The temperature response has been estimated for four latitude bands (90-28°S, 28°S-28°N, 28-60°N, and 60-90°N). The regional pattern in climate response not only depends on the relationship between RF and surface temperature, but also on where and when emissions occurred and atmospheric transport, chemistry, interaction with clouds, and deposition. We present four emissions cases covering Europe, East Asia, the global shipping sector, and the entire globe. Our study is the first to estimate ARTP values for emissions during Northern Hemisphere summer (May-October) and winter season (November-April). The species studied are aerosols and aerosol precursors (black carbon, organic carbon, SO2, NH3/, ozone precursors (NOx, CO, volatile organic compound), and methane (CH4/. For the response to BC in the Arctic, we take into account the vertical structure of the RF in the atmosphere, and an enhanced climate efficacy for BC deposition on snow. Of all SLCFs, BC is the most sensitive to where and when the emissions occur, as well as giving the largest difference in response between the latitude bands. The temperature response in the Arctic per unit BC emission is almost four times larger and more than two times larger than the global average for Northern Hemisphere winter emissions for Europe and East Asia, respectively. The latitudinal breakdown likely gives a better estimate of the global temperature response as it accounts for varying efficacies with latitude. An annual pulse of non-methane SLCF emissions globally (representative of 2008) lead to a global cooling. In contrast, winter emissions in Europe and East Asia give a net warming in the Arctic due to significant warming from BC deposition on snow. © 2017 Author(s).",,"aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; black carbon; climate modeling; emission inventory; marine atmosphere; radiative forcing; regional climate; temperature profile; Europe; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029476865

In this study, streamflow characteristics of ungauged catchments in Rwanda were calculated using a regionalization approach based on climate similarity and stepwise multiple-regression analysis. One climatic homogeneous region was identified and datasets of nine gauged stations and general available catchment characteristics were used to develop non-transformed and log-transformed regression models. New hydrological insights for the region Results of this study show that climate, physiography and land cover strongly influence the hydrology of catchments in Rwanda. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, the log-transformed models were found to predict the flow parameters more suitably. These models can be used for estimating the flow parameters in ungauged catchments in Rwanda and the methodology can be applied in any other region, as long as sufficient and good quality streamflow data is available. © 2017 The Authors","Catchment attributes; Stepwise multiple-regression; Streamflow estimation; Ungauged catchments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029377050

The observed climate data were obtained from the Alabama Mesonet Stations, and the modeled climate was obtained from multiple models, multiple scenarios, and multiple projections available through the World Climate Research Program's database. The hydrologic model, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), was calibrated and validated for the period of 2004 to 2013, based on daily meteorological forcing and monthly streamflow data. Various climate scenarios developed with respect to anticipated future climate until 2100, based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs), were forced into the calibrated SWAT model to quantify future water availability. The simulated average change in monthly streamflow varied from +23 to -46%, +29 to -48%, +40 to -48%, and +38 to -48% for scenarios RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, respectively; the simulated total annual streamflow varied from +18 to -28% for the same scenarios. However, average change in total annual streamflow based on all scenarios showed a decreasing streamflow pattern from -0.3 to -1.2% for future periods, except a slight increase of +0.17% at the end of this century.

However, landscape-scale patterns and drivers of shrub expansion remain poorly understood, inhibiting accurate incorporation of shrub effects into climate models. Here, we use dendroecology to elucidate the role of soil moisture in modifying the relationship between climate and growth for a dominant deciduous shrub, Salix pulchra, on the North Slope of Alaska, USA. We improve upon previous modeling approaches by using ecological theory to guide model selection for the relationship between climate and shrub growth. Finally, we present novel dendroecology-based estimates of shrub biomass change under a future climate regime, made possible by recently developed shrub allometry models. We find that S. pulchra growth has responded positively to mean June temperature over the past 2.5 decades at both a dry upland tundra site and an adjacent mesic riparian site. For the upland site, including a negative second-order term in the climate–growth model significantly improved explanatory power, matching theoretical predictions of diminishing growth returns to increasing temperature. A first-order linear model fit best at the riparian site, indicating consistent growth increases in response to sustained warming, possibly due to lack of temperature-induced moisture limitation in mesic habitats. These contrasting results indicate that S. pulchra in mesic habitats may respond positively to a wider range of temperature increase than S. pulchra in dry habitats. Lastly, we estimate that a 2°C increase in current mean June temperature will yield a 19% increase in aboveground S. pulchra biomass at the upland site and a 36% increase at the riparian site.

Hypothesis/Problem The hypothesis is that most modern hospitals in urban areas in the United States need to augment their current disaster planning to include climate-related impacts. Methods Using Los Angeles County (California USA) as a case study, historical data for emergency department (ED) visits and projections for extreme-heat events were used to determine how much climate change is likely to increase ED visits by mid-century for each hospital. In addition, historical data about the location of wildfires in Los Angeles County and projections for increased frequency of both wildfires and flooding related to sea-level rise were used to identify which area hospitals will have an increased risk of climate-related wildfires or flooding at mid-century. Results Only a small fraction of the total number of predicted ED visits at mid-century would likely to be due to climate change. By contrast, a significant portion of hospitals in Los Angeles County are in close proximity to very high fire hazard severity zones (VHFHSZs) and would be at greater risk to wildfire impacts as a result of climate change by mid-century. One hospital in Los Angeles County was anticipated to be at greater risk due to flooding by mid-century as a result of climate-related sea-level rise. Conclusion This analysis suggests that several Los Angeles County hospitals should focus their climate-change-related planning on building resiliency to wildfires. © 2017 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.","climate change; hospital; wildfire","California; climate change; disaster; emergency ward; flooding; heat; sea level rise; California; demography; disaster planning; health service; hospital emergency service; human; statistics and numerical data; utilization; wildfire; Climate Change; Demography; Disaster Planning; Emergency Service, Hospital; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Los Angeles; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020715308

Based on interviews with actors and experts involved in the development and implementation of the plan, the paper evaluates the role green leadership aspirations play in shaping urban climate change policy and how policy makers and stakeholders use policy to position the city and its greening initiatives locally and globally. In particular, it analyzes the role of competitive positioning and green leadership in sustainability initiatives and change within and beyond urban boundaries. While leadership suggests increased buy-in of residents and those involved in the implementation of the strategy and multiplication effects through learning within the region and between (peer) cities, it can also pose challenges as the interest in meeting leadership claims can impede more radical change through specific targets and implementation strategies and challenge other sustainability objectives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","City boosterism; Climate change leader; Place branding; Sustainable cities; Urban policy","Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Sustainable development; Urban planning; City boosterism; Competitive positioning; Implementation strategies; Multiplication effect; Place branding; Sustainability objectives; Sustainable cities; Urban policy; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027492755

Analysis using energy systems models indicate that carbon capture and storage is a key technology for the UK to achieve its mitigation targets at lowest cost. There is potential to significantly improve upon the representation of the CO2 storage systems used in these models, but sensitivities of a given reservoir system to future development pathways must be evaluated. To investigate this we generate a range of numerical simulations of CO2 injection into the Bunter Sandstone of the UK Southern North Sea, considered to be one of the most important regional aquifers for CO2 storage. The scenarios investigate the sensitivity of CO2 storage to characteristics of regional development including number of injection sites and target rates of CO2 injection. This enables an evaluation of the impact of a range of deployment possibilities reflecting the range of scenarios that may be explored in an energy system analysis. The results show that limitations in achieving target injection rates are encountered at rates greater than 2 MtCO2/year-site due to local pressure buildup. The areal location of injection sites has minimal impact on the results because the Bunter Sandstone model has good regional connectivity. Rather, the depth of the site is the most important factor controlling limits on CO2 injection due to the relationship between the limiting pressure and the lithostatic pressure gradient. The potential for model simplification is explored by comparison of reservoir simulation with analytical models of average reservoir pressure and near-site pressure. The numerical simulations match average pressure buildup estimated with the “closed-box” analytical model of Zhou et al. (2008) over a 50 year injection period. The pressure buildup at individual sites is estimated using the Mathias et al. (2011) formulation and compared to the simulation response. Discrepancies in the match are mostly due to the interaction of signals from multiple injection sites and heterogeneous permeability in the numerical simulations. These issues should be the focus of further development of simplified models for CO2 storage in an energy systems analysis framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bunter sandstone; CO2 storage; Energy systems models; Operational demands","Analytical models; Aquifers; Carbon capture; Hydrogeology; Numerical models; Regional planning; Sandstone; Systems analysis; Average-reservoir pressures; CO2 storage; Energy system analysis; Energy systems analysis; Energy-systems models; Operational demands; Regional development; Reservoir simulation; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; demand analysis; fluid injection; future prospect; pressure field; sandstone; waste disposal; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031298231

However, agriculture remains underdeveloped and poverty persists, especially in rural areas. Therefore, this study examined the implications of land use and land cover changes on rural household food insecurity in the Teleyayen sub-watershed, which covers an area of 152 km2. Methods: Landsat satellite images of 1973, 1986 and 2015 were used to analyze the spatial and temporal changes. LU-LC changes of the study area were detected from a time series of such satellite images using Remote Sensing (ERDAS Imagine 9.2) and GIS (ArcMap 10.3) software. Additional data were collected through Global Positioning System, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. Results and discussion: The results of the study showed that forest lands declined from 3.8% in 1973 to 0.2% in 2015. The total forest lands cleared between 1973 and 2015 amounts to 552 ha. This is 95% of the forest cover that existed in 1973. Similarly, shrub lands declined from 28.4% in 1973 to 24.9% in 2015. Meanwhile, crop lands and rural settlements increased from 38.6% in 1973 to 44.1% in 1986 and 54.4% in 2015. The greatest expansion of crop lands and rural settlements occurred between 1986 and 2015 (81%). This kind of conversion could be at the expense of grass lands, shrub lands, marginal lands and forest lands. The major driving forces were found to be population growth, shortage of farm lands and shortage of rainfall, which in turn exacerbated the food security problems. Land degradation, rural-urban migration, farm land fragmentation, climate change, crop yield reduction and soil erosion are also identified as major implications of land use and land cover changes. Conclusions: The observed land use and land cover changes are caused by population pressure as well as expansion of agricultural lands through unplanned and inappropriate land management practices in order to meet the food demands of the rapidly growing population. Therefore, it is worthwhile to link food security policies with sustainable land management policies because both are closely interrelated with each other. It is also advisable to decentralize responsibilities and financial resources to local farmers and local administrative bodies so as to improve their food security status. This decentralization could help lead to adequate access to information on agricultural inputs, land management and food security services. © 2017 The Author(s).","Ethiopia; Food insecurity; Land cover; Land management; Land use",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032580167

CO2 transfer from gas or liquid phase to the bulk of water is expected to happen not only by molecular diffusion but also driven by natural convective currents induced by CO2 dissolution in water. Using particle tracer methods, we experimentally characterize the flow velocity of the bulk of water during CO2H formation. For that purpose, CO2H is grown inside an optical cell with a volume of 12 mL at various pressures and temperatures. Due to CO2 dissolution, convection currents are noticed prior to hydrate formation. Our experimental results point to a significant correlation between this process and the subsequent hydrate formation. Two well-differentiated hydrate growth patterns were observed depending on the hydrate induction time and the corresponding CO2 concentration distribution inside water. For long induction times, CO2 can be provided from the water phase resulting in rapid growth. Short induction times resulted in slow growth at the interface creating a solid barrier accompanied by a significant drop in the flow velocity. In some cases, the hydrate layer appeared to be unstable and convection could restart. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Diffusion in liquids; Dissolution; Flow velocity; Gas hydrates; Hydration; Visualization; Carbon dioxide hydrates; Engineering applications; Global climate changes; Induced dissociation; Molecular diffusion; Scientific community; Short induction time; Transport phenomena; Phase interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034230867

This is because rainfall limits the production of biomass in the region, a resource on which people are directly dependent for their livelihoods. In this study, we utilized a remote-sensing approach to answering the following two questions: (1) how does the dynamic relationship between soil moisture and plant growth vary across hydrological regimes, and (2) are vegetation-type-dependent responses to soil moisture availability detectable from satellite imagery? In order to answer these questions, we studied the relationship between monthly modelled soil moisture as an indicator for water availability and the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation growth between a “recovery rainfall period” (1982 to 1997) and a “stable rainfall period” (1998 to 2013), at different time lags across the Sahel region. Using windowed cross-correlation, we find a strong significant positive relationship between NDVI and soil moisture at a concurrent time and at NDVI lagging behind soil moisture by 1 month for grassland, cropland, and deciduous shrubland vegetation – the dominant vegetation classes in the Sahel. South of the Sahel (the Sudanian and Guinean areas), we find longer optimal lags (soil moisture lagged by 1– 3 months) in association with mixed forest and deciduous shrubland. We find no major significant change in optimal lag between the recovery and stable periods in the Sahelian region; however, in the Sudanian and Guinean areas, we observe a trend towards shorter time lags. This change in optimal lag suggests a vegetation change, which may be a response to a climatic shift or land-use change. This approach of identifying spatiotemporal trends in optimal lag correlations between modelled soil moisture and NDVI could prove to be a useful tool for mapping vegetation change and ecosystem behaviour, in turn helping inform climate change mitigation approaches and agricultural planning. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Climate change; Ecology; Forestry; Land use; Rain; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Agricultural planning; Climate change mitigation; Hydrological regime; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing approaches; Soil moisture availability; Spatiotemporal trends; Vegetation dynamics; Soil moisture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039159259

The problem involves multiple fields, i.e., RE, battery technology, SC technology, and control theory, and requires an efficient and precise co-ordination between sub-fields to harness the full benefits, making the problem labyrinthine. The optimization problem is formulated, and it involves a variety of realistic constraints from both hybrid generation and storage, and an objective function is proposed to: 1) minimize the cost; 2) improve the reliability; and 3) curtail greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The complex optimization problem is solved innovatively in piecewise fashion to decrease the complexity and computational time. First, sizes of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) are determined using an innovative search algorithm, and in the second step, the size of HESS is calculated, finally the optimal solution is determined. A comparison based upon cost, reliability, and GHG emissions is presented which plainly shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The technique is also applied to determine the size of an MG employing PV, WT, and BES operating in grid-connected mode. And a brief cost analysis, reliability assessment, and emission reduction are given for three scenarios: 1) MG with HESS; 2) MG with BES; and 3) MG with conventional generation. It is shown that an MG with HESS is not only economical but also more reliable and has lower GHG emissions. © 2017 IEEE.","Hybrid energy storage; Microgrid; Optimization; Renewable power","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric batteries; Emission control; Energy storage; Optimization; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Supercapacitor; Wind turbines; Battery energy storages (BES); Complex optimization problems; Conventional generation; Hybrid energy storage; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Micro grid; Reliability assessments; Renewable Power; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032722835

This study has explored the spatio-temporal trends of dengue and potential socio- demographic and ecological determinants in Australia. Data on dengue cases, socio-demographic, climatic and land use types for the period January 1999 to December 2010 were collected from Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, respectively. Descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed to observe the spa-tio-temporal trends of dengue, socio-demographic and ecological factors in Australia. A total of 5,853 dengue cases (both local and overseas acquired) were recorded across Australia between January 1999 and December 2010. Most the cases (53.0%) were reported from Queensland, followed by New South Wales (16.5%). Dengue outbreak was highest (54.2%) during 2008–2010. A highest percentage of overseas arrivals (29.9%), households having rainwater tanks (33.9%), Indigenous population (27.2%), separate houses (26.5%), terrace house types (26.9%) and economically advantage people (42.8%) were also observed during 2008–2010. Regression analyses demonstrate that there was an increasing trend of dengue incidence, potential socio-ecological factors such as overseas arrivals, number of households having rainwater tanks, housing types and land use types (e.g. intensive uses and production from dryland agriculture). Spatial variation of socio-demographic factors was also observed in this study. In near future, significant increase of temperature was also projected across Australia. The projected increased temperature as well as increased socio-ecological trend may pose a future threat to the local transmission of dengue in other parts of Australia if Aedes mosquitoes are being established. Therefore, upgraded mosquito and disease surveillance at different ports should be in place to reduce the chance of mosquitoes and dengue cases being imported into all over Australia. © 2017 Akter et al.

In the present work, a novel, self-sustained, efficient process scheme has been proposed for the production of high purity hydrogen by integrating sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) with chemical looping combustion (CLC) and by incorporating heat recovery steam generation (HRSG) as well as power generation sections. The integration between SESMR and CLC is proposed with the objectives of increasing H2 productivity, reducing CO2 emission while effectively conserving the process heat, which is achieved by coupling fuel reactor flue gases with reformer and air reactor outlet gases with regenerator. Thermodynamic investigation of the proposed process is carried out based on a steady state plant wide model developed using ASPEN Plus. Further, sensitivity analysis is carried out to analyse the process performance and to evaluate the optimum operating parameters.

Going solo poses a great environmental challenge, as the possibility to benefit from scale economies in consumption and its greenhouse gas impacts is not taken advantage of. In other words, understanding of intra-household sharing patterns of different consumption categories is increasingly important in climate change mitigation. This paper explores the relationship between household sizes, urban structures, and greenhouse gas impacts of lifestyles. When urban areas grow outwards, the household sizes also grow. As a result of this, the increase in intra-household sharing seems to alleviate the negative GHG implications of urban sprawl, which is highly logical but yet not comprehended. Thus, the rise of collaborative consumption offers potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of solo dwellers, and compensate for the lower intra-household sharing with inter-household sharing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Cities; Household size; Input–output analysis; Lifestyles; Sharing","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Economics; Gas emissions; Urban growth; Cities; Household size; Input output analysis; Lifestyles; Sharing; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049185346

Forest conversion may be an adequate measure to counter possible negative effects of climate change. Unfortunately, climate-driven changes in abiotic and biotic risks bear a significant source of intrinsic uncertainty inherent in climate projections. It is our goal to appraise uncertainty in species selection under drought stress, one of themost important risk factors formany forests.We derive a method to assess drought restrictions and demonstrate the uncertainty in the process of species selection by applying three climate scenarios. Furthermore, we interpret the consequences of climate uncertainty in the light of different management goals, i.e., a business-as-usual silviculture, a climate protection strategy favoring CO2 sequestration and a biodiversity strategy increasing diversity. The methods are applied to two representative regions in the North German Plain. The results clearly show the strong need for adaptive planning when drought restrictions are considered. However, different silvicultural management objectives may alter the extent of adaptive planning. The uncertainty in the planning process arising from different underlying climate projections strongly depends on the regional site characteristics and on forest management strategy. In conclusion, it is most important in forest planning to clearly state the management goals and to carefully explore if the goals can be met under climate change and if the uncertainty due to climate projections significantly affects the results of species selection. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Drought risk; Forest conversion; Forest management; Species selection; Uncertainty","Biodiversity; Drought; Forestry; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Climate protection strategies; Drought risks; Forest conversion; Management strategies; Silvicultural management; Species selection; Tree species selections; Uncertainty; Climate change; adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; drought; forest management; planning method; risk assessment; silviculture; tree; uncertainty analysis; Drought; Forestry; Risk Assessment; Rotation; Silviculture; Species Identification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030112384

Type II bursts are known to be due to propagating shocks that are often associated with fast halo-type coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We analysed the radio spectral data and the white-light coronagraph data from 16 selected events to obtain directions and heights for the propagating CMEs and the type II bursts. CMEs preceding the selected events were included in the analysis to verify whether CME interaction was possible. As a result, we were able to classify the events into five different groups. 1) Events where the heights of the CMEs and type II bursts are consistent, indicating that the shock is located at the leading front of the CME. The radio enhancements are superposed on the type II lanes, and they are probably formed when the shock meets remnant material from earlier CMEs, but the shock continues to propagate at the same speed. 2) Events where the type II heights agree with the CME leading front and an earlier CME is located at a height that suggests interaction. The radio enhancements and frequency jumps could be due to the merging process of the CMEs. 3) Events where the type II heights are significantly lower than the CME heights almost from the start. Interaction with close-by streamers is probably the cause for the enhanced radio emission, which is located at the CME flank region. 4) Events where the radio enhancements are located within wide-band type II bursts and the causes for the radio enhancements are not clear. 5) Events where the radio enhancements are associated with later-accelerated particles (electron beams, observed as type III bursts) that stop at the type II burst emission lane, and no other obvious reason for the enhancement can be identified. Most of the events (38%) were due to shock–streamer interaction, while one quarter of the events was due to possible CME–CME interaction. The drift rates, bandwidth characteristics, or cross-correlations of various characteristics did not reveal any clear association with particular category types. The chosen atmospheric density model causes the largest uncertainties in the derived radio heights, although in some cases, the emission bandwidths also lead to relatively large error margins. Our conclusion is that the enhanced radio emission associated with CMEs and propagating shocks can have different origins, depending on their overall configuration and the associated processes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Coronal mass ejections; Initiation and propagation; Meter-wavelengths and longer (m, dkm, hm, km); Radio bursts; Type II",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028716701

As is normally the case, the HHG emission is suppressed for increased ellipticity since the recollision wave packet leading to HHG is steered away from the parent ion for large ellipticity. However, through comparison with computations of the first step in HHG, namely, strong-field ionization (SFI), we show that the observed differences in the ellipticity dependence for the three molecular species reflect the lateral momentum distributions of the continuum electron responsible for HHG, which in turn provides information about the particular orientation between the molecular axis and the laser field that maximizes the SFI probability. Strikingly, and contrary to the conventional wisdom in the strong-field community, we find that for furan and thiophene the most probable orientation for SFI occurs when the electric field of the laser is aligned near a nodal plane of the corresponding ionizing orbital. 2,3-dihydrofuran, on the other hand, follows the standard expectation that the most probable orientation for SFI occurs when the electric field is aligned away from any nodal plane. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Aromatic compounds; Electric fields; Ionization; Ionization of gases; Molecular orientation; Molecules; Organic pollutants; Probability distributions; Thiophene; Continuum electrons; Five-membered rings; High harmonic generation; High order harmonic generation; Molecular species; Probable orientations; Recollision wave packets; Strong field ionization; Harmonic generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031099155

Large air quality field studies (the Texas Air Quality Studies or TexAQS I and II) were conducted to determine root causes of the high ozone concentrations. Hundreds of air quality investigators, from around the world, deployed instruments on aircraft, on ships, and at fixed ground sites to make extensive air quality measurements; detailed photochemical modeling was used to interpret and assess the implications of the measurements. The Texas Air Quality Studies revealed that both continuous and episodic emissions of light alkenes, which came to be called highly reactive volatile organic compounds, played a critical role in the formation of ozone and other photochemical oxidants in the region. Understanding and quantifying the role of these emissions in regional air quality required innovations in characterizing emissions and in photochemical modeling. Reducing emissions required innovative policy approaches. These coupled scientific and policy innovations are described, and the result, substantially cleaner air for Houston, is documented. The lessons learned from the Houston air quality experience are relevant to cities with similar population and industrial profiles around the world.

Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) can collide with wind turbines, adding to the existing and substantial mortality from other anthropogenic sources. These collisions are a conservation concern, and they pose a legal risk to wind energy companies and potentially hamper development in areas where the range of Golden Eagle overlaps areas of high wind energy potential. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through the revised Eagle Rule and the Eagle Conservation Plan Guidance, has designed a mitigation strategy for eagle conservation that allows wind energy companies to obtain incidental take permits. However, the strategy is challenged by a lack of data supporting scientifically rigorous strategies to mitigate eagle take, where mitigation is defined as efforts to avoid and minimize take, and compensate for unavoidable take. We review the steps and options a wind developer can consider to mitigate predicted eagle collisions with wind turbines consistent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's revised Eagle Rule and Eagle Conservation Plan Guidance. Most of these options have limited or no scientific support and their effect on reducing risk of eagle collisions is unknown. We briefly describe approaches for evaluating technology intended to minimize eagle take and for developing options to offset unavoidable eagle take that are quantifiable and verifiable. Because estimates of Golden Eagle fatalities at many wind energy projects are low, research to evaluate mitigation measures needs to be coordinated and collaborative across multiple wind energy facilities to improve our ability to produce scientifically robust mitigation strategies. The impetus for these efforts is improving implementation and compliance with the revised Eagle Rule, but the results have benefits beyond Golden Eagles, for raptors and their ecological communities. © 2017 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.","wind energy","anthropogenic source; collision; conservation planning; mortality; raptor; species conservation; wind power; wind turbine; Aquila; Aquila chrysaetos; Raptores",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028951016

Health studies have relied on proximity to O&G wells as an exposure metric, typically using an inverse distance-weighting (IDW) approach. Because O&G emissions are dependent on multiple factors, a dynamic model is needed to describe the variability in air pollution emissions over space and time. We used information on Colorado O&G activities, production volumes, and air pollutant emission rates from two Colorado basins to create a spatiotemporal industrial activity model to develop an intensity-adjusted IDW well-count metric. The Spearman correlation coefficient between this metric and measured pollutant concentrations was 0.74. We applied our model to households in Greeley, Colorado, which is in the middle of the densely developed Denver-Julesburg basin. Our intensity-adjusted IDW increased the unadjusted IDW dynamic range by a factor of 19 and distinguishes high-intensity events, such as hydraulic fracturing and flowback, from lower-intensity events, such as production at single-well pads. As the frequency of multiwell pads increases, it will become increasingly important to characterize the range of intensities at O&G sites when conducting epidemiological studies. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Hydraulic fracturing; Industrial emissions; Oil wells; Pollution; Air pollutant emission; Epidemiological studies; Hazardous air pollutants; Industrial activities; Inverse distance weighting; Oil and gas operations; Pollutant concentration; Spearman correlation coefficients; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; epidemiology; gas production; hydraulic fracturing; industrial emission; oil production; operations technology; pollutant removal; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; Colorado; correlation coefficient; fracking; household; air pollution; Colorado; environmental monitoring; oil and gas field; United States; Colorado; Colorado; Denver; Greeley; United States; well water; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Colorado; Environmental Monitoring; Oil and Gas Fields; United States; Water Wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028939579

Many of the current energy related policies have their focus on new buildings but, due to the low rates of replacement of the existing building stock, it is crucial that the low energy performances of these buildings are improved. Most of these buildings, due to design and construction constraints, may not be able to reach the new energy efficiency standards, which many times involve complex construction works. Nevertheless, the achievement of significant reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions may not always require a highly efficient solution for the envelope. Other solutions, combining energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy, are also possible. In this context, the key research problem addressed in Annex 56 was to understand how far it is possible to go with energy conservation and efficiency measures and from which point the measures to foster renewable energy use become more economical taking into account the local context and the many restrictions the existing buildings face. Thus, a new methodology was developed to be used in the decision making process for energy related building renovation, allowing to find a cost-effective balance between energy consumption, carbon emissions and overall added value achieved in the renovation process. The methodology developed within IEA EBC Annex 56 project aims at defining, assessing and comparing energy renovation activities in a cost-effective way, optimizing the energy use and the carbon emissions reduction, mainly in residential buildings but also in non-residential buildings without complex HVAC technologies. The methodology explores the full range of cost-effective reduction of carbon emissions and energy use and takes into account also the additional benefits and the overall added value achieved by the building within the renovation process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building renovation; Co-benefits; Emissions; Energy; Energy efficiency; Life-cycle cost analysis; Life-cycle impact assessment; Renewable energy sources","Buildings; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Decision making; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Historic preservation; Housing; Life cycle; Natural resources; Particulate emissions; Renewable energy resources; Building renovation; Co benefits; Energy; Life cycle cost analysis; Life cycle impact assessment; Renewable energy source; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027586021

Emphasis is given on the use of nanoparticles (NP) as sorbents of CO2 and CH4, which are the two most important global warming gases. The existing NP sorption processes must overcome certain challenges before their implementation to the industrial scale. These are: i) the utilization of the concentrated gas stream generated by the capture and gas purification technologies, ii) the reduction of the effects of impurities on the operating system, iii) the scale up of the relevant materials, and iv) the retrofitting of technologies in existing facilities. Thus, an innovative design of adsorbents could possibly address those issues. Biogas purification and CH4 storage would become a new motivation for the development of new sorbent materials, such as nanomaterials. This review discusses the current state of the art on the use of novel nanomaterials as adsorbents for CO2 and CH4. The review shows that materials based on porous supports that are modified with amine or metals are currently providing the most promising results. The Fe3O4-graphene and the MOF-117 based NPs show the greatest CO2 sorption capacities, due to their high thermal stability and high porosity. Conclusively, one of the main challenges would be to decrease the cost of capture and to scale-up the technologies to minimize large-scale power plant CO2 emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Metal organic framework; Methane; Nanomaterials; Zeolite","Adsorption; Air purification; Gas adsorption; Gas emissions; Global warming; Impurities; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Methane; Nanostructured materials; Organometallics; Zeolites; Biogas purifications; Effects of impurities; High thermal stability; Industrial scale; Innovative design; Large-scale power plants; Sorbent materials; Sorption process; Carbon dioxide; absorbent; adsorbent; alkali; carbon dioxide; carbon nanotube; graphene; ionic liquid; magnetite; mesoporous silica nanoparticle; metal organic framework; methane; zeolite; adsorption; biogas; carbon dioxide; global warming; methane; nanoparticle; purification; zeolite; adsorption kinetics; greenhouse gas; nanoanalysis; porosity; Review; thermostability; waste component removal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016624000

This study applies an iterative process of field assessments and literature reviews across multiple governance levels and spatial scales to identify constraints to effective formulation and implementation of climate change related policies and strategies in Uganda. Data was collected through sex-segregated participatory vulnerability assessments with farming communities in Rakai district, policy document reviews, and interviews with policy actors at national and district levels. Findings reveal that the key challenges to effective policy implementation are diverse and cut across the policy development and implementation cycle. Policies are mainly developed by central government agencies; other actors are insufficiently involved while local communities are excluded. There is also a communication disconnect between national, district, and community levels. Coupled with limited technical capacity and finances, political interference, and absence of functional implementation structures across these levels, climate change adaptation becomes constrained. We propose strategies that enhance linkages between levels and actors, which will improve policy formulation, implementation and ultimately adaptation by smallholders. © 2017 International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA)","Climate change adaptation; Implementation constraints; Local institutions; Policy formulation; Policy implementation; Smallholder vulnerabilities; Uganda","adaptation; agricultural worker; Article; climate change; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; community care; environmental change; environmental policy; female; government; human; interpersonal communication; interview; male; practice guideline; priority journal; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020385656

A three dimensional heterogeneous reservoir model was developed for evaluating the CO2-EOR performance of in the Farnsworth Field Unit (FWU), Ochiltree County, Texas. The model aided in improved characterization of prominent rock properties within the Pennsylvanian-aged Morrow sandstone reservoir. Seismic attributes illuminated previously unknown faults and structural elements within the field. A laboratory fluid analysis was tuned to an equation of state and subsequently used to predict the thermodynamic minimum miscible pressure. Datasets including net-to-gross ratio, volume of shale, permeability, and burial history were used to model initial fault transmissibility based on Sperrevik model. An improved history match of primary and secondary recovery was performed to set the basis for a CO2 flood study. The performance of the current CO2 miscible flood patterns were subsequently calibrated to historical production and injection data. Several prediction models were constructed to study the effect of recycling, addition of wells and/or new patterns, water alternating gas cycles and optimum amount of CO2 purchase on incremental oil production and CO2 storage in the FWU. The history matching study successfully validated the presence of the previously-undetected faults within FWU that were seen in the seismic survey. The analysis of the various prediction scenarios showed that recycling a high percentage of produced gas, addition of new wells and a gradual reduction in CO2 purchase after several years of operation would be the best approach to ensure a high percentage of recoverable incremental oil and sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 within the Morrow reservoir. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","CO2 storage; History matching; Net present value; Numerical simulation; Oil recovery; Reduce order model","Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Digital storage; Equations of state; Floods; Forecasting; Offshore oil well production; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoirs; Predictive analytics; Secondary recovery; Seismic prospecting; Seismology; Water recycling; CO2 storage; Heterogeneous reservoirs; History matching; Net present value; Oil recoveries; Performance assessment; Performance assessment methodology; Water alternating gas; Enhanced recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027039546

In this paper, we describe the eco-epidemiological parameters of CL during the armed conflict period from January 2011 till December 2012. Current spatiotemporal distributions of CL cases were explored and projected to the future using a correlative modelling approach. In addition the present results were compared with our previous data obtained for the time period 1995–2008. Methodology/Principal findings: We investigated 312 CL patients who presented to the Dermatology Department at the Tripoli Central Hospital and came from 81 endemic areas distributed in 10 districts. The patients presented with typical localized lesions which appeared commonly on the face, arms and legs. Molecular identification of parasites by a PCR-RFLP approach targeting the ITS1 region of the rDNA was successful for 81 patients with two causative species identified: L. major and L. tropica comprised 59 (72.8%) and 22 (27.2%) cases, respectively. Around 77.3% of L. tropica CL and 57.7% of L. major CL caused single lesions. Five CL patients among our data set were seropositive for HIV. L. tropica was found mainly in three districts, Murqub (27.3%), Jabal al Gharbi (27.3%) and Misrata (13.7%) while L. major was found in two districts, in Jabal al Gharbi (61%) and Jafara (20.3%). Seasonal occurrence of CL cases showed that most cases (74.2%) admitted to the hospital between November and March, L. major cases from November till January (69.4%), and L. tropica cases mainly in January and February (41%). Two risk factors were identified for the two species; the presence of previously infected household members, and the presence of rodents and sandflies in patient’s neighborhoods. Spatiotemporal projections using correlative distribution models based on current case data and climatic conditions showed that coastal regions have a higher level of risk due to more favourable conditions for the transmitting vectors. Conclusion: Future projection of CL until 2060 showed a trend of increasing incidence of CL in the north-western part of Libya, a spread along the coastal region and a possible emergence of new endemics in the north-eastern districts of Libya. These results should be considered for control programs to prevent the emergence of new endemic areas taking also into consideration changes in socio-economical factors such as migration, conflicts, urbanization, land use and access to health care. © 2017 Amro et al.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; controlled study; disease surveillance; DNA extraction; face; female; household; human; infant; infection control; Leishmania major; Leishmania tropica; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; lower limb; lymphangitis; major clinical study; male; microscopy; molecular epidemiology; polymerase chain reaction; restriction fragment length polymorphism; skin leishmaniasis; spatiotemporal analysis; species distribution; upper limb; animal; genetics; isolation and purification; Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous; middle aged; parasitology; preschool child; Psychodidae; rodent; spatiotemporal analysis; transmission; very elderly; young adult; protozoal DNA; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA, Protozoan; Female; Humans; Infant; Leishmania major; Leishmania tropica; Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous; Libya; Male; Middle Aged; Psychodidae; Rodentia; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030644546

A large marine transport company spends more than 2.6 billion U.S. dollars on fuel every year. In order to reduce fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions from ships, it is crucial to be able to accurately calculate the impact of winds and waves on ship speed and fuel efficiency. Normally, existing ship performance estimation technologies rely on experiments with model ships in tanks of water, or on physics model simulations. However, they do not take into account the complicated interactions of winds, waves, and sea currents that influence the state of ships at real sea waters, resulting in large margins of error. Against this background, Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a technology to visualize ship performance. In addition to weather and sea conditions including winds, waves, and sea currents during actual ship operation, it collects engine log data and ship operation data such as location and ship speed, and posts it to the cloud, and then analyzes these data using high-dimensional statistical analysis that we developed. Applying this technology to a university-owned test ship and some merchant ships resulted in highly accurate estimation of ship speed and fuel consumption for each of the ships, with error of 5% or less. We also evaluated this technology through simulation and verified that it can improve fuel efficiency significantly. This paper describes this technology to predict ship performance in real sea waters, which is key to reducing ship fuel consumption, with some examples of system configurations. © 2017 Fujitsu Limited.",,"Big data; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Fuels; Seawater; Ship models; Ships; Water tanks; Wind; Artificial intelligence technologies; High-dimensional; Highly accurate; Marine transport; Maritime industry; Physics modeling; Ship performance; System configurations; Vehicle performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037058188

However, especially when buildings operate under the Mediterranean climates, where outdoor conditions have to be mitigated by the building fabric throughout the year, the contribution of an insulation solution to indoor thermal comfort is also an important issue. In this approach, an integrated decision support system was applied to assess thermal insulation practices used commonly in residential buildings in the Mediterranean area. The system assesses the buildings’ elements over their life cycle, with thermal comfort being evaluated by means of the PMV/PPD index. Twenty-three thermal insulation configurations were considered, with different locations (internal, middle, external), materials (expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, stone wool), and thicknesses. As the results showed, the position and the thickness of the insulation materials have a large impact on the energy consumption, the overall environmental impact, and the life cycle cost of the building, while thermal comfort was affected to a lesser degree. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Embodied energy; Environmental performance; Life cycle assessment; Mediterranean region; Thermal comfort; Thermal insulation","Artificial intelligence; Buildings; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Insulation; Life cycle; Polystyrenes; Thermal comfort; Embodied energy; Environmental performance; Expanded polystyrene; Extruded polystyrenes; Indoor thermal comfort; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mediterranean climates; Mediterranean region; Thermal insulation; building; insulation; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; Mediterranean environment; urban area; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008490021

This can be achieved by a transformative shift and massive adoptions of low-carbon technologies (LCTs). The region already possesses much of the technologies to achieve the carbon emission reductions at a level required. But for all economies to enjoy the economic and environmental benefits of LCTs, the implementation plan of INDCs must be coordinated in global, national, and local context. The cost of INDCs through globalization of LCTs can be modest, if policy adjustments are made immediately.

In some climate-change mitigation policies, industries and individuals can purchase offsets that compensate for their greenhouse-gas emissions by reducing emissions elsewhere. However, offsets may undermine mitigation efforts, by potentially giving carbon credits for emissions reductions that would have occurred even without the offset program in place. We evaluate California's forest offset program – the first-ever legally enforceable “compliance” offset program for existing forests – to determine whether offsets (1) provide additional emissions reductions that would not have occurred without the program (called “additionality”) and (2) yield other benefits. We found that California's forest offset program, comprising a small portion of the state's mitigation portfolio, does not inhibit overall emissions reductions. Further, the program advances stringent “additionality” of emissions reductions through multiple mechanisms. Finally, mitigation through forest offsets can yield a suite of important co-benefits. Lessons from California's experience with forest offsets can help to inform other offset programs that are increasingly being developed around the world. © The Ecological Society of America",,"carbon emission; climate change; compliance; conservation; emission control; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028723673

There is considerable interest in the potential of microrefugia to provide climate change resilience to landscapes and to biodiversity conservation. Although attractive conceptually, there is yet little guidance on how to identify climate change microrefugia in order to study and protect them, and the data required to do so are often lacking. This study demonstrates how time series remote sensing, using all available Landsat images of a study area, can be used to directly detect microrefugia maintained by water subsidies in a semi-arid landscape in southwest Western Australia. Microrefugia were identified as pixels with abundant vegetation and consistent vegetation dynamics between wet and dry years. At every pixel, a harmonic model was fit to the intra-annual time series of vegetation index values compiled from the wettest years in the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) archive. This model was then used to predict the phenological cycle of the driest years at that pixel. Candidate microrefugia were defined to be those pixels with (1) high vegetation activity in dry years and (2) highly predictable phenologies that are consistent regardless of the weather conditions experienced in a given year. Spatial relationships between candidate microrefugia and landscape features associated with elevated moisture availability (thought to drive climate microrefugia in these semi-arid landscapes) were assessed. The candidate microrefugia show great promise. Evaluations against high-resolution imagery reveal that candidate microrefugia most likely buffer against drought, although refugia from other disturbances, especially fire, were also detected. In contrast, spatial proxies of the physical features expected to maintain microrefugia failed to adequately represent the distribution of microrefugia across the landscape, likely due to data quality and the heterogeneity of microrefugia.

Here, we present the results obtained from a systematic review of 369 articles (published from 1990 to 2014) about deforestation rates for 17 countries and forest types (tropical lowland, tropical montane, tropical and subtropical dry, subtropical temperate and mixed, and Atlantic forests). Drivers identified as direct or indirect causes of deforestation in the literature were also analysed. With an overall annual deforestation rate of −1.14 (±0.092 SE) in the region, we compared the rates per forest type and country. The results indicate that there is a high variability of forest loss rates among countries and forest types. In general, Chile and Argentina presented the highest deforestation rates (−3.28 and −2.31 yearly average, respectively), followed by Ecuador and Paraguay (−2.19 and −1.89 yearly average, respectively). Atlantic forests (−1.62) and tropical montane forests (−1.55) presented the highest deforestation rates for the region. In particular, tropical lowland forests in Ecuador (−2.42) and tropical dry forests in Mexico (−2.88) and Argentina (−2.20) were the most affected. In most countries, the access to markets and agricultural and forest activities are the main causes of deforestation; however, the causes vary according to the forest types. Deforestation measurements focused at different scales and on different forest types will help governments to improve their reports for international initiatives, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) but, more importantly, for developing local policies for the sustainable management of forests and for reducing the deforestation in Latin America. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Causes; Deforestation rates; Factors; Forest loss; Tropical deforestation","deforestation; emission control; forest dynamics; literature review; montane forest; sustainable forestry; tropical forest; Argentina; Chile; Latin America; Mexico [North America]; Paraguay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031311938

The major factors influencing the rate of soil respiration are climatic and edaphic, however, the effects of these factors on soil respiration of different plantation under similar climatic conditions has not been studied extensively in the dry tropical region. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine the dependency of rate of soil respiration on soil parameters and climatic factors in different tree plantations. Carbon-dioxide (CO2) efflux of soil (soil respiration: Mg CO2-C ha-1 day-1) was measured at monthly intervals in tree plantations of Acacia nilotica + Dalbergia sissoo, Syzygium cumini, Tectona grandis, Populus deltoides and Eucalyptus tereticornis. The soil respiration was highest in rainy season in all plantations. Among different plantations, the higher respiration rate was observed in P. deltoides (13.02 Mg C ha-1) plantation followed by T. grandis. The least values of soil respiration were observed in A. nilotica + D. sissoo (9.99 Mg CO2-C ha-1). The CO2 efflux from the soil surface was found to be positively correlated with soil moisture, soil temperature, rainfall and atmospheric temperature. The soil respiration rate was significantly correlated with soil moisture in all the plantations. However, significant correlation between soil respiration rate and soil temperature were observed only in A. nilotica + D. sissoo and E. tereticornis. The correlations were also significant between soil respiration rate and rainfall for S. cumini, T. grandis, P. deltoides and E. tereticornis plantations. Significant correlation between soil respiration rate and mean monthly atmospheric temperature was observed for the plantations of A. nilotica + D. sissoo and P. deltoides. The soil respiration in all plantations was found to be greatly influenced by soil moisture. The microclimatic factors such as soil moisture and soil temperature influence the activity of microbes positively which leads to increased rate of soil organic matter decomposition and results in more CO2 efflux from the soil. Anthropogenic disturbances such as forest fire and LULC change may alter the soil moisture and temperature conditions and thereby soil respiration rate. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Carbon emissions; Climate change; Climatic variables; Soil parameters; Soil respiration; Tree plantations","air temperature; carbon cycle; climate conditions; deciduous tree; decomposition; microbial activity; parameterization; plantation; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil respiration; terrestrial ecosystem; Haryana; India; Kurukshetra; Acacia nilotica; Dalbergia sissoo; Eucalyptus tereticornis; Populus deltoides; Syzygium cumini; Tectona grandis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040519862

The mechanisms influencing fruit set are complex, but reduced fruit set may be associated with inadequate nutrient availability during critical stages of flowering, ovule fertilization, and initial fruit development. Calcium (Ca) and boron (B) are of particular interest for reproductive developmental processes and are frequently applied annually by growers in the Pacific Northwest region because of the perception that these nutrients enhance fruit set and corresponding yields. Evaluation of commonly applied products containing these nutrients and their effects on fruit set and yield are of specific importance to justify the application of these nutrients. To address this, commercially available fertilizers containing Ca and B were applied to ‘Draper’ and ‘Bluecrop’ blueberry as foliar sprays, either alone or in combination, during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons in northwestern Washington. Treatments included calcium chloride (750 and 1500 ppm Ca), calcium sulfate (150 ppm Ca), and tetra borate (125 and 250 ppm B) foliar sprays, repeated six times per season every 7–10 days from early pink bud through petal fall. No significant increases were observed for fruit set, estimated yield, and fruit quality (firmness and berry weight) across the treatments. Increased concentrations of B were observed in leaf tissues in 2015 and 2016, and to a lesser extent fruit tissues. Calcium remained unchanged regardless of treatment and tissue type. Under the conditions of this study, foliar applications of Ca and B did not lead to increased fruit set or yield. This research suggests that other approaches should be explored to increase fruit set and corresponding yields of highbush blueberry grown in northwest Washington. © 2017, American Society for Horticultural Science.

Model-based control strategies are promising to meet the dual objective of maximizing NOx reduction and minimizing NH3 slip in urea-selective catalytic reduction. In this paper, a control oriented model of a Cu-zeolite urea-SCR system for automotive diesel engines is presented. The model is derived from a quasi-dimensional four-state model of the urea-SCR plant. To make it suitable for the real-time urea-SCR management, a reduced order one-state model has been developed, with the aim of capturing the essential behavior of the system with a low computational burden. Particularly, the model allows estimating the NH3 slip that is fundamental not only to minimize urea consumption but also to reduce this unregulated emission. Parameters identification and model validation have been performed vs. simulation data achieved by a commercial code of the SCR system, based on the four-state quasi-dimensional modeling approach. The accuracy of the reduced-order model is demonstrated by comparing NO, NO2 and NH3 concentrations with those simulated by the more complex reference model. It is observed that the one state model allows estimating the SCR behavior with good accuracy and low computational demand thus being suitable for real-time application.

Houses with south, south-east and south-west facing roofs are considered eligible for the retrofit since solar irradiation is maximum on south facing surfaces in the northern hemisphere. The PV system is used to produce electricity and supply the electrical demand of the house, with the excess electricity sold to the grid in a net-metering arrangement. The BIPV/T system produces electricity as well as thermal energy to supply the electrical as well as the thermal demands for space and domestic hot water heating. The PV system consists of PV panels installed on the available roof surface while the BIPV/T system adds a heat pump, thermal storage tank, auxiliary heater, domestic hot water heating equipment and hydronic heat delivery system, and replaces the existing heating system in eligible houses. The study predicts the energy savings, GHG emission reductions and tolerable capital costs for regions across Canada. Results indicate that the PV system retrofit yields 3% energy savings and 5% GHG emission reduction, while the BIPV/T system yields 18% energy savings and 17% GHG emission reduction in the Canadian housing stock.

A 2015 World Health Organisation (WHO) report estimated that 3.5 million people globally rely on solid biomass for cooking and heating using traditional and inefficient cookstoves. The report identified the practice as the major cause of indoor air pollution responsible for 4.3 million premature deaths globally and 70,000 deaths estimated in Nigeria. The study will discuss results from ongoing qualitative research investigating enablers for the uptake of improved cookstoves (ICS) in Benue State, North Central Nigeria. The researchers used interviews and household questionnaires to gain an understanding of gendered cooking responsibilities at the household level. The paper will highlight fuel choice and wider household responsibilities that affect the use of ICS. It further discusses households' sources of income and what duties are performed by spouses in the study area. Household decision-making regarding stove purchases and cooking preferences influencing the types of stove used for preparing food will be highlighted. The results suggest that households with shared responsibility for cooking and fuel choice help to enable women to make decisions on household energy use and have access to some basic financial resources. These appear to be important drivers for clean energy use. The study indicates that the inclusion of gender perspectives within energy policy has potential to promote the uptake of ICS with greater energy use efficiency and reduced levels of household air pollution among Nigeria's rural and urban population. © 2017 WIT Press.","Energy efficient cooking device (ICS).; gender; household; responsibility",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047923989

Significant elements in the Republican Party became openly hostile to the scientific evidence and, following the election of George W. Bush, legislative action at the federal level effectively ground to a halt. This opened up space at the state and local level to develop climate change policies with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco and New York implementing a number of initiatives that brought real and substantive developments. The election of Barack Obama in 2008 seemed to open new possibilities for federal and global leadership once more and whilst the Obama administration has been criticised for a somewhat contradictory approach to the issue at times, there were nonetheless a number of substantive policy developments. Through a substantive and detailed analysis of the politics of climate change, this book places the evolution of US climate policy within broader debates on the nature of politics in the US and argues that there exists a latent potential, often obscured by the complexities of its political system, for America to act as a world leader on the issue.

Available experimental and numerical studies have documented stationary, non-stationary, or asymmetric modes that depend on properties of the incoming reactant flow as well as channel geometry and wall temperatures. This work seeks to illuminate mechanisms leading to symmetry breaking and limit cycle behavior that are fundamental to these combustion modes. Specifically, four cases of lean premixed methane/air combustion—two equivalence ratios (0.53 and 0.7) and two channel widths (2 mm and 5 mm)—are investigated in a 2D configuration with constant channel length and bulk inlet velocity, where numerical simulations are performed using detailed chemistry. External wall heating is simulated by imposing a linear temperature gradient as a boundary condition on both walls. In the 2 mm channel, both equivalence ratios produce flames that stabilize with symmetric flame fronts after propagating upstream. In the 5 mm channel, flame fronts start symmetrically, although symmetry is broken almost immediately after ignition. Further, 5 mm channels produce non-stationary combustion modes with dramatically different limit cycles: in the leaner case (φ = 0.53), the asymmetric flame front flops periodically, whereas in the richer case (φ = 0.7), flames with repetitive extinctions and ignitions (FREI) are observed. To further understand the flame dynamics, reaction fronts and flame fronts are captured and differentiated. Results show that the loss of flame front symmetry originates in a region close to the flame cusp, where flow and chemical characteristics exhibit large gradients and curvatures. Limit cycle behavior is illuminated by investigating flame edges that are formed along the wall, and accompany local or global ignition and extinction processes. In the flopping mode (φ = 0.53), local ignition and extinction in regions adjacent to the wall result in oblique fronts that advance and recede along the wall and redirect the flow ahead of the flame. In the FREI mode, asymmetric flames propagate much farther upstream, where they experience global extinction due to heat losses, and re-ignite far downstream with opposite flame front orientation. In both cases, an interaction of flow and chemical effects drives the asymmetric limit cycles. The lack of instabilities and asymmetries for the 2mm cases is attributed to insufficient wall separation, which is of the same order of magnitude as the flame thickness. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","CFD with detailed chemistry; flame instabilities; flames with repetitive extinctions and ignitions (FREI); Premixed combustion; symmetry breaking","Computational fluid dynamics; Flammability testing; Geometry; Ignition; Methane; Detailed chemistry; Flame instability; flames with repetitive extinctions and ignitions (FREI); Premixed combustion; Symmetry-breaking; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029544462

Objective: To investigate the effect of climate variability on childhood diarrhea (CDD) and identify high risk periods of diarrheal diseases. Methods: The study was conducted in all districts located in three Zones (Awi, West and East Gojjam) of Amhara Region in northwestern parts of Ethiopia. Monthly CDD cases for 24 months (from July 2013 to June 2015) reported to each district health office from the routine surveillance system were used for the study. Temperature, rainfall and humidity data for each district were extracted from satellite precipitation estimates and global atmospheric reanalysis. The space-time permutation scan statistic was used to identify high risk periods of CDD. A negative binomial regression was used to investigate the relationship between cases of CDD and climate variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using SaTScan program and StataSE v. 12. Results: The monthly average incidence rate of CDD was 11.4 per 1000 (95%CI 10.8–12.0) with significant variation between males [12.5 per 1000 (95%CI 11.9 to 13.2)] and females [10.2 per 1000 (95%CI 9.6 to 10.8)]. The space-time permutation scan statistic identified the most likely high risk period of CDD between March and June 2014 located in Huletej Enese district of East Gojjam Zone. Monthly average temperature and monthly average rainfall were positively associated with the rate of CDD, whereas the relative humidity was negatively associated with the rate of CDD. Conclusions: This study found that the most likely high risk period is in the beginning of the dry season. Climatic factors have an association with the occurrence of CDD. Therefore, CDD prevention and control strategy should consider local weather variations to improve programs on CDD. © 2017, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

Each member state shall establish an indicator showing the energy efficiency contribution towards the Member State's 2030 target. Under such challenging target, the use of optimized energy management system has the potential to greatly contribute to the reduction of both the primary energy and the CO2 emission. Of course, the economic benefit for installing these systems is also an important issue from owner's point of view, and it has a big influence on the technical solution choice. The energy management systems are capable to optimize the schedule of boilers, electric chillers, and other kind of generators. In this latter case, the use of cogeneration systems is often applied, in order to increase the overall efficiency of the plant, often in combination with absorption chillers to make effective use of the heat also with large cooling loads and small heating duties. The fuel sources of all these pieces of equipment are represented by natural gas and electricity, so the result of optimized operations is greatly modified depending on the situation of gas and electricity prices, which are strictly dependent on the country which the analysis is referred to. The purpose of this study is to clarify the influence of the electricity price and the natural gas price of each country on the optimum operation of an energy management system, considering the acquired energy demand pattern and the configuration of a multi-generation production plant consisting in a small Italian factory. The energy price scenarios which will be analyzed are related to 7 countries with large GDP in the EU region, on which optimization algorithm will be applied. The results will be focused on the comparison of the economic benefit, primary energy saving and reduction of CO2 emissions for each country, applying different target function of the optimizer (minimum running costs, primary energy consumption, or GHGs emissions), in order to highlight the most relevant parameters determining the benefit of the energy management system. © 2017 The Author(s).","Combined Heat; Energy Management System; Optimization Algorithm Benefit Analysis; Power","Absorption cooling; Carbon dioxide; Cooling systems; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Industrial plants; Natural gas; Optimization; Benefit analysis; Combined heat; Economic and environmental benefits; Optimization algorithms; Optimized energy managements; Power; Primary energy consumption; Primary energy savings; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030667987

One land use that is particularly amenable to this type of manipulation is agricultural land, which often has high sequestration potential. However, this capacity can depend on local factors such as cropping history, soil type and climate. Critically, it may also be limited by N availability. In this study we used the retrospective (repeated measures) methodology to assess the impact on previously arable land of land use change by either afforestation with two species of broadleaf trees planted at 800 or 1600 stems ha− 1 (T800 and T1600), or reversion to rough grassland (NT) for 21 years. We quantified the concentration, distribution and total stocks of organic C and N in the upper 0–30 cm of a common soil type found in NE Scotland and investigated the robustness of C:N to land use change. Finally we estimated ecosystem stocks of C and N, and how these were partitioned between plant and soil components. We found increases in the overall concentrations of soil C from 4.6% to 5.8%, and N from 0.32% to 0.43%. The increase in soil C stocks over the experiment was in the order NT &gt; T800 &gt; T1600 and each treatment differed significantly. The same pattern was seen for increases in N stocks but here the increases in NT and T800 were significantly greater than for T1600. Overall, stocks were higher in the rough grassland plots than under trees by 35 Mg ha− 1 for C and 2.2 Mg ha− 1 for N. These increases in stocks were accompanied by a highly significant narrowing in C:N with time across all treatments from 14.6 to 13.6 and differences seen between upper and lower soil layers in 1991 had disappeared by 2012. From an average of 151 Mg ha− 1 in 1991, the system C stock (soil + plants) had increased to between 202 Mg ha− 1 (NT) and 221 Mg ha− 1 (T1600) by 2012, with between 96% (NT) and 73% (T1600) of the C in the soil. Concurrently the system stock of N had increased to between 14.1 Mg ha− 1 (NT) and 11.3 Mg ha− 1 (T1600), from an average of 9.4 Mg ha− 1 in 1991, with between 99% (NT) and 81% (T1600) of the system N in the soil. Although in 2012 there were significantly greater soil C stocks in NT, this was offset by C accumulation in the treatments containing trees, such that overall there were no treatment differences. However, this was not seen with system N stocks in 2012, which were significantly larger in the NT treatment than in those with trees. Mean annual rates of C and N accumulation in the systems were greatest in NT (2.7 and 0.22 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1) and least in T1600 (0.7 and 0.08 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1). These results are important in the context of land use strategies aimed at pollution mitigation, such as C sequestration and nitrate leaching. They are also relevant to the possible effects of land use change, especially reversion to agricultural use, of land previously taken out of production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Abandonment; Afforestation; Climate change; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Sequestration; Temperate","Agriculture; Climate change; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Reforestation; Soils; Abandonment; Afforestation; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Sequestration; Temperate; Soil pollution; abandoned land; afforestation; arable land; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; land use change; soil carbon; soil emission; soil nitrogen; soil type; stoichiometry; temperate environment; topsoil; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019136698

Application of silicon as a metallic agent in Al2 03 - C slide gate plate production is usual. In fact, a non-oxide bond can be generated due to the reaction between silicon and carbon under reducing atmosphere in the plate matrix. This non-oxide bond can enhance the mechanical strength and abrasion resistance. In order to improve the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties, functional additives can be aimed to lower the sintering temperature and tailor the microstructure. For this reason, the effect of a special solid state sintering aid addition on the microstructure and thermo-mechanical properties of Al2 03 - C slide gate plates in the presence of Si as a metallic component has been investigated. Two types of specimens were pressed at 150 MPa, tempered at 200 °C and fired in coke bed at 1 400 °C, respectively. Physical (BD and AP), mechanical (CCS and MOR) and thermo-mechanical (HMOR) properties were determined; in addition, phase composition was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and microstructure of specimens was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Results have shown that the addition of sintering aid increased the generation of cation vacancy in Al203 structure which enhanced the cation diffusion and densification process; consequently, CCS, MOR and HMOR of specimens increased drastically while bulk density and apparent porosity remained unchanged.","Alumina carbon refractories; Mechanical properties; Microstruc-ture; Silicon carbide; Sintering aid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032360408

To improve yield potential and eco-efficiency simultaneously for the rice-wheat rotation system in China, we investigated changes in potential yields and yield gaps based on the field experiment data from 1981 to 2009 at four representative agro-meteorological experiment stations, along with the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) rice-wheat model. We further optimized crop cultivar and sowing/transplanting date, and investigated crop yield, water and nitrogen use efficiency, and environment impact of the rice-wheat rotation system in response to water and nitrogen supply. We found that the yield gaps between potential yields and farmer's yields were about 8101 kg/ha or 45.3% of the potential yield, which had been shrinking from 1981 to 2009. To improve yield potentials and eco-efficiency, the cultivars of rice and wheat that properly increase both radiation use efficiency and grain weight are promising. Rice cultivars breeding need to maintain the length of panicle development and reproductive phase. High-yielding wheat cultivars are characterized by medium vernalization sensitivity, low photoperiod sensitivity and short length of floral initiation phase. Proper shift in sowing date can alleviate the negative effect of climate risk. Intermittent irrigation scheme (irrigate until surface soil saturated when average water content of surface soil is <50% of saturated water content) for rice, together with nitrogen application rate of 390–420 kg N/ha (180–210 kg N/ha for rice and 210 kg N/ha for wheat), is suggested for the rice-wheat rotation system to maintain high yield with high resource use efficiency. This suggested nitrogen application rates are lower than those currently used by many local farmers. Our findings are useful to improve yield potential and eco-efficiency for the rice-wheat rotation system in China. Furthermore, this study demonstrates an effective approach with crop modelling to design farming system for sustainable intensification, which can be adapted to other farming systems and regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Agro-ecosystem; Climate smart agriculture; Impacts; Sustainable development; Yield gap","adaptation; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural production; crop rotation; crop yield; cultivar; nutrient use efficiency; resource use; rice; sustainability; sustainable development; wheat; China; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021014199

This article contributes to these debates by advancing two arguments. The first concerns the need for greater examination of how climate justice coexists and competes with more established political and justice considerations during the negotiation of climate policies. I argue that distinguishing analytically between normative interpretations of climate justice and justice claims made by parties affected by climate change or by mitigation or adaptation policies provides fertile ground for deepening understanding of the multivalent and relational nature of climate justice and confronting challenges to its incorporation into climate responses. The second argument concerns the importance of exploring how proponents and opponents of climate action strive to develop “spatial anchors” for justice claims to increase their legitimacy in policy debates. Based on analysis of carbon pricing controversies in Australia, the article illustrates how supporters of carbon pricing initiatives stressed international justice issues, whereas opponents mobilized multiscalar and multivalent international, national, regional, and local justice narratives to gain traction for their arguments. The article concludes by calling for further investigation of the multivalence of climate justice and of how climate justice might be spatially represented to advance its leverage in political debates on climate policy. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.","Australia; carbon pricing; climate justice; justice claims; spatial representation","adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; environmental justice; environmental policy; pricing policy; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017176886

To be successful, the transition requires billions of people to adopt cleaner, more efficient cooking technologies that contribute to sustainability through multiple pathways: improved air quality, reduced emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, and reduced deforestation or forest degradation. However, the latter depends entirely on the extent to which people rely on 'non-renewable biomass' (NRB). This paper compares NRB estimates from 286 carbon-offset projects in 51 countries to a recently published spatial assessment of pan-tropical woodfuel demand and supply. The existing projects expect to produce offsets equivalent to ∼138 MtCO2e. However, when we apply NRB values derived from spatially explicit woodfuel demand and supply imbalances in the region of each offset project, we find that emission reductions are between 57 and 81 MtCO2e: 41%-59% lower than expected. We suggest that project developers and financiers recalibrate their expectations of the mitigation potential of woodfuel projects. Spatial approaches like the one utilized here indicate regions where interventions are more (and less) likely to reduce deforestation or degradation: for example, in woodfuel 'hotspots' in East, West, and Southern Africa as well as South Asia, where nearly 300 million people live with acute woodfuel scarcity. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon offsets; deforestation; energy transitions; forest degradation; woodfuels","Air cleaners; Air quality; Deforestation; Developing countries; Emission control; Sustainable development; Wood fuels; Carbon offsets; Cooking technology; Emission reduction; Energy transitions; Forest degradation; Project developers; Spatial assessment; Spatially explicit; Forestry; air quality; carbon dioxide; deforestation; developing world; emission control; fuelwood; pollutant; sustainability; technology adoption; East Africa; South Asia; Southern Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036452539

Associated concerns about amplified ocean deoxygenation arise from an arguable likelihood that coastal upwelling systems in the world's oceans may further intensify as anthropogenic climate change proceeds. Comparative examples discussed include the uniquely intense seasonal Somali Current upwelling, the massive upwelling that occurs quasi-continuously off Namibia and the recently appearing and now annually recurring 'dead zone' off the US State of Oregon. The evident 'transience' in causal dynamics off Oregon is somewhat mirrored in an interannual-scale intermittence in eruptions of anaerobically formed noxious gases off Namibia. A mechanistic scheme draws the three examples towards a common context in which, in addition to the obvious but politically problematic remedy of actually reducing 'greenhouse' gas emissions, the potentially manageable abundance of strongly swimming, finely gill raker-meshed small pelagic fish emerges as a plausible regulating factor.

Road freight transport, trucking in particular, has a large share in the energy consumption, CO2-emissions and air pollution by human activities. This will become an even bigger issue with the expected massive growth of road freight transport. Climate change mitigation asks for a major reduction of CO2-emissions from human origin. Improvement of air quality is a second reason why trucking companies have to look for alternative engine-fuel configurations: Biodiesel, gas and electricity. The paper answers two research questions: New truck technologies are under way, what impact could these have on fuel consumption and emissions related with the fuel consumption of trucks? How realistic is large-scale introduction of these new technologies before the year 2030? A model was used to estimate the emissions of CO2, NOx and PM10 of a truck transporting goods along a pre-defined route consisting of city roads and highways. The volumes and composition of the emissions vary depending on the data entered by the user: Route/distance, fuel efficiency/consumption, emission factors and engine-fuel configuration. The model was used for a micro-simulation, but an extension towards a macro-simulation model is feasible. This would allow to estimate the impact on fuel consumption and emissions for a fleet of trucks. The model indicates that the main benefit of an alternative like biodiesel lies in the reduction of PM10-emissions. Electric trucking is necessary to drastically reduce CO2-emissions and air pollution. In a few years from now hybrid diesel-electric trucks will become common. Full-electric trucks energized by internal (hydrogen in fuel cells) and/or external (trolley-like, high density batteries) sources are feasible well before the year 2030. Electric trucking means a drastic change in the use of fuels with implications for the electricity grid as well. © 2017 WIT Press.","Conditions.; Emissions; energy consumption; Environment; Heavy-duty trucks",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047933666

Cities are not only responsible for environmental and health problems but also they hold the key for a greener economy and a sustainable future. Urban built environment is a policy field where appropriate policies and actions could yield significant human and ecological benefits. Among different elements of urban built environment, buildings deserve particular attention due to their large contribution to environmental and health problems. The concept of sustainable (green) building is a recent response to address the problems that stem from the building sector. However, the widespread implementation of the concept is hindered by significant challenges. This paper argues that manifestation of multiple benefits that sustainable buildings deliver could help overcome some of these challenges. The paper presents the extent to which green buildings could generate co-benefits, and underlines the opportunities and barriers to push green building agenda forward. The results indicate that green and sustainably renovated buildings could yield significant benefits in terms of energy and CO2 reduction, cost savings, and improved health situation for building users. The case study buildings with the best two performances are found to achieve 33% and 26% reduction in energy use intensity, and 38% and 32% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity in comparison to benchmark values. Reduction in energy consumption in the top two buildings corresponds to an energy cost saving of $ 1–1.5 Million per year per building. Furthermore, the top two buildings are found to provide improved healthy environment due to improved indoor and ambient air quality, better thermal comfort and more natural lighting indoors. Making more explicit the multiple benefits of sustainable buildings needs further consideration in this regard. We recommend that the public sector could take key actions to accelerate the number of green buildings including fiscal support, technical assistance and policy reforms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Co-benefits; CO2 reduction; Health benefits; Monetary benefits; Sustainability; ​Green buildings","Air quality; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Health; Intelligent buildings; Co benefits; Energy use intensities; Green buildings; Health benefits; Healthy environments; Monetary benefits; Reduction in energy consumption; Sustainable building; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959240130

In this study, real-time observation data such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 were used to analyze wintertime haze events at a rural site (Dongshan) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). 3-hour resolution organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were also measured to further investigate the sources of PM2.5. The hybrid receptor models were used to identify source regions of PM2.5. The results showed that both regional transport and local emissions significantly contribute to air pollution at Dongshan during haze periods. The source areas affecting high PM2.5 concentrations were mainly located in nearby urbanized provinces (i.e., Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang) and industrial provinces (i.e., Shandong and Hebei) in eastern China. Furthermore, open biomass-burning emissions in south China (i.e., Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong and Fujian) decreased regional air quality, which was supported by MODIS fire spots and receptor models. During clean periods, air masses were originated from remote regions such as Mongolia and oceanic areas (i.e., the Yellow Sea and the East Sea). Enhanced secondary organic carbon (SOC) formation was found under long-range transport when OC aging was favorable. Contrarily, relatively low SOC formation was found when the site was dominated by local emissions. In addition to local emissions, high PM2.5 concentrations at Dongshan were apparently affected by either regional or long-range transport, which were characterized by relatively low and high wind speeds, respectively. It is necessary to implement the emission control strategies for the industrial and urbanized areas. © 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Back trajectories; Carbonaceous aerosols; PM2.5; Sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014993209

Although multiple hypotheses related to local climate variables have been proposed, an understanding of this seasonal variation remains incomplete. The historical Bengal region, which encompasses the full range of cholera's seasonality observed worldwide, provides a unique opportunity to gain insights on underlying environmental drivers. Here, we propose a mechanistic, rainfall-temperature driven, stochastic epidemiological model which explicitly accounts for the fluctuations of the aquatic reservoir, and analyze with this model the historical dataset of cholera mortality in the Bengal region. Parameters are inferred with a recently developed sequential Monte Carlo method for likelihood maximization in partially observed Markov processes. Results indicate that the hydrological regime is a major driver of the seasonal dynamics of cholera. Rainfall tends to buffer the propagation of the disease in wet regions due to the longer residence times of water in the environment and an associated dilution effect, whereas it enhances cholera resurgence in dry regions. Moreover, the dynamics of the environmental water reservoir determine whether the seasonality is unimodal or bimodal, as well as its phase relative to the monsoon. Thus, the full range of seasonal patterns can be explained based solely on the local variation of rainfall and temperature. Given the close connection between cholera seasonality and environmental conditions, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would allow the better management and planning of public health policies with respect to climate variability and climate change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bengal; Cholera; Endemic; Historical dataset; Infectious disease; Modeling; Seasonality","Climate change; Dynamics; Geographical regions; Markov processes; Models; Monte Carlo methods; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Bengal; Cholera; Endemic; Historical dataset; Infectious disease; Seasonality; Diseases; cholera; climate change; climate variation; data set; endemic species; infectious disease; rainfall; seasonality; Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009375195

A critical contributor to the uncertainty is variability in warfarin metabolism, which includes mostly oxidative but also reductive pathways. Reduction of each warfarin enantiomer yields two warfarin alcohol isomers, and the corresponding four alcohols retain varying levels of anticoagulant activity. Studies on the kinetics of warfarin reduction have often lacked resolution of parent-drug enantiomers and have suffered from coelution of pairs of alcohol metabolites; thus, those studies have not established the importance of individual stereospecific reductive pathways. We report the first steady-state analysis of R- and S-warfarin reduction in vitro by pooled human liver cytosol. As determined by authentic standards, the major metabolites were 9R,11S-warfarin alcohol for R-warfarin and 9S,11S-warfarin alcohol for S-warfarin. R-warfarin (Vmax 150 pmol/mg per minute, Km 0.67 mM) was reduced more efficiently than S-warfarin (Vmax 27 pmol/mg per minute, Km 1.7 mM). Based on inhibitor phenotyping, carbonyl reductase-1 dominated R-and S-warfarin reduction, followed by aldo-keto reductase-1C3 and then other members of that family. Overall, the carbonyl at position 11 undergoes stereospecific reduction by multiple enzymes to form the S alcohol for both drug enantiomers, yet R-warfarin undergoes reduction preferentially. This knowledge will aid in assessing the relative importance of reductive pathways for R- and S-warfarin and factors influencing levels of pharmacologically active parent drugs and metabolites, thus impacting patient dose responses.

The simulated climate results from a reduction in the zonal temperature gradient, which weakens westerly flow and reduces moisture flux and precipitation in the midcontinent. As a result, sensible heating is favored over evaporation and latent heating, resulting in substantial surface-driven atmospheric warming. Thus, the discrepancy with the paleoenvironmental evidence arises initially from a problem in the simulated circulation and is exacerbated by feedback from the land surface. This region is also drier and warmer than indicated by observations in the preindustrial control simulations, and this bias arises in the same way: zonal flow and hence moisture flux into the midcontinent are too weak, and feedback from the land surface results in surface-driven warming.

The tendency of enantioenriched organic compounds to revert to an entropically favored racemic state in the presence of viable racemization pathways (e.g., the enolization of stereogenic carbonyl derivatives) can sometimes interfere with this objective; however, beginning with Noyori's foundational disclosure of a dynamic kinetic transfer hydrogenation, the ability to channel racemic, configurationally labile starting materials through stereoconvergent reaction pathways has been recognized as a powerful strategy in asymmetric synthesis. Proton transfer, retro-aldol, retro-Michael, reversible redox events, and other processes that can be deleterious to asymmetric synthesis are exploitable in enantioconvergent reactions using chiral small molecules and enzymes as asymmetric catalysts. Enantioselective reduction of configurationally labile carbonyl derivatives bearing a C-H acidic chiral center are particularly common. Because facile racemization is vital to stereocontrol in these transformations, hydrogenations of β-dicarbonyls are commonplace, while less activated substrates have been used less commonly. Our entry into enantioconvergent catalysis evolved from a long-standing interest in the synthesis of complex glycolates and began with the development of a general Noyori-type transfer hydrogenation of α-keto esters. Key innovations in this work include the identification of a new terphenylsulfonamide-Ru(II) complex, which displays unusual preference toward reduction of α-keto esters, and the observation that α-keto esters racemize under mildly basic conditions. This work was extended to the dynamic kinetic hydrogenation of racemic acyl phosphonates. Moreover, the recent recognition that the mechanistic paradigm underlying enantioconvergent hydrogenation chemistry can be extended to diverse carbon-centered nucleophiles has led to advances in the art. Our lab has developed a number of enantioconvergent tertiary alcohol syntheses. In the context of carbon-centered nucleophiles, we have focused on the use of α-keto esters; however, in the latter part of this Account, we will briefly describe our nascent efforts to develop dynamic kinetic additions of carbon-centered nucleophiles to β-oxo acid derivatives. While the enantioconvergent hydrogenation of β-keto acid derivatives is carried out on 100-ton scale annually, non-hydrogenative transformations of these compounds constitute an underexplored subclass of enantioconvergent reactions.With regard to future prospects, a trend toward transformations that afford increasing levels of molecular complexity is apparent. It can be expected that the burgeoning field of asymmetric 1,2-addition chemistry will further drive this chemistry to encompass a wider array of enantioconvergent additions. Additionally, the continued exploration of these chemistries in the context of less conventional electrophiles, as well as identifying novel or overlooked modes of racemization, holds considerable potential. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"carbon; carboxylic acid; glycolic acid derivative; catalysis; chemistry; kinetics; stereoisomerism; synthesis; Carbon; Carboxylic Acids; Catalysis; Glycolates; Kinetics; Stereoisomerism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029681234

However, policy mix analysis has thus far been employed at a high conceptual level, focusing on describing interactions between instrument types. Policy mix analysis rarely describes instrument ‘structure’ or functional characteristics in a way that would answer the question ‘what constitutes an instrument’? We describe how the rules-in-use taxonomy of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, developed for research on common pool resource management, can be used to characterize conservation policy instrument interactions. We demonstrate the approach on the well-known payments for ecosystem services (PES) program in Costa Rica and cross-compliance policies, arguing that PES is a policy mix rather than a single economic instrument. Our analysis shows how design features of PES described in the economics literature map to ‘rules-in-use’ in the IAD framework. The framework provides a terminology for defining what constitutes institutional context, comparing economic, regulatory and information instruments, and studying their interactions. The rules-in-use taxonomy of IAD is a ‘structural’ diagnostic approach, which needs to be combined with other tools that analyse the role and ‘agency’ of actors, as part of integrative environmental governance research.

The nanosheets of g-C3N4 have been obtained from its bulk counterpart through liquid phase exfoliation, while the attached functional groups have been removed through sodium borohydride treatment. X-ray photoelectron and micro Raman studies indicate the improved aromatization through the removal of the functional groups, while structural defect formation has been realized at higher reduction levels. It has been found that the increase in sp2 C-N cluster size as a result of improved aromatization leads to the enhanced absorption through π → π∗ transition. Consequently, the luminescence response has been found to increase at the lower reduction level. On the other hand, near-ultraviolet emission and suppressed visible emission has been witnessed at higher reduction levels. The improvement in near-ultraviolet emission originates from the modified density of states which favors the transitions involving δ∗ and N lone pair states. Better understanding of the reduction mechanism can lead to the fabrication of prototype flexible light emitting devices that can emit light in the ultraviolet as well as the visible region of the spectrum. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Light; Light emission; Luminescence; Nanosheets; Nitrides; Titanium sheet; Enhanced absorption; Flexible light emitting devices; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Micro-Raman studies; Near-ultraviolet emissions; Reduction mechanisms; Sodium boro hydrides; X-ray photoelectrons; Carbon nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029360759

The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme (REDD+) is an example of such investment. This study examines the livelihood implications and perceptions of REDD+ among indigenous and forest-dependent communities in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. A systems-based livelihood survey has been conducted with two communities affected by REDD+ (n = 102)-Kala Tonggu village (participating in UN-REDD, a multilateral programme) and Hieu commune (participating in a REDD+ project of Fauna and Flora International). The positive effects of REDD+ included: introduction of community-based forest management; shifting power relations in favour of local communities; communities receiving financial benefits for forest monitoring; and positive community perceptions on REDD+. The negative impacts concerned: more restricted access to the natural forest; raising false expectations on the financial benefits of REDD+; increasing risks of food insecurity; exclusion of customary institutions and forest classifications; and lack of livelihood alternatives in dealing with changing socio-ecological conditions. Based on the findings of this study, we argue that REDD+ implementation needs to incorporate the temporality and dynamics of community livelihoods, power relations, and customary and formal socio-ecological systems more comprehensively. This to ultimately achieve inclusive local development and effective conservation of global forest commons. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon sequestration; Climate action; Forest-dependent livelihood; Global land rush; Livelihood perception; REDD+; Socio-ecological system; Vietnam","accessibility; adaptive management; carbon sequestration; climate change; community resource management; conservation; empirical analysis; indigenous population; investment; land use change; livelihood; natural resource; perception; power relations; research program; risk factor; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam; Naso hexacanthus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030646674

A climate change impact, adaptation and vulnerability (CCIAV) assessment following IPCC traditions was applied, which operationalizes the concepts of exposure, sensitivity, potential impact, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability for natural ecosystems. Potential impact was quantified for the periods 2021–2050 and 2071–2100 based on regional climate models ALADIN-Climate and RegCM. Although the potential impact of future climate change was predominantly negative on the most climate sensitive forested habitat types of Hungary, for some of the grassland types we experienced positive predicted responses. Loess steppes and annual saline vegetation may thus partially benefit from climate change.

Each with the odds of a 100-year occurrence suggesting that such extreme events are the region's “new normal.” City and state policy-makers, in response, are studying how to develop a network of robust, resilient critical infrastructure facilities. These studies, however, typically fail to address interdependencies among critical infrastructures and lack a quantitative tool to investigate the maximum resilience possessed by a given infrastructure facility in the face of climate-change-induced hazards. We propose a multi-stage stochastic mathematical program to maximize network resilience given: i) random arrival of extreme events; ii) the network's inherent capacity to withstand and cope with the aftermath of exogenous shocks; iii) pre-, during-, and post-event strategies available to enhance system operability; and iv) budgeting and technological restrictions facing policy-makers. Our approach allows both qualitative and quantitative paradigms to interact. Our model thus clarifies how to allocate resources proactively and how the network's absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities can be coordinated to enhance overall system resilience. Our findings suggest that an integrated planning approach combined with smart allocation of resources across a network's main elements creates a greater degree of resilience while utilizing less costly resilience-enhancing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change-induced hazards; Climate-adaptive planning; Extreme events; Hurricane; Motor fuel supply-chain; Resilience planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021422494

Less discussed, but equally important, is the evolving interest and use of research evaluation to support learning and adaptive management within research programmes. This is especially true in a research-for-development context where research competes with other worthy alternatives for overseas development assistance funding and where highly complex social, economic and ecological environments add to evaluation challenges. Researchers and research managers need to know whether and how their interventions are working to be able to adapt and improve their programmes as well as to be able to satisfy their funders. This paper presents a theory-based research evaluation approach that was developed and tested on four policy-relevant research activities: a long-term forest management research programme in the Congo Basin; a large research programme on forests and climate change; a multi-country research project on sustainable wetlands management, and; a research project of the furniture value chain in one district in Indonesia. The first used Contribution Analysis and the others used purpose-built outcome evaluation approaches that combined concepts and methods from several approaches. Each research evaluation began with documentation of a theory of change (ToC) that identified key actors, processes and results. Data collected through document reviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were analysed to test the ToCs against evidence of outcomes in the form of discourse, policy formulation and practice change. The approach proved valuable as a learning tool for researchers and research managers and it has facilitated communication with funders about actual and reasonable research contributions to change. Evaluations that employed a participatory approach with project scientists and partners noticeably supported team learning about past work and about possible adaptations for the future. In all four cases, the retrospective ToC development proved challenging and resulted in overly-simplistic ToCs. Further work is needed to draw on social scientific theories of knowledge translation and policy processes to develop and further test more sophisticated theories of change. This theory-based approach to research evaluation provides a valuable means of assessing research effectiveness (summative value) and supports learning and adaptation (formative value) at the project or programme scale. The approach is well suited to the research-for-development projects represented by the case studies, but it should be applicable to any research that aspires to have a societal impact.

Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO2 (assimilation [A]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (gS). The ability to mechanistically predict gS and A in response to atmospheric CO2, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for gS are lacking, especially for C4 photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C4 photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C4 grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of gS to light, atmospheric CO2 and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C4 plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C4 grasses may have supported the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

This three-step methodology starts by modeling systems where flows are described by temporal distributions. Then, a temporally differentiated life cycle inventory (TDLCI) is calculated to present the environmental exchanges through time. Finally, time-dependent characterization factors are applied to the TDLCI to evaluate climate-change impacts through time. The implementation of this new framework is illustrated by comparing systems producing domestic hot water (DHW) over an 80-year period. Electricity is used to heat water in the first system, whereas the second system uses a combination of solar energy and gas to heat an equivalent amount of DHW at the same temperature. This comparison shows that using a different temporal precision (i.e., monthly vs. annual) to describe process flows can reverse conclusions regarding which case has the best environmental performance. Results also show that considering the timing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduces the absolute values of carbon footprint in the short-term when compared with results from the static life cycle assessment. This pragmatic framework for the implementation of time in DLCA studies is proposed to help in the development of the methodology. It is not yet a fully operational scheme, and efforts are still required before DLCA can become state of practice. © 2016 by Yale University","dynamic modeling; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment (LCA); life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); life cycle inventory (LCI); methods","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Dynamic models; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hot water distribution systems; Solar energy; Water; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life cycle inventories; Methods; Life cycle; carbon footprint; climate change; dynamic property; gas; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; precision; solar power; temporal distribution; water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996538633

The Danish municipality of Helsingør can achieve a substantial CO2 emissions reduction by transforming its heat supply and deploying heat savings. In this paper, we model the heating system of Helsingør, assess it from a simple socio- and private-economic perspective, develop future scenarios, and conduct an iterative process to derive a cost-optimal mix between district heating, individual heating and heat savings. The results show that in 2030 it is cost-optimal to reduce the heating demand by 20–39% by implementing heat savings, to deploy 32%–41% of district heating and to reduce heating-related CO2 emissions by up to 95% in comparison to current emissions. In 2050, the cost-optimal share of district heating in Helsingør increases to between 38 and 44%. The resulting average heating costs and CO2 emissions are found to be sensitive to biomass and electricity price.

To determine sustainable and economically feasible environmental management options for MSW incineration FA in Estonia, CO2 sequestration with a further carbonation process was examined. A partial Cost &amp; Benefit Analysis has been conducted to compare the carbonation process to the current situation. Two carbonation options were developed. Option 1 is to use carbonated FA in any other processes based on the waste-to-product principle. Option 2 is to send carbonated FA to the non-hazardous landfill in Tallinn, Estonia. Important parameters, such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Benefit–Cost Ratio (BCR) and Break Even Point (BEP), have been calculated for carbonation options and the current case. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to examine its robustness. The results showed that the best option is carbonation Option 1 with NPV of 9,209,662 EUR, IRR of 43%, BCR of 2.63 and BEP between 2018 and 2019. Both Options 1 and 2 constitute more sustainable and environmentally friendly management options compared to the current situation. It can be concluded that this preliminary feasibility study showed that running a carbonation plant may be profitable and sustainable for Estonia. Currently, there is no treatment technology for MSW incineration FA in Estonia and FA is sent to a neighbouring country for further utilisation. This is the first study to demonstrate FA management options with economic and environmental benefits. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","CO2 sequestration with further carbonation; Cost & Benefit Analysis; fly ash utilisation; Municipal solid waste incineration","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Earnings; Environmental management; Fly ash; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; Planning; Sensitivity analysis; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Waste management; Benefit analysis; CO2 sequestration; Economic and environmental benefits; Incineration fly ashes; Internal rate of return; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste incineration fly ashes; Treatment technologies; Waste incineration; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Estonia; feasibility study; fly ash; incineration; solid waste; Coal Ash; Estonia; Feasibility Studies; Incineration; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027469888

Degradation of forest resources is likely to cause adverse effects on the economy and environment both locally and globally. Further, it is observed that the natural forests do reduce the frequency and severity of floods as it traps water during heavy rainfall and releases the same slowly into streams reducing the run off. However, this link between forest covers and flood damages is still unclear and yet to be settled in empirical literatures. Also, the protective role of forests in Indian context has remained largely unexplored and this paper attempts to fill this research gap. The objective of this study is, therefore, to examine the impact of forest cover on the extent of flood damage in India controlling various social, economic and demographic aspects. The study uses secondary data across the Indian states for the period 1998–2011. The data were analyzed using the Poisson and ordinary least square (OLS) regression models. The findings suggest that forest cover in India has an inverse relationship with the flood damages. In addition, socio-economic factors such as literacy, per capita net state domestic product and population size have significant influence on the extent of flood damages. Hence, investments in forest protection and regeneration are necessary to restrict flood damages and protect human lives and properties. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Flood damages; Forest cover; India; Meteorological parameters; Mortality ratio; Socio-economic parameters","environmental degradation; flood damage; forest cover; forest resource; mortality; natural hazard; parameterization; socioeconomic status; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021234480

In vitro activity tests of the sediment with methane and sulfate demonstrated sulfide production coupled to the simultaneous consumption of sulfate and methane at approximately equimolar ratios over a period of 150 days. The maximum sulfate reduction rate was 5 μmol sulfate per gram dry weight per day during the incubation period. Diverse archaeal and bacterial clades were retrieved from the sediment with the majority of them clustered with Euryarchaeota, Thaumarcheota, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the sediment from marine Lake Grevelingen contained anaerobic methanotrophic Archaea (ANME) and methanogens as archaeal clades with a role in the methane cycling. ANME at the studied site mainly belong to the ANME-3 clade. This study provides one of the few reports for the presence of ANME-3 in a shallow coastal sediment. Sulfate-reducing bacteria from Desulfobulbus clades were found among the sulfate reducers, however, with very low relative abundance. Desulfobulbus has previously been commonly found associated with ANME, whereas in our study, ANME-3 and Desulfobulbus were not observed simultaneously in clusters, suggesting the possibility of independent AOM by ANME-3. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; ANME; Archaea; Bacteria; Coastal sediments; Marine Lake Grevelingen; Sulfate reduction","archaeal RNA; bacterial RNA; methane; RNA 16S; sea water; anaerobic bacterium; anaerobic growth; archaeon; classification; genetics; lake; metabolism; microbiology; Netherlands; oxidation reduction reaction; sediment; sequence analysis; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Geologic Sediments; Lakes; Methane; Netherlands; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Archaeal; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, RNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017129126

Material selection in the product design phase is of great significance to energy conservation and emission reduction. However, because of the limitation of the current life-cycle energy analysis and optimization method, such concerns have not been adequately addressed in material selection. To fill in this gap, a process to build a comprehensive multi-objective optimization model for automated multimaterial selection (MOO-MSS) on the basis of cloud manufacturing is developed in this paper. The optimizing method, named local search-differential group leader algorithm (LS-DGLA), is a hybrid of differential evolution and local search with the group leader algorithm (GLA), constructed for better flexibility to handle different needs for various product designs. Compared with a number of evolutionary algorithms and nonevolutionary algorithms, it is observed that LS-DGLA performs better in terms of speed, stability, and searching capability.

However, LST is challenging to measure and simulate because of its high sensitivity to atmospheric instability and solar angle, particularly over large-scale heterogeneous scenes. We propose a model that combines radiosity theory and an energy budget method for surface temperatures; we also explore the anisotropic behavior of row-planted crop emissions. The surface thermodynamic equilibrium state is fulfilled via the interaction between the 3-D radiative transfer calculations of the thermal-region radiosity-graphics combined model and the energy balance equation. Despite its shortcomings, such as the time-consuming calculations, the proposed model is feasible according to the results of an intercomparison and validation analysis. The intercomparison shows that the model exhibits similar performance, in terms of surface temperature calculations, to that of the soil-canopy observation, photochemistry and energy balance model (root-mean-square differences) of 0.59 °C and 1.77 °C for the leaf and soil components, respectively.

This concern manifests not only in strategic planning and forward-looking documents, but also in building infrastructural capacity and material provision. Yet, the impetus to ‘green’ the military goes beyond the deployment of existing technologies. We examine several facets of the military's role as an environmental actor, particularly through its promotion of the US Navy's ‘Great Green Fleet’ (GGF), which actively supports the development of advanced biofuels by subsidizing their development and facilitating wider marketization. The GGF promises to reduce military reliance on conventional fossil fuels and reconfigure its energy sourcing, thus reducing dependence on imported hydrocarbons; this is with an eye towards ultimately severing the logistical relationship between existing energy infrastructures and the spaces of military intervention. Taking an integrated lens of political ecology and geopolitics - ‘geopolitical ecology’ - we seek to provide an understanding of the production of weaponized nature. We demonstrate that the US military's discursive use of climate change to justify the provision of new military hardware and advanced biofuels promotes a vision of resource conflicts to support the development of technologies to overcome the constraints to delivery of fuel to emergent front lines. We argue that while this may appear to be militarized greenwashing, it signals a shift in the logics and practices of fuel sourcing driven by a dystopian vision of climate change, which the US military played a significant role in creating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Geopolitical ecology; Markets; Territory; US Navy","biofuel; climate change; energy market; environmental politics; fossil fuel; geopolitics; military intervention; territory; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016514834

In the Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) member countries as a group, infant and child mortality were reduced by more than 65% between 1990 and 2015, achieving the MDG target of two-thirds reduction, although these goals were not achieved by several smaller countries. The SDGs are broader in focus than the MDGs, but include several goals that relate directly to nutrition: 2 (zero hunger—food), 3 (good health and well-being—healthy life), and 12 (responsible consumption and production—sustainability). Other SDGs that are closely related to nutrition are 4 and 5 (quality education and equality in gender—education and health for girls and mothers, which is very important for infant health) and 13 (climate action). Goal 3 is “good health and well-being,” which includes targets for child mortality, maternal mortality, and reducing chronic disease. The Global Burden of Disease Project has confirmed that the majority of risk for these targets can be attributed to nutrition-related targets. Dietary Guidelines were developed to address public health nutrition risk in the Asia Pacific region at the 48th APACPH 2016 conference and they are relevant to the achievement of the SDGs. Iron deficiency increases the risk of maternal death from haemorrhage, a cause of 300000 deaths world-wide each year. Improving diets and iron supplementation are important public health interventions in the APACPH region. Chronic disease and obesity rates in the APACPH region are now a major challenge and healthy life course nutrition is a major public health priority in answering this challenge.

Controlling this process in order to improve the performance and to reduce emissions by ensuring rapid and robust combustion depends on how ignition stage is achieved. An ignition system that seems to be able for providing such an enhanced combustion process is that based on plasma generation using a Q-switched solid state laser that delivers pulses with high peak power (of MW-order level). The laser-spark devices used in the present investigations were realized using compact diffusion-bonded Nd:YAG/Cr4+:YAG ceramic media. The laser igniter was designed, integrated and built to resemble a classical spark plug and therefore it could be mounted directly on the cylinder head of a passenger car engine. In this study are reported the results obtained using such ignition system provided for a K7M 710 engine currently produced by Renault-Dacia, where the standard calibrations were changed towards the lean mixtures combustion zone.

This paper investigates the role of temporal (“when”) flexibility from emission banking provisions under an economy-wide cap-and-trade policy in the USA. The current literature on meeting deep decarbonization targets almost exclusively assumes unlimited banking, which may bias policy recommendations and have important consequences for R&D prioritization and model development. Numerical experiments using the energy-economic model US Regional Energy, GHG, and Economy (US-REGEN) indicate that assumptions about banking materially impact cost and emission pathways in meeting long-term targets like 80% reductions by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. Given the stringency of long-run targets and convexity of marginal abatement costs, the cost-minimizing time path for mitigation with banking suggests that 2025 abatement should exceed the pledged level under the Paris Agreement (42% instead of 26–28%) to reduce future costs. Total policy costs are approximately 30% higher when banking is excluded; however, political economy barriers and uncertainty may limit the use of banking provisions despite their appeal on economic efficiency grounds. Banking on policy implementation with unlimited temporal flexibility may distort insights about the pace, extent, and economic impacts of future energy transitions associated with long-term abatement targets, especially for more stringent climate policies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Budget control; Commerce; Cost reduction; Costs; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Cumulative emissions; Emission allowances; Energy-economic model; Environmental policy; Marginal abatement costs; Numerical experiments; Policy implementations; Policy recommendations; Environmental protection; abatement cost; banking; climate change; cost analysis; emission; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; international agreement; numerical method; policy development; policy implementation; political economy; pollution tax; prioritization; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027712396

Understanding leaf trait variation along environmental gradients is thus essential to improve the representation of vegetation in Earth system models. Our aims were to quantify relationships between leaf traits and climate in permanent grasslands at a biogeographical scale and to test whether these relationships were sensitive to (a) the level of nitrogen inputs and (b) the inclusion of information pertaining to plant community organization. Location: Permanent grasslands throughout France. Methods: We combined existing datasets on climate, soil, nitrogen inputs (fertilization and deposition), species composition and four traits, namely specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, for 15,865 French permanent grasslands. Trait–climate relationships were tested using the following four climatic variables available across 1,833 pixels (5 km × 5 km): mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), and two indices accounting for the length of the growing season. We compared these relationships at the pixel level using either using community-level or species’ trait means. Results: Our findings were as follows: (a) leaf traits related to plant nutrient economy shift consistently along a gradient of growing season length accounting for temperature and soil water limitations of plant growth (GSLtw); (b) weighting leaf traits by species abundance in local communities is pivotal to capture leaf trait–environment relationships correctly at a biogeographical scale; and (c) the relationships between traits and GSLtw weaken for grasslands with a high nitrogen input. Main conclusions: The effects of climate on plant communities are better described using composite descriptors than coarse variables such as MAT or MAP, but appear weaker for high-nitrogen grasslands. Using information at the community level tends to strengthen trait–climate relationships. The interplay of land management, community assembly and bioclimate appears crucial to the prediction of leaf trait variations and their effects on biogeochemical cycles. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","community functional structure; environmental gradients; fertilization; functional biogeography; functional diversity; growing season length; land management; permanent grasslands; plant traits","biodiversity; biogeography; community structure; environmental gradient; fertilization (reproduction); grassland; growing season; land management; leaf; nitrogen; plant community; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029575165

This option has associated risks such as possible CO2 leakage from the storage sites. So far, negative effects deriving from a CO2 release have been reported for benthic macrofauna in both polluted and nonpolluted sediments. However, bacterial communities has no considered. In this work, risk assessment was carried out in order to evaluate the possible effects in a contaminated area considering bacterial responses (total number of cells, respiring activity, changes in the bacterial community composition and diversity). Four microcosms were placed into an integrated CO2 injection system with a non-pressurized chamber to simulate four different pH treatments (pH control 7.8, 7, 6.5 and 6). Results showed an impact on bacterial communities because of the CO2 treatment. Changes in respiring activity, community composition groups and diversity were found. This study highlights the use of respiring bacteria activity not only as bioindicator for environmental risk assessment and monitoring purposes but also as a bioindicador during a CO2 leakage event or CO2 enrichment process among all the responses studied. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial communities; Carbon capture and storage; Contaminants; Respiring activity","Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Impurities; Risk assessment; Bacterial community; Bacterial community composition; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Community composition; Environmental risk assessment; Polluted sediments; Pressurized chambers; Sub-seabed storages; Carbon capture; arsenic; carbon dioxide; chromium; cobalt; copper; iron; lead; zinc; carbon; carbon dioxide; environmental marker; sea water; bacterium; bioindicator; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; community composition; community response; marine sediment; sediment pollution; Article; benthic fauna; carbon storage; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental enrichment; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; pH measurement; population abundance; risk assessment; sea pollution; sediment; species composition; bacterium; carbon sequestration; chemistry; metabolism; microbiology; sediment; water pollutant; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteria; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Environmental Biomarkers; Geologic Sediments; Seawater; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015984259

The main purpose of this large effort is to reduce the effects of greenhouse emission, climate change to head for a sustainable society. In this scenario, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play a key role. From one side, advances in physical and environmental information sensing, communication and processing, enabled the monitoring of energy behaviour of buildings in real-time. The access to this information has been made easy and ubiquitous thank to Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and protocols. From the other side, the creation of digital repositories of buildings and districts (i.e. Building Information Models-BIM) enabled the development of complex and rich energy models that can be used for simulation and prediction purposes. As such, an opportunity is emerging of mixing these two information categories to either create better models and to detect unwanted or inefficient energy behaviours. In this paper, we present a software architecture for management and simulation of energy behaviours in buildings that integrates heterogeneous data such as BIM, IoT, GIS (Geographical Information System) and meteorological services. This integration allows: I) (near-) real-time visualisation of energy consumption information in the building context and ii) building performance evaluation through energy modelling and simulation exploiting data from the field and real weather conditions.

Context: Land degradation and deforestation of natural forests are serious issues worldwide, potentially leading to altered land use and carbon storage capacity. Aims: Our objectives were to investigate if short-rotation plantations can restore carbon pools of degraded soils, without altering soil fertility. Methods: Carbon and nutrient pools in above- and below-ground biomass and soils were assessed using stand inventories, harvested biomass values, allometric relationships and selective sampling for chemical analyses. Results: Carbon pools in the total ecosystem were low in the degraded land and in croplands (6–13 Mg ha−1) and high in forests (66–94 in eucalyptus plantations; 86–126 in native forests). The soil nutrient status of eucalyptus stands was intermediate between degraded land and native forests and increased over time after eucalyptus introduction. All harvest scenarios for eucalyptus are likely to impoverish the soil but, for the moment, the soil nutrient status has not been affected. Conclusion: Afforestation of degraded land with eucalyptus can be a useful restoration tool relative to carbon storage and soil fertility, provided that non-intensive forestry is applied. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.","Afforestation; Carbon pools; Cork oak; Eucalyptus; Soil nutrients","afforestation; angiosperm; carbon sequestration; deciduous tree; deforestation; forest inventory; land degradation; phytomass; semiarid region; soil fertility; soil nutrient; water supply; Morocco; Eucalyptus; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026774423

With support from the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia and others, countries have started to include climate change as a key consideration in their national public health policies. Further efforts are needed to develop evidence-based responses; garner the necessary support from partner ministries; and access funding for activities related to health and climate change. National action plans for climate change generally identify health as one of their priorities; however, limited information is available on implementation processes, including which ministries and departments would be involved; the time frame; stakeholder responsibilities; and how the projects would be financed. While progress is being made, efforts are needed to increase the capacity of health systems to manage the health risks of climate change in South-East Asia, if population health is to be protected and strengthened while addressing changing weather and climate patterns.

In Canada, four provinces in particular, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, worked with each other and U.S. states, and engaged at the international level, when choosing policy instruments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. How did inter-jurisdictional dynamics influence the instruments these provinces selected and has there been convergence in their policy responses? The article finds that policy transfer, information sharing, and emulation among jurisdictions, was more likely to overcome competitiveness concerns and lead to policy adoption when it was driven by technical learning or the desire to conform to external norms, than when jurisdictions compared themselves to others or attempted to influence broader policies through political benchmarking and bandwagoning. Despite continued variation in some areas, there has been limited convergence on some provincial instruments. © The Author 2017.

Applied to Delhi, India, the analysis demonstrates that city-scale action can rival typical food policy interventions that occur at larger scales, although no single city-scale action can rival in all three environmental impacts. In particular, improved food-waste management within the city (7% system-wide GHG reduction) matches the GHG impact of preconsumer trans-boundary food waste reduction. The systems approach is particularly useful in illustrating key trade-offs and co-benefits. For instance, multiple diet shifts that can reduce GHG emissions have trade-offs that increase water and land impacts. Vertical farming technology (VFT) with current applications for fruits and vegetables can provide modest system-wide water (4%) and land reductions (3%), although implementation within the city itself may raise questions of constraints in water-stressed cities, with such a shift in Delhi increasing community-wide direct water use by 16%. Improving the nutrition status for the bottom 50% of the population to the median diet is accompanied by proportionally smaller increases of water, GHG, and land impacts (4%, 9%, and 8%, systemwide): increases that can be offset through simultaneous city-scale actions, e.g., improved food-waste management and VFT. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Commerce; Economic and social effects; Greenhouse gases; Nutrition; Waste management; Delhi , India; Food policies; Fruits and vegetables; GHG emission; GHG reductions; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Systems approach; Trans-boundary; Environmental impact; water; water; action plan; emission; environmental impact; food policy; food waste; future prospect; greenhouse gas; methodology; nutritional status; solid waste; urban area; waste management; agricultural land; Article; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; food industry; food processing; food security; food waste; greenhouse gas; human; India; nutritional status; plant biotechnology; social class; urban area; vegetable; vertical farming technology; waste management; catering service; city; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; water supply; Delhi; India; Cities; Food Supply; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; India; Water; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031819005

The balance between Fe(III) reduction, methanogenesis, and CH4 oxidation in ferruginous Archean and Paleoproterozoic oceans would have controlled CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, thereby regulating the capacity for CH4 to warm the early Earth under the Faint Young Sun. We studied CH4 and Fe cycling in anoxic incubations of ferruginous sediment from the ancient ocean analogue Lake Matano, Indonesia, over three successive transfers (500 days in total). Iron reduction, methanogenesis, CH4 oxidation, and microbial taxonomy were monitored in treatments amended with ferrihydrite or goethite. After three dilutions, Fe(III) reduction persisted only in bottles with ferrihydrite. Enhanced CH4 production was observed in the presence of goethite, highlighting the potential for reactive Fe(III) oxides to inhibit methanogenesis. Supplementing the media with hydrogen, nickel and selenium did not stimulate methanogenesis. There was limited evidence for Fe(III)-dependent CH4 oxidation, although some incubations displayed CH4-stimulated Fe(III) reduction. 16S rRNA profiles continuously changed over the course of enrichment, with ultimate dominance of unclassified members of the order Desulfuromonadales in all treatments. Microbial diversity decreased markedly over the course of incubation, with subtle differences between ferrihydrite and goethite amendments. These results suggest that Fe(III) oxide mineralogy and availability of electron donors could have led to spatial separation of Fe(III)-reducing and methanogenic microbial communities in ferruginous marine sediments, potentially explaining the persistence of CH4 as a greenhouse gas throughout the first half of Earth history. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"Archean; bacterium; ferrihydrite; flux measurement; iron; marine sediment; methane; methanogenesis; microbial activity; microbial community; oxidation; Proterozoic; reduction; sediment chemistry; Greater Sunda Islands; Lake Matano; Malili Lakes; South Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Desulfuromonadales; ferric ion; iron; methane; RNA 16S; bacterium; biosynthesis; Indonesia; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; sediment; Bacteria; Ferric Compounds; Geologic Sediments; Indonesia; Iron; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017567567

In this paper we unify a two-box climate model, which allows for heat and moisture transport from the southern region to the northern region, with an economic model of welfare optimization. Our main contribution is to show that by ignoring spatial heat and moisture transport and the resulting polar amplification, the regulator may overestimate or underestimate the tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The direction of bias depends on the relations between marginal damages from temperature increase in each region. We also determine the welfare cost when a regulator mistakenly ignores polar amplification. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results, while ballpark estimates indicate that the tax bias could be as high as 20%, while welfare cost could reach 2% of global effective steady-state consumption. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Emission taxes; Market discount rate; Optimal policy; Polar amplification; Spatial heat and moisture transport","albedo; climate change; climate modeling; emissions trading; environmental policy; environmental tax; heat transfer; moisture transfer; optimization; polar region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032165564

Content analysis of 102 documents from four major REDD+ initiatives intervening in DRC, sought to understand how civil conflict is being integrated into the discourse on REDD+ and its implication for climate change mitigation. Results showed that discussion of how conflict and political instability might impact REDD+ outcomes was limited. Concrete approaches to address the reality of civil conflict were not evident. Governance reform was, however, an important emphasis of REDD+ in DRC. Since REDD+, peace-building and development initiatives are often funded by the same institutions, it is important to begin a dialogue as to how they can be more intentional in harmonizing approaches in conflict-affected, forest-rich countries like DRC. Finding synergies has the potential to improve overall outcomes for the global climate, the forest, and the lives of local people. © 2017 by the author.

HFCs are not ozone-depleting but have large global warming potentials and are, therefore, reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Here, we use four independent inverse models to estimate European emissions of the two HFCs contributing the most to global warming (HFC-134a and HFC-125) and of SF6 for the year 2011. Using an ensemble of inverse models offers the possibility to better understand systematic uncertainties in inversions. All systems relied on the same measurement time series from Jungfraujoch (Switzerland), Mace Head (Ireland), and Monte Cimone (Italy) and the same a priori estimates of the emissions, but differed in terms of the Lagrangian transport model (FLEXPART, NAME), inversion method (Bayesian, extended Kalman filter), treatment of baseline mole fractions, spatial gridding, and a priori uncertainties. The model systems were compared with respect to the ability to reproduce the measurement time series, the spatial distribution of the posterior emissions, uncertainty reductions, and total emissions estimated for selected countries. All systems were able to reproduce the measurement time series very well, with prior correlations between 0.5 and 0.9 and posterior correlations being higher by 0.05 to 0.1. For HFC-125, all models estimated higher emissions from Spain + Portugal than reported to UNFCCC (median higher by 390 %) though with a large scatter between individual estimates. Estimates for Germany (+140 %) and Ireland (+850 %) were also considerably higher than UNFCCC, whereas the estimates for France and the UK were consistent with the national reports. In contrast to HFC-125, HFC-134a emissions from Spain + Portugal were broadly consistent with UNFCCC, and emissions from Germany were only 30 % higher. The data suggest that the UK over-reports its HFC-134a emissions to UNFCCC, as the model median emission was significantly lower, by 50 %. An overestimation of both HFC-125 and HFC-134a emissions by about a factor of 2 was also found for a group of eastern European countries (Czech Republic + Poland + Slovakia), though with less confidence since the measurement network has a low sensitivity to these countries. Consistent with UNFCCC, the models identified Germany as the highest national emitter of SF6 in Europe, and the model median emission was only 1 % lower than the UNFCCC numbers. In contrast, the model median emissions were 2-3 times higher than UNFCCC numbers for Italy, France, and Spain + Portugal. The country-aggregated emissions from the different models often did not overlap within the range of the analytical uncertainties formally given by the inversion systems, suggesting that parametric and structural uncertainties are often dominant in the overall a posteriori uncertainty. The current European network of three routine monitoring sites for synthetic greenhouse gases has the potential to identify significant shortcomings in nationally reported emissions, but a denser network would be needed for more reliable monitoring of country-wide emissions of these important greenhouse gases across Europe. © 2017 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; comparative study; data inversion; emission inventory; estimation method; hydrofluorocarbon; modeling; spatial distribution; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Apennines; Bern [Switzerland]; Connacht; County Galway; Emilia-Romagna; Europe; Ireland; Italy; Jungfraujoch; Mace Head; Modena; Mount Cimone; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029473054

The obstacles are numerous with the main issues being well known although not all having clear solutions. The case of collectively owned properties (COP) is probably one of the more difficult challenges. The existing laws and financial assistance are not sufficient to overcome all the barriers to improving the energy use performance of COP. As such, ‘actors’ coaches’ become indispensable at the local level to accompany COP wishing to undergo an energy retrofit. The major outcome of the paper is the development of evaluation mechanisms of the coaching process. The paper analyzes the arrangement of specific stakeholders acting at the local level as “coaches” or “facilitators” for the co-owners, their associations and their trustees, through technical and financial support.

Models indicate that warm-season precipitation will increase during the early spring wet season but shift north earlier in the season, intensifying late summer drying. Regional climate models (RCMs) project larger precipitation changes than their global climate model (GCM) counterparts. This is particularly true during the dry season. The credibility of the RCM projections is established by exploring the larger-scale dynamical and local land-atmosphere feedback processes that drive future changes in the simulations, that is, the responsible mechanisms or processes. In this case, it is found that out of 12 RCM simulations produced for the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), the majority are mechanistically credible and consistent in the mean changes they are producing in the SGP. Both larger-scale dynamical processes and local land-atmosphere feedbacks drive an earlier end to the spring wet period and deepening of the summer dry season in the SGP. The midlatitude upper-level jet shifts northward, the monsoon anticyclone expands, and the Great Plains low-level jet increases in strength, all supporting a poleward shift in precipitation in the future. This dynamically forced shift causes land-atmosphere coupling to strengthen earlier in the summer, which in turn leads to earlier evaporation of soil moisture in the summer, resulting in extreme drying later in the summer. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Anticyclones; Atmosphere-land interaction; Climate change; Jets; Precipitation; Regional models","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Drought; Electric power system interconnection; Fighter aircraft; Jets; Landforms; Precipitation (chemical); Soil moisture; Anticyclones; Atmosphere-land interactions; Land-atmosphere couplings; Regional climate changes; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate models; Regional model; Warm season precipitation; Climate change; air-soil interaction; anticyclone; climate change; climate modeling; jet; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); soil moisture; Great Plains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029762012

Understanding the climate influences on these outbreaks is essential for developing management plans that account for potential future mountain pine beetle outbreaks, among other threats, and informing listing decisions under the Endangered Species Act. Prior research has focused on one geographic region, but geographic variability in beetle and tree physiological responses to climate conditions have been documented. Here we evaluate geographic variability in climate influences on recent beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine and estimate future climate suitability for outbreaks across much of the range of whitebark pine in the western US. To accomplish these objectives, we developed and analyzed statistical models for three different geographic regions as well as a Westwide model, then applied the Westwide model to a suite of climate projections. The general patterns of climate-tree mortality relationships were similar across the three regions of our study. However, the relative importance of individual climate metrics preceding and during the recent outbreaks varied geographically because of the different climates in the regions. Winter minimum temperatures appeared to be limiting prior to outbreaks in the colder regions. All regions experienced low summer precipitation prior to or during outbreak initiation. Future climate suitability for beetle outbreaks is estimated to increase or remain stable in the coldest regions and decline slightly in the warmest region by the end of this century. Across the study area, projections of higher winter temperatures and decreased summer precipitation (with lower confidence than for temperatures) contribute to increased climate suitability for outbreaks, while projected higher fall/spring/summer temperatures contribute to decreased suitability. Some regional variability exists; in particular, the effect of winter warming is muted in the warmest region (Cascades) where winter temperatures appear to be less limiting. However, all regions are projected to experience fewer years with very low suitability, which commonly occurred prior to the recent outbreaks and may have limited beetle populations. Given the inherent uncertainty in climate projections and ecological responses to novel climates, management plans that incorporate sites that are expected to experience a range of expected future climate conditions might increase the chances of whitebark pine persistence in a warmer future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate suitability; Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae); Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis)","Climate change; Conservation; Forestry; Landforms; Physiological models; Climate suitability; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Endangered Species Act; Geographic variability; Physiological response; Pinus albicaulis; Regional variability; Summer precipitation; Climate models; beetle; climate conditions; coniferous tree; ecosystem response; forest management; geographical variation; mortality; numerical model; persistence; physiological response; warming; Climates; Insects; Pinus Albicaulis; Pinus Mugo; Cascade Range; United States; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Pinus albicaulis; Pinus mugo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019700094

We find that increased gas pressure over the range 4-16 Pa significantly reduces the beam current rise-time and significantly increases the emission current amplitude. For example, at a discharge current of 20 A, increasing the working gas pressure from 4 Pa to 16 Pa increases the emission current from 8 A to 18 A and shortens the beam rise-time from 50 μs to 20 μs. This influence of gas pressure on the electron beam parameters can be explained by the effect of arc discharge current switching from the anode to emission. In our case, the current switching effect is caused by increased working gas pressure. In the forevacuum pressure range, the increase of the electron emission current with the growth of gas pressure is due to a rise in the emission plasma potential which is caused by ion back-streaming from the plasma formed in the electron beam transport region. A model describing the influence of gas pressure on the electron emission from the plasma is presented. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electron beams; Electron sources; Electrons; Gases; Pressure effects; Electron beam emission; Electron beam transport; Electron emission currents; Electron-beam parameters; Emission parameters; Experimental investigations; Plasma electron sources; Working gas pressure; Electron emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028554394

Appropriate design strategies, developed a priori and then experimentally validated according to suitable test protocols on a prototype, are needed in order to reach potential energy saving targets. These strategies can successfully be implemented in the food service sector, where cooking appliances, in particular, present many possibilities for improving energy savings. Therefore, a valuable design methodology should take into account not only steady state operating conditions but also the transient behaviours of the device, which must be described by means of specially developed theoretical dynamic models. The operating profile of an oven, for example, consists of a sequence of unsteady phases (cavity heating-up, food introduction and extraction, switching from one cooking mode to another) interspersed with steady cooking phases. The dynamic model presented in this paper defines the energy conservation equations of a professional oven, where a high temperature thermal source positioned inside its cavity produces thermal power radiated and modulated over time, according to a suitable control strategy. In particular, when the temperature in the cooking zone of the cavity has reached a specified set point, this is thermostatically controlled in time, depending on the cooking phase. The resulting equation system is then solved by means of numerical methods. With this code, it is possible to support the design phase of both the structure and the control strategy of the oven. It permits, for example, to get a general understanding of the best possible configurations and combinations of insulation materials for the cavity walls or, with reference to the control strategy, to simulate different cooking procedures, with the aim of optimizing the operating sequence of the oven, reaching the maximum energy saving without reducing the cooking quality. The code, validated by comparison with a set of experimental data obtained with a current production model, will be applied in the design phase of a new line of high efficiency professional ovens. © 2017 The Author(s).","Lumped capacitance method; professional oven","Climate change; Computer aided software engineering; Cooking; Dynamic models; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Numerical methods; Ovens; Potential energy; Professional aspects; Quality control; Appropriate designs; Efficiency improvement; Energy conservation equations; Insulation materials; Lumped capacitance methods; Operating sequences; Reducing energy consumption; Steady-state operating conditions; Thermal processing (foods)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030726100

While most of the current literature on the subject deals with specific regions, this book analyses the impacts of climate change across the Caribbean, the Pacific Ocean, and the African and Indian Ocean regions in order to identify and tackle the real issues faced by all the small island States. As the global effects of climate change become increasingly evident and urgent, it is clear that the impact on small islands is going to be particularly severe. These island countries are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels, hurricanes and cyclones, frequent droughts, and the disruption of agriculture, fisheries and vital ecosystems. On many small islands, the migration of vulnerable communities to higher ground has already begun. Food security is an increasingly pressing issue. Hundreds of thousands of islanders are at risk. Marine ecosystems are threatened by acidification and higher seawater temperatures leading to increased pressure on fisheries-still an important source of food for many island communities. The small island developing States emit only small amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Yet many SIDS governments are allocating scarce financial and human resources in an effort to further reduce their emissions. This is a mistake. Rather than focus on mitigation (i.e., the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) Climate Change Adaptation in Small Island Developing States concentrates on adaptation. The author assesses the immediate and future impacts of climate change on small islands, and identifies a range of proven, cost-effective adaptation strategies. The book: Focuses on the challenges of climate change faced by all of the world's small island developing States; Provides comprehensive coverage of the latest research into the most likely environment impacts; Uses numerous case studies to describe proven, practical, and cost-effective policies, including disaster management strategies-which can be developed and implemented by the SIDS; Takes a unique, multidisciplinary approach, making it of particular interest to specialists in a variety of disciplines, including both earth sciences and life sciences. This book is a valuable resource for all professionals and students studying climate change and its impacts. It is also essential reading for government officials and the ministries of the 51 small island developing States, as well as the signatories to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AFP 464, which has a unique mechanism of action by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway, decreased tumor size, and growth rate in the estrogen dependent, Tamoxifen-sensitive spontaneous M05 mouse model. Considering that AhR has recently emerged as a physiological regulator of the innate and adaptive immune responses, we investigated whether AFP 464 modulates the immune response in our mouse model. Studies on the effect of AFP 464 on the immune system were carried in BALB/c mice bearing M05 semi-differentiated mammary adenocarcinomas that express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Splenic cells and tumor inflammatory infiltrates were studied by cytometric analyses. The modulation of splenocytes cytotoxic activity by AFP 464 was also evaluated. We further investigated the effects of AFP 464 on peritoneal macrophages by evaluating metalloproteinase, arginase, and iNOS activities. We found that AFP 464 increased splenic cytotoxic activity, diminished the number of systemic and local Treg lymphocytes, and MDSCs, and induced a M1 phenotype in peritoneal macrophages of M05 tumor bearing mice. Therefore, we conclude that AFP 464 modulates immune response which collaborates with its anti-tumor activity. Our results place the immune system as a novel target for this anti-cancer agent to strengthen the rationale for its inclusion in breast cancer treatment regimens. J. Cell.

Through the study of the implementation of state-led adaptation and mitigation projects in two rural localities of northern Colombia, we interrogate the ways in which these interventions shape the everyday lives of those who happen to be located in the targeted areas. We found that, in spite of the different goals and particular configurations of the adaptation and mitigation interventions, these climate projects engendered the same contradiction. They promised a resilient and environmentally sound future, but the path towards that future has not been available to everyone. Furthermore, we show that the subjects of climate interventions do not embrace state promises in the same way. Local expectations, desires and engagement with the state are ambivalent and heterogeneous, and cannot be taken as a given. This paper develops these ideas by way of three arguments. First, we argue that exclusion, dispossession and marginality are inherent to the promises of climate mitigation and adaptation in the cases we study in the Colombian Caribbean. Secondly, the goals of state-led adaptation and mitigation programs we study are at odds with the material and social conditions of the areas of implementation. And thirdly, paying attention to the dynamics of state formation in the Colombian Caribbean in relation to climate change challenges common binaries opposing state absence/presence, failure/success, and retreat/return. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate crisis; Colombia; Dispossession; Mitigation; State formation","adaptive management; climate change; environmental politics; mitigation; rural area; state role; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017390930

Critical to this opportunity is the requirement for inexpensive catalysts based on earth-abundant metals instead of precious metals. We report a nickel-gallium complex featuring a Ni(0)→ Ga(III) bond that shows remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenating CO2 to formate at ambient temperature (3150 turnovers, turnover frequency = 9700 h-1), compared with prior homogeneous Ni-centered catalysts. The Lewis acidic Ga(III) ion plays a pivotal role in stabilizing catalytic intermediates, including a rare anionic d10 Ni hydride. Structural and in situ characterization of this reactive intermediate support a terminal Ni-H moiety, for which the thermodynamic hydride donor strength rivals those of precious metal hydrides.

While known to influence soil carbon (C) cycling, it remains unresolved if altered rainfall patterns induced by climate change will stimulate positive feedbacks of CO2 into the atmosphere. Using a meta-analysis frame-work including 1495 observations from 60 studies encompassing a variety of ecosystems and soil types, we investigated drought effects on respiration rates, cumulative respiration during drying-rewetting cycles, metabolic quotient (qCO2), dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass and fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratios from laboratory and field experiments. We show that C-rich soils (&gt;2% organic carbon) increase CO2 release into the atmosphere after intense droughts, but that C-poor soils show a net decline in C losses. We explain this self-reinforcing mechanism of climate change in C-rich soils by: (i) high substrate availability that magnify bursts of CO2 release after drought events and (ii) a shift in microbial community with increased loss of C per unit of biomass. These findings shed light on important responses of soil CO2 emissions to drought, which could either offset or facilitate positive feedbacks to global warming. Our results should be considered in global climate models, as even small changes in soil CO2 emission have large repercussions for global warming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dry-rewetting cycles; F:B ratio; Metabolic quotient; Microbial community; Soil organic matter; Soil respiration","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Drought; Ecology; Ecosystems; Global warming; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Organic carbon; Soils; Metabolic quotient; Microbial communities; Re-wetting; Soil organic matters; Soil respiration; Climate change; bacterium; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon flux; climate change; climate feedback; community dynamics; dissolved organic carbon; drought; fungus; global warming; meta-analysis; microbial community; nutrient loss; rainfall; soil carbon; soil emission; soil microorganism; soil respiration; substrate; wetting-drying cycle; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019075124

Understanding growth of urban trees exposed to air pollution will support planning, managing and expanding urban areas. This approach intends to determine growth patterns of urban trees to support future urban planning. Non-destructive samples were collected from trees of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze in Araucaria city, Parana State, Brazil. Growth rings were related to pollutant concentrations and meteorological series. Growth reduction was observed except in the border areas of the city. Trees established during or after the period of industrialization incentives were most affected by air pollution, indicating that immature plants are more vulnerable. Sulphur dioxide and nitric oxide significantly affected growth of smaller trees. Those greater than 60 cm dbh did not demonstrate significant correlation with any identified pollutant. As the trees established before accentuated urbanization were less affected by air pollution, it is reinforced the importance of preserving remaining urban trees. We suggest that planning urban afforestation should precede industries placing. When urban planning is impossible, new planted trees should not be expected to grow as in free pollution areas, but they will still present satisfactory diameter increment, contributing to improve local urban environment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Araucaria angustifolia; Dendrochronology; Tree life cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016434801

The global cement production has risen sharply in the past decades due largely to urbanization and construction. Here we deployed a top-down dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) model to quantify the historical development of cement in-use stocks in residential, nonresidential, and civil engineering sectors of all world countries. We found that global cement production spreads unevenly among 184 countries, with China dominating the global production and consumption after the 1990s. Nearly all countries have shown an increasing trend of per capita cement in-use stock in the past century. The present per capita cement in-use stocks vary from 10 to 40 tonnes in major industrialized and transiting countries and are below 10 tonnes in developing countries. Evolutionary modes identified from historical patterns suggest that per capita in-use cement stock growth generally complies with an S-shape curve and relates closely to affluence and urbanization of a country, but more in-depth and bottom-up investigations are needed to better understand socioeconomic drivers behind stock growth. These identified in-use stock patterns can help us better estimate future demand of cement, explore strategies for emissions reduction in the cement industry, and inform CO2 uptake potentials of cement based products and infrastructure in service. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Cements; Developing countries; Emission control; Cement and concretes; Cement production; Cement-based; Dynamic materials; Emissions reduction; Engineering sectors; Global production; Historical development; Cement industry; carbon dioxide; cement; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; cement; concrete; construction industry; consumption behavior; economic history; industrial development; industrial production; material flow analysis; socioeconomic conditions; top-down approach; urbanization; Article; cement industry; China; city; developing country; urbanization; developing country; industry; urbanization; China; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Developing Countries; Industry; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030665889

Measurements of SO2 content with automatic analysers were used as a criterion to asssess the air quality. Rovinari and Turceni areas were chosen for this study due to the fact that there are located two thermal power plants considered high stationary sources with an important contribution to regional and global pollution by sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust. Sustainable development of fossil fuel power plants cannot be done without the use of technology to limit or eliminate environmental pollution. Studies regarding determination of SO2 content in the monitored areas were performed from January to December 2014. By interpreting the results obtained it can be concluded that the concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the ambient air are below the limit value set in legislation. This is mainly due to the developing of the programs for the progressive reduction of annual emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust which was set up by operators of thermal power plants in order to comply with emission limit values. The high level of SO2 concentration in cold season is attributed to intensifying the burning of fossil fuels for household activities.","Air pollutants monitoring; SO2 air content; Thermal power plant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033214452

These traits allow plants to show high carbon assimilation capacity. However, under encroachment, reduced light availability may act as a filter on traits of plants established under typical savanna conditions. Here we studied morpho-physiological traits of species exclusively found in typical and forested savanna conditions to evaluate how encroachment selects for specific leaf traits in such environments. We also evaluated if species occurring in distinct encroached situations would show plasticity to deal with light variations. We studied two species exclusively found in typical savanna (TS, open condition), two species exclusively found in forested savanna (FS, encroached condition) and two species growing along a gradient of tree encroachment (typical, dense and forested savanna). We measured specific leaf area (SLA), maximum photosynthetic rate in an area basis (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs), water use efficiency (WUE), leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations. We found that herbaceous species exclusively found in TS possess higher Amax, gs, WUE and C in comparison with plants from forested savanna. Such strategies are necessary to thrive under environments with elevated irradiances. In turn, species from FS showed elevated SLA and foliar N concentration, strategies linked to capture diffuse light in forested environments. Species capable of thriving in sites with distinct degrees of encroachment changed their leaf traits according with light availability. We conclude that differences in leaf traits between typical and forested savanna species may explain the non-occurrence of typical savanna species when their environment become encroached. Only those species capable of showing a certain degree of plasticity may survive under such distinct encroached states. © 2017, Brazilian Society of Plant Physiology.","Cerrado; Encroachment; Photosynthesis; Specific leaf area",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029579262

However, up to a point, all of them embrace the uncontroversial view that tells us that anthropic factors have leverage on global climate. It happens that the so-called greenhouse effect is closely related to the accumulation of certain gases in the atmosphere, e.g., carbon dioxide, whose original source comes from productive sectors. Thus, our purpose in this article is to estimate the rate of emission intensity - here we mean the ratio between CO2 emissions and GDP - which has increased since the early part of the 20th century. To support that idea, this study reports on data from 24 different countries. In terms of C02 emission, the results undoubtedly show that United Kingdom and the United States highlight a negative picture, particularly when both are compared to India. It should be noted the presence of structural changes, which coincide with three major historical events: the World War I (1914-1918), the Great Depression in the 1930s, and finally the Oil-price shocks in the 1970s. As the result of the analysis demonstrates, the amount of emission produced by developing countries is surprisingly low. That the technology reveals its relative merit for reducing the overall emission intensity is transparently obvious.","Carbon dioxide; Emission intensity; Global warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040565533

This approach covers three steps. In the first step, typical buildings and their properties are determined by analysing the residential buildings in Istanbul, and then the retrofit alternatives are generated. In the second step, an economic impact analysis is performed for typical buildings by considering the costs during their life cycle phases. In the third step, a life cycle cost assessment is done according to the variables, which are defined as window-to-wall ratio (WWR), window system, thermal insulation material, orientation and building age. The most beneficial retrofits are lastly determined depending on their economic performance ratios (EPRs). In conclusion, insulating exterior wall, projected floors, floors above unheated space and roof floors separately provide the highest benefits at the age of 30, and the lowest benefits occur at the age of 15 for all WWRs. The highest EPRs are obtained for the WWR of 10% at all ages. The renewal with PVC frame provides benefit while the renewal with wooden frame causes losses. Orientation slightly affects the EPRs. The use of stone wool in the retrofit causes a reduction in the EPRs due to high investment cost of stone wool. When the 20-year-old building which has the WWR of 10% is insulated with extruded polystyrene and renewed with PVC, it provides the highest benefit of about 45%. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Economic performance assessment; LCC; Renewal; Residential building; Retrofit","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Floors; Housing; Life cycle; Retrofitting; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Wool; Yarn; Economic performance; Extruded polystyrenes; Investment costs; Renewal; Residential building; Retrofit; Thermal insulation materials; Window-to-wall ratio; Buildings; building; economic analysis; economic impact; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008440709

Eddy covariance (EC) technique provides continuous measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and can be used to separate GPP from NEE in real time series. However, seasonal and inter-annual variation and consequently ecosystem carbon budget is still very difficult to simulate from climatic and environment. To address this limitation, we develop a growing season indicator (GSI) based on low temperature and soil water stress to model and predict intra and inter-annual dynamic of gross primary productivity (GPP). Validation of this new index was conducted using continuous six-year consective EC measurement from 2004 to 2009 at a Tibetan alpine meadow. Simulated GPP agreed well with the observed GPP in terms of seasonal and inter-annual variation. The six-year correlation coefficients on seasonal scale between GSI and scalar GPP derived from EC reached more than 0.85 no matter in dry years or wet years. In addition, the temporal GPP estimation derived from GSI model was quite similar to those from observed values by EC measurement. Moreover, accumulated GSI values can predict annual variability of net ecosystem production (NEP). Higher yearly accumulated GSI corresponded to more annual NEP. When cumulative GSI arrived up to 92, the target ecosystem was a carbon sink. This is probably a threshold which Tibetan alpine meadow changes from carbon source to carbon sink. It is indicated that the GSI model is a simple, alternative approach to estimating GPP and has the potential to simulate spatial GPP in a larger scale. However, the performance of GSI model in other vegetation types or regions still needs a further verification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alpine meadow; Eddy covariance; Gross primary production; Growing season index; Tibetan Plateau","Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Ecosystems; Electric conductivity measurement; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Plants (botany); Soil moisture; Temperature; Alpine meadow; Eddy covariance; Gross primary production; Growing season; Tibetan Plateau; Budget control; alpine environment; annual variation; carbon budget; carbon sink; eddy covariance; growing season; index method; meadow; net ecosystem exchange; primary production; seasonal variation; soil water; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation type; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020657357

Previous studies observed health effects linked to this solid-fuel use in several Navajo communities. Emission factors (EFs) for common fuels used by the Navajo have not been reported using a relevant stove type. In this study, two softwoods (ponderosa pine and Utah juniper) and two high-volatile bituminous coals (Black Mesa and Fruitland) were tested with an in-use residential conventional wood stove (homestove) using a modified American Society for Testing and Materials/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (ASTM/EPA) protocol. Filter sampling quantified PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) and organic (OC) and elemental (EC) carbon in the emissions. Real-time monitoring quantified carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and total suspended particles (TSP). EFs for these air pollutants were developed and normalized to both fuel mass and energy consumed. In general, coal had significantly higher mass EFs than wood for all pollutants studied. In particular, coal emitted, on average, 10 times more PM2.5 than wood on a mass basis, and 2.4 times more on an energy basis. The EFs developed here were based on fuel types, stove design, and operating protocols relevant to the Navajo Nation, but they could be useful to other Native Nations with similar practices, such as the nearby Hopi Nation. Implications: Indoor wood and coal combustion is an important contributor to public health burdens in the Navajo Nation. Currently, there exist no emission factors representative of Navajo homestoves, fuels, and practices. This study developed emission factors for PM2.5, OC, EC, CO, and CO2 using a representative Navajo homestove. These emission factors may be utilized in regional-, national-, and global-scale health and environmental models. Additionally, the protocols developed and results presented here may inform on-going stove design of the first EPA-certified wood and coal combination stove. © 2017 A&WMA.",,"Bituminous coal; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuels; Health; Housing; Materials testing; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Pollution; Softwoods; Stoves; Aerodynamic diameters; American society for testing and materials; Environmental model; Fine particulate matter; Organic and elemental carbon; Real time monitoring; Residential heating; Total suspended particles; Coal combustion; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; coal; elemental carbon; fuel; organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; Article; carbon balance; combustion; heating; human; Juniperus; moisture; particle size; particulate matter; pollutant; ponderosa pine; priority journal; residential area; wood; air pollutant; American Indian; analysis; environmental monitoring; heating; household; housing; particulate matter; pine; Utah; Air Pollutants; American Native Continental Ancestry Group; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Household Articles; Housing; Humans; Juniperus; Particulate Matter; Pinus; Utah; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025679299

Using data from field observations, 86 interviews, and 13 focus group discussions from five municipalities, the research finds that cross-scale activities, including local plans and multi-stakeholder forums, and municipal budgeting processes, influence adaptation and mitigation to climate change in smallholder farming systems. Furthermore, using matrix analysis and stakeholder responses, we identify interactions, synergies, conflicts, and potential co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation, and food production practices. The analysis of climate-resiliency field school practices shows that the addition of livelihood outcomes to smallholder farming landscapes strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and food production outcomes (and vice versa). Climate-resiliency Field Schools have promoted the practice of organic farming, various systems for rice intensification, and the establishment of community seed banks. Other practices, such as soil conservation, reforestation, and agroforestry, have been used in Mindanao to maintain carbon stocks while increasing crop production. Climate-resiliency Field Schools serve as a multilevel institutional platform where farmers can access climate information, which they can use to improve farm planning (i.e., choices of crops, timing of farm preparation, and harvest). The research findings suggest that climate-smart interventions are highly location-specific, technically rigorous, involve knowledge-intensive processes, and are influenced by the knowledge and capacities of local farming communities and implementing partners. We conclude with some suggestions for the design of programs, and the types of interventions that are required to sustain and ultimately scale up efforts to enhance climate-smart agriculture. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","adaptation; agriculture; Climate-resiliency Field Schools; climate-smart agriculture; mitigation; smallholder farmers","adaptive management; alternative agriculture; climate change; crop production; farming system; livelihood; smallholder; Mindanao; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019953014

The projected results show that Malaysia needs to reduce its total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by 11 and 31% to achieve its unconditional (35% of GHG emission intensity) and conditional (45% of GHG emission intensity) INDC targets, respectively, by 2030. Malaysia is able to achieve these targets if policy and initiatives are diligently followed. Currently, Malaysia has achieved some success in promoting installation capacity of renewable energy yet the deployment of LCTs is still limited. Among these technologies, within the energy sectors, biomass and solar PV seems to be viable but technology deployment in order to provide sufficient renewable energy mix has been slow. The efforts so far seem to be fragmented and less coordinated with multiple institutional settings and poor policy coordination. Indeed, clear targets need to be established in the INDC including the sectorial targets. The low-carbon technological focus is missing in various policies, especially those with regard to industrial technologies. Take-up rate in the industrial sectors as well as in the consumer markets are still limited, the reasons being slow technological shifting, low tariff rates due to subsidization of energy, high capital and technology cost, lack of financing channels as well as limited policy and institutional coordination. It is crucial that Malaysia removes these constraints if it intends to achieve its INDC targets as proposed in the mitigation plan. Globalization of LCTs is crucial in meeting the targets of INDC. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043672651

Many countries are paying substantial attention to carbon emissions to improve air quality and public health. The largest source of carbon emissions from human activities in some countries in Europe and elsewhere is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation. The prices of fuel and carbon emissions can influence each other. Owing to the importance of carbon emissions and their connection to fossil fuels, and the possibility of [1] Granger (1980) causality in spot and futures prices, returns, and volatility of carbon emissions, crude oil and coal have recently become very important research topics. For the USA, daily spot and futures prices are available for crude oil and coal, but there are no daily futures prices for carbon emissions. For the European Union (EU), there are no daily spot prices for coal or carbon emissions, but there are daily futures prices for crude oil, coal and carbon emissions. For this reason, daily prices will be used to analyse Granger causality and volatility spillovers in spot and futures prices of carbon emissions, crude oil, and coal. As the estimators are based on quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) under the incorrect assumption of a normal distribution, we modify the likelihood ratio (LR) test to a quasi-likelihood ratio test (QLR) to test the multivariate conditional volatility Diagonal BEKK model, which estimates and tests volatility spillovers, and has valid regularity conditions and asymptotic properties, against the alternative Full BEKK model, which also estimates volatility spillovers, but has valid regularity conditions and asymptotic properties only under the null hypothesis of zero off-diagonal elements. Dynamic hedging strategies by using optimal hedge ratios are suggested to analyse market fluctuations in the spot and futures returns and volatility of carbon emissions, crude oil, and coal prices. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Coal; Crude oil; Diagonal BEKK; Dynamic hedging; Fossil fuels; Full BEKK; Granger causality; Green energy; Low carbon targets; Quasi likelihood ratio (QLR) test; Spot and futures prices; Volatility spillovers","air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; coal; crude oil; emission control; environmental economics; European Union; fossil fuel; future prospect; Granger causality test; greenhouse gas; human activity; oil spill; price dynamics; volatilization; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030479747

In this paper, we examine the spot price dynamics, asymmetric clustering and regime-switching behaviors of CO2 emissions allowances in the new China-wide emissions trading scheme (CETS) pilots using AR-GARCH, AR-TARCH and MRS-AR-GARCH models. The regional ETS pilots’ design in China vary widely in their coverage thresholds, sector coverage, emissions allocation and caps setting methods, market trading rules and price stabilization provisions. Our empirical results indicate that the spot prices of regional emissions allowances exhibit significant dynamic behaviors, asymmetric leverage effects and regime-switching behaviors in the entire period considered; previous market overreactions in the Beijing, Tianjin and Guangdong pilots have stronger price clustering effects on future conditional variances than do the Shanghai and Hubei pilots. Unexpected market shocks and greater persistence in the Beijing, Tianjin and Guangdong ETS pilots display stronger market volatility and higher market risks, and their asymmetric leverage effects display a decreasing trend in the volatility of the BEA, TJEA and GDEA prices. The BEA and SHEA prices exhibit significant regime-switching behaviors, price jumps and higher volatility; in addition, the changes in the regime-switching phases are often related to the political mechanism design and the fundamental market factors. Those empirical results are beneficial for government decision-makers and market participants to strengthen risk management strategies, support emission-related investment decisions and optimize co-benefits of alternative energy-environmental policies. © 2017","Asymmetry effect; China's emissions trading scheme; Emissions allowances; GARCH model; Price dynamics; Regime-switching process","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decision making; Dynamics; Economics; Environmental protection; Investments; Machine design; Risk management; Switching; Asymmetry effect; Emissions Trading Scheme; GARCH models; Price dynamics; Regime-switching process; Commerce; carbon emission; decision making; emissions trading; empirical analysis; energy policy; environmental economics; environmental policy; modeling; price dynamics; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hubei; Shanghai; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032973348

Health co-benefits represent selected near term, positive consequences of climate policies that can offset mitigation costs in the short term before the beneficial impacts of those policies on the magnitude of climate change are evident. The diversity of approaches to modeling mitigation options and their health effects inhibits meta-analyses and syntheses of results useful in policy-making. Methods/Design: We evaluated the range of methods and choices in modeling health co-benefits of climate mitigation to identify opportunities for increased consistency and collaboration that could better inform policy-making. We reviewed studies quantifying the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation related to air quality, transportation, and diet published since the 2009 Lancet Commission 'Managing the health effects of climate change' through January 2017. We documented approaches, methods, scenarios, health-related exposures, and health outcomes. Results/Synthesis: Forty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Air quality, transportation, and diet scenarios ranged from specific policy proposals to hypothetical scenarios, and from global recommendations to stakeholder-informed local guidance. Geographic and temporal scope as well as validity of scenarios determined policy relevance. More recent studies tended to use more sophisticated methods to address complexity in the relevant policy system. Discussion: Most studies indicated significant, nearer term, local ancillary health benefits providing impetus for policy uptake and net cost savings. However, studies were more suited to describing the interaction of climate policy and health and the magnitude of potential outcomes than to providing specific accurate estimates of health co-benefits. Modeling the health co-benefits of climate policy provides policy-relevant information when the scenarios are reasonable, relevant, and thorough, and the model adequately addresses complexity. Greater consistency in selected modeling choices across the health co-benefits of climate mitigation research would facilitate evaluation of mitigation options particularly as they apply to the NDCs and promote policy uptake. © 2017 The Author(s).

It has been demonstrated that, among the endohedral MO4©B20O30 n− clusters with strong multiply charged anions (VO4 3−, CrO4 2−, PO4 3−, SO4 2−, AsO4 3−, SeO4 2−, etc.), the isomer in which a “guest” tetrahedron MO4 is located at the center of the B20O30 cage and bonded to it through internal oxygen bridges M-O*-B is the most favorable one. Among the exohedral analogues MO4 · B20O30 n−, two most favorable isomers contain the “capping” MO4 tetrahedron bonded to the B20O30 cage through two and three external M-O-B bridges. For the complexes with doubly charged SO4 2− and SeO4 2− anions, the third exohedral isomer in which the sulfite or selenite group MO3 is bidentately coordinated to the oxidized B20O29(OO) cage with one peroxide bridge turns out to be close in energy to the above two isomers. For the systems with high negative charge n, the exohedral isomers are much more favorable than the endohedral isomer; however, with decreasing charge, the difference in energy between them decreases to ~10–18 kcal/mol, so that the exo–endo transition between them can require moderate energy inputs. For the endohedral complexes with singly charged ClO4 − and BrO4 − anions, two isomers with close energies are preferable in which the central atoms of the guest tetrahedra are reduced to the state of singly charged ions, while the oxoborate cage is oxidized to B20O26(OO)4 with four peroxide groups B-O-O-B and retains its closed (closo) structure. In the most favorable isomer of the complexes with multicharged ortho-anions BO4 5−, CO4 4−, and NO4 3−, the outersphere anion is reduced to, respectively, borate, carbonate, and nitrate bidentately coordinated to the oxidized B20O29(O)2 cage with an open structure and two strongly elongated terminal B-O bonds.

Because farmers need to quickly adapt to reduce their risks and emissions, there is a pressing need to better understand the process by which they make decisions. This complex decision-making process includes many factors, such as farmers’ beliefs; knowledge and capacity to make changes; the information they receive from Extension, industry, and social networks (e.g., family and peers); economics and regulations; and farm-scale and environmental issues (including personal experience with extreme weather). This study assesses the published literature on U.S. agricultural stakeholder views and decisions on climate change, focusing on farmers and ranchers from different regions. We identify key themes that emerge from the literature on how stakeholder views about extreme weather and climate change relate to decisions about adaptation and mitigation practices. This review finds that although the majority of U.S. farmers believe the climate is changing, many remain skeptical of the issue and uncertain about the anthropogenic causes of climate change. Farmers’ climate change mitigation and adaptation decisions also vary widely and are often correlated with belief or other factors such as personal experience with extreme weather, costs of change, or fear of regulation. We conclude with the implications of the research, including the importance of understanding farmers’ view and actions and issue framing, and implications for researchers, Extension and policy makers, both nationally and globally.

RAP combines, under a unified framework, elements from robust action, participatory planning and network theory to capture the different motives, perception, and roles of actors that are important for climate change adaptation. RAP leverages existing structures and networks and involves diverse actors to plan, sequence and time strategies across multiple levels (i.e. from local to national). Actors identify adaptation interventions and important actor relations to develop wide networks, highlighting potential pathways for connecting action from central policy to local implementation (and vice versa). Comparing these proposed participatory structures with existing structures reveals actors deemed important for delivering adaptation, as well as gaps and overlaps in their relations. The end result is a robust plan covering many perspectives and local realities for both relieving immediate and adapting to longer-term consequences of climate change. We applied the RAP framework in Ghana’s agricultural climate change adaptation regime to demonstrate its usefulness as a means of planning adaptation interventions in a climate-vulnerable, multi-actor and multi-level setting. The application of the RAP framework in this paper highlights how it can: (1) visualise the adaptation space (and its different components), and reduce the complexity of implementing adaptation responses; (2) offer a shared space to actors from all administrative levels to think and create collective narratives for adaptation without demanding explicit consensus and; (3) identify key actors and actions through a collaborative planning process, and allocate responsibility for the smooth delivery of adaptation interventions. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adaptation planning; Agriculture; Climate change; Ghana; Network analysis; Robust action",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027711249

This paper aims to determine the successful implementation of energy and air pollution control policies in Thailand through an investigation of the emissions inventory of on-road transport in BMR, including ozone precursors (CO, NOX, Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) ), greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), acidic substances (SO2 and NH3), and particulate matters (PM2.5, PM10, Black Carbon (BC), Organic Carbon (OC)) during the period from 2007 to 2015, using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS)model based on the country-specific activity data together with the emission factor from the GAINS-Asia database. This study found that the amount of exhaust emissions over the BMR area in the year 2015 (and the trend during the period from 2007 to 2015) is approximately 139 kt of CO (-7.9%), 103 kt of NOX (-4.1%), 19.9 kt of NMVOC (-6.7%), 15 kt of CO2 (+1.6%), 8.6 kt of CH4 (+6.8%), 0.59 kt of N2O (+1.3%), 0.87 kt of SO2 (-25.8%), 1.1 kt of NH3 (+7.8%), 4.9 kt of PM2.5 (-5.5%), 5.1 kt of PM10 (-7.9%), 3.1 kt of BC (-2.5%), and 1.4 kt of OC (-7.7%). The change in emissions in each pollutant is a result of the more stringent control of fuel and engine standards, the shift in the fuel type used, and the effects of controlling some emissions. Light duty car gasoline fuel is identified as a major contributor of CO, NH3, N2O, and NMVOC, whereas trucks are the greatest emitters of NOX, SO2, and particulate matter. This study suggests that the most powerful implementation plan for the continuous, significant reduction of ozone precursor, SO2, and particulate matter emissions is the more stringent enforcement of fuel and vehicle standard levels, especially concerning light duty vehicles. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution control policy; Air quality; GAINS; Mobile source; Urban air pollution","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Motor transportation; Organic carbon; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Quality control; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Volatile organic compounds; Emission inventories; GAINS; Metropolitan regions; Mobile sources; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Particulate matter emissions; Road transport sectors; Urban air pollution; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; metropolitan area; pollution control; pollution policy; road transport; urban pollution; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029841663

By using one of the piloting emission trading schemes (ETS) in Guangdong province as a case study, it is argued that the main features of the piloting experiments, particularly in the climate change domain, are largely different from previous local marketization experiments that dominate the reform period of China. Whereas previous experiments are often characterized as bottom-up or indigenous initiatives with strong patronage relations to the pro-reform politicians at central level, the current piloting programmes are often crafted in a top-down fashion that is often misaligned with local market or corporate interests. Hence, local policy innovations are designed, developed and brokered by the local state officers, in order to bridge this central–local interest gap. As a result, successful implementation of these policy innovations largely depends on local political traditions, bureaucratic culture and perceptions of distinctive development needs. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon Markets; China; Climate Governance; Climate Policy; Emission Trading; Policy Experiments; Policy Innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028524915

A large data archive collected by the Landsat program significantly benefits both the academic community and society. Thermal imagery from Landsat sensors, provided with relatively high spatial resolution, is suitable for monitoring urban thermal environment. Growing use of Landsat data in monitoring urban thermal environment is demonstrated by increasing publications on this subject, especially over the last decade. Urban thermal environment is usually delineated by land surface temperature (LST). However, the quantitative and accurate estimation of LST from Landsat data is still a challenge, especially for urban areas. This paper will discuss the main challenges for urban LST retrieval, including urban surface emissivity, atmospheric correction, radiometric calibration, and validation. In addition, we will discuss general challenges confronting the continuity of quantitative applications of Landsat observations. These challenges arise mainly from the scan line corrector failure of the Landsat 7 ETM + and channel differences among sensors. Based on these investigations, the concerns are to: (1) show general users the limitation and possible uncertainty of the retrieved urban LST from the single thermal channel of Landsat sensors; (2) emphasize efforts which should be done for the quantitative applications of Landsat data; and (3) understand the potential challenges for the continuity of Landsat observation (i.e., thermal infrared) for global change monitoring, while several climate data record programs being in progress. © 2017","Data consistency; Radiometric calibration; Remote sensing; SLC-off; Surface temperature","Application programs; Calibration; Climate change; Land surface temperature; Patient monitoring; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Surface properties; Atmospheric corrections; Data consistency; High spatial resolution; Radiometric calibrations; Scan line correctors; SLC-off; Surface temperatures; Urban thermal environment; Atmospheric temperature; imaging method; Landsat; observational method; radiometric method; remote sensing; sensor; surface temperature; urban area; city; climate; environmental monitoring; remote sensing; satellite imagery; statistics and numerical data; temperature; uncertainty; Cities; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Remote Sensing Technology; Satellite Imagery; Temperature; Uncertainty",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015399452

Two challenges are currently constraining urban planning decisions around decarbonisation. Firstly, a lack of detailed knowledge about city-induced emissions occurring outside of the city boundary hampers the design of mitigation strategies that involves the city's ‘hinterland’. Secondly, the complexity of interconnections between industries and regions located upstream or downstream the supply chain of urban economic activity makes it difficult to implement specific, effective and efficient decarbonisation policies. In this study, a multi-scale, multi-region input–output model with nested regions at city, state, nation and world level is employed to study the carbon footprints and the inter-sectoral linkages in terms of embodied carbon emissions of the two largest metropolitan areas of Australia, Melbourne and Sydney. The results show that imported emissions make up more than 50% of the city carbon footprints, with most of them attributable to goods (excluding food) and services (excluding electricity). This highlights the importance of promoting mitigation measures both within and outside of the city. The energy, mining and agriculture sectors – usually located outside of city boundaries – all have significant carbon linkage multipliers associated with city demand, indicating the need of pursuing carbon mitigation measures in these sectors. The linkage analysis pinpoints to crucial sectors that need to be targeted in future investments towards urban decarbonisation to minimise emissions and to maximise positive economic effects for urban and regional economies. The study also provides an improved understanding of the differences and similarities between Australia's two main cities. It is envisaged that this type of analysis will become increasingly relevant to other cities as the spatial resolution of multi-region input–output databases continues to improve. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Carbon multipliers; Cities; Forward and backward linkages; Multi-region input–output analysis; Urban transformation","Climate change; Decarbonization; Economics; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial economics; Investments; Supply chains; Agriculture sectors; Cities; Climate change impact; Forward-and-backward; Input output analysis; Mitigation measures; Multi-region input-output models; Urban transformation; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975691301

Despite their incomparable advantages over traditional vehicles in emission reduction and energy saving, PEVs impose significant pressure on the existing power systems. Therefore, understanding achievable PEV penetration rate from distribution network capacity perspective is crucial. In this study, first, a mathematical optimization model involving distribution network constraints are formulated and linearized to assess the maximum penetration rate of PEVs. Second, incorporating real-world data revealing the travelling trajectories of traditional taxis in an urban area in China, we evaluate the penetration rate of plug-in electric taxis (PETs) under distribution network constraints. By setting a time filter, we extract the distribution of PET charging demands in the region considered and assign them to the nearest bus for charging. We then apply the model to solve for the maximum percentage of traditional taxis that can be electrified without undermining the distribution network safe operation. © 2017 IEEE.","GPS data; Plug-in electric vehicle; smart grids; transportation electrification","Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Optimization; Smart city; Smart power grids; Vehicles; Charging demands; Emission reduction; GPS data; Mathematical optimization model; Means of transportations; Penetration rates; Smart grid; Transportation electrifications; Plug-in electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039972725

This study aims to investigate the social impacts of dairy farm via a case study using a social life cycle assessment framework. Methods: The assessment was carried out applying the social LCA Guideline by UNEP-SETAC. Nineteen suitable social indicators were selected from four stakeholder categories of the guideline. Characterization and normalization were further developed based on data availability. National farm survey data was used as foreground data for farm activities, supplemented with background data from public database and life cycle working environment (LCWE) data by Gabi database. All indicators were divided into three groups: functional unit-related quantitative indicators, non-functional unit-related quantitative indicators and semi-quantitative indicators. Results and discussion: Irish dairy farming has positive social impacts on value chain actors and society, predominantly positive impacts for local community and generally positive values for workers. The main negative impacts are health and safety issue, equal opportunity for workers, and safe and healthy living conditions for the local community. Possible actions to improve the social performance include introducing more efficient and robotic milk production systems; applying better handling methods and using real time decision support to operational management for emissions reduction. Conclusions: This study is the first attempt of social LCA in Ireland. It demonstrated a possible method to carry out SLCA for Irish dairy sector.

Multiple types of disturbance exist widely across the landscape, and heavily influence carbon cycling in this region. However, a current quantitative assessment of the impact of disturbances on carbon sequestration is largely lacking. In this study, we combined the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS), the Shiyomi grazing model, and the global fire model (Glob-FIRM) to investigate the impact of the two major types of disturbance in the TES (i.e. domestic grazing and fire) on regional carbon sequestration. Model performance was validated using satellite data and field observations. Model outputs indicate that disturbance has a significant impact on carbon sequestration at a regional scale. The annual total carbon lost due to disturbances was 7.8 TgC yr-1, accounting for 14.2% of the total net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Domestic grazing plays the dominant role in terrestrial carbon consumption, accounting for 95% of the total carbon lost from the two disturbances. Carbon losses from both disturbances significantly increased from 1999 to 2008 (R 2 = 0.82, P &lt; 0.001 for grazing, R 2 = 0.51, P &lt; 0.05 for fire). Heavy domestic grazing in relatively barren grasslands substantially reduced carbon sequestration, particularly in the grasslands of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the far southwest of Inner Mongolia.

After carbonization of the walnut shells and acid treatments, zigzag and armchair edges of CQDs with an average size of 3.4 nm were revealed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with the (100) planes of graphitic carbon, the lattice spacing distance of these CQDs was 0.258 nm. The photoluminescence behaviors related to the size/shape and corresponding edge-state. The CQDs exhibited green fluorescence when the excitation wavelength ranging from 360 nm to 460 nm. Meanwhile, the CQDs showed hydrophilic, pH-sensitive and up-converted photoluminescence properties. We also found pH and solvent had reversible effects on CQDs' photoluminescence. The CQDs were then tested with live-cell fluorescent images for the potential intracellular probes. Raman mapping technique was also applied to detect the CQDs' distribution in vitro and clarify the entering procedure of CQDs into cells besides confocal microscopy. © 2017","Carbon quantum dots; Cellulose; Fluorescent properties; Intracellular bioimaging; Walnut shells","Biocompatibility; Carbonization; Cellulose; Fluorescence; Nanocrystals; Photoluminescence; Semiconductor quantum dots; Shells (structures); Bio-imaging; Carbon quantum dots; Excitation wavelength; Fluorescence characteristics; Fluorescent property; Photoluminescence properties; Structural evolution; Walnut shells; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Carbon Fibers; Carbonization; Cellulose; Fluorescence; Transmission Electron Microscopy; carbon; quantum dot; intracellular space; spectrofluorometry; transmission electron microscopy; walnut; Carbon; Intracellular Space; Juglans; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Quantum Dots; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019422978

CWT results suggested that the number of major source regions contributing to GEM, GOM, and reactive mercury (RM 5 GOM 1 PBM) over the eastern United States and southeastern Canada declined over time. Across much of these regions, source contributions in 2011-14 decreased by up to 20% for GEM, by greater than 60% for GOM, and by 20%-60% for PBM compared to 2006-08, largely because of the decreases in power-plant mercury emissions since 2009. Changes in the spatial distribution of the source regions were also observed over time. Increases in source contributions of GEM after 2011 over the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada were predominantly from emission increases in metal and steel production and forest fires. Source contribution increases in PBM were more widespread, which can be attributed potentially to mercury transformation processes in the air or wood combustion rather than industrial sources. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Air quality trends; Airshed modeling; Measurements","Air quality; Deforestation; Emission control; Measurements; Steelmaking; Air quality trends; Atmospheric mercury; Gaseous elemental mercury; Gaseous oxidized mercuries; Industrial sources; Particulate bound mercury; Source contributions; Transformation process; Mercury (metal); air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; combustion; concentration (composition); emission inventory; fuelwood; industrial emission; mercury (element); quantitative analysis; rural atmosphere; source apportionment; speciation (chemistry); Canada; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029084905

However, the sinter strength would be weakened due to the damaged heat pattern at high biomass proportion. In this paper, the gaseous fuel injection method was experimentally investigated with the aim at solving this problem. Eleven cases were arranged to examine the ultra-low concentration of methane combustion and its effect on the improvement of heat pattern at high charcoal proportion. The temperature in the sintering bed was recorded by both thermocouples and infrared thermography. The thermocouple data indicated that the melt quantity index was significantly increased by employing the gaseous fuel injection method. Moreover, the infrared images show that the red-hot region was expanded at each moment in the methane injection cases. The influencing mechanism of gaseous fuel injection on the heat pattern in sintering process was revealed in this paper. As the premixed methane/air approaching to the solid fuel combustion zone, it was preheated by the hot sintered ores, then ignited and self-sustained near the solid fuel combustion zone. A newly generated gaseous fuel combustion zone coupled with the solid fuel combustion zone was used to control the heat pattern in sintering bed. The results showed that the heat pattern and sinter strength kept increasing until the methane concentration increased to 0.4–0.5% under the lab conditions. The stable interval of secondary combustion zone in the sintering bed was also analyzed. Finally, comprehensively considering the sinter strength, yield, productivity and sintering time, the recommended equivalent methane concentration at high charcoal proportion was 0.5% where the shatter strength grew 3.78% and solid fuel rate reduced 7.52%, compared with 100% coke sintering case. Generally, the gaseous fuel injection offers a technical support for the iron ore sinter production using cheap or carbon neutral solid fuel. More importantly, this method can also reduce solid fuels (the main contributor of contamination dust during the production, transportation and storage) consumption by partial substitution of cleaner gaseous fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Charcoal; Fuel concentration; Gaseous fuel injection; Heat pattern; Iron-ore sintering; Secondary combustion zone","Carbon; Charcoal; Coke; Combustion; Digital storage; Fuel injection; Fuel storage; Fuels; Global warming; Infrared imaging; Iron; Iron ore sinter; Iron ores; Methanation; Methane; Ore sintering; Ores; Thermocouples; Fuel concentration; Heat patterns; Influencing mechanisms; Methane concentrations; Partial substitution; Secondary combustion zones; Solid fuel combustion; Ultra low concentration; Sintering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022000926

Located on the downwind side of strong sources of anthropogenic emissions, South Korea bears the full impact of the regional transport of pollutants and their precursors. However, the impact of foreign emissions sources has not yet been fully documented. We utilized two regional air quality simulation systems: (1) a Weather Research and Forecasting and Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) system and (2) a United Kingdom Met Office Unified Model and CMAQ system. The following combinations of emissions inventories are used: the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-Phase B, the Inter-comparison Study for Asia 2010, and the National Institute of Environment Research Clean Air Policy Support System. Partial contributions of domestic and foreign emissions are estimated using a brute force approach, adjusting South Korean emissions to 50%. Results show that foreign emissions contributed ĝ1/4 60% of SMA surface PM concentration in 2014. Estimated contributions display clear seasonal variation, with foreign emissions having a higher impact during the cold season (fall to spring), reaching ĝ1/4 70% in March, and making lower contributions in the summer, ĝ1/4 45% in September. We also found that simulated surface PM concentration is sensitive to meteorology, but estimated contributions are mostly consistent. Regional contributions are also found to be sensitive to the choice of emissions inventories. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; meteorology; metropolitan area; particulate matter; pollutant transport; seasonal variation; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028912006

The aim of this case study was to contemplate sustainability from the perspective of flood resilience that focuses on environmental problems and solutions. The study provided insights into retailers' resilience thinking regarding the flood-prone Shetzu Peninsula in Taipei City. It is of concern that the retailers strategically identified potential flood risks and have developed adaptive knowledge, skills, and networks. The Location Quotient (LQ) analysis was conducted to verify that the retail sector of Shetzu Peninsula was considered a basic industry. Further assessments, an interactive visualization model and a consumption intensity map, were provided as supportive data. Based on the results, semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore 15 key retailers' resilience thinking on how to adapt to floods in terms of risk communication under climate change. This approach is vital to meet the adaptation challenge in the Shetzu Peninsula. As a result, the study indicated that retailers have strategically identified potential weather-related risks and have implemented adaptation plans for each store functions. The study discussed that, in the face of climate change, maladaptation, interactive visualization models for communicating flood risks, and place attachment are key issues to increase flood resilience under climate change. The introduction of adaptation interventions in terms of urban resilience as a part of a comprehensive strategy helps to manage the impacts of climate change towards urban sustainability. © 2017 by the authors.","Flood risk; Location quotient; Place attachment; Semi-structured interview; Visualizationmodel","adaptive management; attitudinal survey; climate change; estuarine environment; flood; hazard management; model; public attitude; retailing; risk; spatial planning; sustainability; urban planning; visualization; Shetzu River; Taipei; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029599248

Reduced environmental impact, higher mileage, lower cost and new technologies are required in order to maintain its global position both in public and private mobility. For a long time, researchers have been investigating the so called Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) that promises a higher efficiency due to a rapid combustion - i.e. closer to the ideal thermodynamic Otto cycle - and therefore more work and lower exhaust gas temperatures. Consequently, a rich mixture to cool down the turbocharger under high load may no longer be needed. As the combustion does not have a distinguished flame front it is able to burn very lean mixtures, with the potential of reducing HC and CO emissions. However, until recently, HCCI was considered to be reasonably applicable only at part load operating conditions. The 3D-CFD engine development tool QuickSim, which has been developed at the FKFS in cooperation with the IVK/University of Stuttgart, is able to simulate the entire flow path of the engine, including both flame propagation and HCCI combustion. In a recent project with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) it was possible to calibrate the parameters of the auto-ignition HCCI model using a highly variable free piston linear generator. This paper addresses the potential of virtual engine development in the creation of a new combustion process for series engines. The described process is called Spark-Assisted Compression Ignition (SACI). It utilizes a pre-chamber spark plug to initialize and control the following auto-ignition. This prevents accidental combustion and also ensures an auto-ignition that is less dependent on the environment and transient conditions, while maintaining the efficiency and emission advantages of a conventional HCCI combustion (auto-ignition of the air-fuel mixture merely regulated by local thermodynamic variables in the combustion chamber).

In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as AlternateWetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions (~70%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22% to 55%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration. © 2017 by the authors.","Cassava leaves; Forage; Greenhouse gases; Livestock; Rice","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural production; cassava; decision making; forage; greenhouse gas; livestock; paradigm shift; rice; smallholder; sustainability; water management; Colombia; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032335100

However, private landowners will supply less carbon sequestration than would be socially desirable if they are unable to capture the economic value of sequestration. We examine the viability of offering landowners property tax subsidies for forest carbon sequestration (referred to as a 'tax-based subsidy approach'). Waiving property taxes on forestland provides incentives for landowners to afforest non-forested land and/or sustain forests that are at risk of deforestation. We focus on 17 Tennessee counties and one Kentucky county, constituting one of 179 Bureau of Economic Analysis areas in the United States, as a case study. Higher forestland net return from waiving property taxes increases the share of forestland in the 18 counties, which in turn increases the accumulation of carbon in the forest ecosystem, suggesting that this is a viable approach. The annualized county-level cost of supplying forest carbon sequestration using a tax-based subsidy ranges between US$15.56 and US$563.58 per carbon tonne across the 18 counties. Relevant government agencies can use these estimates to target selected counties for more cost-effective adoption of the county-level tax-based subsidy approach. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2017.","Forest carbon sequestration; Incentive payment; Tax-based subsidy","Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Deforestation; Economic analysis; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Taxation; Bureau of Economic Analysis; Carbon sequestration; Forest carbon sequestration; Global climate changes; Government agencies; Incentive payments; Private landowners; tax-based subsidy; Forestry; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; deforestation; forest ecosystem; forest edge; global climate; greenhouse gas; landowner; property market; risk assessment; subsidy system; tax incentive; Kentucky; Tennessee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015105236

Despite the efforts, however, recent studies suggest that some land use strategies such as densification and mixed-use development may result in slower vehicle movements, and consequently generate more driving emissions. Since vehicle miles of travel (VMT) is only a proxy and not an exact measure of emissions, reduction in VMT may not lead to a proportional reduction in transportation GHG emissions. Aside from local land use efforts, regional factors also influence vehicle travel and associated emissions. This study investigates the relationship between land use, vehicle travel, and driving emissions in the selected U.S. metropolitan areas at multiple geographic levels. The study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to examine how land use influences vehicle travel characteristics and associated emissions. The main data sources for the analyses include the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) add-on samples and the Smart Location Database (SLD) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The study results show that VMT reduction and the associated environmental benefit do not show a one-on-one relationship due to the emissions penalty of lowered vehicle operating speed. Vehicle travel and associated emissions are not only influenced by local urban form factors but also affected by the greater geographical context. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","driving emissions; Land use; NHTS Add-on; SEM; Smart Location Database; VMT","carbon emission; database; emission control; greenhouse gas; land use change; metropolitan area; scanning electron microscopy; traffic emission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032218062

We have developed and tested the MOSAICA-f framework to build innovative multi-functional agricultural landscapes that can consider explicitly: 1) the performance of cropping systems at the field scale, 2) farmers' decision processes on the adoption of cropping systems, and 3) possible scenarios for innovations and policy changes at the regional scale. This framework is based on a scenario approach that encompasses normative, exploratory and optimized scenarios to assess the relevance of combinations of new agricultural policies, changes to the external context (market and regulations) and innovations in cropping systems. The impacts of these changes on sustainability issues are simulated using the regional bioeconomic model MOSAICA for farmers' decision processes regarding the adoption of cropping systems at the field scale throughout a region. Applied in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), the MOSAICA-f framework enabled the design of a scenario increasing agricultural added value, food and energy self-sufficiency, employment and the quality of water bodies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This sustainable scenario combines new cropping systems tuned to farm types with a reorientation of subsidies, an increased workforce and banning food crop production on polluted soils. It can be used to understand the potential contribution of agriculture to sustainability issues and to help local decision makers define policies that will account for the spatial diversities of farms and fields in a landscape. Beyond the design of such a win-win scenario, MOSAICA-f has revealed trade-offs in the provision of services by agriculture. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cropping system mosaics; Ecosystem services; Farming system design; Land use change; Scenarios","agri-environmental policy; agricultural land; crop production; cropping practice; decision making; ecosystem service; farmers attitude; farming system; greenhouse gas; innovation; land use change; scenario analysis; sustainability; trade-off; Guadeloupe; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001560516

High resolution imaging experiments were carried out in a field emission microscope with a specialty imaging anode screen such that electron emission micrographs were taken concurrently with measurements of I-V characteristics. An automated image processing algorithm was applied to process the extensive imaging data sets and calculate the emission area per image. It was routinely found that field emission from as-grown planar (N)UNCD films was always confined to a counted number of discrete emitting centers across the surface, which varied in size and electron emissivity. It was established that the actual field emission area critically depends on the applied electric field and that the field emission area and overall electron emissivity improve with the sp2-fraction present in the film, irrespective of the original substrate roughness or morphology. Most importantly, when as-measured I-E characteristics were normalized by the electric field-dependent emission area, the resulting j-E curves demonstrated a strong kink and departed from the Fowler-Nordheim law, finally saturating at a value on the order of 100 mA/cm2. This value was nearly identical for all studied films regardless of substrate. It was concluded that the saturation value is specific to the intrinsic fundamental properties of (N)UNCD. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","automated image processing; CVD synthetic diamond; emission area; field emission; field emission microscopy; ultrananocrystalline diamond","Diamond films; Diamonds; Electric fields; Electromagnetic wave emission; Electrons; Field emission; Field emission microscopes; Image processing; Synthetic diamonds; Automated image processing; Emission area; Emission characteristics; Field emission microscopy; Fundamental properties; High-resolution imaging; Ultra-nanocrystalline diamond; Ultra-nanocrystalline diamond films; Electron emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030253212

The rapidly expanding human population has led to a shortage of resources and the ability to support the growing population sustainably is a major challenge for the future. Coastal environments, including natural seaweed communities, provide a range of important ecosystem services. Since seaweed aquaculture beds (SABs) provide many of the services associated with natural seaweed communities they have a potential role in providing solutions such as CO2 sequestration, provision of food and the supply of useful chemicals. However, the productivity of natural seaweed communities and SABs is under threat from the rapid changes in climate that the planet is experiencing. Here we examine the likely effects of global change, in particular elevated CO2 and ocean acidification, increased temperatures and elevated levels of UVB, on the performance of seaweeds. While it is clear that rising temperatures and elevated CO2 and their interactions with other environmental factors are likely to have profound effects on macroalgal production, such effects are likely to be species dependent. We also examine the fate of organic matter from seaweeds and the potential for using SAB productivity as a contributor to blue carbon as a strategy for amelioration of increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. There is considerable potential for increased drawdown of CO2 by SABs, though its effectiveness in amelioration of atmospheric CO2 increase will depend on the fate of the resulting biomass. © 2017 British Phycological Society.","aquaculture; blue carbon; climate change; primary productivity; seaweed aquaculture beds; seaweeds","anthropogenic effect; aquaculture system; carbon sequestration; climate change; coastal zone; ecosystem service; environmental factor; global change; human activity; macroalga; ocean acidification; primary production; seaweed culture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031123900

In order to achieve sustainable shipping, primarily through new regulations and techniques, greater knowledge of dispersion and deposition of air pollutants is required. Regional model calculations of the dispersion and concentration of sulfur, nitrogen, and particulate matter, as well as deposition of oxidized sulfur and nitrogen from the international maritime sector in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, have been made for the years 2011 to 2013. The contribution from shipping is highest along shipping lanes and near large ports for concentration and dry deposition. Sulfur is the most important pollutant coupled to shipping. The contribution of both SO2 concentration and dry deposition of sulfur represented up to 80% of the total in some regions. WHO guidelines for annual concentrations were not trespassed for any analysed pollutant, other than PM2.5 in the Netherlands, Belgium, and central Poland. However, due to the resolution of the numerical model, 50 km×50 km, there may be higher concentrations locally close to intense shipping lanes.Wet deposition is more spread and less sensitive to model resolution. The contribution of wet deposition of sulfur and nitrogen from shipping was up to 30% of the total wet deposition. Comparison of simulated to measured concentration at two coastal stations close to shipping lanes showed some underestimations and missed maximums, probably due to resolution of the model and underestimated ship emissions. A change in regulation for maximum sulfur content in maritime fuel, in 2015 from 1 to 0.1 %, decreases the atmospheric sulfur concentration and deposition significantly. However, due to costs related to refining, the cleaning of exhausts through scrubbers has become a possible economic solution. Open-loop scrubbers meet the air quality criteria but their consequences for the marine environment are largely unknown. The resulting potential of future acidification in the Baltic Sea, both from atmospheric deposition and from scrubber water along the shipping lanes, based on different assumptions about sulfur content in fuel, scrubber usage, and increased shipping density has been assessed. The increase in deposition for different shipping and scrubber scenarios differs for the basins in the Baltic Sea, with highest potential of acidification in the southern basins with high traffic. The proportion of ocean-acidifying sulfur from ships increases when taking scrubber water into account and the major reason for increasing acidifying nitrogen from ships is increasing ship traffic. Also, with the implementation of emission control for nitrogen, the effect of scrubbers on acidification is evident. This study also generates a database of shipping and scrubber scenarios for atmospheric deposition and scrubber exhaust from the period 2011 to 2050. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Acidification; Air cleaners; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Emission control; Marine pollution; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Pollution; Scrubbers; Ships; Sulfur; Water pollution; Waterway transportation; Atmospheric depositions; Economic solutions; Marine environment; Model resolution; Oxidized sulfurs; Particulate Matter; Quality criteria; Sulfur concentrations; Air pollution; acidification; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dry deposition; emission control; regulatory approach; shipping; sustainability; traffic emission; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Belgium; Kalmar [Sweden]; Netherlands; North Sea; Oland; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031729759

It provides valuable insights into the growing emergence of knowledge-based industries of the Asia Pacific, and highlights research on: modes of creativity and innovation; intellectual property; the components of national innovation systems such as firms, education and training; knowledge and technical infrastructure; and public policy. The Asia Pacific region is currently in the process of transforming from being the manufacturing centre of the global economy to a centre of innovation for the knowledge economy, with the successful IPO of Alibaba in 2014 being a prime example of this shift. From a neo-Schumpeterian perspective, the region is increasingly engaged in shortening and intensifying cycles of innovation. The historic agreement at the Beijing APEC meeting between China and the US to radically reduce carbon emissions indicates that one imperative of this innovation is to contribute to sustainability. The fact that the US Government is moving away from this historic commitment, while the Chinese Government is endorsing the commitment, indicates an emerging opportunity for Asia to lead the world technologically in a vital industrial sector of the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

Sampling was conducted between February 2009 and February 2010 in Pinal County, AZ near the town of Casa Grande where PM concentrations routinely exceed the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for both PM10 and PM2.5. In this desert region, exceedances of the PM10 NAAQS are dominated by high coarse particle concentrations, a common occurrence in this region of the United States. This work expands on previously published measurements of PM mass and chemistry by examining the sources of fine and coarse particles and the relative contribution of each to ambient PM mass concentrations using the Positive Matrix Factorization receptor model (Clements et al., 2014). Coarse particles within the region were apportioned to nine sources including primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs - 25%), crustal material (20%), re-entrained road dust (11%), feedlot (11% at the site closest to a cattle feedlot), secondary particles (10%), boron-rich crustal material (9%), and transported soil (6%), with minor contributions from ammonium nitrate, and salt (considered to be NaCl). Fine particles within the region were apportioned to six sources including motor vehicles (37%), road dust (29%), lead-rich (10%), with minor contributions from brake wear, crustal material, and salt. These results can help guide local air pollution improvement strategies designed to reduce levels of PM to below the NAAQS. © 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Coarse particles; Crustal material; Desert aerosols; Feedlot; Positive matrix factorization; Primary biological aerosol particles; Road dust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015686359

These people now face a changing climate and associated societal responses. We use mapping and a literature review to juxtapose the climate fate of smallholder systems with that of other agricultural systems and population groups. Limited direct evidence contrasts climate impact risk in smallholder agricultural systems versus other farming systems, but proxy evidence suggests high smallholder vulnerability. Smallholders distinctively adapt to climate shocks and stressors. Their future adaptive capacity is uncertain and conditional upon the severity of climate change and socioeconomic changes from regional development. Smallholders present a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation paradox. They emit a small amount of CO2 per capita and are poor, making GHG regulation unwarranted. But they produce GHG-intensive food and emit disproportionate quantities of black carbon through traditional biomass energy. Effectively accounting for smallholders in mitigation and adaption policies is critical and will require innovative solutions to the transaction costs that enrolling smallholders often imposes. Together, our findings show smallholder farming systems to be a critical fulcrum between climate change and sustainable development. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

Nutrient reduction (via carbon addition) and seed bank depletion are two approaches to reduce competition from exotic annuals but to be effective these treatments must allow establishment of species such as native grasses. This experiment was conducted in two degraded Austrostipa understoreys in the box gum woodlands of south-east Australia. It compares the effects of carbon addition (sugar), seed depletion (spring burning or spring grazing) and combinations of carbon addition and seed depletion treatments on the establishment of C3 and C4 native grasses, and measured the effects of their establishment on soil nitrate concentration and exotic annuals. Treatments that reduced exotic annual abundance did not increase initial germination of the C4 native grasses, Bothriochloa or Themeda. However, sugar increased seedling survival of Themeda and Bothriochloa and grazing increased seedling survival of Bothriochloa, presumably by reducing effects of exotic annuals. Poa and Rytidosperma (C3 native grasses) failed to establish. Although we were unable to detect any reduction in soil nitrate concentration, swards with successful recruitment of C4 grasses suppressed exotic annuals more than the Austrostipa-only swards at one site (the other was affected by wildfire). Further, Austrostipa-Themeda swards were more effective than Austrostipa-Bothriochloa for suppressing exotics, pointing to a role for both functional and species identity in the degree of resistance conferred. © 2017 Ecological Society of Australia","Austrostipa; exotic annuals; grassland; native grass; soil nitrate; woodland","ammonium nitrate; C3 plant; C4 plant; grass; introduced species; native species; new species; plant community; recruitment (population dynamics); restoration ecology; seed bank; soil nitrogen; survival; sward; woodland; Australia; Austrostipa; Bothriochloa; Poa; Poaceae; Rytidosperma; Themeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013907782

The main objective of the experiment is to assess the efficiency of air pollutant emissions mitigation measures in improving regional-scale air quality. <br><br> The present paper formulates the main scientific questions and policy issues being addressed by the EURODELTA-Trends modelling experiment with an emphasis on how the design and technical features of the modelling experiment answer these questions. <br><br> The experiment is designed in three tiers, with increasing degrees of computational demand in order to facilitate the participation of as many modelling teams as possible. The basic experiment consists of simulations for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. Sensitivity analysis for the same three years using various combinations of (i) anthropogenic emissions, (ii) chemical boundary conditions, and (iii) meteorology complements it. The most demanding tier consists of two complete time series from 1990 to 2010, simulated using either time-varying emissions for corresponding years or constant emissions.<br><br> Eight chemistry-transport models have contributed with calculation results to at least one experiment tier, and five models have -to date -completed the full set of simulations (and 21-year trend calculations have been performed by four models). The modelling results are publicly available for further use by the scientific community. <br><br> The main expected outcomes are (i) an evaluation of the models' performances for the three reference years, (ii) an evaluation of the skill of the models in capturing observed air pollution trends for the 1990-2010 time period, (iii) attribution analyses of the respective role of driving factors (e.g. emissions, boundary conditions, meteorology), (iv) a dataset based on a multi-model approach, to provide more robust model results for use in impact studies related to human health, ecosystem, and radiative forcing. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; experimental study; hindcasting; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; time series analysis; trend analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028818500

Feedbacks are calculated for RCP8.5 and abrupt4xCO2 experiments as well as for interannual and decadal variability from pre-industrial runs. Regressions across models are used to elicit relationships across experiments/timescales. Feedbacks between RCP8.5 and abrupt4xCO2 experiments show strong relationships, as expected from surface temperature response similarities arising from the two experiments. The analysis also reveals significant relationships between RCP8.5 and decadal and interannual lapse rate feedback, decadal water vapour and interannual total cloud—the latter confirming results elsewhere. To reveal the impact of warming pattern differences, ‘synthetic’ feedbacks are also generated, based on RCP8.5, whereby local feedbacks determined from that experiment are scaled by relative temperature changes (per degree of global warming) from the others. The synthetic feedbacks indicate that the (sometimes strongly) differing temperature response patterns themselves should not preclude strong correlations between variability and climate change feedbacks—indeed such correlations would be close if local feedbacks were a robust feature of the climate. Although such close correlations are not manifest, the synthetic feedbacks predict the interannual and decadal feedbacks to some extent (are correlated across models), and reveal the consistency, to a first approximation, of the mean model strength of variability feedbacks. Although cloud feedbacks at interannual timescales are correlated with those from RCP8.5, and show consistency with the strength of synthetic feedbacks, separate long and short wave components reveal very different, compensating, latitudinal patterns, suggesting the close correlation may be fortuitous. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate feedbacks; Climate sensitivity; Climate variability; Feedback","climate change; climate feedback; climate modeling; climate variation; cloud radiative forcing; correlation; longwave radiation; radiative forcing; research work; sensitivity analysis; shortwave radiation; temperature profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994761694

Lycopersicon, sect. Lycopersicoides and sect. Juglandifolia) constitute a recently derived clade inhabiting a wide range of habitats across latitudinal and altitudinal axes in South America, with important variation in plant morpho-physiological traits. It is not clear to what extent growth capacity and related traits depend on phylogenetic constraints, or are driven by each species’ adaptation to the climate of origin. The use of wild tomatoes to improve the adaptation of the domesticated species to variable environmental conditions requires knowledge on which wild species are most suitable for growth capacity improvement. Under common garden conditions, results show that the relative growth rate (RGR) in the tomatoes is better determined by its physiological (net assimilation rate, NAR) rather than morphological (leaf area ratio, LAR) component. Moreover, RGR is correlated with the climate of origin in arid and semi-arid habitat species, and display different biomass allocation strategies depending on the climate, particularly related to the green and senescent leaf fractions. When grown under the same conditions, the domesticated tomato showed important differences in leaf size and leaf mass per area (LMA) as compared to its wild relatives, suggesting modifications related to the domestication process. Several semi-arid species appear as suitable species to improve the domesticated tomato growth capacity under more arid cultivation conditions, as those predicted by climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass allocation; Leaf area ratio; Leaf fractions; Net assimilation rate; Relative growth rate; Solanum sect.

When El Niño events happen, the rising air over the central Pacific can bring low surface concentrations of CH4 over the ocean into midtroposphere, resulting in a reduction of midtropospheric CH4 over the region. On the contrary, the rising air over the western Pacific brings low surface CH4 to the midtroposphere during the La Nina events, which leads to negative midtropospheric CH4 anomalies over the western Pacific. In the horizontal direction, there are stronger southward winds during El Niño than La Niña months in the region of the western Pacific Ocean. The stronger southward winds during El Niño can enhance the transport of high-concentration CH4 from the Northern Hemisphere to the tropical western Pacific region and contribute to the positive CH4 anomalies over the region. The difference of midtropospheric CH4 can reach +15 ppb (−15 ppb) over the western (central) Pacific between El Niño and La Niña events. The noteworthy difference of CH4 has a significant correlation to the Southern Oscillation Index with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. The change in the transports associated with the ENSO event is an important factor for CH4 anomalies in the middle troposphere.

Despite the resulting degradation of forest structure, selectively logged forests still harbor a substantial amount of biodiversity leading to suggestions that their protection is the next best alternative to conserving primary, old-growth forests. Restoring carbon stocks under Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes is a potential method for obtaining funding to protect logged forests, via enrichment planting and liberation cutting of vines. This study investigates the impacts of restoring logged forests in Borneo on avian phylogenetic diversity, the total evolutionary history shared across all species within a community, and on functional diversity, with important implications for the protection of evolutionarily unique species and the provision of many ecosystem services. Overall and understorey avifaunal communities were studied using point count and mist netting surveys, respectively. Restoration caused a significant loss in phylogenetic diversity and MPD (mean pairwise distance) leaving an overall bird community of less total evolutionary history and more closely related species compared to unlogged forests, while the understorey bird community had MNTD (mean nearest taxon distance) that returned toward the lower levels found in a primary forest, indicating more closely related species pairs. The overall bird community experienced a significant loss of functional strategies and species with more specialized traits in restored forests compared to that of unlogged forests, which led to functional clustering in the community. Restoration also led to a reduction in functional richness and thus niches occupied in the understorey bird community compared to unlogged forests. While there are additional benefits of restoration for forest regeneration, carbon sequestration, future timber harvests, and potentially reduced threat of forest conversion, this must be weighed against the apparent loss of phylogenetic and functional diversity from unlogged forest levels, making the biodiversity-friendliness of carbon sequestration schemes questionable under future REDD+ agreements. To reduce perverse biodiversity outcomes, it is important to focus restoration only on the most degraded areas or at reduced intensity where breaks between regimes are incorporated. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","biodiversity; birds; Liana cutting; payments for ecosystem services; REDD+; restoration; selective logging; silviculture; Southeast Asia; sustainable forest management","bird; carbon sequestration; clearcutting; community response; ecosystem service; emission control; forest management; phylogenetics; restoration ecology; selective logging; silviculture; sustainable development; tropical forest; vine; Southeast Asia; Aves; animal; biodiversity; bird; Borneo; environmental protection; forestry; Malaysia; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Borneo; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028586717

In order to better understand cloud glaciation, cloud spectrometer observations are presented in this paper, which were made in the mixed-phase temperature regime between 0 and -38°C (273 to 235K), where cloud particles can either be frozen or liquid. The extensive data set covers four airborne field campaigns providing a total of 139000 1Hz data points (38.6h within clouds) over Arctic, midlatitude and tropical regions. We develop algorithms, combining the information on number concentration, size and asphericity of the observed cloud particles to classify four cloud types: liquid clouds, clouds in which liquid droplets and ice crystals coexist, fully glaciated clouds after the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process and clouds where secondary ice formation occurred. We quantify the occurrence of these cloud groups depending on the geographical region and temperature and find that liquid clouds dominate our measurements during the Arctic spring, while clouds dominated by the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process are most common in midlatitude spring. The coexistence of liquid water and ice crystals is found over the whole mixed-phase temperature range in tropical convective towers in the dry season. Secondary ice is found at midlatitudes at -5 to -10°C (268 to 263K) and at higher altitudes, i.e. lower temperatures in the tropics. The distribution of the cloud types with decreasing temperature is shown to be consistent with the theory of evolution of mixed-phase clouds. With this study, we aim to contribute to a large statistical database on cloud types in the mixed-phase temperature regime. © 2017 Author(s).",,"air temperature; climate prediction; cloud cover; glaciation; ice; temperature effect; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026373560

However, urban energy systems are complex, involving supply-demand interconnections, interaction of whole system level with various stakeholders (e.g. end-users, centralised suppliers) and regulation effects of policy instruments. The potential roles of integrated DSM and DG for the climate change mitigation under the urban energy system context haven been yet well understood. Our research aims to advance the understanding of such promising urban energy solutions and generate new insights via modelling framework development. In this study, an optimisation model is developed to simulate the combined effects of DSM and DG strategies in the optimal design of urban energy systems, and investigate the trade-offs between environmental and economic targets. The results of our case study on a hypothetical urban area suggest that the effects of just DSM on climate change mitigation are relatively low whereas urban system would benefit significantly from the introduction of more carbon efficient and economically competitive DG technologies. The set of Pareto optimal solutions derived from the model provide insights into the trade-offs between conflicting GHG and economic objectives: the environmentally optimal solutions with up to 39-43% of the GHG reduction are derived at the expenses of a cost increase by 73-87%; relatively cost efficient systems with marginal increase in economic profiles (4-5%) but significant GHG reductions (32-33%) are achievable. This study demonstrates the insights such model could provide for the decision-making and paradigm shifts towards sustainable urban energy systems and smart operational strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","demand side management; distributed generation; urban energy systems",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041393978

However, the magnitude of vegetation cooling and sensitivity to mesoclimate and meteorology are uncertain. To improve understanding of the variation in vegetation's influence on urban microclimates we asked: how do meso- and regional-scale drivers influence the magnitude and timing of vegetation-based moderation on summertime air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) and heat index (HI) across dryland cities? To answer this question we deployed a network of 180 temperature sensors in summer 2015 over 30 high- and 30 low-vegetated plots in three cities across a coastal to inland to desert climate gradient in southern California, USA. In a followup study, we deployed a network of temperature and humidity sensors in the inland city. We found negative Ta and HI and positive RH correlations with vegetation intensity. Furthermore, vegetation effects were highest in evening hours, increasing across the climate gradient, with reductions in Ta and increases in RH in low-vegetated plots. Vegetation increased temporal variability of Ta, which corresponds with increased nighttime cooling. Increasing mean Ta was associated with higher spatial variation in Ta in coastal cities and lower variation in inland and desert cities, suggesting a climate dependent switch in vegetation sensitivity. These results show that urban vegetation increases spatiotemporal patterns of microclimate with greater cooling in warmer environments and during nighttime hours. Understanding urban microclimate variation will help city planners identify potential risk reductions associated with vegetation and develop effective strategies ameliorating urban microclimate. © 2017","Air temperature; Ecosystem heterogeneity; Land use; Relative humidity; Urban heat island; Urbanization","air temperature; coastal zone; cooling; desert; heat island; heterogeneity; land use change; microclimate; relative humidity; spatial variation; urbanization; air temperature; Article; climate; coastal plain; cooling; desert climate; environmental temperature; follow up; humidity; meteorology; microclimate; remote sensing; risk reduction; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; vegetation; California; city; desert climate; California; United States; California; Cities; Climate; Desert Climate; Meteorology; Microclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020045515

Detailed information about the various parameters that affect the profitability of biomethane is given, and several case studies are analyzed as a function of two variables: subsidies and selling price. The results support the commercialization of small-scale plants, reducing also several environmental issues. The role of subsidies is strategic, and the profitability is verified only in some case studies. © 2017 by the authors.","Biomethane; Economic analysis; Subsidies; Sustainability; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036585294

Accordingly, occupant heating behaviors and associated social-psychological factors are essential elements in understanding energy consumption. This study presents a new investigation on the demographic factors, building characteristics, and social-psychological motivations influencing current heating patterns and future heating intentions among 904 residents in the HSCW zone in China. Most residents surveyed selected the city-scale central-heating system as their future heating pattern, which might lead to a high level of energy consumption. Among demographics, family income was the main factor influencing residents’ current heating patterns, followed by number of children and building age. Additionally, thermal comfort was one of the most frequent motivations for adopting specific heating patterns in our sample. Although residents were generally concerned about the environmental impacts of energy use, they could have been unaware that their current and future heating patterns could cause high levels of energy consumption. This study provides multifaceted insight in occupant research by investigating the link among occupant heating patterns, climate zone, and behavioral motivations, which should be considered by building designers, policymakers, engineers, and energy educators. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Heating; Hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) zone; Occupant behavior; Residential energy usage","Energy policy; Environmental impact; Heating; Housing; Motivation; Population statistics; Building characteristics; Central heating system; Hot summer and cold winter zones; Hot summer and cold winters; Occupant behavior; Residential energy; Residential energy consumption; Social economic factors; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029726486

To shape infrastructure systems in a sustainable and equitable manner, knowledge about the sources and demands of the resources they convey is necessary, as well as the technologies which ensure their efficient use and safe return to the environment. This paper undertakes a basic urban metabolism assessment to examine resource consumption in the City of Cape Town. It examines the type and quantity of resources which fuel the city and its people, in order to highlight prospects for the sustainability of Cape Town. Key findings from resource profiles of Cape Town show that annual energy and water consumption, which are feared to be approaching system limits, have actually shown decline in consumption since 2007 and 2011 respectively. The key intervention to reduce energy consumption and resultant carbon emissions lies in reducing low-occupancy private car usage, while the key limitations to reducing raw water abstraction through wastewater reuse is the limited ability to store and redistribute it. Comparing maps of resource access to maps of material stocks shows that while the city periphery experiences low resource access, resource stocks are potentially quite dense. The spatial location of resource stock, flow and consumption represents a useful tool for detailed urban planning and service delivery, and is a gap in need of researching. Although flows of food are difficult to track, estimates suggest that 11.6% of the food processed in Cape Town is grown within municipal boundaries and interventions for keeping nutrients in the system should be explored. Examining the flow of people between suburbs over time shows that migration dynamics are entrenching poverty in already high poverty suburbs, as people with economic means are more likely to move to better serviced suburbs than invest in their current ones. This presents a need for the city to invest in these underserviced areas, so as to retain personal investment. Key recommendations for urban and resource planning are the integrated analysis of resource nexuses using system dynamics modelling, as well as integrating departments within the municipality, to enable more holistic intervention strategies. To aid this, research into a baseline examination of differential spatial and temporal flows of resources at suburb level is currently underway. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cape Town; Resource flows; Sustainability; Urban metabolism; Urban planning","carbon emission; energy use; infrastructural development; natural resource; sustainability; sustainable development; urban area; urban planning; Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022185927

A regulation to improve air quality in coastal regions and frequented waterways is the limitation of fuel sulphur content to 0.1% in sulphur emission control areas (SECAs), which has caused a switch from heavy fuel oil (HFO) towards diesel-like marine gas oil (MGO) or marine diesel oil (MDO). The fraction of aromatic organic vapours in the exhaust from a marine engine, operating on HFO and MGO, was investigated by resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (REMPI-TOFMS). MGO with fuel sulphur content (FSC) below 0.1% and HFO with an average FSC of 2.7% denote representative marine fuels inside and outside SECAs, respectively. The obtained emission spectra were combined with data of previous REMPI-TOFMS studies of combustion engines and wood combustion in statistical analyses to derive marker substances for ship emissions inside and outside SECAs. A diagnostic ratio of C2-naphthalenes to methyl-naphthalenes was found to hold for a good discriminator between ship emissions on the one hand and road traffic and wood combustion on the other hand. Furthermore, random REMPI spectra from all emission sources were mixed with different proportions in a simulation to create a model based on partial least square (PLS) regression for the prediction of ship contribution to aromatic organic vapours. We point out that in particular PAHs with higher degree of alkylation are significant markers for primary ship emissions which may support source apportionment studies inside and outside SECAs to assess the benefits of fuel sulphur content regulation on air quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy fuel oil; IVOC; Marine gas oil; PAH; REMPI",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027519936

The study's findings show that eco-efficiency was generally not obvious among the companies during the first two trading periods.

However, owing to the complex behavior of CO2 capture system, such as large inertia, strong coupling among multi-variables, and strict constraints, the conventional PID controllers cannot meet the flexible operation requirement. For this reason, this paper proposes the use of model predictive control to improve the control performance of the CO2 capture system. Subspace identification is firstly utilized to identify a model from input-output data of the CO2 capture system. The power plant flue gas is considered in the modeling as measured disturbance, so that its influence can be quickly removed by the predictive control system. The model predictive controller is then developed on the identified model to regulate the CO2 capture level and re-boiler temperature. To alleviate the effect of unknown disturbances and modeling mismatches, and achieve an offset-free tracking of the capture system, integral action is added by using an augmented state-space model in the controller design. Simulation results on an amine solvent-based post-combustion CO2 capture system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed controller. © 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.","Model Predictive Control; Post-combustion CO2 Capture; Subspace Identification",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032201391

To gain insights into the transcriptional mechanisms controlling carbon storage in Sinorhizobium meliloti, we investigated the global transcriptomic response to the genetic disruption of key genes in PHB synthesis and degradation and in glycogen synthesis. Under both nitrogen-limited and balanced growth conditions, transcriptomic analysis was performed with genetic mutants deficient in PHB synthesis (phbA, phbB, phbAB, and phbC), PHB degradation (bdhA, phaZ, and acsA2), and glycogen synthesis (glgA1). Three distinct genomic regions of the pSymA megaplasmid exhibited altered expression in the wild type and the PHB cycle mutants that was not seen in the glycogen synthesis mutant. An Fnr family transcriptional motif was identified in the upstream regions of a cluster of genes showing similar transcriptional patterns across the mutants. This motif was found at the highest density in the genomic regions with the strongest transcriptional effect, and the presence of this motif upstream of genes in these regions was significantly correlated with decreased transcript abundance. Analysis of the genes in the pSymA regions revealed that they contain a genomic overrepresentation of Fnr family transcription factor-encoding genes. We hypothesize that these loci, containing mostly nitrogen utilization, denitrification, and nitrogen fixation genes, are regulated in response to the intracellular carbon/nitrogen balance. These results indicate a transcriptional regulatory association between intracellular carbon levels (mediated through the functionality of the PHB cycle) and the expression of nitrogen metabolism genes. IMPORTANCE The ability of bacteria to store carbon and energy as intracellular polymers uncouples cell growth and replication from nutrient uptake and provides flexibility in the use of resources as they are available to the cell. The impact of carbon storage on cellular metabolism would be reflected in global transcription patterns. By investigating the transcriptomic effects of genetically disrupting genes involved in the PHB carbon storage cycle, we revealed a relationship between intracellular carbon storage and nitrogen metabolism. This work demonstrates the utility of combining transcriptome sequencing with metabolic pathway mutations for identifying underlying gene regulatory mechanisms. © 2017 D'Alessio et al.","Carbon nitrogen balance; Carbon storage; Glycogen; Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB); RNA-seq; Sinorhizobium meliloti",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039913727

For new snow, the regional-averaged albedo reductions caused by all LAPs in the Arctic, North America, and China are 0.009, 0.012, and 0.077, respectively, of which the albedo reductions caused by black carbon (BC) alone are 0.005, 0.005, and 0.031, corresponding to a positive radiative forcing of 0.06, 0.3, and 3 W m−2. For the same particulate concentrations, the albedo reduction for old melting snow is larger than that of new snow by a factor of 2; this leads to 3–8 times larger radiative forcing, in part due to higher solar irradiance in the melting season. These calculations used ambient snowpack properties; if all snowpacks were instead assumed to be optically thick, the albedo reduction would be 20–50% larger for new snow in the Arctic and North America and 120–300% larger for old snow. Accounting for non-BC LAPs reduces the albedo reduction by BC in the Arctic, North America, and China by 32%, 29%, and 70%, respectively, for new snow and 11%, 7%, and 51% for old snow. BC-in-snow albedo reduction computed using a two-layer model agrees reasonably with that computed using a multilayer model.

The contribution of ruminant livestock to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been investigated extensively at various scales from regional to global, but the long-term trend, regional variation and drivers of methane (CH4) emission remain unclear. In this study, we use Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier II guidelines to quantify the evolution of CH4 emissions from ruminant livestock during 1890–2014. We estimate that total CH4 emissions in 2014 was 97.1 million tonnes (MT) CH4 or 2.72 Gigatonnes (Gt) CO2-eq (1 MT = 1012 g, 1 Gt = 1015 g) from ruminant livestock, which accounted for 47%–54% of all non-CO2 GHG emissions from the agricultural sector. Our estimate shows that CH4 emissions from the ruminant livestock had increased by 332% (73.6 MT CH4 or 2.06 Gt CO2-eq) since the 1890s. Our results further indicate that livestock sector in drylands had 36% higher emission intensity (CH4 emissions/km2) compared to that in nondrylands in 2014, due to the combined effect of higher rate of increase in livestock population and low feed quality. We also find that the contribution of developing regions (Africa, Asia and Latin America) to the total CH4 emissions had increased from 51.7% in the 1890s to 72.5% in the 2010s.

In situ measurements were carried out from three different parts of the mangrove forest, i.e. (1) deep forest (with limited tidal influence), (2) rooted (with pneumatophores, medium tree density and tidally active), and (3) un-rooted region (tidal flat). Subsequently, the role of soil salinity, temperature and the enzyme activities (Urease, β-D glucosidase and Dehydrogenase activity) in regulating the microbial mineralization processes were also studied to understand their contribution to the soil CO2 emission. Irrespective of the sampling locations, the highest and lowest CO2 efflux was recorded during month from October to January and from June to September, respectively. Among the three different regions, the highest and the lowest CO2 emission was recorded from the deep forest (8.34 ± 1.04 mmol C m-2h-1) and un-rooted soil (0.81 ± 0.07 mmol C m-2 h-1), respectively. Soil CO2 emission did not show any significant response to salinity. However, soil temperature and available enzyme activities showed significant control over soil CO2 emission. The results indicated that the microbial community in this tidally active zone is well adapted within a large salinity range. Among the soil enzymes, β-D glucosidase activity showed the highest contribution, in regulating the soil CO2 emissions, in all the studied locations. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Enzyme activity; Microbial mineralization; Salinity; Soil CO2 emission; Sundarban mangroves; Temperature","biomineralization; enzyme activity; forest soil; mangrove; microbial activity; microbial community; salinity; soil carbon; soil emission; soil temperature; temporal variation; India; Sundarbans; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040514055

Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services. © 2017 The Authors.

We investigate the effects of microclimatic heterogeneity on woodland resilience through millennial climate and disturbance shifts near northwest European woodland range limits. We use palaeoecological data from northern Scotland to study the effects of fragmentation on community composition and diversity in a potentially favourable microclimate, and compare palynological timeseries of tree abundance from five sites to assess the effects of favourable (low-lying sheltered) versus more marginal (higher altitude) settings on population persistence and stability. The sheltered site shows persistence of tree cover through Holocene climatic and anthropogenic shifts, including climatically-driven regional woodland contraction around 4400 cal BP (calendar years before present), when surviving woods became compositionally differentiated into upland pine and low-lying deciduous communities. A favourable microclimate can thus buffer woodlands against environmental shifts and increase continuity of canopy cover, but it does not generate stable communities. Compositional reorganisation is an essential stress response mechanism and should be accommodated by conservation managers. The replacement of deciduous taxa by Pinus sylvestris after 1060 cal BP represents the decoupling of pine distribution from climate drivers by management intervention. As a result, current microrefugial woodland composition reflects late Holocene human intervention. Alternative models of community composition and behaviour from palaeoecology provide a stronger foundation for managing microsite communities than relict woods in contrasting environmental settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Conservation; Fragmentation; Paleoecology; Scotland; Woodland","abundance; climate change; coniferous tree; deciduous forest; disturbance; ecological stability; ecosystem resilience; environmental disturbance; fragmentation; heterogeneity; Holocene; microclimate; paleoecology; palynology; persistence; replacement; species diversity; time series; woodland; Scotland; United Kingdom; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021900092

Starting from the numerically simulated static micromagnetic state, the magnetization is deliberately deflected orthogonally to its equilibrium orientation, and the magnetic fields generated in response to this deflection are evaluated using micromagnetic software. This allows us to calculate the elements of the effective demagnetizing tensor, which are then used within a linear analytical formalism to map the local FMR frequency and dynamic magnetic susceptibility. To illustrate the typical results that one can obtain using this model, we analyze three micromagnetic systems boasting nonuniformity in either one or two dimensions, and successfully explain the spin-wave emission observed in each case, demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of the Schlömann excitation mechanism underpinning the observations. Finally, the developed model of local FMR frequency can be used to explain how spin waves could be confined and steered using magnetic nonuniformities of various origins, rendering it a powerful tool for the mapping of the graded magnonic index in magnonics. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Ferromagnetic resonance; Magnetic susceptibility; Mapping; Spin waves; Demagnetizing tensor; Dynamic magnetic susceptibility; Equilibrium orientations; Excitation mechanisms; Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR); Micromagnetic systems; Non-uniformities; Patterned magnetic structure; Magnetic structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029957255

The Declaration, initiated prior to the 2015 COP 21 meeting by scholars from the Global Network for the Study of Human Rights and the Environment (GNHRE), is one of a convergence of initiatives reflecting the need to understand human rights as intrinsically threatened by climate change. This article introduces the Declaration, the necessity for it, its philosophical and legal background and its support by contemporary cases providing evidence of the escalating legal need for such a tool. A key aim of the Declaration is to trace out a potential normative approach for establishing responsibility towards the planet and redressing unevenly distributed vulnerabilities and climate injustices while recognizing that it is vital that respect for human rights should be understood as an indispensable element of any adequate approach to climate change. The Declaration strives to offer a compelling level of ethical appeal, as well as to be legally literate and philosophically rigorous. The drafting process engaged scholars and communities from across the world, prioritized indigenous involvement, and drew on indigenous ontologies and epistemologies. Newer philosophical approaches such as new materialist understandings of lively materiality also informed the drafting process.

Although it is well documented that the materials comprising artificial structures influence the composition of organisms that use them as habitat, little is known about how these materials may chemically react with changing seawater conditions, and what effects this will have on associated biota. We investigated the effects of ocean warming, acidification, and type of coastal infrastructure material on algal turfs. Seawater acidification resulted in greater covers of turf, though this effect was counteracted by elevated temperatures. Concrete supported a greater cover of turf than granite or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under all temperature and pH treatments, with the greatest covers occurring under simulated ocean acidification. Furthermore, photosynthetic efficiency under acidification was greater on concrete substratum compared to all other materials and treatment combinations. These results demonstrate the capacity to maximise ecological benefits whilst still meeting local management objectives when engineering coastal defense structures by selecting materials that are appropriate in an ocean change context. Therefore, mitigation efforts to offset impacts from sea-level rise and storms can also be engineered to alter, or even reduce, the effects of climatic change on biological assemblages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Filamentous algae; Marine infrastructure; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming","Acidification; Concretes; Ecology; High density polyethylenes; Oceanography; Sea level; Seawater; Seawater effects; Storms; Coastal defense structures; Ecological performance; High density polyethylene(HDPE); Marine infrastructure; Ocean acidifications; Ocean warming; Photosynthetic efficiency; Seawater acidifications; Climate change; polyethylene; sea water; acidification; alga; climate change; climate effect; construction material; warming; acidification; Article; climate change; ecology; environmental temperature; granite; mesocosm; ocean environment; photosynthesis; temperature measurement; warming; water temperature; analysis; building material; chemistry; materials testing; sea; water pollutant; algae; Climate Change; Construction Materials; Materials Testing; Oceans and Seas; Polyethylene; Seawater; Water Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030751069

However, the supplying of water and an efficient replacement of nutrients to the soil are essential for these crops, due to the intrinsic climatic conditions of this region, such as low rainfall and high evapotranspiration. This study aimed at evaluating the physiological characteristics of ‘Itália’ grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) under irrigation and fertilization management. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design, with four replications, in a split-plot arrangement, with four irrigation water depths (0.75, 1.00, 1.25 and 1.5 times the crop coefficient) in the plots and four fertilizer rates (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%, based on the recommended fertilizer rates for this crop) in the subplots, with addition of organic compounds. The leaf water potential, leaf chlorophyll content, relative water content, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, internal CO2 partial pressure, leaf temperature and biomass accumulation in the berries were evaluated. The highest leaf chlorophyll contents were found in treatments with fertilizer rates of 70-85%. Stomatal conductance decreased with the increasing irrigation water depths, thus reducing the internal CO2 partial pressure and increasing the leaf temperature and air vapor pressure deficit. The reduction of 25% in the conventional fertilization and irrigation of 135% of the recommended coefficient resulted in the highest average weight of berries.

The PGC forms conformal shells around tiny 5-15 nm core grains of Fe carbide. The C, N, and O isotopic compositions of these components are identical within errors to terrestrial standards, indicating a formation inside the solar system. Magnetite compositions are consistent with oxidation of reduced metal, similar to that seen in enstatite chondrites. Similarly, the core-shell structure of the carbide + PGC inclusions suggests a formation via FTT reactions on the surface of metal or carbide grains in warm, reduced regions of the solar nebula. Together, the nanoscale assemblage in the cometary particle is most consistent with the alteration of primary solids condensed from a C-rich, reduced nebular gas. The nanoparticulate components in the cometary particle provide the first direct evidence from comets of reduced, carbon-rich regions that were present in the solar nebula. © 2017.

We performed in-depth proteomic analysis using the 4,000-plex SOMAscan assay on 1,470 serum samples from seven countries where TB is endemic. All samples were from patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of active pulmonary TB that were systematically confirmed or ruled out for TB by culture and clinical follow-up. HIV coinfection was present in 34% of samples, and 25% were sputum smear negative. Serum protein biomarkers were identified by stability selection using L1-regularized logistic regression and by Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics. A naive Bayes classifier using six host response markers (HR6 model), including SYWC, kallistatin, complement C9, gelsolin, testican-2, and aldolase C, performed well in a training set (area under the sensitivity-specificity curve [AUC] of 0.94) and in a blinded verification set (AUC of 0.92) to distinguish TB and non-TB samples. Differential expression was also highly significant (P1020) for previously described TB markers, such as IP-10, LBP, FCG3B, and TSP4, and for many novel proteins not previously associated with TB. Proteins with the largest median fold changes were SAA (serum amyloid protein A), NPS-PLA2 (secreted phospholipase A2), and CA6 (carbonic anhydrase 6). Target product profiles (TPPs) for a non-sputum biomarker test to diagnose active TB for treatment initiation (TPP#1) and for a community-based triage or referral test (TPP#2) have been published by the WHO. With 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity, the HR6 model fell short of TPP#1 but reached TPP#2 performance criteria. In conclusion, we identified and validated a six-marker signature for active TB that warrants diagnostic development on a patient-near platform. © 2017 De Groote et al.","Aptamer; Biomarker; Proteomics; Tuberculosis","alpha 1 antitrypsin; amino acid transfer RNA ligase; biological marker; biotinidase; C reactive protein; carbonate dehydratase; carbonate dehydratase 6; cathelicidin; cathepsin V; CD163 antigen; CD36 antigen; complement component C9; creatine kinase MB; ferritin; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; gelatinase A; gelsolin; heat shock protein 90; hepcidin; interleukin 6; interstitial collagenase; kallistatin; lumican; lysozyme; procollagen C proteinase; secretory phospholipase A2; serum amyloid A; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; unclassified drug; bacterial antigen; biological marker; complement component C9; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; gelsolin; kallistatin; plasma protein; proteoglycan; serine proteinase inhibitor; SPOCK2 protein, human; adolescent; aged; area under the curve; Article; bacterium culture; Bangladesh; blood sampling; body height; body mass; body weight; Colombia; controlled study; demography; diagnostic test accuracy study; drug sensitivity; endemic disease; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; limit of detection; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; mass spectrometry; mixed infection; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Peru; priority journal; protein expression; proteomics; RNA sequence; sensitivity and specificity; South Africa; sputum smear; tuberculosis control; Uganda; Viet Nam; Zimbabwe; blood; genetics; immunology; lung tuberculosis; metabolism; microbiology; Antigens, Bacterial; Biomarkers; Blood Proteins; Complement C9; Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase; Gelsolin; Humans; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Proteoglycans; Proteomics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serpins; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030121578

Part two examines regional networks and linkages that the AIIB is becoming part of. These include China's 'one belt, one road' initiative, and various collective initiatives based around ASEAN. In part three, this article explores the AIIB's appearance on the development finance scene as an example of 'contested multilateralism'-where a new multilateral institution emerges to challenge the rules and practices of existing institutions. The AIIB has entered into co-financing agreements with many of its multilateral development bank peers. Its standards and procedures are strongly influenced by existing ones, even while it begins to influence the practices of its partner multilateral development banks. Part four examines the potential influence of a future alliance between the AIIB and the UNCCC's Green Climate Fund. Such an alliance would require an even greater degree of compliance by the AIIB with global standards of transparency and good governance, as well as expanding the scope for the AIIB to influence regional climate change adaptation and mitigation infrastructure initiatives. © The Author(s) 2017.

Currently, forest biomass is one of the most important energy sources in Sweden, accounting for around 20% of the total supply. New demands of forest biomass may be expected due to the European Union energy targets, the previous high oil prices, the energy supply security, and the bioenergy market. However, the supply depends on the intensity of conventional final felling operations. Thus, it is crucial to determine the energy demands of conventional and new forest assortment supply chains and promote those with the highest energy efficiency and least greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An attributional life cycle assessment approach was used to evaluate the fuel consumption and GHG emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels used in forest operations, transportation and comminution of forest biomass procured via two kinds of supply chains in Northern Sweden: conventional and integrated. The results indicate that most fuel was consumed in transportation processes. The integrated supply chains (in which the harvesting of industrial roundwood is integrated with extraction of forest fuels) are more energy efficient than conventional supply chains, and have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 13%.

Teak (Tectona grandis) is one of the most valuable tropical hardwood species in the international timber market, and natural teak forests are distributed from India through Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. The extents of teak forests are shrinking due to deforestation and the local impacts of global climate change. However, the direct impacts of climate changes on the continental-scale distributions of native and non-native teak have not been examined. In this study, we developed a species distribution model for teak across its entire native distribution in tropical Asia, and its non-native distribution in Bangladesh. We used presence-only records of trees and twelve environmental variables that were most representative for current teak distributions in South and Southeast Asia. MaxEnt (maximum entropy) models were used to model the distributions of teak under current and future climate scenarios. We found that land use/land cover change and elevation were the two most important variables explaining the current and future distributions of native and non-native teak in tropical Asia. Changes in annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and annual mean actual evapotranspiration may result in shifts in the distributions of teak across tropical Asia. We discuss the implications for the conservation of critical teak habitats, forest management planning, and risks of biological invasion that may occur due to its cultivation in non-native ranges. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biological invasions; Climate change; Exotic species; Forest management; Species’ distribution models","Climate models; Deforestation; Forestry; Hardwoods; Land use; Population distribution; Tropics; Actual evapotranspiration; Biological invasion; Distribution models; Exotic species; Forest management planning; Future climate scenarios; Land use/land cover change; Species distribution modeling; Climate change; biological invasion; climate change; climate effect; deciduous tree; deforestation; environmental factor; environmental planning; evapotranspiration; forest management; global climate; induced response; introduced species; population distribution; seasonality; timber market; Bangladesh; climate change; entropy; evapotranspiration; exotic species; forest management; habitat; information processing; land use; model; nonhuman; precipitation; seasonal variation; Southeast Asia; species distribution; species invasion; Tectona grandis; Asia; ecosystem; environmental protection; forecasting; forest; growth, development and aging; Lamiaceae; organization; plant dispersal; procedures; Southeast Asia; tree; trends; tropic climate; Bangladesh; India; Laos; Myanmar; Thailand; Tectona grandis; Asia, Southeastern; Asia, Western; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forecasting; Forests; Lamiaceae; Organizational Objectives; Plant Dispersal; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018766497

Here, we use data from more than 1,000 sites from five separate global and regional datasets to identify the importance of palaeoclimatic conditions (Last Glacial Maximum and mid-Holocene) in shaping the current structure of soil bacterial communities in natural and agricultural soils. We show that palaeoclimate explains more of the variation in the richness and composition of bacterial communities than current climate. Moreover, palaeoclimate accounts for a unique fraction of this variation that cannot be predicted from geographical location, current climate, soil properties or plant diversity. Climatic legacies (temperature and precipitation anomalies from the present to ∼20 kyr ago) probably shape soil bacterial communities both directly and indirectly through shifts in soil properties and plant communities. The ability to predict the distribution of soil bacteria from either palaeoclimate or current climate declines greatly in agricultural soils, highlighting the fact that anthropogenic activities have a strong influence on soil bacterial diversity. We illustrate how climatic legacies can help to explain the current distribution of soil bacteria in natural ecosystems and advocate that climatic legacies should be considered when predicting microbial responses to climate change. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"agriculture; bacterium; climate change; microbiology; microflora; Agriculture; Bacteria; Climate Change; Microbiota; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031943475

However, how climate changes, such as altered precipitation (PPT), will influence switchgrass growth and soil carbon storage potential have not been well investigated. We conducted a two-year PPT manipulation experiment with five treatments: −50%, −33%, +0%, +33%, and +50% of ambient PPT, in an “Alamo” switchgrass field in Nashville, TN. Switchgrass aboveground net primary production (ANPP), leaf gas exchange, and soil respiration (SR) were determined each growing season. Data collected from this study was then used to test whether switchgrass ANPP responds to PPT changes in a double asymmetry pattern as framed by Knapp et al. (2017), and whether it is held true for other ecosystem processes such as SR. Results showed that the wet (+33%, and +50%) treatments had little effects on ANPP and leaf gas exchange compared to the ambient precipitation treatment, regardless of fertilization or not. The −33% treatment did not change ANPP and leaf photosynthesis, but significantly decreased transpiration and enhanced water use efficiency (WUE). Only the −50% treatment significantly decreased ANPP and LAI, without changing leaf photosynthesis. SR generally decreased under the drought treatments and increased under the wet treatments, while there was no significant difference between the two drought treatments or between the two wet treatments. Our results demonstrate that switchgrass ANPP responded in a single negative asymmetry model to PPT changes probably due to relative high PPT in the region. However, even in such a mesic ecosystem, SR responded strongly to PPT changes in an “S” curve model, suggesting that future climate changes may have greater but more complex effects on switchgrass belowground than aboveground processes. The contrasting models for switchgrass ANPP and SR in response to PPT indicate that extreme wet or dry PPT conditions may shift ecosystem from carbon accumulation toward debt, and in turn provide government and policy makers with useful information for sustainable management of switchgrass. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground net primary production; Bioenergy crop; Leaf gas exchange; Panicum virgatum; Precipitation change; Soil respiration; Switchgrass; Water use efficiency","aboveground production; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; climate change; energy crop; gas exchange; grass; growing season; precipitation (climatology); primary production; soil carbon; soil respiration; water use efficiency; Nashville; Tennessee; United States; Panicum virgatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025818850

With Quebec City (Canada) as a case study, it combines an origin-destination (OD) survey, population census data and land use records for 2006 and rests on a series of structural equations models developed at the grid cell level (3,892 cells), which allows for testing for both direct and indirect effects of urban form, accessibility and socio-economic attributes on GHG emissions, households’ transportation and housing financial burdens and motorization rate. As expected, findings suggest that GHG emissions increase with higher incomes (and education), but mainly for homeowners. Tenants displaying a high expenditure-to-income ratio for housing tend to stay close to the city centre (and jobs), thereby minimizing their overall expenditures for transportation while lowering GHG emissions. Potential accessibility by car promotes urban sprawl, thereby contributing to increased GHG emissions. In contrast, increasing residential density and land use mix while providing a better walking access to jobs and local shops tends to favour active transportation, leading to a significant reduction in GHG emissions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Greenhouse gas emissions; housing choices; structural equation model; transportation patterns; urban form","carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; household income; social housing; socioeconomic status; statistical analysis; transportation mode; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Quebec [Quebec (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029408748

In this work we present an approach to simulate the power consumption characteristics of electric buses in line operation. Due to accurate depiction of the heating and cooling demand, the model is capable to generate seasonal charging profiles of EVs in high resolution. Comparing these to power generation profiles of fluctuating renewable energy sources this paper discusses which degrees of freedom are incorporated in the configuration of an electric driven public bus system to enhance simultaneity of power production and consumption in order to guarantee an emission-free operation. Results show that the energy demand of electric buses is heavily influenced by temperature variations and that synchronicity of power generation and consumption on a completely renewable powered bus route over a full year is given at an average of 37.0 % for photovoltaic (PV) systems and 41.3 % for wind turbines. © 2017 IEEE.","cooling & air conditioning; electrification; heating; public transportation; renewable energy; simulation; urban bus traffic","Air conditioning; Buses; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric automobiles; Electric lines; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Environmental technology; Heating; Mass transportation; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Urban transportation; Wind turbines; electrification; Public transportation; Renewable energies; simulation; Urban bus; Bus transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034581833

In this regard, the present work aims to investigate the CO2 methanation performance of cobalt-based catalysts supported on different metal oxides (MxOy: CeO2, ZrO2, Gd2O3, ZnO) at low temperatures (200-300 °C) and under atmospheric pressure. Various characterization methods, such as N2 adsorption-desorption at -196 °C, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), were employed to correlate the structural and surface properties of the materials with their catalytic activity. The results revealed a significant impact of support nature on the CO2 hydrogenation performance. The following order, in terms of CH4 yield (YCH4), was recorded at 300 °C: Co/CeO2 (∼96%) &gt; Co/ZnO (∼54%) &gt; Co/G2O3 (∼53%) ∼ Co/ZrO2 (∼53%). On the basis of the characterization results, the superiority of Co/CeO2 catalyst can be mainly ascribed to its enhanced reducibility linked to Co-Ceria interactions. Moreover, Co/CeO2 demonstrated a stable conversion/selectivity performance under subsequent reaction cycles, in contrast to Co/ZnO, which progressively activated under reaction conditions. The latter is related with the modifications induced in elemental chemical states and surface composition of Co/ZnO upon pretreatment in reaction conditions, in contrast to Co/CeO2 sample where a stable surface performance was observed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a critical and ongoing aspect of farming operations in Australia’s largest watershed. Using the 2013 Regional Wellbeing Survey data, we show that irrigators and dryland farmers adjust their production processes and business models using a wide range of strategies, with irrigators adopting more strategies than dryland farmers and investment-related strategies being the most prevalent form of adjustment. The extent of adjustment depends on farm characteristics: large, intensive-farming units, on-farm income-dependent and annual cropping farmers were more likely to adapt among irrigators. Irrigators also generally place more importance on water-related strategies than output- and input-related strategies. Amongst dryland farmers, hobby farming, non-intensive-farming and perennial cropping units were more likely to adjust than other dryland farms. These empirical findings inform the important debate about developing and targeting adequate policy support for structural adjustment of farming operations in the MDB. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","drought; dryland farmers; Farm adjustment; irrigators; water-related challenges",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976438384

These results indicate that mitigation responses to climate change are location specific and no one trade policy is suitable at the regional and global levels.

This is leading to rapid climate change and scarcity of resources. There is growing agreement globally of the need to deliver sustainable development to improve the lives of millions of people in low and middle income countries through provision of clean water, sanitation, energy and transport solutions. The response of the international community to this challenge is via the United Nations programme (published in January 2016), which establishes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including response to climate change. These SDGs will guide decisions taken by nations and organisations over the next 15 years. This paper is the written version of the opening keynote lecture delivered to the 3rd Pan American Conference on Geosynthetics in Miami Beach, USA, in April 2016; it considers the role that geosynthetics can make in achieving the SDGs. Scientific evidence for climate change is presented, and the value and uncertainty in available climate change information is discussed to inform its use in design. International agreements on reducing greenhouse gas emissions are based on country specific action plans for mitigation and adaptation against climate change, and the potential for geosynthetics to help achieve these targets is identified. Finally, approaches for calculating embodied carbon for solutions incorporating geosynthetics are introduced and case studies that provide evidence for the ‘sustainability’ case for geosynthetics are summarised.

Eight focus groups with 53 Michigan farmers were conducted in 2011-12 to better understand the following: 1) what do farmers think about the relationship between climate change and agriculture, 2) what differentiates normal weather-related management from climate change adaptation actions, and 3) how do farmers understand the term ""climate change adaptation."" Farmers expressed skepticism at global climate change yet conveyed specific details about the local changes in climate they are experiencing on their farms. They were not able to clearly define the term ""climate change adaptation"" but did note specific adaptive actions they have already implemented. The farmers explained that nonclimate factors were of more concern to them when making management decisions, and they showed reactive (not proactive) actions toward adaptation. Farmers noted that any action they take has to address their specific situation, suggesting that generalized adaptation actions and language might not resonate with them.

However, the effects of exposure to a ubiquitous contaminant di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on these behaviors and, in particular, on courtship vocalizations have not been examined. OBJECTIVE: The effects of adult exposure to DEHP on courtship and mating behaviors and gonadotropic axis and neural mechanisms involved in DEHP-induced effects were analyzed in male mice. METHODS: Adult C57BL/6J males were orally exposed to DEHP (0, 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/kg/d) for 4 wk. Olfactory preference, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), partner preference and mating, as well as locomotor activity and motor coordination, were measured. The kisspeptin system and testosterone levels were analyzed. Proteomic and molecular studies were conducted on the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus, the key region involved in sexual motivation to vocalize and mate. RESULTS: DEHP at 50 μg/kg/d reduced the emission of USVs, whereas lower doses changed the ratio of syllable categories. This was associated with diminished sexual interest of female partners toward males exposed to 5 or 50 μg/kg/d and increased latency to mate, despite normal olfactory preference. The kisspeptin system and circulating testosterone levels were unaffected. In DEHP-exposed males, proteomic analysis of the preoptic nucleus identified differentially expressed proteins connected to the androgen receptor (AR). Indeed, exposure to 5 or 50 μg/kg/d of DEHP induced selective AR downregulation in this nucleus and upstream chemosensory regions. The involvement of AR changes in the observed alterations was further supported by the reduced emission of courtship vocalizations in males with disrupted neural AR expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the critical role of neural AR in courtship vocalizations and raises the possibility that the vulnerability of this signaling pathway to exposure to endocrine disrupters may be detrimental for courtship communication and mating in several species. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The combustion behavior and emission characteristics of the fuels were investigated on a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) and a circulating fluidized bed (CFB). The effects of an excess air ratio, primary air rate, secondary air ratio, and fuel type on flue gas emissions were studied. The results showed that the fluidization status and temperature distribution had direct influences on CO emission. Sufficient fluidization and high temperature effectively reduced CO emission. NOx emission was relatively sensitive to the excess air ratio and increased with increasing excess air ratio. By comparing BFB and CFB, we found that CFBs have an advantage in optimizing combustion and controlling emissions by enhancing mixing and increasing freeboard temperatures. The Cr speciation and distribution among different ash types were extensively investigated in four co-combustion tests. The results showed that the distribution modes of Cr in BFBs and CFBs were different and determined by separate fluid dynamics modes of sludge ash particles in the combustor. The extent of Cr oxidation in ash in CFB tests was higher than that in BFB tests, particularly for bottom ash and heat exchanger ash, due to longer residence times in high-temperature regions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Ash handling; Coal combustion; Combustion; Combustors; Exhaust gases; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustors; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Gas emissions; High temperature effects; Residence time distribution; Bench-scale fluidized bed combustors; Bubbling fluidized bed; Circulating fluidized bed; Combustion behavior; Distribution modes; Emission characteristics; Excess air ratios; Freeboard temperature; Fluidized bed combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031939172

The concept of urban industrial symbiosis offers a smart solution for city to coordinate the relationship among industries and between industry and city. While internationally, this idea has been promoted more than two decades, in China, which is ideal laboratory to test such practices, related research is rather few, especially quantitative studies. With this circumstance, this study conducts a case study to test the urban industrial symbiosis promotion in one typical industrial city named Liuzhou, in southern China, of which heavy industries play an important role. A hybrid evaluation model integrating process based life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (IO) model is established to assess the environmental benefits in the whole supply chain. Based on local conditions, innovative urban industrial symbiosis is designed and analyzed. Five new waste/energy synergies named waste plastics recycling, scrap tire recycling, coal flying ash recycling, biomass utilization and carbon capture by slag carbonization are selected for scenarios analysis. We particular focus on the carbon mitigations. Compared with business as usual scenario, planned symbiosis enables to reduce CO2 emissions by 29.66, 557.42 and 520.13 kt-CO2/year in power purchase, material consumption and waste disposal stage. Results highlight that urban industrial symbiosis is not only able to green the industries, but also utilize industry contribute to urban development. Finally, policy implications and countermeasures to address the barriers of promoting the urban industrial symbiosis are discussed.

In this system, timely and accurate detection of vehicles in tunnels is guaranteed through the use of a tunnel surveillance application. Under different illumination conditions, with no vehicles on the road, we obtain images of each tunnel segment with each surveillance camera and use them as background images before detection begins. Regions of interest (ROIs) are then extracted to reduce the subsequent processing area. For the detection, we use the background subtraction method, edge detection method, and block division processing method. Then, the nonzero point (NZP) number in specific blocks is calculated to determine if vehicles are in the tunnel based on the NZP threshold. This method takes into account practical constraints including real-time operation and poor image conditions. Our main contribution is a simple and practical method to avoid the omission ratio of vehicle detection under the special tunnel environment, which is essential for tunnel security. Experimental results show the proposed approach achieves a 0% emission ratio (existence is detected as nonexistence) and a false detection ratio (nonexistence is detected as existence) of less than 5%, which ensures the safe operation of the system in the tunnel. © 2017 IEEE.","background subtraction; image blocking (keywords); tunnel surveillance; vehicle detection","Edge detection; Energy conservation; Image segmentation; Monitoring; Processing; Security systems; Solid wastes; Vehicles; Background subtraction; Background subtraction method; Edge detection methods; Energy-saving control; Illumination conditions; Image blocking; Tunnel surveillances; Vehicle detection; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032787985

By using a three end-member mixing model, we semiquantitatively estimated the removal of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) mediated by biological production in the river plume and upwelled water to be 13 ± 17 and 15 ± 16 μmol kg−1, respectively. The enhanced organic production was mainly responsible for these DIC consumptions in both two regimes, however, nearly a half of DIC removal was attributed to biocalcification in the plume system while it was negligible in the upwelling system. Furthermore, the modeled results over reefs revealed that river plume and coastal upwelling were two major threats of acidification to coral communities at the east coast of Hainan Island during cruises. In comparison, the biological contribution to acidification was limited for balancing between organic production and biocalcification during July 2014 cruise, whereas the acidification was greatly intensified by organic degradation during July 2015 cruise. It was verified that naturally local acidification (physical and biological processes) played a major role in great pH decreases on a short-term scale, leading to coastal waters more vulnerable to anthropogenic “ocean acidification” (uptake of atmospheric CO2) by reducing buffering capacity of waters. Finally, effects of acidification associated with other local threats on a fringing reef were further depicted with a conceptual model. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

These potentials are still highly underutilized in most European countries. They also play a key role in the planning of future energy systems due to their positive impact on the increase of integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, for example wind and solar in a combination with power to heat technologies. In order to ensure optimal levels of district heating penetration into an energy system, a comprehensive analysis is necessary to determine the actual demands and the potential energy supply.

The fate of this Hg during and following snowmelt is largely unknown. We measured Hg, major ions, and stable water isotopes from the snowpack through the entire spring melt runoff period for two years. Our small (2.5 ha) watershed is near Barrow (now Utqiag→vik), Alaska. We measured discharge, made 10 000 snow depths, and collected over 100 samples of snow and meltwater for chemical analysis in 2008 and 2009 from the watershed snowpack and ephemeral stream channel. Results show an ""ionic pulse"" of mercury and major ions in runoff during both snowmelt seasons, but major ion and Hg runoff concentrations were roughly 50% higher in 2008 than in 2009. Though total discharge as a percent of total watershed snowpack water equivalent prior to the melt was similar in both years (36% in 2008 melt runoff and 34% in 2009), it is possible that record low precipitation in the summer of 2007 led to the higher major ion and Hg concentrations in 2008 melt runoff. Total dissolved Hg meltwater runoff of 14.3 (± 0.7) mg/ha in 2008 and 8.1 (± 0.4) mg/ha in 2009 is five to seven times higher than that reported from other arctic watersheds. We calculate 78% of snowpack Hg was exported with snowmelt runoff in 2008 and 41% in 2009. Our results suggest AMDE Hg complexed with Cl- or Br- may be less likely to be photochemically reduced and re-emitted to the atmosphere prior to snowmelt, and we estimate that roughly 25% of the Hg in snowmelt is attributable to AMDEs. Projected Arctic warming, with more open sea ice leads providing halogen sources that promote AMDEs, may provide enhanced Hg deposition, reduced Hg emission and, ultimately, an increase in snowpack and snowmelt runoff Hg concentrations. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Chemical analysis; Ions; Runoff; Sea ice; Snow; Snow melting systems; Watersheds; Arctic warming; Atmospheric mercury; Ephemeral streams; Hg concentrations; Snow-melt season; Snowmelt runoff; Stable water isotopes; Water equivalent; Mercury compounds; bromine; chlorine; halogen; mercury; snow; ion; atmospheric deposition; chemical analysis; discharge; environmental fate; ionic composition; meltwater; mercury (element); polar region; pollutant source; runoff; snowmelt; snowpack; stable isotope; watershed; Alaska; Arctic; Article; atmosphere; chemical analysis; photochemistry; precipitation; runoff; sea ice; summer; warming; water analysis; watershed; Arctic; environmental monitoring; Alaska; Arctic; Barrow; United States; Alaska; Arctic Regions; Environmental Monitoring; Ions; Mercury; Snow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030661742

Quantifying the severity of the issue and informing adaptation measures presents a challenge to ecological modelling. We undertook a study of biodiversity impacts and adaptation using spatial modelling across south-eastern Australia. The study aimed to (1) forecast future impacts on biodiversity arising from 18 plausible climate futures, and (2) identify places where land management actions including revegetation will maximise expected improvements to projected biodiversity persistence. This work augments well-tested regional-scale biodiversity assessment by considering an uncertain future climate. Generalised Dissimilarity Models (GDMs) were developed at two baselines (1990 and 2000) to characterise the continuous nature of compositional turnover of vascular plants varying with climate, soils and landform across the region. The classified outputs of the GDM, representing a vegetation-based biodiversity surrogate, were projected using kernel regression to simulate changing distributions for the future epochs 2020, 2030, 2050 and 2070, referred to as Bio-climatic Classes (BCC). BCC distributions were combined with a model of current ecosystem condition and applied to a range of biodiversity assessment methodologies, including the Biodiversity Forecasting Tool, the Spatial Links Tool and a new coupled time-series metapopulation occupancy model. The BFT evaluation of the BCC distributions and their respective ecosystem conditions, forecasts a reduction in biodiversity persistence across the region of between 3 and 20 percent by 2070 (due to climate change only) adding to a past loss of 20 percent since European settlement (due to land use change only, not other factors such as weeds and pests). Maps of compositional dissimilarity change in vascular plants point to varying degrees of expected change in biodiversity across south-eastern Australia. Conservation benefit analysis indicates a general increase and re-distribution of the relative benefits of undertaking conservation to sustain or enhance biodiversity across the region. Results have been incorporated into novel visualisations, to assist environmental managers and others to interpret the complex concepts and issues associated with the work, and support regional adaptation planning. © 2017","Australia; Biological communities; Climate change impacts and adaptation; Terrestrial biodiversity assessment","Biodiversity; Climate models; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Forecasting; Forestry; Land use; Revegetation; Soil conservation; Assessment methodologies; Australia; Biodiversity conservation; Biodiversity surrogates; Biological community; Climate change impact; South-eastern Australia; Terrestrial biodiversity; Climate change; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027883146

There is a new trend of moving from a cross-country or country-level study to a regional level study. In this article, the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality in 56 prefecture-level cities of China from 2011 to 2012 has been studied. Per capita GDP was used as a marker of economic development at the city level. Besides the commonly used SO2 emissions, per capita water consumption and COD emissions were also included as typical environmental indicators. While the per capita GDP in these cities increased remarkably, there was no significant change of per capita water consumption, but a significant decrease was achieved for SO2 and COD emissions. There is a strong correlation between per capita GDP and per capita water consumption, which fulfills the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. However, there was no significant relationship between per capita GDP neither SO2 emission nor COD emission. There was also no regional difference for per capita GDP and per capita water consumption, but SO2 emission and COD emission are division-dependent. Generally speaking, the emissions reduction policy for SO2 and COD in these cities showed tangible results. The control of per capita water consumption remains a major task for local governments. Besides the strict control of pollution emission, a series of water-saving measures should be included in the environmental protection policy to reduce the per capita water consumption. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1290–1295, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog","air pollution; COD; energy policy; wastewater treatment","Air pollution; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Pollution; Pollution control; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water pollution; Economic development; Emissions reduction; Environmental indicators; Environmental Kuznets curves; Environmental quality; Pollution emissions; Regional differences; Water saving measures; Water pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017175183

Based on the enhanced surveillance system, we aimed to explore whether the addition of temperate and search engine query data improves the risk prediction of HFMD. Design Ecological study. Setting and participants Information on the confirmed cases of HFMD, climate parameters and search engine query logs was collected. A total of 1.36 million HFMD cases were identified from the surveillance system during 2011-2014. Analyses were conducted at aggregate level and no confidential information was involved. Outcome measures A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with external variables (ARIMAX) was used to predict the HFMD incidence from 2011 to 2014, taking into account temperature and search engine query data (Baidu Index, BDI). Statistics of goodness-of-fit and precision of prediction were used to compare models (1) based on surveillance data only, and with the addition of (2) temperature, (3) BDI, and (4) both temperature and BDI. Results A high correlation between HFMD incidence and BDI (r=0.794, p<0.001) or temperature (r=0.657, p<0.001) was observed using both time series plot and correlation matrix. A linear effect of BDI (without lag) and non-linear effect of temperature (1 week lag) on HFMD incidence were found in a distributed lag non-linear model. Compared with the model based on surveillance data only, the ARIMAX model including BDI reached the best goodness-of-fit with an Akaike information criterion (AIC) value of â 345.332, whereas the model including both BDI and temperature had the most accurate prediction in terms of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 101.745%. Conclusions An ARIMAX model incorporating search engine query data significantly improved the prediction of HFMD. Further studies are warranted to examine whether including search engine query data also improves the prediction of other infectious diseases in other settings. © Article author(s) 2017.","ARIMAX model; Baidu index; Hand, foot and mouth disease; Time series analysis","Article; autumn; China; climate; hand foot and mouth disease; human; incidence; major clinical study; prediction; search engine; seasonal variation; spring; summer; temperature; biological model; evaluation study; female; foot; foot disease; hand; hand foot and mouth disease; health survey; information processing; information science; male; morbidity; mouth; mouth disease; procedures; risk factor; season; skin disease; temperature; theoretical model; virology; China; Climate; Data Collection; Female; Foot; Foot Diseases; Hand; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Incidence; Informatics; Male; Models, Biological; Models, Theoretical; Morbidity; Mouth; Mouth Diseases; Population Surveillance; Risk Factors; Search Engine; Seasons; Skin Diseases; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031087536

The Pb–Zn mineralization is mainly hosted in the marble of the Dashiqiao Formation. Three distinct mineralization styles (strata-bound, open-space-filling and transitional type) are recognized. Two genetic models have been proposed to explain the Pb–Zn mineralization in this district: the sedimentary-exhalative model and the superimposed multi-stage model, in which syn-sedimentary deposition is overprinted by metamorphic and magmatic hydrothermal modification. Based on these three mineralization styles, this study provides new C–O–S–Pb isotopic data and LA–ICPMS trace element analyses of carbonates in order to place more constraints on the genesis of the Pb–Zn deposits. The δ13CPDB values of the syn-ore carbonates range from −5.11‰ to −1.06‰, and their δ18OSMOW values range from 3.30‰ to 13.2‰; these values are distinctively lower than those of barren meta-sedimentary rocks (δ13C = −1.98‰ – −0.55‰, δ18O = 19.69‰−22.76‰). The depleted C–O isotopic values of syn-ore carbonates are inferred to result from fluid-rock interactions combined with the impact of graphite. In situ LA–ICPMS trace element analyses show that syn-ore carbonates record enriched REE contents, pronounced positive Eu anomalies and lower Y/Ho ratios compared to barren carbonates. The depleted C–O isotopic signatures and distinctive REE characteristics of syn-ore carbonates indicate that the hydrothermal fluid is likely magmatic in origin and has mixed with low δ18O fluids, such as meteoric or formation water. Sulfide minerals have δ34S values ranging from 3.16‰ to 9.14‰ and display a gradually increasing trend from open-space-filling to transitional type to strata-bound mineralization styles, which reflect different mixing proportions of the two end-members of magmatic sulfur and sedimentary sulfur. The Pb isotopic compositions of sulfide minerals are relatively uniform (206Pb/204Pb = 17.511–17.883, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.549–15.64 and 208Pb/204Pb = 37.670–38.178) for different mineralization styles; however, the open-space-filling mineralization records relatively lower lead isotope values. The linear correlation of ore lead isotopes between schist and Triassic intrusions indicates that lead may have originated from a mixture of magmatic and sedimentary end-members. The relatively lower Pb isotopes of the open-space-filling mineralization suggest the presence of higher proportions from a magmatic source. Mineralization styles respond to diverse ore-controlling structures and their proximity to the mineralizing source: open-space-filling mineralization shows the least stratigraphic control, with more pronounced “magmatic marks” (i.e., lower S–Pb isotopic values and more depleted C–O values), compared to strata-bound mineralization. These mineralization styles, combined with C–O–S–Pb isotopic geochemistry, consistently preclude a SEDEX origin for the Pb–Zn deposits in the Qingchengzi district, but suggest that they represent a distal hydrothermal mineralization type related to Triassic magmatic activity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonate LA−ICPMS trace element; Carbonate replacement Pb−Zn mineralization; C–O−S–Pb isotope; Jiao−Liao−Ji Belt","Binary alloys; Carbonates; Carbonation; Deposits; Europium; Filling; Gold alloys; Gold deposits; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Isotopes; Lead; Lead alloys; Mineralogy; Ore analysis; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Silver alloys; Silver deposits; Stratigraphy; Sulfur; Trace elements; Zinc; Zinc alloys; Zinc deposits; Fluid-rock interaction; Hydrothermal mineralization; Hydrothermal modification; Isotopic geochemistry; Metasedimentary rocks; Ore-controlling structures; Pb isotopes; Trace element analysis; Ores; carbonate; hydrothermal alteration; inductively coupled plasma method; isotopic analysis; lead; metallogenesis; mineralization; ore deposit; trace element; zinc; China; Liaoning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025159739

More recently, black carbon has been identified as a major, ongoing contributor to anthropogenic climate change, thus making historical emission inventories of black carbon an essential tool for assessing past climate sensitivity and modeling future climate scenarios. Current estimates of black carbon emissions for the early industrial era have high uncertainty, however, because direct environmental sampling is sparse before the mid-1950s. Using photometric reflectance data of >1,300 bird specimens drawn from natural history collections, we track relative ambient concentrations of atmospheric black carbon between 1880 and 2015 within the US Manufacturing Belt, a region historically reliant on coal and dense with industry. Our data show that black carbon levels within the region peaked during the first decade of the 20th century. Following this peak, black carbon levels were positively correlated with coal consumption through midcentury, after which they decoupled, with black carbon concentrations declining as consumption continued to rise. The precipitous drop in atmospheric black carbon at midcentury reflects policies promoting burning efficiency and fuel transitions rather than regulating emissions alone. Our findings suggest that current emission inventories based on predictive modeling underestimate levels of atmospheric black carbon for the early industrial era, suggesting that the contribution of black carbon to past climate forcing may also be underestimated. These findings build toward a spatially dynamic emission inventory of black carbon based on direct environmental sampling.","Aerosols; Air pollution; Climate change; Natural history; Soot","black carbon; coal; fuel; carbon; aerosol; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; bird; combustion; environmental policy; feather; industry; model; nonhuman; photometry; predictive value; priority journal; sampling; sparrow; trend study; animal; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; ecosystem monitoring; environmental monitoring; season; soot; United States; Animals; Birds; Carbon; Coal; Ecological Parameter Monitoring; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Feathers; Industry; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Midwestern United States; Seasons; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032188036

The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop national-level safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor.

We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests. © 2017 by the author(s).","Climate change mitigation; Livelihoods; Monitoring; Social impact assessment; Well-being","carbon emission; deforestation; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental monitoring; incentive; livelihood; mitigation; smallholder; social impact assessment; Brazil; Cameroon; Indonesia; Peru; Tanzania; Viet Nam; Daucus carota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025632124

Besides the prominent vibrational fundamental, the region was found to feature the v1+v5-v5, v1+v4-v4 and even v1+v3-v3 hot bands, the latter two of which were observed for the first time. Owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio obtained, the ν1 mode of C343S could also be observed in natural abundance for the first time at high spectral resolution in the infrared. At 2061 cm−1, hidden inside the R-branch of the C3S ν1 fundamental mode, a weak new band is observed which exhibits very tight line spacing and stems from a heavy both carbon and sulfur containing carrier. On the basis of high-level quantum-chemical calculations of selected carbon–sulfur chains and other carbon-rich cumulenes, this feature is attributed to the ν5 vibrational fundamental of linear SC7S, which stands for the first gas-phase spectroscopic detection of this long cumulenic chain. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","carbon–sulfur chains; coupled-cluster calculations; cumulenes; hot bands; Infrared spectroscopy","Chains; Chemical detection; Infrared spectroscopy; Laser ablation; Numerical methods; Quantum chemistry; Signal to noise ratio; Spectral resolution; Coupled-cluster calculations; Cumulenes; High signal-to-noise ratio; High spectral resolution; Hot band; Quantum chemical calculations; Quantum chemical studies; Vibrational fundamentals; Sulfur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020705272

Acknowledging this, an array of federal regulations and policies have emerged that requires US National Forests to report baseline carbon stocks and changes due to disturbance and management and assess how management activities and forest plans affect carbon stocks. To address these requirements with the best-available science, we compiled empirical and remotely sensed data covering the National Forests (one fifth of the area of US forest land) and analyzed this information using a carbon modeling framework. We demonstrate how integration of various data and models provides a comprehensive evaluation of key drivers of observed carbon trends, for individual National Forests. The models in this framework complement each other with different strengths: the Carbon Calculation Tool uses inventory data to report baseline carbon stocks; the Forest Carbon Management Framework integrates inventory data, disturbance histories, and growth and yield trajectories to report relative effects of disturbances on carbon stocks; and the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Model incorporates disturbance, climate, and atmospheric data to determine their relative impacts on forest carbon accumulation and loss. We report results for several National Forests across the USA and compare their carbon dynamics. Results show that recent disturbances are causing some forests to transition from carbon sinks to sources, particularly in the West. Meanwhile, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen deposition are consistently increasing carbon stocks, partially offsetting declines due to disturbances and aging. Climate variability introduces concomitant interannual variability in net carbon uptake or release. Targeting forest disturbance and post-disturbance regrowth is critical to management objectives that involve maintaining or enhancing future carbon sequestration. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Climate change; Ecosystem model; Forest carbon; Forest inventory; National Forests","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Ecology; Ecosystems; Land use; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide removal; Comprehensive evaluation; Ecosystem model; Forest carbons; Forest inventory; Interannual variability; National forests; Forestry; anthropogenic effect; baseline conditions; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; data assimilation; disturbance; ecosystem modeling; environmental factor; federal system; forest; growth; inventory; land management; nitrogen; project assessment; yield; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026918281

These simulations provided boundary concentrations for base and natural background simulations with the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) on a North American domain (one-way nested) at 12 km 12 km resolution over March-September 2010. The predicted maximum daily average 8 h (MDA8) background ozone for the US is largest in the mountainous areas of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. The background MDA8 ozone in some of these locations exceeds 60 ppb, when averaged over the 10 days with the largest base-case ozone (T10base average). The background ozone generally becomes both a larger fraction of the base-case ozone in the western US and a smaller fraction in the eastern US when proceeding from spring to summer to the T10base average. The ozone difference between the base and background cases represents the increment to ozone from all anthropogenic sources. The path-integral method was applied to allocate this anthropogenic ozone increment to US anthropogenic emissions, Canadian/Mexican anthropogenic emissions, and the anthropogenic components of the lateral and top boundary concentrations (BCs). Using the T10base average MDA8 ozone, the relative importance of the sources is generally US emissions >anthropogenic lateral BCs > Canadian/Mexican emissions anthropogenic top BCs. Specifically, for 10 US urban areas, the source contributions were 12-53 ppb for US emissions, 3-9 ppb for lateral BCs, 0.2-3 ppb for Canadian/Mexican emissions, and 0.1 ppb for top BCs. The contributions of the lateral BCs are largest for the higherelevation US sites in the Intermountain West and along the western boundary of the domain. In Denver, for example, the lateral BCs contribute 44% to the T10base anthropogenic increment. Averaging over the 10 days in the background case with the largest MDA8 ozone (T10bkgd), the contribution from US emissions is reduced to 3-13 ppb at the 10 urban sites, leading to a reduction in the anthropogenic ozone increment. The contribution of the Canadian/Mexican emissions remains about the same (0.3-2 ppb), and the contribution from the lateral BCs increases (5-10 ppb), especially at the lower-elevation urban sites. The net effect at the urban sites is that the relative importance of the anthropogenic lateral BCs is significantly greater for the T10bkgd average than the T10base average. This is also true for rural sites studied, where the anthropogenic lateral BC contribution becomes as large as 68% of the anthropogenic increment for the T10bkgd average. In addition to the source apportionment, we also used surface and ozonesonde measurements to evaluate GEOS-Chem and CAMx performance.",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; carbon emission; concentration (composition); EOS; estimation method; ozone; seasonal variation; Arizona; California; Colorado; Denver; New Mexico; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032016891

Many different materials have been proposed for use in such a process, the process requiring fast CO2 absorption reaction kinetics as well as being able to cycle the material for multiple cycles without loss of capacity. Lithium ternary oxide materials, and in particular Li2ZrO3, have displayed promising performance, but further modifications are needed to improve their rate of reaction with CO2. Previous studies have linked rates of lithium ionic conduction with CO2 absorption in similar materials, and in this work we present work aimed at exploring the effect of aliovalent doping on the efficacy of Li2ZrO3 as a CO2 sorbent. Using a combination of X-ray powder diffraction, theoretical calculations, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we studied the impact of Nb, Ta, and Y doping on the structure, Li ionic motion, and CO2 absorption properties of Li2ZrO3. These methods allowed us to characterize the theoretical and experimental doping limit into the pure material, suggesting that vacancies formed upon doping are not fully disordered but instead are correlated to the dopant atom positions, limiting the solubility range. Characterization of the lithium motion using variable-temperature solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance confirms that interstitial doping with Y retards the movement of Li ions in the structure, whereas vacancy doping with Nb or Ta results in a similar activation energy as observed for nominally pure Li2ZrO3. However, a marked reduction in the CO2 absorption of the Nb- and Ta-doped samples suggests that doping also leads to a change in the carbonation equilibrium of Li2ZrO3, disfavoring the CO2 absorption at the reaction temperature. This study shows that a complex mixture of structural, kinetic, and dynamic factors can influence the performance of Li-based materials for CCS and underscores the importance of balancing these different factors in order to optimize the process. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation energy; Calculations; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Doping (additives); Lithium; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Reaction kinetics; Thermogravimetric analysis; Vacancies; X ray powder diffraction; Aliovalent doping; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); First-principles calculation; Reaction temperature; Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance; Ternary oxide material; Theoretical calculations; Variable temperature; Nuclear magnetic resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031330383

We assembled a comprehensive database of fertilizer management studies with data on N2O (417 observations, 27 studies) and NO3 (388 observations, 25 studies) losses associated with 4R fertilizer N management in North American corn-cropping systems. Only one study measured both losses, and studies of N2O and NO3 differed by location, time period, and management practices. Meta-analysis of side-by-side comparisons found significant yield-scaled N2O emission reductions when SUPERU replaced urea or UAN, and when urea replaced anhydrous ammonia.

This was done using simulation model applications designed for reporting according to the Helcom (Helsinki Commission) and Kyoto protocols. Using model simulations based on modified crops N dynamics and SOC were assessed for three agro-ecological regions (latitudes ranging 55°20′–60°40′ N) in Sweden over a 20-year period. The modified N use properties of spring barley were implemented in the SOILNDB model (simulating soil C, N, water and heat, and plant N dynamics) by changing the parameters for root N uptake efficiency and plant N demand within a range given by previous model applications to different crops. A doubling of the daily N uptake efficiency and increased N demand (by ca 30%) reduced N leaching by 24%–31%, increased plant N content by 9%–12%, depending on region. The effects of the modified crop on SOC was simulated with the ICBM model, resulting in an increased SOC content (0–25 cm depth) by 57–79 kg C ha−1 y−1. The results suggest that a modified crop might reduce N leaching from spring barley area, in a range similar to the targets of relevant environmental protection directives, a result which held more in the northern than southern regions.

Simple approaches are a useful first step in this direction but may not be applicable for certain climatic conditions. To improve the ability of the reduced-complexity Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) Earth system model DCESS to address cold climate conditions, we reformulated the model's land biosphere module by extending it to include three dynamically varying vegetation zones as well as a permafrost component. The vegetation zones are formulated by emulating the behaviour of a complex land biosphere model. We show that with the new module, the size and timing of carbon exchanges between atmosphere and land are represented more realistically in cooling and warming experiments. In particular, we use the new module to address carbon cycling and climate change across the last glacial transition. Within the constraints provided by various proxy data records, we tune the DCESS model to a Last Glacial Maximum state and then conduct transient sensitivity experiments across the transition under the application of explicit transition functions for high-latitude ocean exchange, atmospheric dust, and the land ice sheet extent. We compare simulated time evolutions of global mean temperature, pCO2, atmospheric and oceanic carbon isotopes as well as ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations with proxy data records. In this way we estimate the importance of different processes across the transition with emphasis on the role of land biosphere variations and show that carbon outgassing from permafrost and uptake of carbon by the land biosphere broadly compensate for each other during the temperature rise of the early last deglaciation. © Author(s) 2017.",,"biosphere; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate; climate change; concentration (composition); dissolved oxygen; ice sheet; last deglaciation; Last Glacial Maximum; permafrost; proxy climate record; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029911733

In particular, this region has thousands of hectares of apple orchards, which have an important socioeconomic impact on the life of people. Climate and land cover changes over the past several decades threaten the apple orchards phenology (AOP). Recent studies have emphasized the effect of temperature on plant phenology; however, they have overlooked the influence of land cover changes, such as Lake Desiccation, on plant phenology. Meanwhile, how climate change and Lake Desiccation will affect the AOP is still not very well understood. Therefore, in this study, we used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) extracted from remote sensing images acquired by the MODIS sensor spanning from 2003 to 2014, in order to extract the AOP events. Furthermore, we used a random forest regression (RFR) for analyzing the relationship between temperature changes/Lake Desiccation and AOP. The results revealed that EVI is a very useful tool for estimating the AOP with a mean root-mean-square error of 6.25 days. Moreover, there is a linear trend toward the early start of season in this region. The end of season (EOS) and the growing season length have also increased in the areas closer to the lake until 2008. This seems that the delayed EOS in the area closest to Urmia Lake has been associated with the lake microclimate since 2008. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Land cover change; Phenology; Temperature change","Agriculture; Biology; Decision trees; Driers (materials); Economics; Farms; Food supply; Forestry; Fruits; Image reconstruction; Lakes; Mean square error; Orchards; Remote sensing; Agricultural productions; Enhanced vegetation index; Growing season lengths; Land-cover change; Phenology; Root mean square errors; Socio-economic impacts; Temperature changes; Climate change; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028032127

The methodology relates the different passive strategies suitable for major climate conditions in MENA region (dry-hot) to design parameters that create the urban form. This parametric design approach is the basis for a tool that generates conceptual climate responsive urban forms so as to assist the urban designer early in the design process.

One area of consideration is the built environment. A number of challenges have emerged due to the current design of most major cities. The notion of Biophilic Urbanism refers to the use of natural elements as purposeful design features in urban landscapes in order to address climate change issues in rapidly growing economies. Five case studies and twenty six interviews were conducted to interrogate examples of successful biophilic cities – Portland, Chicago, Toronto, Berlin and Singapore. This investigation was conducted to capture the method of economic enquiry used to inform Biophilic Urbanism. Findings indicated the explicit or implicit use of ecological knowledge in decision making. We present an extension to the theory of ecosystem services in the form of ‘biophilic services’, which we propose play an influential role in informing decisions regarding whether to incorporate biophilic urbanism in city environments. We also present the underlying logic that appears to be informing biophilic urbanism. The existing Ecosystem Services model for decision making is adapted to provide a decision making flow for biophilic urbanism. Not only do the components of the model (i.e. ‘Pressure’, ‘Context of Value’, ‘Biophilic Services’ and ‘Valuation’) accommodate the iterative, snowballing dynamism necessary within biophilic-related decisions; the model also highlights the significant role of each component in informing the final decision. We conclude from this study a number of opportunities for governments, as well as for other stakeholders involved in the decision making process, to use economics in a holistic way to strengthen the case for biophilic urbanism. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH","Biophilic decision model; Biophilic services; Biophilic urbanism; Built environment; Decision making; Ecosystem services","conceptual framework; decision making; ecosystem service; global warming; government; numerical model; stakeholder; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; urban area; urban design; urban economy; urban planning; urban policy; Australia; Berlin; Canada; Chicago; Germany; Illinois; Ontario [Canada]; Portland [Victoria]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Toronto; United States; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006970910

This work, therefore, focused on the effects of the polarization charge for GaN and AlGaN with three different aluminum concentrations 15%, 25%, and 35%. The band bending of AlxGa1-xN surfaces was measured after a N2/H2 plasma pretreatment, which reduced the carbon and oxygen contamination below the detection limit of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface band bending was then related to surface states, where the band bending of oxygen-free surfaces - as obtained with a high-temperature, immersed hydrogen/nitrogen plasma clean - scales with the aluminum content. In addition, the band offsets at the plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited SiO2/AlxGa1-xN interface were measured, giving 3.4 eV, 3.3 eV, 3.3 eV, and 3.0 eV for respective 0%, 15%, 25%, and 35% aluminum concentrations.

This research estimated existing and potential, tree cover, and its contribution to ecosystem services in 10 megacity metropolitan areas, across 5 different continents and biomes. We developed estimates for each megacity using local data to transform i-Tree Eco estimates of tree cover benefits to reductions in air pollution, stormwater, building energy, and carbon emissions for London, UK. The transformation used biophysical scaling equations based on local megacity tree cover, human population, air pollution, climate, energy use, and purchasing power parity. The megacity metropolitan areas ranged from 1173 to 18,720 sq km (median value 2530 sq km), with median tree cover 21%, and potential tree cover another 19% of the city. Megacities had a median tree cover density of 39 m2/capita, much smaller than the global average value of 7800 m2/capita, with density lower in desert and tropical biomes, and higher in temperate biomes. The present median benefit value from urban trees in all 10 megacities can be estimated as $482 million/yr due to reductions in CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5, $11 million/yr due to avoided stormwater processing by wastewater facilities, $0.5 million/yr due to building energy heating and cooling savings, and $8 million/yr due to CO2 sequestration. Planting more trees in potential tree cover areas could nearly double the benefits provided by the urban forest. In 2016 there were 40 megacities, totaling 722 million residents, nearly 10% of the human population, who would benefit from nature conservation plans where they work and live. Nature conservation strategies in megacities should work to sustain and grow the benefits of the urban forest, and improve accounting methods to include additional ecosystem services provided by the urban forest. © 2017","Biophysical scaling; Conservation; Ecological model; Ecosystem service; Urban nature","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Carbon; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Nitrogen compounds; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Storms; Biophysical scaling; Conservation strategies; Ecological modeling; Ecosystem services; Implementation strategies; Purchasing power parity; Urban nature; Wastewater facilities; Forestry; biodiversity; biome; biophysics; carbon emission; conservation planning; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem service; estimation method; megacity; metropolitan area; nature conservation; urban forestry; vegetation cover; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026519709

Our current understanding on the state of adaptation is limited, however, both globally and in Africa in particular. This study examines the status of adaptation in the Sahel by reviewing the primary peer review literature that reports concrete climate change adaptation actions. Based on an analysis of 70 peer review papers that document 414 discrete adaptations, we create a snap shot of adaptations developed between 1975 and 2015, and also calculate the percentages of adaptation. The results show that from a country to country perspective, Kenya has the highest number of reported adaptation actions (75 or 18.1%). The percentages indicate that the adaptive capacity of the entire study area is generally low for all the countries being that the highest country-level percentage is recorded in Kenya and it is 18%. Regionally, West Africa has more adaptation actions (261 or 63%) when compared to other regions of the Sahel. Regional level percentages suggest a higher level of adaptation at the regional level being that the percentage falls within the high scale range. The most commonly used adaptation actions reported are income diversification and water harnessing respectively. When categorized, technically related adaptation actions dominate the adaptation charts. The decade 2008–2016 recorded the highest number of adaptations (65.2%). Adaptation actions are also reported to be triggered by climatic and non-climatic drivers which both record high frequencies but the climatic drivers (98%) of adaptation are slightly dominant relative to the non-climatic drivers (95%). These results should be viewed as proxies of climate change adaptation as much information may be found in grey literature and non-peer review national communications which are left out here because of their relative low standardization and acceptability due to the absence of peer review. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Income diversification; Sahel; Technical adaptation; West Africa","water; adaptation; Article; climate change; drought; ecosystem; environmental change; food insecurity; human; income; Kenya; precipitation; priority journal; Sahel; systematic review",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020469087

In the spirit of Heimann's original categorization scheme for carbon-only materials, we here report an ab initio method to create triangular (ternary) maps based on their valence-orbital mixing. These maps group together allotropes of similar electronic structure––and, hence, physical properties––and can thus aid in finding allotropes with specific features. Moreover, these maps can be used to classify all carbon allotropes according to their bonding nature. We suggest to extract insights about the composition of the crystal wave function as emerging from individual atomic orbitals. To do so, we develop a way to visualize the entire linear-coefficient space of an extended LCAO wave function, also based on ternary diagrams. This scheme yields that lower-level mixed states always get realized and filled first before higher-level mixed states can be created, a consequence of symmetry breaking of canonical orbitals within the solid state. For the specific case of graphite, there is more sp mixing than in sp2 mixing present, while diamond exhibits more sp and sp2 mixing than sp3 mixing. Once higher-level mixing is realized, however, these levels are more significant for the allotropes’ properties than the lower-level ones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Carbon; Electronic structure; Mixing; Quantum chemistry; Ab initio method; Atomic orbital; Bonding nature; Carbon allotropes; Linear coefficients; Symmetry-breaking; Ternary diagrams; Valence orbitals; Wave functions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027495645

Representatives of indigenous peoples have in fact since 2008 been actively seeking a role in contributing to combating climate change through their participation in international environmental conferences, as well as by means of activism and political engagement at local and national levels. Using examples from the Amazonian region in the east of Ecuador, home to indigenous communities such as the Huaorani, Sápara and Sarayaku Kichwa originary peoples, this article argues that indigenous peoples, particularly forest dwellers, have a dual role in combating climate change. First, colonized forest peoples have continued to resist the occupation and deforestation of lands they have lived in for centuries; second, a number of indigenous forest communities have since the 1990s become aware of their responsibility to protect the forests in the interests of combating climate change. They have recognized the potential for their having decision-making power at a local and global level that may contribute to saving the planet. In the last 10 years indigenous peoples’ representatives have been collectively engaged in lobbying for inclusion in intergovernmental climate change negotiations and to have decision-making power at the United Nations. This comment calls for international support from governments and civil society from both North and South, at the United Nations and at other international fora, to uphold the rights of indigenous peoples—enshrined in international law—who wish to prevent incursions into their territory for the extraction of fossil fuels. Moreover, it calls on governments, (I)NGOs, and private companies engaged in the extractive industries, and in other processes of modernization and development, to respect the right of indigenous peoples not to develop and to choose for themselves the level of their integration into the global economy and polity. The choice not to develop, not to have access to the modern world through roads, for example, is itself a contribution to protecting the rainforest and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This article draws on existing scholarly literature on the Ecuadorian Amazonian indigenous peoples, primary research among Huaorani and Sarayaku Kichwa communities of Eastern Ecuador 2016–2017, and documents from the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) 26 April—6 May 2017.

However, on a regional scale, atmospheric Hg concentration or deposition trends vary to such an extent during the industrial period that the consequences of recent Asian emissions on atmospheric Hg levels are still unclear. Here we present a 320 year Hg deposition history for Central Asia, based on a continuous high-resolution ice-core Hg record from the Belukha glacier in the Siberian Altai, covering the time period 1680-2001. Hg concentrations and deposition fluxes start rising above background levels at the beginning of the 19th century due to emissions from gold/silver mining and Hg production. A steep increase occurs after the 1940s culminating during the 1970s, at the same time as the maximum Hg use in consumer products in Europe and North America. After a distinct decrease in the 1980s, Hg levels in the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s return to their maximum values, which we attribute to increased Hg emissions from Asia. Thus, rising Hg emissions from coal combustion and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Asian countries determine recent atmospheric Hg levels in Central Asia, counteracting emission reductions due to control measures in Europe and North America. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Consumer products; Deposition; Economic geology; Emission control; Heavy metals; Particulate emissions; Anthropogenic emissions; Background level; Control measures; Deposition fluxes; Emission reduction; Hg concentrations; Ice core records; Toxic heavy metals; Coal combustion; coal; gold; mercury; silver; mercury; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; coal combustion; concentration (composition); emission; heavy metal; ice core; mercury (element); nineteenth century; twentieth century; air pollution; Arctic; Article; Asia; combustion; Europe; glacier; ice core record; mineral dust; mining; North America; Northern Hemisphere; volcano; air pollutant; analysis; Asia; environmental monitoring; pollution; Altai Mountains; Altay [Russian Federation]; Belukha Glacier; Russian Federation; Air Pollutants; Asia; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Europe; Mercury; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031790473

Both geometry optimizations of the molecular structure and optimization of the cell size were performed. While cell parameters and heavier atom positions determined at the GGA level are very close to the experimental ones, there are important discrepancies in the positioning of the hydrogen atoms. As a result of these calculations, it was shown that the assignment of the peroxydic hydrogens and the peroxydic bond in the experimental structure was incorrect. A more accurate structure is presented and geometrical as well as cell parameters described. It is also shown that LDA is not accurate enough to describe this type of ionic crystals, because of overbinding of the ions, leading to incorrect cell parameters and volume.

Coupled outdoor-indoor simulations were applied to overcome the incapability of packages to do both jobs in one tool and to account for the effects of adaptation of urban greenery on the indoor performance since indoor simulations tools does not consider microclimatic interactions. In addition to the three types of urban trees which modeling parameters were measured, green roofs and facades were applied. Present and future (2020, 2050 and 2080) microclimatic effects of the green cover of two case studies in different climatic zones were compiled conjunctionally in a TMY2 weather files to relate ENVI-metV4.0 simulations (accounting for outdoor conditions) with indoor simulations using DesignBuilderV4.2 which has been applied to predict sites' energy efficiency. Results show that even if TMY3 weather files are available, which is not for many countries including Egypt, it will not account for urban microclimate and vegetation effects of local sites when only indoor simulations take place. Thermal comfort (PMV) and air temperature (Ta) maps' results of both cases outdoor adapted conditions showed cool spots at the center of communities. Those cool spots improvements decrease by 2080 due the effects of climate change. Whole site averages of (Ta) showed increased records for the adapted cases owed to the suggested green façade coverage which draws attention to the sensitive plantation of building walls as well as the coverage percentage of urban trees that might traps heat. In comparison to their un-adapted cases, the least energy efficiency result for whole site was 10.0% corresponding to 23.8% cost saving at 2080 in case two whereas the maximum was 21.3% corresponding to 35.7% cost savings at present day.

In 1954 Harmon Craig suggested a value of 2.0 for the fractionation ratio b that is used to correct 14C/12C ratios for shifts in the 13C/12C ratios and this value has been applied by the radiocarbon community ever since. While theoretical considerations suggest moderate deviations of b from 2.0, some measurements have suggested larger differences (e.g. b = 2.3, measured by Saliège and Fontes in 1984). With the high precision attained in radiocarbon measurements today (±2‰), even a relatively small deviation of b from 2.0 can impact the accuracy of radiocarbon data, and it is, therefore, of interest to re-evaluate the fractionation corrections. In the present study, the fractionation ratio b was determined by independent experiments on the chemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to elemental carbon (graphitization reaction) and on the photosynthetic uptake of CO2 by C3 and C4 plants. The results yielded b = 1.882 ± 0.019 for the reduction of CO2 to solid graphite and b = 1.953 ± 0.025 for the weighted mean of measurements involving C3 and C4 photosynthesis pathways. In addition, the analysis of over 9600 full-sized OX-I and OX-II normalizing standards measured between 2002 and 2012 confirms b values lower than 2.0. The obtained values are in good agreement with quantum mechanical estimates of the equilibrium fractionation and classic kinetic fractionation as well as with results from other light three-isotope systems (oxygen, magnesium, silicon and sulfur). While the value of the fractionation ratio varies with the relative importance of kinetic and equilibrium fractionation, the values obtained in the present study cluster around b = 1.9. Our findings suggest that a significant fraction of all samples (“unknowns”) would be shifted by 2‰ (16 radiocarbon years) or more due to this effect: for example, for b = 1.882, between 16.8% and 25.9% of almost 60,000 radiocarbon values measured at the Keck Carbon Cycle AMS facility between 2002 and 2012 would be affected.

These four inter-connected response actions (mitigation, adaptation, monitoring and prediction) constitute the main strategies for managing climate change. This paper aims to weigh in on policies and societal coordination for effective management of the earth’s climate with respect to these four elements in Africa because of its socioeconomic peculiarities. Design/methodology/approach: The Delphi experts’ method backed by questionnaires was used to obtain relevant data for the study. The questionnaires were distributed to professionals dealing with issues related to climate change response and sustainability in various parts of the world, with a focus on Africa. Findings: With respect to the strategies that are most needed for effective climate change actions in Africa, government’s policies, activities and decisions rank highest at 1.20 with a p-value of < 0.001, and financing is next at 0.93, mitigation is 0.83, prediction is 0.76 and adaptation is 0.68 (p = 0.048), at the 5 per cent cutoff. Also, for the most appropriate approaches to managing climate change across Africa, regional efforts are at least 8 times more effective than country-wide approaches, followed by continental efforts at 6.51 times, international cooperation at 3.99 times and inaction at 0.00 times. Originality/value: The paper concludes that a holistic climate change management approach is important in Africa to contain the impacts of climate change in the continent. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Africa-wide efforts; Climate change management; Climate financing; Climate governance; Climate monitoring; Regional response","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; international cooperation; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030319890

In this scenario the direct injection system plays a key role for both diesel and gasoline engines. The spray dynamic behaviour is crucial in defining the global and the local air index of the mixture, which in turns affects the combustion process development. At the same time it is widely recognized that the spray formation is influenced by numerous parameters, among which also the cavitation process inside every single hole of the injector nozzle. The proper prediction of the cavitation development inside the injector nozzle holes is crucial in predicting the liquid jet emerging from them. In this mechanism the CFD simulation is of great importance because of the too small dimension of the nozzle holes, which are mostly non suitable for an accurate experimental investigation and, when they are, these analyses need to be limited to a few cases for cost reasons. Nowadays the most used cavitation model is the two-phase homogeneous mixture model, especially with the Raleigh-Plesset closure model. In the literature it is possible to find out multiple examples of validation attempts of such a model versus experimental data: generally they fail because of the systematic overestimation of the mass flow with respect to the experimental data. The main parameters identified as responsible are the fluid properties, mostly in terms of the liquid density value, and the mesh setup. The focus of the present paper is to investigate the effective weight of each single fluid parameter, both for liquid and vapor phase, plus the mesh setup on the final pressure difference-mass flow rate curve, in terms of curve shape, curve values and evaluation of the cavitation onset/development.

As such, water infiltration will be reduced, and the volume of surface runoff will be increased. By retaining stormwater, best management practices (BMPs) are used to mitigate the hydrologic effects of urbanization. Using the Ludlow watershed in northern Kentucky as a case study, the main objective of this paper was to identify the most cost-effective arrangement of BMPs in reducing surface runoff. A simulation program was employed to model the hydrologic conditions in the Ludlow watershed under the current and future climate conditions and to identify the most cost-effective BMP arrangement. The results show that the simulation program is an effective tool in simulating a small watershed. Indeed, BMPs are instrumental in reducing surface runoff even when the future climate becomes drier. The most cost-effective BMP arrangement is to install two infiltration trenches and one bioretention in the watershed.

Deep roots connect deep soil/groundwater to the atmosphere, thus influencing the hydrologic cycle and climate. Deep roots enhance bedrock weathering, thus regulating the long-term carbon cycle. However, we know little about how deep roots go and why. Here, we present a global synthesis of 2,200 root observations of >1,000 species along biotic (life form, genus) and abiotic (precipitation, soil, drainage) gradients. Results reveal strong sensitivities of rooting depth to local soil water profiles determined by precipitation infiltration depth from the top (reflecting climate and soil), and groundwater table depth from below (reflecting topography-driven land drainage). In well-drained uplands, rooting depth follows infiltration depth; in waterlogged lowlands, roots stay shallow, avoiding oxygen stress below the water table; in between, high productivity and drought can send roots many meters down to the groundwater capillary fringe. This framework explains the contrasting rooting depths observed under the same climate for the same species but at distinct topographic positions. We assess the global significance of these hydrologic mechanisms by estimating root water-uptake depths using an inverse model, based on observed productivity and atmosphere, at 30″ (∼1-km) global grids to capture the topography critical to soil hydrology. The resulting patterns of plant rooting depth bear a strong topographic and hydrologic signature at landscape to global scales. They underscore a fundamental plant–water feedback pathway that may be critical to understanding plant-mediated global change. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, being able to predict the incidence of this phenomenon is of vital importance for the engine process simulation - a tool widely used in the engine development. Common knock models in the 0D/1D simulation are based on the calculation of a pre-reaction state of the unburnt mixture (also called knock integral), which is a simplified approach for modeling the progress of the chemical reactions in the end gas where knock occurs. Simulations of thousands of knocking single working cycles with a model representing the Entrainment model’s unburnt zone were performed using a detailed chemical reaction mechanism. The investigations showed that, at specific boundary conditions, the auto-ignition of the unburnt mixture resulting in knock happens in two stages. It is demonstrated that the commonly used knock integral is not capable of representing this behavior of the detailed chemical mechanism, meaning an improved approach for modeling the progress of the chemical reactions is needed for the calculation of the knock boundary. Based on these findings, a new two-stage knock integral approach capable of reproducing the auto-ignition behavior of the detailed chemical mechanism was developed. For this purpose, an enhanced three zone approach for modeling the influence of various parameters (pressure, temperature, exhaust gas fraction, air-fuel ratio, ethanol content and surrogate composition) on the ignition delay times of the mixture is proposed. Furthermore, a newly developed model for the ignition delay of the low-temperature ignition as a function of the boundary conditions is presented. Finally, the performance of the new two-stage approach is demonstrated and compared with the results achieved by the commonly used single-stage knock integral.

An emergy-based embodied carbon indicator system was also set up to evaluate the low-carbon system performance. The case study of a typical industrial park in Beijing shows that the embodied carbon emissions of the whole process are mainly concentrated on the outside inputs, waste management and water recycling, of which the outside inputs have lower embodied carbon emission intensities than those of the waste management and water recycling sectors. The embodied carbon emission intensity associated with the exploitation of local renewable resources is lower than that of non-renewable resources. The embodied carbon-related sustainability indicator (ESICO2) is large, implying that the case park can sustain a balance between embodied carbon emission level and environment supporting ability. Particularly, the embodied carbon emission intensity of waste management per unit emergy yield is low, indicating that the environmental remediation cost of the total production of case park is relatively small. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Embodied carbon emissions; Emergy analysis; Low-carbon industrial park","Environmental protection; Recycling; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Waste management; Water recycling; Embodied carbons; Emergy analysis; Emergy evaluation; Environmental remediation; Indicator system; Industrial parks; Non-renewable resource; Sustainability indicators; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949034541

Adaptation to climate risks that can no longer be avoided is an important aspect of the global response to climate change. Humans have always adapted to changing climatic conditions, and there is growing, if still patchy, evidence of widespread adaptation behavior. However, adaptation is not autonomous as sometimes claimed. It requires knowledge, planning, coordination, and foresight. There are important knowledge gaps, behavioral barriers, and market failures that hold back effective adaptation and require policy intervention. We identify the most urgent adaptation priorities, including areas where delay might lock in future vulnerability, and outline the decision-making challenges of adapting to an unknown future climate. We also highlight the strong interlinkages between adaptation and economic development, pointing out that decisions on industrial strategy, urban planning, and infrastructure investment all have a strong bearing on future vulnerability to climate change. We review the implications of these links for adaptation finance and what the literature tells us about the balance between adaptation and mitigation. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

Estimating the corresponding change in population exposure and PM2:5-attributable risk of death prior to the year 2000 is made difficult by the lack of PM2:5 monitoring data. OBJECTIVES: We used a new technique to estimate historical PM2:5 concentrations, and estimated the effects of changes in PM2:5 population exposures on mortality in adults (age ≥30 y), and on life expectancy at birth, in the contiguous United States during 1980–2010. METHODS: We estimated annual mean county-level PM2:5 concentrations in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 using universal kriging incorporating geographic variables. County-level death rates and national life tables for each year were obtained from the U.S. Census and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used log-linear and nonlinear concentration–response coefficients from previous studies to estimate changes in the numbers of deaths and in life years and life expectancy at birth, attributable to changes in PM2:5. RESULTS: Between 1980 and 2010, population-weighted PM2:5 exposures fell by about half, and the estimated number of excess deaths declined by about a third. The States of California, Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia had some of the largest estimated reductions in PM2:5 -attributable deaths. Relative to a counterfactual population with exposures held constant at 1980 levels, we estimated that people born in 2050 would experience an ∼ 1-y increase in life expectancy at birth, and that there would be a cumulative gain of 4.4 million life years among adults ≥30 y of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest that declines in PM2:5 exposures between 1980 and 2010 have benefitted public health. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

We used the time series of data from DMSP-OLS images to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of urban development in 48 Algerian provinces from 1993 to 2012. A systematic nighttime light calibration method was used to improve the consistency and comparability of the DSMP-OSL images and then a separation is made between light detected from human settlements and light detected from gas flaring in order to allow us to study human settlements without other light emissions and then assess the suitability of using DMSP data in southern Algeria and its ability to monitor gas flaring. Linear regression methods were developed to identify the dynamic change of nighttime light and estimated its growth directions at pixel level. This work is the first to use nighttime light observations to detect and monitor the growth of human settlements in North Africa. In this study, we made use of DMSP-OLS data as a return ticket to the years of crises and we found the most affected provinces during that period. The DMSP-OLS data proved to be an index of growth in the economy during the period of stability in Algeria expressed by positive dynamic changes in the lighted area in all Algerian provinces. We used NTL data as an alternative to annual growth indexes for each province, which are unavailable, and its help as a monitoring system for socioeconomic parameters to fill the gap of data availability.

This comparative study offers insights on climate change risk perceptions and attitudes among environmental, economic and social stakeholders in coastal areas in northeastern Spain and South Australia, as well as compares interviewed stakeholders’ risk perceptions with available documentary data and participant observation. Using a community risk assessment approach, the results show that some stakeholders perceive that climate change is already and/or may further continue to affect their employment, mostly in a predominantly negative way. Interestingly, some other interviewed stakeholders consider that climate change creates opportunities through new and additional areas of work. The findings also suggest that climate change may influence relocation of coastal residential populations in both case studies, which is likely to be an acceptable option among the stakeholders.

A field trial was carried out to evaluate the short-term effects of soil amendment with solid olive mill waste (OMW) and its compost in comparison to the olive mill waste derived from the new two-phase treatment (humid OMW) and its resulting compost. The impact of treatments on soil water extractable organic matter and soil microbiota was determined. During a 120 days-long field trial, it was observed an initial increase of water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), total reducing sugars and total phenol compounds for all the amended soils. Even if humid OMW had the highest WEOC and total phenol compounds concentration, it increased to a lesser extent their content in the soil, probably due to the rapid utilisation of this particular organic matter by microorganisms. After three days from spreading, all amendments induced rapid modifications of both fungal and bacterial communities. However, while the bacterial community restored its initial state at the end of the trial, suggesting their high resilience capacity, the fungal populations changes remained until 120 days. The overall results indicated that all types of the organic materials tested as soil amendments had an impact on the soil microbial communities, especially in the early days of the field trial, without negative effects on the soil chemical characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Compost; Field trial; Microbial community; Olive mill waste; Water extractable organic matter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021922355

Here, we present a new hybrid system combining a supramolecular photonic gel of naphthalimidederived molecules self-assembled into fibers and upconverting NaYF4:Yb/Tm nanoparticles (UCNPs). The hybrid system presented here manipulates light reversibly as a result of an optical communication between the UCNPs and the photoactive gel network. Upon UV irradiation, the system shows the characteristic emission at 410 nm from the photoactive organomolecule. This emission is also activated upon 980 nm excitation thanks to an efficient energy transfer from the UCNPs to the fibrillary network. Interestingly, the intensity of this emission is thermally regulated during the reversible assembly or disassembly of the organogelator molecules, in such a way that gelator emission is only observed in the aggregated state. Additionally, the adsorption of the UCNPs with the supramolecular gel fibers enhances their emissive properties, a behavior ascribed to the isolation from solvent quenchers and surface defects, as well as an increased IR light scattering promoted by the fibrillary network. The reported system constitutes a unique case of a thermally regulated, reversible, dual UV and IR light-harvesting hybrid soft material. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Energy transfer; Gelation; Harvesting; Hybrid systems; Irradiation; Light scattering; Molecules; Optical communication; Soft materials; Supramolecular chemistry; Surface defects; Characteristic emission; Efficient energy transfer; Emissive properties; Light-harvesting; Organo-gelator; Soft systems; UV irradiation; Visible emissions; Hybrid materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032811602

As the emission sources or adsorption sinks, land use and the corresponding landscape pattern unavoidably affect the concentration. However, the correlation varies with different regions and scales, leaving a significant gap for urban planning. This study clarifies the correlation with the aid of in situ and satellite-based spatial datasets over six urban agglomerations in China. Two coverage and four landscape indices are adopted to represent land use and landscape pattern. Specifically, the coverage indices include the area ratios of forest (F_PLAND) and built-up areas (C_PLAND). The landscape indices refer to the perimeter-area fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Then, the correlation between PMPM2.5 concentration with the selected indices are evaluated from supporting the potential urban planning. Results show that the correlations are weak with the in situ PMPM2.5 concentration, which are significant with the regional value. It means that land use coverage and landscape pattern affect PMPM2.5 at a relatively large scale. Furthermore, regional PMPM2.5 concentration negatively correlate to F_PLAND and positively to C_PLAND (significance at p &lt; 0.05), indicating that forest helps to improve air quality, while built-up areas worsen the pollution. Finally, the heterogeneous landscape presents positive correlation to the regional PMPM2.5 concentration in most regions, except for the urban agglomeration with highly-developed urban (i.e., the Jing-Jin-Ji and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations). It suggests that centralized urbanization would be helpful for PMPM2.5 pollution controlling by reducing the emission sources in most regions. Based on the results, the potential urban planning is proposed for controlling PMPM2.5 pollution for each urban agglomeration.","China; Land use; Landscape; PMPM2.5 concentration; Spatial variability","Agglomeration; Air quality; Forestry; Fractal dimension; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Pollution control; Urban planning; Area fractal dimensions; China; Fine particulate matter; Heterogeneous landscapes; Landscape; Positive correlations; Spatial variability; Urban agglomerations; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029395549

It has also been considered the outcome of evolutionary processes that vary over geographical space. We used six South American mammal groups to test the association of environmental and evolutionary factors and the ecological structuring of mammal assemblages with spatial variation in taxonomic richness (TR), at a spatial resolution of 110 km x 110 km, at tropical and extra-tropical latitudes. Based on attributes that represent what mammal species do in ecosystems, we estimated ecological diversity (ED) as a mean pairwise ecological distance between all co-occurring taxa. The mean pairwise phylogenetic distance between all co-occurring taxa (AvPD) was used as an estimation of phylogenetic diversity. Geographically Weighted Regression analyses performed separately for each mammal group identified tropical and extra-tropical high R2 areas where environmental and evolutionary factors strongly accounted for richness variation. Temperature was the most important predictor of TR in high R2 areas outside the tropics, as was AvPD within the tropics. The proportion of TR variation accounted for by environment (either independently or combined with AvPD) was higher in tropical areas of high richness and low ecological diversity than in tropical areas of high richness and high ecological diversity. In conclusion, we confirmed a shift in the impact of environmental factors, mainly temperature, that best account for mammal richness variation in extra-tropical regions, whereas phylogenetic diversity best accounts for richness variation within the tropics. Environment in combination with evolutionary history explained the coexistence of a high number of ecologically similar species within the tropics. Consideration of the influence of contemporary environmental variables and evolutionary history is crucial to understanding of the latitudinal diversity gradient. © 2017 Fergnani, Ruggiero.

This problem is further aggravated when adequate infrastructure is lacking to monitor the environmental impacts left by industries and refineries. In this study, a new protocol was designed combining biomonitoring and geostatistics to evaluate the possible effects of shale industry emissions on human health and wellbeing. Futhermore, the traditional and expensive air quality method based on PM2.5 measuring was also used to validate the low-cost geostatistical approach. Chemical analysis was performed using Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (EDXRF) to measure inorganic elements in tree bark and shale retorted samples in São Mateus do Sul city, Southern Brazil. Fe, S, and Si were considered potential pollutants in the study area. Distribution maps of element concentrations were generated from the dataset and used to estimate the spatial behavior of Fe, S, and Si and the range from their hot spot(s), highlighting the regions sorrounding the shale refinery. This evidence was also demonstrated in the measurements of PM2.5 concentrations, which are in agreement with the information obtained from the biomonitoring and geostatistical model. Factor and descriptive analyses performed on the concentrations of tree bark contaminants suggest that Fe, S, and Si might be used as indicators of industrial emissions. The number of cases of respiratory diseases obtained from local basic health unit were used to assess a possible correlation between shale refinery emissions and cases of repiratory disease. These data are public and may be accessed on the website of the the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Significant associations were found between the health data and refinery activities.

It is known that fertilizer application stimulates soil gaseous N losses, especially immediately after their application. In this short-term incubation experiment, the effects of different chabazite zeolite amendments on soil gaseous emissions (CO2, N2O, NOx and NH3) were evaluated in high resolution as potential mitigation strategy for agricultural soils. Different soil-zeolite mixtures, including both natural and NH4+-enriched chabazite zeolites, were incubated for 24 h both immediately after the application of urea fertilizer and without a further N input in order to carry out a high resolution investigation of soil CO2, N2O, NOx and NH3 fluxes, in comparison to an unamended soil. Immediate CO2, N2O, NOx and especially NH3 emissions after fertilizer application were generally reduced in soils amended with zeolites at natural state, indicating a potential valuable material for reducing soil C-N gaseous losses. On the other hand, the application of NH4+-enriched zeolites lowered CO2 and N2O emissions, but very high NOx fluxes occurred during the first 24 h even without applying any further N input. NH3 emissions were higher in NH4+-enriched zeolites amended soil, but if the amendment is performed without further N inputs, the emissions can be significantly lowered with respect to a conventional urea fertilization. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2; N2O; Natural zeolites; NH3; NOx; Soil emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021328867

National and European policies point towards the adoption of proper energy measures aiming at reducing the emissions. In this direction, Distributed Energy Systems (DESs) are considered as an alternative to the traditional centralized supply, since they allow producing energy that may be distributed to consumers. Yet, the energy interactions occurring among consumers and installers of DESs are modeled within the framework of the complex networks, where nodes stand for consumers and/or potential producers and links symbolize their energy exchanges. The model is based on a cost analysis and minimizes the energy provided from the traditional power plant when a network of distributed energy systems is constituted within the urban territory. Moreover, the impact that the decentralized production has on the centralized supply in terms of cost of the energy delivered to consumers is evaluated.

We assess alternative policies to achieve this goal in a world divided into two regions, one regulated with emissions pricing and one unregulated, supplied by multiple resource pools with different extraction costs and a carbon-free backstop whose costs decline over time. Global emissions can be reduced by combinations of three policies: (1) increasing the size of the regulated coalition, (2) raising the tax (or tightening the cap) within the regulated coalition, and (3) accelerating cost reductions of the clean technology. We ask how combinations achieving the same cumulative CO2 emissions (the “carbon budget”) affect the discounted surplus of regulated and unregulated consumers and the wealth of the extractors. We first evaluate these policy alternatives in a two-pool, theoretical model with high and low-cost extractors and, once tradeoffs are illuminated, in a calibrated oil market model. A global CO2 tax is both cost-effective and the best policy for regulated consumers. Extractors and unregulated consumers, however, prefer a technology-only policy. When the regulating coalition is subglobal, support for the clean substitute is desired and often required. But the preferred policy portfolio of the coalition involves a tighter cap and less technology policy than is globally optimal, leaving room for bargaining over who pays for clean innovation. © 2017","Cap-and-trade; Carbon tax; Climate change; Innovation; Spatial and intertemporal leakage","carbon budget; carbon emission; climate change; innovation; policy making; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020391109

While several Dutch cities have ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the implementation of renewable energy projects has been rather slow. The main reasons for this are the limited institutional capacities of local decision-makers, low levels of social acceptance of renewable-energy technologies, and limited opportunities for engagement of communities in decision-making processes. In order to address these issues we have developed an interactive planning support tool named COLLAGE for stakeholder participation in local renewable-energy planning. The goal of this paper is to analyze whether the COLLAGE tool helps to increase community engagement in renewable-energy projects and planning by increasing awareness and addressing social learning issues related to renewable-energy options. We tested the tool in a series of workshops with stakeholders and citizens from the city of Enschede, The Netherlands. The workshop results show that the tool helped involve stakeholders and communities in deciding where to locate renewable-energy facilities. It increased community members' awareness of the benefits of and requirements for renewable energy by disclosing the spatial consequences of overall municipal goals. We conclude that the COLLAGE tool can be an important building block towards new local energy governance. © 2017 by the authors.","Energy governance; Interactive mapping tools; Maptable; Renewable energy; Social acceptance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041617325

Stakeholder diversity in such systems often triggers power differences and disparity and the study explores the dual role of power disparity in collaborative settings. The purpose of this paper is to extend the power approach-inhibition model (Keltner et al., 2003) to the group level of analysis and argue that, on the positive side, power disparity increases the cognitive activity of the interacting groups (i.e. task-related debates), while on the other hand it generates a negative affective climate. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data at two time points across nine behavioral simulations (54 teams, 239 participants) designed to explore the cognitive and affective dynamics between six parties interacting in a collaborative decision task. Findings: The results show that power disparity increases cognitive activity in collaborative multi-party systems, while it hinders the affective climate, by increasing relationship conflict and decreasing psychological safety among the stakeholders. Practical implications: This study provides important theoretical and practical contributions mostly for the consultation processes, as interventions might be directed at fostering the positive effects of power disparity in collaborative setting, while mitigating its drawbacks. Originality/value: By extending the approach-inhibition model to the group level, this is one of the first empirical studies to examine the dual nature of the impact that power disparity has on the cognitive (i.e. positive effect) and affective (i.e. negative effect) dynamics of multi-party collaborative systems (i.e. multi-team systems). © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Conflict; Emergent states; Power disparity; Psychological safety",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029676463

The few remaining individuals occur in areas dominated by alien grasses like Urochloa decumbens. We tested the impact of nitrogen (N) availability and symbionts' presence on mitigating the effects of competition from U. decumbens. Dimorphandra wilsonii seedlings were 50-week pot-cultivated under limiting (3 mM) or non-limiting (10 mM) N, with or without U. decumbens, and inoculated or not with a N-fixer (Bradyrhizobium sp.) and an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF – Glomus etunicatum), both forming symbioses in the field. Since D. wilsonii seedlings grew more and ‘lost' fewer nutrients under the symbionts' presence, symbionts mitigated plant-plant competition. Under limiting N, inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings grew more (despite no nodulation), but N fixation was only suggested when inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings competed with U. decumbens. D. wilsonii 13C, and substrate's carbon and respiration suggest that only the microbes performing key functions received plant carbon. Under non-limiting N, inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings became enriched in 13C, substrate accumulated carbon and microbial respiration increased, suggesting a more generalist microbial community. Data suggest inoculating D. wilsonii seeds/seedlings with AMF and N-fixers as a conservation measure.

Such knowledge can be gained through studies of spatial population dynamics at climatic range margins. Here, using a butterfly (Pyrgus armoricanus) as model species, we first predicted based on species distribution modelling that its climatically suitable habitats currently extend north of its realized range. Projecting the model into scenarios of future climate, we showed that the distribution of climatically suitable habitats may shift northward by an additional 400 km in the future. Second, we used a 13-year monitoring dataset including the majority of all habitat patches at the species northern range margin to assess the synergetic impact of temperature fluctuations and spatial distribution of habitat, microclimatic conditions and habitat quality, on abundance and colonization–extinction dynamics. The fluctuation in abundance between years was almost entirely determined by the variation in temperature during the species larval development. In contrast, colonization and extinction dynamics were better explained by patch area, between-patch connectivity and host plant density. This suggests that the response of the species to future climate change may be limited by future land use and how its host plants respond to climate change. It is, thus, probable that dispersal limitation will prevent P. armoricanus from reaching its potential future distribution. We argue that models of range dynamics should consider the factors influencing metapopulation dynamics, especially at the range edges, and not only broad-scale climate. It includes factors acting at the scale of habitat patches such as habitat quality and microclimate and landscape-scale factors such as the spatial configuration of potentially suitable patches. Knowledge of population dynamics under various environmental conditions, and the incorporation of realistic scenarios of future land use, appears essential to provide predictions useful for actions mitigating the negative effects of climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

However, understanding of spatial and temporal LCC patterns in these environments is limited, particularly for semi-arid regions transitional between arid andmore mesic climates. Here, we use post-classification analysis of Landsat TM(1990), ETM+ (2003), and OLI (2013) satellite imagery to classify and assess net and gross LCC for the Chobe District, a 21,000 km2 area encompassing urban, peri-urban, rural, communally-managed (Chobe Enclave), and protected land (Chobe National Park, CNP, and six protected forest reserves). We then evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of LCC in relation to precipitation, fire detections (MCD14M, 2001-2013) fromthe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and dry season elephant (Loxodonta africana) aerial survey data (2003, 2006, 2012, 2013). Woodland cover declined over the study period by 1514 km2 (16.2% of initial class total), accompanied by expansion of shrubland (1305 km2, 15.7%) and grassland (265 km2, 20.3%). Net LCC differed importantly in protected areas, with higherwoodland losses observed in forest reserves compared to the CNP. Loss of woodland was also higher in communally-managed land for the study period, despite gains from 2003-2013. Gross (class) changes were characterized by extensive exchange between woodland and shrubland during both time steps, and a large expansion of shrubland into grassland and bare ground from 2003-2013. MODIS active fire detections were highly variable from year to year and among the different protected areas, ranging from 1.8 fires*year-1/km2 in the Chobe Forest Reserve to 7.1 fires*year-1/km2 in the Kasane Forest Reserve Extension. Clustering and timing of dry season fires suggests that ignitions were predominately from anthropogenic sources. Annual fire count was significantly related to total annual rainfall (p = 0.009, adj. R2 = 0.50), with a 41% increase in average fire occurrence in years when rainfall exceeded long-term mean annual precipitation (MAP). Loss of woodland was significantly associated with fire in locations experiencing 15 or more ignitions during the period 2001-2013 (p = 0.024). Although elephant-mediated damage is often cited as a major cause of woodland degradation in northern Botswana, we observed little evidence of unsustainable pressure on woodlands fromgrowing elephant populations. Our data indicate broad-scale LCC processes in semi-arid savannas in Southern Africa are strongly coupled to environmental and anthropogenic forcings. Increased seasonal variability is likely to have important effects on the distribution of savanna plant communities due to climate-fire feedbacks. Long-term monitoring of LCC in these ecosystems is essential to improving land use planning and management strategies that protect biodiversity, as well as traditional cultures and livelihoods under future climate change scenarios for Southern Africa. © 2017 by the authors.","Chobe; Disturbance; Drought; Dryland; Ecosystem services; Ecotone; Forest resources; KAZA; Non-linear change; Protected areas; Southern Africa; Sustainable livelihoods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044760708

However, our knowledge of fine-root trait distribution relies to date on local- and regional-scale studies with limited numbers of species, growth forms and environmental variation. We compiled a world-wide fine-root trait dataset, featuring 1115 species from contrasting climatic areas, phylogeny and growth forms to test a series of hypotheses pertaining to the influence of plant functional types, soil and climate variables, and the degree of manipulation of plant growing conditions on species fine-root trait variation. Most particularly, we tested the competing hypotheses that fine-root traits typical of faster return on investment would be most strongly associated with conditions of limiting versus favourable soil resource availability. We accounted for both data source and species phylogenetic relatedness. We demonstrate that: (i) Climate conditions promoting soil fertility relate negatively to fine-root traits favouring fast soil resource acquisition, with a particularly strong positive effect of temperature on fine-root diameter and negative effect on specific root length (SRL), and a negative effect of rainfall on root nitrogen concentration; (ii) Soil bulk density strongly influences species fine-root morphology, by favouring thicker, denser fine-roots; (iii) Fine-roots from herbaceous species are on average finer and have higher SRL than those of woody species, and N2-fixing capacity positively relates to root nitrogen; and (iv) Plants growing in pots have higher SRL than those grown in the field. Synthesis. This study reveals both the large variation in fine-root traits encountered globally and the relevance of several key plant functional types and soil and climate variables for explaining a substantial part of this variation. Climate, particularly temperature, and plant functional types were the two strongest predictors of fine-root trait variation. High trait variation occurred at local scales, suggesting that wide-ranging below-ground resource economics strategies are viable within most climatic areas and soil conditions. © 2017 The Authors.

The U. S. Corn Belt plays an important role in the global anthropogenic N2O budget. To date, studies on local surface N2O emissions and the atmospheric N2O budget have commonly used Lagrangian models. In the present study, we used an Eulerian model - Weather Research and Forecasting Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to investigate the relationships between N2O emissions in the Corn Belt and observed atmospheric N2O mixing ratios. We derived a simple equation to relate the emission strengths to atmospheric N2O mixing ratios, and used the derived equation and hourly atmospheric N2O measurements at the KCMP tall tower in Minnesota to constrain agricultural N2O emissions. The modeled spatial patterns of atmospheric N2O were evaluated against discrete observations at multiple tall towers in the NOAA flask network. After optimization of the surface flux, the model reproduced reasonably well the hourly N2O mixing ratios monitored at the KCMP tower. Agricultural N2O emissions in the EDGAR42 database needed to be scaled up by 19.0 to 28.1 fold to represent the true emissions in the Corn Belt for June 1–20, 2010 - a peak emission period. Optimized mean N2O emissions were 3.00–4.38, 1.52–2.08, 0.61–0.81 and 0.56–0.75 nmol m− 2 s− 1 for June 1–20, August 1–20, October 1–20 and December 1–20, 2010, respectively. The simulated spatial patterns of atmospheric N2O mixing ratios after optimization were in good agreement with the NOAA discrete observations during the strong emission peak in June. Such spatial patterns suggest that the underestimate of emissions using IPCC (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) inventory methodology is not dependent on tower measurement location. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Corn Belt; EDGAR42; Inverse analysis; KCMP tower; Nitrous oxide; WRF-Chem","Agriculture; Budget control; Climate change; Global warming; Lagrange multipliers; Mixing; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone layer; Towers; Weather forecasting; Discrete observations; EDGAR42; Global warming potential; Inverse analysis; Measurement locations; Nitrous oxide; Weather research and forecasting; WRF-Chem; Atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric chemistry; emission inventory; Eulerian analysis; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; inverse analysis; nitrous oxide; spatial analysis; weather forecasting; Corn Belt; Minnesota; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018527416

This study demonstrates that, in the Caddo Limestone of the Eliasville and Breckenridge fields, porosity and permeability are best developed in phylloid-algal wackestones and packstones, as well as Komia wackestones and packstones prevalent within the uppermost interval (i.e., Cycle A) of the formation in the study area. The main reservoirs formed in the upper and middle intervals of the Caddo algal mounds because of meteoric dissolution related to subaerial exposure (which created a large volume of secondary pores) and early cementation that prevented mechanical compaction. A great portion of the secondary pores remain open, providing the principal pore spaces of the reservoir interval. Vugs (including moldic voids) are abundant, and dissolution-enhanced intragranular pores are very common within widespread Komia. Intercrystalline pores are prevalent in dolomitized and neomorphised lithofacies where micrite was converted to microsparitic and sparitic calcite. Micropores are abundant in the matrix and within grains (especially Komia fragments). The lower or basal interval of Cycle A is commonly much less porous owing to the substantial loss of primary pores by physical compaction and lack (or rare presence) of secondary pores. Laterally, wells in the areas with thicker Cycle A (interpreted as algal mounds) have higher porosity and thicker net reservoir than those in intermound areas. This work provides a case study of carbonate reservoirs in which Komia wackestones and packstones are the major reservoir rocks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Algal mound; Carbonate lithofacies; Diagenetic alteration; Komia; Pore evolution; Reservoir character","Carbonation; Compaction; Dissolution; Limestone; Porosity; Algal mound; Diagenetic alteration; Komia; Lithofacies; Pore evolution; Reservoir character; Petroleum reservoirs; carbonate; cementation; diagenesis; dissolution; hydrocarbon reservoir; lithofacies; permeability; porosity; reservoir characterization; Stephens County [Texas]; Texas; United States; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023202763

And drag reduction is a realizable method to achieve this goal. Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) whose contact angle is greater than 150° have attracted much attention because of the ability of realizing drag reduction in turbulent flows. However, few researchers focus on the application of SHSs in shipping industry. In this paper, a numerical study of turbulent channel flows and turbulent boundary layers developing over SHSs are performed. In the simulation, the VOF multiphase flow model is used for the gas-liquid phase flow, and a superhydrophobic surface microstructure grid with local encryption technology is adopted. The results show that within the range of ship economic speed, a stable gas vortex can form in the upper part of microstructure, and the drag reduction ratio of SHSs has a close relationship with size of velocity, gas-liquid contact area, and soaking time. © 2017 IEEE.","drag reduction; numerical study; shipping industry; superhydrophobic surface","Boundary layers; Channel flow; Cryptography; Drag; Drag reduction; Emission control; Microstructure; Ships; Surface properties; Turbulent flow; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Gas-liquid contact area; Multi-phase flow models; numerical study; Shipping industry; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Turbulent boundary layers; Turbulent channel flows; Hydrophobicity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032805741

However, the widespread use of these polymers is still hampered due to their higher cost of production as compared to plastics. The production cost could be overcome by obtaining high yields and productivity. The goal of the present research was to enhance the yield of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) with the help of two simple fed-batch cultivation strategies. In the present study, average batch kinetic and substrate limitation/inhibition study data of Alcaligenes latus was used for the development of PHB model which was then adopted for designing various off-line nutrient feeding strategies to enhance PHB accumulation. The predictive ability of the model was validated by experimental implementation of two fed-batch strategies. One such dynamic strategy of fed-batch cultivation under pseudo-steady state with respect to nitrogen and simultaneous carbon feeding strategy resulted in significantly high biomass and PHB concentration of 39.17 g/L and 29.64 g/L, respectively. This feeding strategy demonstrated a high PHB productivity and PHB content of 0.6 g/L h and 75%, respectively, which were remarkably high in comparison to batch cultivation.

A high fraction of carbon bound in solid carbonaceous material is observed to exist in bodies formed in the cold outskirts of the solar nebula, while bodies in the region of terrestrial planets contain only very small mass fractions of carbon. Most of the solid carbon component is lost and converted into CO during the spiral-in of matter as the Sun accretes matter from the solar nebula. Aims. We study the fate of the carbonaceous material that entered the proto-solar disc by comparing the initial carbon abundance in primitive solar system material and the abundance of residual carbon in planetesimals and planets in the asteroid belt and the terrestrial planet region. Methods. We constructed a model for the composition of the pristine carbonaceous material from observational data on the composition of the dust component in comets and of interplanetary dust particles and from published data on pyrolysis experiments. This material entered the inner parts of the solar nebula during the course of the build-up of the proto-sun by accreting matter from the proto-stellar disc. Based on a one-zone evolution model of the solar nebula, we studied the pyrolysis of the refractory and volatile organic component and the concomitant release of hydrocarbons of high molecular weight under quiescent conditions of disc evolution, while matter migrates into the central parts of the solar nebula. We also studied the decomposition and oxidation of the carbonaceous material during violent flash heating events, which are thought to be responsible for the formation of chondrules. To do this, we calculated pyrolysis and oxidation of the carbonaceous material in temperature spikes that were modeled according to cosmochemical models for the temperature history of chondrules. Results. We find that the complex hydrocarbon components of the carbonaceous material are removed from the disc matter in the temperature range between 250 and 400â‰K, but the amorphous carbon component survives to temperatures of 1200 K. Without efficient carbon destruction during flash-heating associated with chondrule formation, the carbon abundance of terrestrial planets, except for Mercury, would be of several percent and not as low as it is found in cosmochemical studies. Chondrule formation seems to be a crucial process for the carbon-poor composition of the material of terrestrial planets. © 2017 ESO.","meteoroids-planets and satellites: Composition-solid state: Volatile; meteors; protoplanetary disks-astrochemistry-meteorites","Dust; Earth (planet); Hydrocarbons; Interplanetary flight; Planets; Pyrolysis; Satellites; Solar system; Astrochemistry; Carbonaceous materials; Hydrocarbon components; Interplanetary dust particles; meteors; Planets and satellites: compositions; Pyrolysis experiments; Volatile organic components; Amorphous carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030313389

Interest in biochar for use in the restoration of disturbed sites is growing; however, biochar effects on wild plant species of the early phase of post-disturbance succession have received almost no prior research attention. Physiological adaptations that enable rapid growth in early-successional pioneers (e.g., high rates of photosynthesis) should be advantageous in soils with fresh charcoal since plants with a capacity for expeditious resource capture can capitalize on resource pulses from leachable mineral elements. In a glasshouse study, we tested the effects of biochar applied at two doses (10 and 20 t/ha) to brunisol/juvenile podzol soils, collected from a managed temperate mixed-wood forest, on the growth and physiology of 13 herbaceous old-field pioneers. We measured leaf-level physiology and nutrient supply rates throughout the experiment, and biomass and reproductive performance at experiment completion. Overall, biochar treatments resulted in 30-37% increases in final average aboveground biomass, 13-17% increases in photosynthesis, and an average ~44% increase in leaf-level water-use efficiency (at 10 t/ha), but with a high species-specific variation that included negative responses. We detected weak negative relationships between intrinsic photosynthetic rates (of non-biochar controls) and some biomass responses: Species with high photosynthetic capacities tended to have low or negative biomass responses to biochar. Plants in biochar treatments flowered earlier and on average had double the reproductive biomass overall. Pulses of PO4- and K+ were supplied by biochar in the first four weeks of the experiment, while NO3- was significantly immobilized by biochar. These results suggest that by providing a pulse of P and base cations, biochar can improve the restoration of disturbed landscapes by enhancing the physiological and reproductive performance of a subset of pioneers that have moderate photosynthetic rates and nitrogen demand. Biochar has important potential applications to restoration; however, biochar is likely to affect community composition strongly, and careful consideration of the physiological rates and nitrogen requirements of target species will be necessary to maximize the success of biochar-based restoration projects. © 2017 Gale et al.","Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Ecophysiology; Ecosystem management; Photosynthesis; Plant nutrients; Plant performance; Reproduction; Restoration; Soil nutrients; Succession",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032983445

Instead, at high heat fluxes, surface (versus in depth) absorption of the thermal radiation locally enhances the decomposition rate leading to shorter ignition times for the composite.

The peat records were dated using tephrochronology, 14C and 210Pb. Local plant succession and hydrological changes in peatlands were synchronous with climatic shifts, although autogenous plant succession towards ombrotrophic status during peatland development was also apparent. The Marooned peatland experienced a shift ca. 2250 cal yr BP from rich to poor fen, as indicated by the appearance of Sphagnum fuscum. At Stordalen, a major shift to wetter conditions occurred between 500 and 250 cal yr BP, probably associated with climate change during the Little Ice Age. During the last few decades, the testate amoeba data suggest a deepening of the water table and an increase in shrub pollen, coinciding with recent climate warming and the associated expansion of shrub communities across the Arctic. Rates of carbon accumulation vary greatly between the sites, illustrating the importance of local vegetation communities, hydrology and permafrost dynamics.

The OR of the terrestrial biosphere is used to partition anthropogenic CO2 between oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks, and the ease of measurement of this property on smaller scales suggests its potential for other uses. However, controls on the natural variation of OR are not understood in either organic matter pools or fluxes, and this lack of basic information limits the use of the tracer. Here we assess the annual variability of the OR of photosynthesis over ~decade for two temperate forests, one coniferous and one deciduous, and show that the photosynthetic OR signature is strongly dominated by plant species. We determined the OR of this flux by measuring the OR of carbon pools that close on annual or shorter timescales (leaves and individual tree rings), via solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Leaf litter OR is different between coniferous and deciduous forests, but tree bole OR is constant between species. There was no significant change in leaf litter OR with time, nor any correlations between leaf litter OR and temperature or precipitation. During this time growing season precipitation varied by 95% from the time period average, and growing season temperature by 22%, demonstrating that on the decadal scale photosynthetic OR is invariant over significant shifts in these climate parameters. ©2017.

While previous studies concentrated on analyzing the carbon emissions of low-rise buildings, they have overlooked high-rise buildings, which also have large impacts on the carbon emissions of a city. Moreover, high-rise buildings use different construction materials and structural forms, resulting in large variability in their embodied carbon estimates. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the relationships between different design parameters and the embodied carbon in high-rise buildings. The results serve as a basis for making more environmentally-sustainable decisions when designing high-rise buildings in order to reduce the carbon emissions from the building sector. Different high-rise buildings are designed by varying the construction materials (namely reinforced concrete, structural steel and composite materials), recycled contents (steel scrap and cement substitutes), structural forms (i.e., core-frame, core-outrigger, tube-in-tube and mega-brace) and building heights. The embodied carbon values are evaluated and compared, by considering the carbon emissions from material manufacture and transportation. Given the same structural form and building height, steel buildings have 50–60% less total weight, but 25–30% more embodied carbon than composite and reinforced concrete buildings. If 80% of the steel used in buildings is recycled, the embodied carbon in steel buildings is reduced by around 60% and becomes the least among all buildings. The embodied carbon per floor area against building height follows a concave upward trend, indicating that each structural form has a suggested height range where embodied carbon is minimum. When the building height exceeds the suggested height range, the structural efficiency of the building decreases with considerable growths in material demand and embodied carbon. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building height; Construction material; Embodied carbon; High-rise building; Recycled material; Structural form","Architectural design; Buildings; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Construction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Materials handling; Recycling; Reinforced concrete; Reinforcement; Scrap metal reprocessing; Steel scrap; Tall buildings; Building height; Embodied carbons; High rise building; Recycled materials; Structural form; Building materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025466825

The results showed that although the water column was typically net heterotrophic, the ecosystem as a whole displayed autotrophic characteristics. The mean net community production from the seagrass meadows was 99.31 ± 45.13 mM C m−2 d−1, while the P/R ratio varied between 1.49 and 1.56. Oxygen produced through in situ photosynthesis, exhibited higher dependence over dissolved CO2 and available light. Apportionment of carbon stores in biomass indicated that nearly three-fourths were available belowground compared to aboveground. However, the sediment horizon accumulated nearly 40 times more carbon than live biomass. The carbon storage capacities of the sediments and seagrass biomass were comparable with the global mean for seagrass meadows. The results of this study highlight the major role of seagrass meadows in modification of seawater chemistry.

One waste is the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash, and the other one is fine granite powder from aggregate manufacturing. These two solid wastes are thoroughly characterized, and their effects on reaction process, gel composition, microstructure are investigated by isothermal calorimeter, TG/DSC, FTIR and SEM. Leaching properties and CO2 footprint of some typical mixes are evaluated. The results indicate that both bottom ash and granite addition can be regarded as non-reactive phases. Micro scale analyses show no evident chemical involvement of both wastes on the gel structure of the reaction products. Bottom ash addition reduces the compressive strength, and granite powder presents a lower influence; 28 d strengths of around 20–70 MPa can be achieved depending on the replacement levels. Most of the mixtures pass the Dutch regulation for heavy metal leaching, while the excessive chlorides and sulfates contents can be easily treated by methods such as washing.

Setting a monthly budget for energy consumption, and consequently energy cost, of buildings is being practiced by several organizations in a bid to reduce their carbon footprint. However, the impact of such an energy budget on the indoor comfort of users in a building has not been paid much attention to. In this regard, we present a constrained optimization model that maximizes the users' comfort while adhering to the budgeted energy consumption of a building. Our energy cost model is based on the temperature difference that has to be bridged by the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) unit to ensure optimal user comfort. We model user discomfort as a function of the difference between the temperature setting of the HVAC unit and the target temperature for user comfort. We derive closed form expressions for the HVAC temperature setting in terms of the fixed energy budget for both heating and cooling scenarios in different types of buildings. Our main contribution is towards budget planning of buildings which aims to achieve a certain degree of indoor comfort as decided by the building operator, at a relatively fixed energy budget. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Air conditioning; Buildings; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Constrained optimization; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Optimization; Smart city; Closed-form expression; Environmental pollutions; Heating and cooling; Indoor comforts; Target temperature; Temperature differences; Temperature setting; Ventilation and air conditioning; Budget control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039995915

As climate change becomes an increasing concern, these efforts must take into account how resilient-protected spaces will be in the face of future drivers of change such as warming temperatures. Climate landscape metrics, which signal the spatial magnitude and direction of climate change, support a convenient initial assessment of potential threats to and opportunities within ecosystems to inform conservation and policy efforts where biological data are not available. However, inference of risk from purely physical climatic changes is difficult unless set in a meaningful ecological context. Here, we aim to establish this context using historical climatic variability, as a proxy for local adaptation by resident biota, to identify areas where current local climate conditions will remain extant and future regional climate analogues will emerge. This information is then related to the processes governing species’ climate-driven range edge dynamics, differentiating changes in local climate conditions as promoters of species range contractions from those in neighbouring locations facilitating range expansions. We applied this approach to assess the future climatic stability and connectivity of Japanese waters and its network of marine protected areas (MPAs). We find 88% of Japanese waters transitioning to climates outside their historical variability bounds by 2035, resulting in large reductions in the amount of available climatic space potentially promoting widespread range contractions and expansions. Areas of high connectivity, where shifting climates converge, are present along sections of the coast facilitated by the strong latitudinal gradient of the Japanese archipelago and its ocean current system. While these areas overlap significantly with areas currently under significant anthropogenic pressures, they also include much of the MPA network that may provide stepping-stone protection for species that must shift their distribution because of climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate analogues; climate change; connectivity; conservation; ecological coherence; Japan; protected areas; stability","biota; climate change; climate conditions; climate variation; connectivity; nature conservation; protected area; risk assessment; Japan; fresh water; climate change; ecology; ecosystem; Japan; risk assessment; sea; Climate Change; Ecology; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Japan; Oceans and Seas; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017369228

Current global inventories of FFCO2 emissions do not directly quantify emissions at local scales; instead, spatial proxies like population density, nighttime lights, and power plant databases are used to downscale emissions from national totals. We have developed a high-resolution (hourly, 1 km2) bottom-up Anthropogenic Carbon Emissions System (ACES) for FFCO2, based on local activity data for the year 2011 across the northeastern U.S. We compare ACES with three widely used global inventories, finding significant differences at regional (20%) and city scales (50–250%). At a spatial resolution of 0.1°, inventories differ by over 100% for half of the grid cells in the domain, with the largest differences in urban areas and oil and gas production regions. Given recent U.S. federal policy pull backs regarding greenhouse gas emissions reductions, inventories like ACES are crucial for U.S. actions, as the impetus for climate leadership has shifted to city and state governments. The development of a robust carbon monitoring system to track carbon fluxes is critical for emissions benchmarking and verification. We show that existing downscaled inventories are not suitable for urban emissions monitoring, as they do not consider important local activity patterns. The ACES methodology is designed for easy updating, making it suitable for emissions monitoring under most city, regional, and state greenhouse gas mitigation initiatives, in particular, for the small- and medium-sized cities that lack the resources to regularly perform their own bottom-up emissions inventories. ©2017.

The main constraint to livestock production in this region is inadequate quantity and quality of livestock feed due to frequent droughts and reduced rainfall attributed to climate change. Participatory on-farm evaluation trials were conducted in agro-ecological zones Upper Midlands 3 (UM3) and Lower Midlands 4 (LM4) of Machakos and Makueni Counties respectively. The objective of the study was to assess agro-ecological adaptability and acceptability of four improved Brachiaria grass cultivars; Brachiaria brizantha cvs. Xaraes, Piatã, MG4 and Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk. Eight farms were selected in each area and herbage was harvested five times at two monthly intervals. In each harvest, dry matter was measured. Assessment on performance and farmers’ preference of the Brachiaria cultivars was carried out after two years using a structured questionnaire that was administered to 49 farmers (18 females and 31 males) in Machakos and 45 farmers (21 females and 24 males) in Makueni. No differences were found in the mean total dry matter yield between the grass cultivars in Machakos county. However, Brachiaria brizantha cvs MG4 gave the highest dry matter yield of 10.4 t ha−1. There were differences in the mean total dry matter yield between the cultivars in Makueni county where Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piatã gave the highest dry matter yield of 8.4 t ha−1. The most preferred cultivar in agro-ecological zone UM3 was Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraes while Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piatã was the most preferred cultivar in agro-ecological zone LM4. Although Cv. Xaraes was not the most productive in agro-ecological zone UM3, it was preferred due to increase in milk production when fed to dairy cattle. Cv.

Hydrogen economy includes the replacement of fossil fuels, so that it can also help in reducing the global CO2 emission. Hydrogen provides an alternative way of storing energy similar to the electricity. This paper introduces a new concept of transmitting energy in the form of hydrogen with an added advantage of producing water. So that both the shortage of water and power can be fulfilled by a single means.

Protein concentrations were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The digitized images obtained with a GS-800 scanner were then analyzed with PDQuest7.0 software to detect the differentially-expressed protein spots. These protein spots were cut from the gel using a proteome work spot cutter and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The digested peptide separation was conducted by LC-MS/MS. ● RESULTS: The 2-DE maps showed that lens proteins were in a pH range of 3-10 with a relative molecular weight of 21-70 kD. The relative molecular weight of the more abundant proteins was localized at 25-50 kD, and the isoelectric points were found to lie between PI 4-9. The maps also showed that the protein level within the liquefied after-cataracts was at 29 points and significantly lower than in normal lenses. The 29 points were identified by LC-MS/MS, and ten of these proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and database queries: beta-crystallin B1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, carbonyl reductase (NADPH) 1, cDNA FLJ55253, gamma-crystallin D, GAS2-like protein 3, sorbitol dehydrogenase, DNA FLJ60282, phosphoglycerate kinase, and filensin. ● CONCLUSION: The level of the ten proteins may play an important role in the development of liquefied aftercataracts. © 2017, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

Using long-term observational studies in the field and common garden and greenhouse experiments of a foundation tree species (Pinus edulis) and its mutualistic ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) associates, we show that EMF community composition is under strong plant genetic control. Seedlings acquire the EMF community of their seed source trees (drought tolerant vs. drought intolerant), even when exposed to inoculum from the alternate tree type. Drought-tolerant trees had 25% higher growth and a third the mortality of drought-intolerant trees over the course of 10 y of drought in the wild, traits that were also observed in their seedlings in a common garden. Inoculation experiments show that EMF communities are critical to drought tolerance. Drought-tolerant and drought-intolerant seedlings grew similarly when provided sterile EMF inoculum, but drought-tolerant seedlings grew 25% larger than drought-intolerant seedlings under dry conditions when each seedling type developed its distinct EMF community. This demonstration that particular combinations of plant genotype and mutualistic EMF communities improve the survival and growth of trees with drought is especially important, given the vulnerability of forests around the world to the warming and drying conditions predicted for the future. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

The current research used a longitudinal field experiment (n=370) to test both the effectiveness of a new curbside OCP and new social innovations intended to stimulate pro-environmental changes in household behavior. The findings suggest greater participation levels occur by implementing both new supportive infrastructure (i.e., curbside carts and collection services), and innovations that target the social aspects of waste (i.e., communicating social norms of separation). The data also provide an opportunity to test new model for predicting the most efficacious behavior-change interventions based on population profiles.

These cumulates, erupted about 2 ka ago at Stromboli volcano (Italy), have been already investigated by Martelli et al. (2014) mainly for Sr-Nd isotopes and for their noble gases geochemistry. The concentration of CO2 varies of one order of magnitude from 3.8·10− 8 mol g− 1 to 4.8·10− 7 mol g− 1, with δ13C values between − 2.8‰ and − 1.5‰ vs V-PDB. These values overlap the range of measurements performed in the crater gases emitted at Stromboli (− 2.5‰ &lt; δ13CCO2 &lt; − 1.0‰). Since SBX formed from relatively primitive mantle-derived basic magmas, we argue that the isotope composition displayed by fluid inclusions and surface gases can be considered representative of the magma volatile imprinting released by partial melting of the mantle source beneath Stromboli (− 2.8‰ &lt; δ13C &lt; − 1.0‰). In addition, the δ13C signature of CO2 is not significantly modified by fractionation due to magmatic degassing or intracrustal contamination processes owing to magma ascent and residence within the volcano plumbing system. Such δ13C values are higher than those commonly reported for MORB-like upper mantle (− 8 ÷ − 4‰) and likely reflect the source contamination of the local mantle wedge by CO2 coming from the decarbonation of the sediments carried by the subducting Ionian slab with a contribution of organic carbon up to 7%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2; Fluid inclusions; Mantle; Stromboli volcano; Ultramafic cumulates; δ13C","Binary alloys; Inert gases; Isotopes; Mineralogy; Neodymium alloys; Organic carbon; Silicate minerals; Strontium alloys; Volcanoes; Carbon isotope composition; Fluid inclusion; Isotope compositions; Mantle; Partial melting of the mantle; Stromboli volcano; Ultramafic cumulate; Ultramafic cumulates; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; concentration (composition); cumulate; fluid inclusion; isotopic composition; ultramafic rock; xenolith; Italy; Lipari Islands; Messina [Sicily]; Sicily; Stromboli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017448778

Green infrastructure practices such as rainwater harvesting (RWH), rain gardens, porous pavements, and green roofs are emerging as viable strategies for climate change adaptation. The modified framework includes 4 economic, 11 environmental, and 3 social indicators. Using 6 indicators from the framework, at least 1 from each dimension of sustainability, we demonstrate the methodology to analyze RWH designs. We use life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment to calculate the sustainability indicators of 20 design configurations as Decision Management Objectives (DMOs). Five DMOs emerged as relatively more sustainable along the EE analysis Tradeoff Line, and we used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a widely applied statistical approach, to quantify the modified EE measures as DMO sustainability scores. We also addressed the subjectivity and sensitivity analysis requirements of sustainability analysis, and we evaluated the performance of 10 weighting schemes that included classical DEA, equal weights, National Institute of Standards and Technology's stakeholder panel, Eco-Indicator 99, Sustainable Society Foundation's Sustainable Society Index, and 5 derived schemes. We improved upon classical DEA by applying the weighting schemes to identify sustainability scores that ranged from 0.18 to 1.0, avoiding the nonuniqueness problem and revealing the least to most sustainable DMOs. Our methodology provides a more comprehensive view of water resource management and is generally applicable to GI and industrial, environmental, and engineered systems to explore the sustainability space of alternative design configurations.

These models may fail to adequately represent the crop performance if they are not adapted to the local conditions. The particularities of Colombian tomato systems (greenhouse and open field) demand the recalibration of existing models to make a more realistic representation of those systems. Therefore, a locally calibrated crop model was proposed considering both production systems. To this purpose, four on-farm calibration experiments were carried out, two under greenhouse conditions with average temperatures of 17.4 and 17.9ºC in Santa Sofía (Boyacá) and two under open field conditions in Páramo and San Gil (Santander), with average temperatures of 20.6 and 24.0ºC, respectively. The crops were commercially managed according to the local practices. Plant data was collected through destructive measurements carried out on a fortnightly basis, while climate data were collected for the entire crop growth cycle. Independent calibration of the dry matter fractions allocated at the plant organs in function of thermal time resulted in an acceptable model performance. The calibration of the model under commercial conditions gave a better representation of the local systems but at the expense of accuracy since on-farm experiments cannot be controlled as those performed in research facilities. © 2017, Universidad Nacional de Colombia1.

For a system of simultaneous first and second order reactions - dB/dt = kABA - kBCB2 and dC/dt = kBCB2 - kCC, where A, B, and C are concentrations, t is time, and the reaction rate parameters kAB and kC in yr-1 are 1st-order and kBC in cm3 molecule-1 yr-1 is 2nd-order - no explicit solution is available, as far as we are aware. This paper presents explicit and asymptotic solutions of simultaneous 1st- and 2nd order Riccati equations and applies them to a simplified sequence of gas reactions in the atmosphere of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn: CH4 methane (1st order, k12) → CH3 methyl (2nd order, k23) → C2H6 ethane (1st order, k3) → Other products. The Titan's atmosphere contains methane (CH4) at the present-day partial pressure of 0.1 bar, out of a total atmospheric pressure made up by nitrogen (N2) of 1.5 bar, comparable to Earth's. Methyl CH3 and ethane C2H6 are minor components. On Titan, methyl (CH3) is an intermediate product from methane to ethane, the latter raining out as liquid on Titan's surface. The main points of this paper are: (1) the asymptotic solutions that approximate near-steady state of Titan's atmosphere about 4.5 billion years after its accretion; (2) the computed present-day concentrations of the three gases in Titan's scale atmosphere (i.e., scale atmosphere is a model of an isothermal well mixed reservoir); and (3) the agreement between Titan's reported and computed atmospheric concentrations of CH4, CH3, and C2H6. The reaction rate parameters of the species are constants representative of their mean values during the satellite's cooling history. The present-day concentrations of methyl (CH3) and ethane (C2H6) are several orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of methane (CH4). Since Titan's accretion about 4.5 billion years B.P., steady-state concentrations of methane and ethane would have been attained in less than 500,000 years. This conclusion and the agreement of the model results with the reported concentrations underscores validity of the asymptotic solutions derived from the explicit solutions, and the long-term stability of the carbon cycle in Titan's atmosphere. © 2017 Author(s).","Explicit & asymptotic solutions; Gas reactions on Titan; Riccati & 1st-order simultaneous equations",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029825679

The mouse Akr1b3 gene is clearly orthologous to human AKR1B1, both coding for aldose reductase, and their gene products show similar tissue distribution, regulation by osmotic stress and kinetic properties. In contrast, no unambiguous orthologs of human AKR1B10 and AKR1B15.1 have been identified in rodents. Although two more AKRs, AKR1B7 and AKR1B8, have been identified and characterized in mouse, none of them seems to exhibit properties similar to the human AKRs. Recently, a novel mouse AKR gene, Akr1b16, was annotated and the respective gene product, AKR1B16 (sharing 83% and 80% amino acid sequence identity with AKR1B10 and AKR1B15.1, respectively), was expressed as insoluble and inactive protein in a bacterial expression system. Here we describe the expression and purification of a soluble and enzymatically active AKR1B16 from E. coli using three chaperone systems. A structural model of AKR1B16 allowed the estimation of its active-site pocket volume, which was much wider (402 Å3) than those of AKR1B10 (279 Å3) and AKR1B15.1 (60 Å3). AKR1B16 reduced aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds, using NADPH as a cofactor, with moderate or low activity (highest kcat values around 5 min−1). The best substrate for the enzyme was pyridine-3-aldehyde. AKR1B16 showed poor inhibition with classical AKR inhibitors, tolrestat being the most potent. Kinetics and inhibition properties resemble those of rat AKR1B17 but differ from those of the human enzymes. In addition, AKR1B16 catalyzed the oxidation of 17β-hydroxysteroids in a NADP+-dependent manner. These results, together with a phylogenetic analysis, suggest that mouse AKR1B16 is an ortholog of rat AKR1B17, but not of human AKR1B10 or AKR1B15.1. These human enzymes have no counterpart in the murine species, which is evidenced by forming a separate cluster in the phylogenetic tree and by their unique activity with retinaldehyde. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aldose reductase inhibitor; Enzyme kinetics; Gene orthology; Retinaldehyde reductase; Steroid oxidoreductase; Subcellular localization","aldo keto reductase 1B16; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; testosterone 17beta dehydrogenase; tolrestat; unclassified drug; Akr1b10 protein, mouse; aldo keto reductase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; oxidoreductase; recombinant protein; retinal; steroid; Article; controlled study; enzyme active site; enzyme analysis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme kinetics; enzyme mechanism; enzyme metabolism; enzyme substrate; Escherichia coli; human; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein purification; protein structure; rat; amino acid sequence; animal; biocatalysis; biosynthesis; chemistry; classification; enzyme specificity; genetics; HeLa cell line; isolation and purification; kinetics; metabolism; phylogeny; protein tertiary structure; sequence alignment; spectrophotometry; Aldo-Keto Reductases; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Biocatalysis; HeLa Cells; Humans; Kinetics; Mice; NADP; Oxidoreductases Acting on Aldehyde or Oxo Group Donors; Phylogeny; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Retinaldehyde; Sequence Alignment; Spectrophotometry; Steroids; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017460957

During industrial processes, some of these dyes are released into the wastewater and their successive release into rivers and lakes produces serious environmental problems. TiO2 is one of the most widely studied and used photocatalysts for environmental remediation. However, it is mainly active under UV-light irradiation due to its band gap of 3.2 eV, while it shows low efficiency under the visible light spectrum. Regarding the exploration of TiO2 activation in the visible light region of the total solar spectrum, the incorporation of carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene, in order to form carbon-TiO2 composites is a promising area. Graphene, in fact, has a large surface area which makes it a good adsorbent for organic pollutants removal through the combination of electrostatic attraction and π-π interaction. Furthermore, it has a high electron mobility and therefore it reduces the electron-hole pair recombination, improving the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor. In recent years, there was an increasing interest in the preparation of graphenebased TiO2 photocatalysts. The present short review describes the recent advances in TiO2 photocatalyst coupling with graphene materials with the aim of extending the light absorption of TiO2 from UV wavelengths into the visible region, focusing on recent progress in the design and applications in the photocatalytic degradation of synthetic dyes. © 2017 by the authors.

Methods Nordic Occupational Safety Climate Assessment Questionnaire was employed to evaluate safety climate in cross-sectional design. The geographically diverse population of the inspection body made it possible to conduct the survey across 10 provinces in Iran. 89 completed questionnaires were obtained with a response rate of 47%. Except for management safety justice, the internal consistency of other six dimensions was found to be acceptable (α ≥ 0.7). Results Mean scores of dimensions ranged from 3.50 in trust in the efficacy of safety systems (SD = 0.38) to 2.98 in workers' safety priority and risk non-acceptance (SD = 0.47). Tukey HSD tests indicated a statistically significant difference of mean scores among groups undergoing different number of safety inspections and those receiving different number of non-compliances (p < 0.05), with no significant differences based on safety training man-hours and sessions (p > 0.05). Spearman's rank-order correlation showed no relationship between work experience and number of non-compliances (correlation coefficient = − 0.04, p > 0.05) and between safety training man-hours and number of non-compliances (correlation coefficient = − 0.15, p > 0.05). Conclusions Our results indicate that safety climate levels are influenced by number of safety inspections and the resultant non-compliances.

Their use and manufacture were restricted or banned in many countries in the 1970–1980s, however, they still persist in the antroposphere, the environment and in biota worldwide today. Conventions like the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution encourage or bind the member parties to annually submit emission inventories of regulated air pollutants. Unfortunately, several member states have not yet reported PCB emissions. The identification and quantification of stocks and emissions sources is, however, an important precondition to handle and remove the remaining reservoirs of PCBs and, thus, to be able to reduce emissions and subsequently environmental exposure. Here, we estimate past, present, and future emissions of PCBs to air in Switzerland and provide emission factors for all relevant emission categories. Switzerland hereby represents a typical developed industrial country, and most of the assumptions and parameters presented here can be used to calculate PCB emission also for other countries. PCB emissions to air are calculated using a dynamic mass flow and emissions model for Switzerland, which is run for the years 1930–2100. The results point out the importance of the use of PCBs in open applications, which have largely been previously overlooked. Additionally, we show that PCBs will persist in applications during the coming decades with ongoing emissions. Especially the use of PCBs in open applications will cause Swiss emissions to remain above 100 kg PCB per year, even after the year 2030.

The present conceptualization considers and accounts for such flow-dependence in terms of potential and actually realized service supply and demand, which may generally differ and must therefore be distinguished due to and accounting for the prevailing conditions of service carrier flows. We here concretize and quantify such flow-dependence for a specific landscape case (the Stockholm region, Sweden) and for two examples of regulating ecosystem services: local climate regulation and storm water regulation. For these service and landscape examples, we identify, quantify and map key areas of potential and realized service supply and demand, based for the former (potential) on prevailing relatively static types of landscape conditions (such as land-cover/use, soil type and demographics), and for the latter (realized) on relevant carrier air and water flows.

Also, total soil organic carbon, diversity, plant cover and vegetation height were measured. Once this behaviour is known, the impacts of future climate scenarios may be approached. Since some of these variables could be altered by climate change, the future vegetation dynamics might indicate the trending of change, so plant communities can be used as bioindicators. The investigation was carried out in some small coastal wetlands located in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Low values of diversity were found in these plant communities due to a great effect of flooding, followed by salinity. ‘Reed beds’ are bioindicators of flooding and environmental disturbance. ‘Saline rushes’ are also flooding bioindicators and efficient accumulators of organic matter. ‘Mediterranean halophilous scrubs’ are bioindicators of seasonal flooding and changes to salinity. ‘Mediterranean halo-nitrophilous scrubs’ might be considered as bioindicators of low flooding and low salinity in anthropic environment while ‘Mediterranean salt steppes’ bioindicate driest conditions. At present, Mediterranean halophilous scrubs are the most widely extended community, which could be interpreted as a consequence of a changing and sharply seasonal climate. Our research suggests that future climate change scenarios involving flooding increases would support the proliferation of the lowest diversity and thus lower ecological value plant communities (i.e. reed beds). Conversely, a future scenario of decreasing flooding would benefit the most diverse and valuable conservation community actually priortized by European Habitats Directive (Mediterranean salt steppes, Limonietalia). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Diversity; Flooding; Habitats directive; Salinity","behavioral response; bioindicator; climate change; coastal wetland; conservation status; disturbance; flooding; salinity; scrub; species diversity; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020718382

Most of the research on peatland carbon budgets and effects of variable weather conditions has been done in Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum-dominated systems. Given their importance in other geographic and climatic regions, a better understanding of peatland carbon dynamics is needed across the spectrum of global peatland types. In New Zealand, much of the historic peatland area has been drained for agriculture but little is known about rates of carbon exchange and storage in unaltered peatland remnants that are dominated by the jointed wire rush, Empodisma robustum. We used eddy covariance to measure ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes and a water balance approach to estimate the sub-surface flux of dissolved organic carbon from the largest remaining raised peat bog in New Zealand, Kopuatai bog. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was estimated over four years, which included two drought summers, a relatively wet summer, and a meteorologically average summer. In all measurement years, the bog was a substantial sink for carbon, ranging from 134.7 to 216.9gCm-2yr-1, owing to the large annual net ecosystem production (161.8 to 244.9gCO2-Cm-2yr-1). Annual methane fluxes were large relative to most Northern Hemisphere peatlands (14.2 to 21.9gCH4-Cm-2yr-1), although summer and autumn emissions were highly sensitive to dry conditions, leading to very predictable seasonality according to water table position. The annual flux of dissolved organic carbon was similar in magnitude to methane emissions but less variable, ranging from 11.7 to 12.8gCm-2yr-1. Dry conditions experienced during late summer droughts led to significant reductions in annual carbon storage, which resulted nearly equally from enhanced ecosystem respiration due to lowered water tables and increased temperatures, and from reduced gross primary production due to vapor pressure deficit-related stresses to the vegetation. However, the net C uptake of Kopuatai bog during drought years was large relative to even the maximum reported NECB from Northern Hemisphere bogs. Furthermore, global warming potential fluxes indicated the bog was a strong sink for greenhouse gases in all years despite the relatively large annual methane emissions. Our results suggest that adaptations of E. robustum to dry conditions lead to a resilient peatland drought response of the NECB.",,"adaptation; bog; carbon balance; carbon sink; dissolved organic carbon; drought; drought resistance; ecosystem response; global change; Holocene; methane; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; Northern Hemisphere; peatland; Southern Hemisphere; New Zealand; Empodisma; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031819232

Until now, most studies that have focused on identifying the best treatment pathway are based on optimization of technological alternatives and life cycle analysis studies. Such studies aim toward sustainability but ignore the capacity of local ecological systems to provide ecosystem services, thus leading to design solutions that may be sub-optimal due to shifting of impacts outside the boundary, resulting in degradation. This work uses a techno-ecological synergy design methodology to identify optimal strategies for biosolids treatment and disposal, by balancing the supply and demand for carbon sequestration ecosystem service. Both the technological systems that create the ecosystem service demand and ecological systems that supply those services are included within one design framework. Technological alternatives for biosolids management in Central Ohio considered in this work are land filling, land application, incineration and composting. Approaches for supplying the carbon sequestration capacity include forestation, extension of timber cycles and geological sequestration. An additional case where biomass utilization from extension of timber cycle to produce renewable energy is also explored. Results from this study demonstrate that including carbon sequestration ecosystem service explicitly in the design problem leads to solutions where the ecosystem service demand and supply can be balanced, while also being cost-effective. Thus by including ecological systems in the design boundary, the optimal solution space expands to reveal novel solutions that cannot be found by the conventional techno-centric approach. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Biosolids management; Carbon sequestration ecosystem service; Multiobjective optimization; Techno-ecological synergy","Biosolids; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Design; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Industrial emissions; Industrial water treatment; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Timber; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Biosolids management; Ecosystem services; Geological sequestration; Municipal wastewaters; Techno-ecological synergy; Technological alternatives; Technological system; Treatment and disposal; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026460681

This in turn affects the environmental quality. The more prosperous a country's economy is, higher is its fossil fuel consumption, resulting in higher GHG emissions. They together determine the level of production and its degree of carbon intensity1. The PET model (Michael Dalton, 2008), a dynamic computable general equilibrium model is also designed to analyse economic trade-offs associated with production and use of fossil fuels and associated GHG emissions in general and the CO2 emissions in particular. The demographic changes i.e. the changes in population and lifestyles have enormous implications for environmental quality (Looking back to think ahead, Green India 2047, 1998). Every nation for its development heavily depends upon coal, natural gases and oil as the fossil fuels and this further release the GHGs in the environment. Generally, the increase in the emissions of GHGs is the byproduct of the economic growth and development. A country has to choose that pathway to growth, which would be sustainable by the least GHG emissions. The converse is, lower carbon emissions of a country, (CO2 being one of the major GHG causing emissions through the use of fossil fuels) it would lead to sustainable development of that country. The importance of the reduction in GHG (mainly the carbon) emissions and its positive atmospheric impact is more advent due to the fact that the atmosphere is uniform and so, reduction in emissions occurring anywhere in the world would reduce the overall concentration of all the GHGs. How effectively we reduce these emissions in a cost effective or an efficient way is the real question. All developing countries enjoy an advantageous position inreducing such emissions in cost effective manner. In this regard the lower abatement costs of the GHGs (mainly of CO2) in India as compared to its very marginal levels of the GHG emissions per capita offers India an opportunity benefit in terms of the CDM under the Kyoto Protocol. © 2017 IEEE.","abatement Costs of GHGs; CO2 emissions; fossil fuels; GHG emissions; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuels; Smart city; Smart power grids; Sustainable development; Abatement costs; CO2 emissions; GHG emission; KYOTO protocol; mitigation; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032362197

Despite the critical role of peatlands in the global C cycle, trait–flux relationships in peatlands are relatively unknown. We assessed the ability of four non-destructive plant traits to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes over two growing seasons in a temperate peatland in Ontario, Canada. We examined relationships between C-fluxes and leaf area, leaf persistence (deciduous, evergreen), growth form (woody, herbaceous) and aerenchyma tissue. To explore potential inconsistencies between different scales of data aggregation, traits were analysed at the level of plots, species and microsites. CO2 fluxes showed a positive relationship with leaf area and leaf persistence, and a negative relationship with proportion of woody species. CH4 fluxes showed a positive relationship with aerenchyma and leaf area. The significance of trait–flux relationships differed based on whether data were averaged at the level of plot, species or microsite. We recommend applying leaf area as a non-destructive trait to other systems where it is not ideal to measure traits destructively. A better understanding of the relationships between above and below-ground traits is likely needed to further explain variation in ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from plant traits.

This process has attracted considerable attention recently in the renewable energy sector because it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and subsidize energy security. The solvent extraction technique has a low production cost and low oil residue compared with the other methods. Six different solvents were employed for the separation process; among them, hexane proves to be the best solvent for bio-oil extraction (yield −28.43%) at the temperature of 68°C. The caloric value of B. variegata seeds is 4800 kcal/kg, which makes it a better choice of fuel. Its physicochemical properties such as acid value, calorific value, flash point, saponification value, iodine number, specific gravity, fire point, and kinematic viscosity were determined for bio-oil and compared with diesel. This result supports the production of biodiesel from B. variegata seeds oil as a viable alternative fuel to diesel in an eco-friendly manner. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bauhinia variegata; bio-oil; extraction; optimize parameters; Soxhlet apparatus","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Energy policy; Energy security; Extraction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Solvents; Bauhinia variegata; Bio oil; Different solvents; optimize parameters; Physicochemical property; Renewable energy sector; Solvent-extraction techniques; Soxhlet apparatus; Solvent extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033369467

More recent research in decision theory suggests that consumers non-switching is based on the so-called status quo bias. The status quo bias reflects the tendency to over-proportionally stick to the current state. In an economic decision experiment, the influence of the status quo bias is empirically tested. Using a choice-based conjoint analysis, consumers are offered different variations of electricity contracts. The experimental investigation was conducted in August 2016 in the US state of California. 584 participants in total were assigned randomly in a control and an experimental group to a modified choice-based conjoint analysis. In each of the 15 conducted choice tasks, the participants had to choose an electricity contract. The difference between the control and the experimental group was only that one of the five electricity contracts in each choice task was preselected as a status quo option. The results show significant differences between the control and the experimental group in terms of part-worth utilities for attribute levels and relative importance of attributes. Contrary to the expectations of the rational choice model, the framing of the choice task with and without the preselection of a status quo option significantly influences the decision behaviour of the participants. These results raise doubts as to whether competitive markets driven by individual preferences are a good tool to reward long-Term infrastructure and climate policy in the electricity market instead of political measures driven by collective choice. It seems that consumer preferences for preventing climate change are susceptible to framing effects. © 2017 WIT Press.","Behavioural economics; Choice-based conjoint analysis; Consumer preferences; Default; Experimental economics; Status quo bias.; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047925466

WeCare made some important contributions to advance the scientific understanding in the area of atmospheric and air transportation research. We characterize contrail properties, show that the aircraft type significantly influences these properties, and how contrail-cirrus interacts with natural cirrus. Aviation NOx emissions lead to ozone formation and we show that the strength of the ozone enhancement varies, depending on where within a weather pattern NOx is emitted. These results, in combination with results on the effects of aerosol emissions on low cloud properties, give a revised view on the total radiative forcing of aviation. The assessment of a fleet of strut-braced wing aircraft with an open rotor is investigated and reveals the potential to significantly reduce the climate impact. Intermediate stop operations have the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption. However, we find that, if only optimized for fuel use, they will have an increased climate impact, since non-CO2 effects compensate the reduced warming from CO2 savings. Avoiding climate sensitive regions has a large potential in reducing climate impact at relatively low costs. Taking advantage of a full 3D optimization has a much better eco-efficiency than lateral re-routings, only. The implementation of such operational measures requires many more considerations. Non-CO2 aviation effects are not considered in international agreements. We showed that climate-optimal routing could be achieved, if market-based measures were in place, which include these non-CO2 effects. An alternative measure to foster climate-optimal routing is the closing of air spaces, which are very climate-sensitive. Although less effective than an unconstrained optimization with respect to climate, it still has a significant potential to reduce the climate impact of aviation. By combining atmospheric and air transportation research, we assess climate mitigation measures, aiming at providing information to aviation stakeholders and policy-makers to make aviation more climate compatible. © 2017 by the authors.","Aerosols; Aviation emission; Climate change; Climate mitigation; Climate sensitive regions; Contrail avoidance; Contrails; Intermediate stop operations; Nitrogen oxides; Open rotor; Strut-braced wing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041012220

Various methodologies have been developed within the framework of quantile mapping. However, it is well known that quantile mapping may significantly modify the long-term statistics due to the time dependency of the temperature bias. Here, a method to overcome this issue without compromising the day-to-day correction statistics is presented. The methodology separates the modeled temperature signal into a normalized and a residual component relative to the modeled reference period climatology, in order to adjust the biases only for the former and preserve the signal of the later. The results show that this method allows for the preservation of the originally modeled long-term signal in the mean, the standard deviation and higher and lower percentiles of temperature. To illustrate the improvements, the methodology is tested on daily time series obtained from five Euro CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs). © Author(s) 2017.",,"Climate change; Mapping; Climate change impact; Climate variables; Long term statistics; Regional climate models; Residual components; Standard deviation; Standard practices; Temperature signal; Climate models; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; correction; mapping; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030221390

Planning in the transport sector requires that policy makers be supported with scientifically sound tools, which are able to take into account the peculiar aspects of transport system analyses, especially at urban scale. One of these peculiarities is the spatial dimension of origin-destination travels, that usually cannot be properly modelled by the common bottom-up energy model generators. These generators are used to build models of the energy systems at different geographic scales, including the urban one, and are suitable for forecasting scenario analyses over mid-long term time horizons, e.g. for studying the decarbonisation pathway feasibility. To face the spatial dimension issue, a new concept - the transport corridor - has been introduced into the open source optimization model generator OSeMOSYS, by acting on the structure of its equations. The proposed methodology, in particular, allows the definition of the minimum cost configuration of an urban transport system, with a competition among transport modes and technologies able to fulfil the mobility demand, under different technical and environmental constraints. This approach can comparatively evaluate the impacts of alternative policy options with a higher granularity with respect to more conventional modelling techniques. As such, it could be useful in assessing, under a mid-long term perspective, the effectiveness of specific local measures (like restricted traffic areas) or actions promoting sustainable mobility (as car-pooling/sharing initiatives), supporting the identification of issues and investment priorities. © 2017 IEEE.","district; modelling; optimization; transport corridors","Application programs; Computer software; Decarbonization; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Investments; Models; Open source software; Optimization; Transportation; district; Environmental constraints; Long-term perspective; Pollutant emissions reduction; Sustainable mobility; Transport corridors; Urban transport sector; Urban transport systems; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032861773

Herein, we synthesized subnanometric iridium dioxide clusters supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by a chemical vapor deposition method (nominated as IrO2/CNT). Benefiting from a mild oxidation process in air at 303 K, the deposited iridium clusters can be controlled to have a narrow size distribution from several atoms to 2 nm, having an average size of ca. 1.1 nm. The subnanometric iridium-containing sample is demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust for water oxidation. The optimal turnover frequency (TOF) of chemical water oxidation on the as-obtained sample can reach 11.2 s-1, and the overpotential of electrochemical water oxidation is 249, and 293 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH (pH: 13.6), and 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH: 0), respectively.

The discovery of several levels of Palaeolithic flint artefacts embedded in a relatively thick loess sequence (ca 6–7 m) preserved on a gentle slope facing North-East, resulted in a 6000 m2 excavation. This opened the opportunity for a detailed pedosedimentary and interdisciplinary geochronological survey (14C, optically stimulated luminescence, thermoluminescence, ESR/U-series) that has allowed us date the sequence reliably. On the basis of these results we propose this sequence as a new pedostratigraphic and archaeological reference sequence for northern France. We present here the optical dating of the sequence performed on fine (4–11 μm) quartz grains extracted from 17 samples. The luminescence characteristics of these extracts indicate that the single-aliquot regenerative dose optically stimulated luminescence (SAR-OSL) procedure that was applied is well suited. A consistent set of optical ages was obtained for the loess deposited up to around 70 ka ago. Independent age control (pedostratigraphy, 14C, ESR/U-series dates) allowed us to apply a Bayesian approach to build a chronometric model. This in turn enabled a regional chronostratigraphic framework to be built, to constrain the correlations with neighboring regions (northern France and Belgium) and to calculate a precise age for the four Palaeolithic levels discovered, including a unique occupation related to the early Upper Palaeolithic which was previously unknown in the area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","ESR/U-series dating; Loess; Middle and Upper Palaeolithic; Northern France; Optical dating; Palaeosols; Periglacial processes; Quartz; SAR; Weichselian",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026921857

With ∼38% of BC's GHG emissions stemming from transportation (in 2012), it is clear that BC's climate goals can only be realized with an effective climate policy for transport fuel activities. Enacted in December 2009, the GHGR Renewable and Low Carbon Fuel Requirement (RLCFR) Act and Regulation have achieved significant life cycle GHG emissions reductions accredited to its enforcement: 904,900 t CO2eq (2012). At face value, this is a great success. However, several accounting issues suggest that these GHG emissions reductions are inaccurate. In this study, the GHG emissions reductions achieved with the RLCFR are first analyzed by fuel source and transport mode. Next, the methodology for determining the life-cycle carbon intensity (CI) factors of each fuel are analyzed, with a particular focus on how indirect land use change (iLUC) is dealt with. The findings of this study suggest that the RLCFR legislation has not been nearly as effective as proclaimed by the BC government. Nevertheless, this transport fuel regulation is essential if BC wants to achieve its future GHG emissions reduction targets.

They positively contribute to global warming through their greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively through the accumulation of organic material in histosols, particularly in peatlands. Our understanding of wetlands’ services is currently constrained by limited knowledge on their distribution, extent, volume, interannual flood variability and disturbance levels. We present an expert system approach to estimate wetland and peatland areas, depths and volumes, which relies on three biophysical indices related to wetland and peat formation: (1) long-term water supply exceeding atmospheric water demand; (2) annually or seasonally water-logged soils; and (3) a geomorphological position where water is supplied and retained. Tropical and subtropical wetlands estimates reach 4.7 million km2 (Mkm2). In line with current understanding, the American continent is the major contributor (45%), and Brazil, with its Amazonian interfluvial region, contains the largest tropical wetland area (800,720 km2). Our model suggests, however, unprecedented extents and volumes of peatland in the tropics (1.7 Mkm2 and 7,268 (6,076–7,368) km3), which more than threefold current estimates. Unlike current understanding, our estimates suggest that South America and not Asia contributes the most to tropical peatland area and volume (ca. 44% for both) partly related to some yet unaccounted extended deep deposits but mainly to extended but shallow peat in the Amazon Basin. Brazil leads the peatland area and volume contribution. Asia hosts 38% of both tropical peat area and volume with Indonesia as the main regional contributor and still the holder of the deepest and most extended peat areas in the tropics. Africa hosts more peat than previously reported but climatic and topographic contexts leave it as the least peat-forming continent. Our results suggest large biases in our current understanding of the distribution, area and volumes of tropical peat and their continental contributions. © 2017 The Authors.

Since most Kenyan communities depend on agriculture as the backbone of the economy for sustenance, some of these, including the Abanyore, Akamba, Ameru, Turkana, and Maasai, have been involved in the practice of rainmaking rituals. They use African traditional indigenous knowledge embedded in African religion to “pray for rain” by predicting, causing, redirecting, and controlling rain within their locality. The role of rainmaking and its effects is therefore crucial. The purpose of this contribution is to examine the indigenous systems of rainmaking in Kenya. It situationally analyzes the art of rainmaking in Africa in general and further contextually examines rainmaking rituals among three Kenyan communities. It suggests that rainmaking is performed as an expression of African religion through communal ceremonies, and further notes that indigenous knowledge in rainmaking rituals is significant in helping local communities respond to climate changes, allowing them to execute this knowledge in mitigation or adaptation of climate challenges. The article concludes that local communities need to integrate both indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge to forecast and dispel rainfall patterns to effectively predict weather patterns. © (2017) World Council of Churches.

Indonesia as a developing country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29 percent by the year 2030. This calls into question the extent to which cities and local governments can cope with the challenges of climate change mitigation. The purpose of the research is to find out the extent to which local air pollution reduction policies can contribute to the climate change mitigation program. The research design involved an empirical case study on governance and policy relevant to climate change efforts to lower GHG in Bandung City, Indonesia. The study evaluated the air quality improvement and the climate change mitigation programs using the actor-based framework of the Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT). The governance and stakeholder characteristic of climate change mitigation were also analysed using the structural context part of the CIT framework. The result shows that air quality improvement policy is implemented separately from climate policy; the latter operates at the national level and the former at the local level. By looking at the actor interaction analysis, the study concludes that a more holistic environmental policy approach would be more efficient at reducing local air pollution and contributing to the mitigation of climate change. © 2017 by the authors.

The relative instrumental, structural, and discursive power of the movement and its adversaries is also examined, showing how, notwithstanding the fossil fuel industry's deeply embedded structural and instrumental power, the movement has managed to shift the contest onto a terrain where it holds a comparative advantage. Finally, the movement's role in nonstate climate governance is considered, taking account of its interactions with and impact on a range of other climate actors. This article's conclusion is that climate governance is not only an instrumental or pragmatic process of mandating changes in behavior but an expressive and symbolic one of nurturing a new norm and institutionalizing a new set of moral principles. © 2017 The Author Law & Policy © 2017 The University of Denver/Colorado Seminary",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031716311

The model outputs have been compared with observations through standard statistical measures. The aim is to study the relative performance of these schemes, selecting the best option climatic zone-wise and thereby minimizing uncertainty in model predictions. WRF model performance evaluation shows better agreement for temperature and relative humidity compared to wind speed. Overall for India, ACM2, QNSE show good performance for temperature and relative humidity whereas ACM2, MYNN show better performance for wind speed though these may vary for different climatic zones. Geopotential height and wind over 850 hPa is well simulated by ACM2 and MYNN over India. For PBL height ACM2, MYNN and MYJ works best for Chennai, New Delhi and Kolkata respectively during summer period. However, for winter period MYJ works best for Chennai while, QNSE works best for New Delhi and Kolkata. Considering all meteorological parameters together, it is seen that for arid zone ACM2, QNSE and MYJ schemes work reasonably well. For temperate zone, ACM2, QNSE and MYNN schemes show better results. For tropical zone all PBL schemes work closely. Hence, depending on the application, parameter and climate zone, this study provides suitable recommendations for choosing PBL schemes appropriately for each zone and parameter separately for the Indian region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate zones; India; PBL parameterization; Surface layer parameterization; WRF","Arid regions; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Weather forecasting; Wind; Different climatic zones; Geo-potential heights; India; Meteorological parameters; PBL parameterization; Planetary boundary layers; Surface layers; Temperature and relative humidity; Parameterization; air temperature; boundary layer; parameterization; relative humidity; sensitivity analysis; surface layer; weather forecasting; wind velocity; Chennai; Delhi; India; Kolkata; New Delhi; Tamil Nadu; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018517872

Here we construct regional climate networks from precipitation data in the Amazonian region and focus on network properties under the recent drought events in 2005 and 2010. Both the networks of the entire Amazon region and the extreme networks resulted from locations severely affected by drought events suggest that network characteristics show slight difference between the two drought events. Based on network degrees of extreme drought events and that without drought conditions, we identify regions of interest that are correlated to longer expected drought period length. Moreover, we show that the spatial correlation length to the regions of interest decayed much faster in 2010 than in 2005, which is because of the dual roles played by both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The results suggest that hub nodes in the regional climate network of Amazonia have fewer long-range connections when more severe drought conditions appeared in 2010 than that in 2005. © 2017 Guo et al.

Although there are some studies on the factors impacting the achievement of green growth, they are limited in quantity. Moreover, most of them are primarily focused on specific influencing factors, such as political factors, environmental regulation (ER), technological innovation (TI), and so on; while there is little discussion of the interaction effects in an integrated methodological framework. Accordingly, this paper develops an integrated model to investigate the relationships among ER, TI and regional green growth performance (RGGP). The model is tested using empirical data on 30 provincial administrative regions in China during 2011–2012 by employing structural equation modeling (SEM) approach that can effectively investigate the relationships between observed and latent variables and the relationships among latent variables simultaneously. The hypothesis H1 of this paper is not confirmed, and the results show that ER has a significant negative effect on RGGP. Both the hypotheses H2 and H3 are confirmed, namely, ER significantly positively influences TI, and TI has a positive impact on RGGP. This finding provides empirical evidence to support the Porter Hypothesis that properly designed ER may positively affect RGGP through motivating TI. According to the results of hypotheses H1, H2 and H3, we find that ER couldn't directly promote RGGP, but RGGP will be positively impacted by TI driven ER. The finding supports the view of ecological modernization theory that green growth practices may be promoted by TI driven ER, but whether ER can bring green growth practices is uncertain. Furthermore, the finding indicates that TI is a bridge for linking ER and RGGP. Based on our findings, we present some important implications that can be useful for policy-makers and enterprise managers to promote green growth practices in China. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese provincial administrative regions; Environmental regulation; Regional green growth performance; Structural equation modeling (SEM) approach; Technological innovation","Digital storage; Innovation; Chinese provincial administrative regions; Ecological modernization theories; Green growths; Integrated modeling; Interaction effect; Methodological frameworks; Structural equation modeling; Technological innovation; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024105717

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of plants on PAHs degradation and on associated changes in transcriptionally active bacterial community structures, degrading bacteria, and especially functional gene expression in a PAH-contaminated agricultural soil. We conducted a rhizo-box experiment planted with ryegrass for 60 days under glasshouse conditions. The degradation of 12PAHs in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils during the experiment was quantified using HPLC analysis. The dynamics of active bacterial community structure in soil were assessed using the molecular tool of cDNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Functional PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHDα) genes were cloned using the Gram-positive (GP) and Gram-negative (GN) primers. The abundance and activity of total bacteria and GP/GN PAH-degraders were monitored by real-time PCR. Results demonstrate that the agricultural soil contained known PAH degraders and RHDα genes, such as nidA3, pdoA, nahAc and phnAc. The presence of ryegrass promoted the dissipation of PAHs and changed the structures of active bacterial communities in soil. In general, the abundance of total bacteria and GP PAH-degrader increased during the inoculation time. The ryegrass root enhanced the functional bacterial diversity in the early stages (0–10 days). However, the effect of ryegrass roots may stimulate the expression of GP and GN PAH-RHDα genes after 40 days. Our results indicate that ryegrass increased the degradation of PAHs by promoting bacteria diversity, increasing the abundance of total bacteria and PAH degraders, and stimulating RHDα gene expression. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradation; Dioxygenase; DNA/RNA; Phytoremediation; Rhizosphere effect; Ryegrass","Agriculture; Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Cloning; Electrophoresis; Gene expression; Genes; Hydrocarbons; Polymerase chain reaction; Social sciences; Soils; Bacterial community structure; Denaturing gradient gel electrophoreses (DGGE); Dioxygenases; Phytoremediation; Plant-microbe interactions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Rhizosphere effects; Ryegrass; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; abundance; agricultural soil; bacterium; biodegradation; community dynamics; community structure; DNA; enzyme activity; experimental study; gene expression; grass; microbial activity; PAH; phytoremediation; rhizosphere; RNA; soil pollution; species diversity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lolium; Negibacteria; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020407376

The recycling and utilization of tree residues may effectively alleviate the situation and will contribute to emissions reduction and environmental protection. Therefore, this study aims to identify the tree residue resources and estimates their quantity in order to provide a basis for related research, such as its comprehensive utilization. This study redefines and reclassifies tree residue resources, in particular, it adds three tree residue resources: tree seedling residue, sanitation felling residue and urban greening and trimmings. This study divides the forest final felling and bucking residue resource into the stumpage section and the non-stumpage section, respectively, scientifically selects values of the percent of merchantable volume and the proportion of non-stumpage biomass of the stumpage volume, separately estimates the quantity of bamboo felling, bucking and processing residues, classifies the forest product processing zone into the sawing section and the forest product processing section, and estimates the current waste wood recycling quantity by tracking the timber output of previous years. The estimation results for tree residue quantity indicate that China's tree residue reached 511.63 Mt in 2015, of which the forest tending and thinning residue was 406.76 Mt, nearly four-fifths of the total tree residue. Among the 31 provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions), more than half (55.57%) of the potential reserve of tree residues is distributed in the 13 provinces of southern China, 25% in the 10 provinces in the north, and approximately 20% in the plain and hilly areas. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, the tree residue reserves showed positive growth. In the past three years (2014-2016), all state-owned forestry farms and collective-owned natural forests stopped commercial felling gradually, which directly resulted in a reduction of log output, thereby also curbing the growth of tree residue to a certain extent. Since the log output has ceased to further decline from 2017, it is predicted that China's tree residue will continue the upward trend. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Quantity estimation; Resources; Tree residue","biomass; emission control; environmental protection; estimation method; forest product; forest resource; plant residue; quantitative analysis; recycling; resource use; thinning; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029586789

Antarctic suspension-feeding communities, which inhabit the shelf of the Southern Ocean, resemble ""Terrestrial Vegetation Forests"" (TVF) or shrublands and support the concept of ""Antarctic Marine Animal Forests"" (AMAF). They comprise mostly sessile animals, provide microniches for an associated mobile fauna, and are fragmented and regionally mixed with other communities. On land, only high mountains and very dry regions are unsuitable for TVF, analogous to the virtual absence of AMAF from the deep sea (> 1000 m). Besides fundamental differences between these systems in energy flow and other ecological drivers such as light requirements and dispersal opportunities, both ""forests"" experience similar disturbances, which impact ecosystem dynamics and diversity in similar ways. While land use affects and reduces terrestrial forests, climate change and fishing impacts are the most serious threats to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Research priorities for a better understanding of ""Antarctic Marine Animal Forests"" demand (1) mapping biotic communities and their structural and functional diversity, especially in terms of hot and cold spots; (2) understanding ecological function, including ecosystem productivity and dynamics; (3) cross-system comparison to identify generality or uniqueness in ecosystem structure and dynamics; and (4) implication of existing and new research approaches and conservation strategies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Areal coverage; Climate change; Conservation; Disturbance; Ecological drivers; Energy flow; Interactions; Limiting factors; Three-dimensional structure",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055011677

The unbalance between the availability of water resources and demand is currently exacerbated and could become worse in the near future in accordance with climate change observations and scenarios provided by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this context, Increasing Maximum Capacity of the surface reservoir (IMC) and Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) are adaptation measures that have the potential to enhance water supply systems resiliency. In this paper, a multiple-users and multiple-resources-Water Supply System (WSS) model is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of these two adaptation strategies in a context of overexploited groundwater under the RCP 4.5 and the RCP 8.5 IPCC scenarios. The presented a case study that is located in the Puglia, a semi-arid region of South Italy characterized by a conspicuous water demand for irrigation. We observed that, although no significant long-term trend affects the proposed precipitation scenarios, the expected temperature increase highly impacts the WSS resources due to the associated increase of water demand for irrigation purposes. Under the RCP 4.5 the MAR scenario results are more effective than the IMC during long term wet periods (typically 5 years) and successfully compensates the impact on the groundwater resources. Differently, under RCP 8.5, due to more persistent dry periods, both adaptation scenarios fail and groundwater resource become exposed to massive sea water intrusion during the second half of the century. We conclude that the MAR scenario is a suitable adaptation strategy to face the expected future changes in climate, although mitigation actions to reduce green-house gases are strongly required. © 2017 by the authors.

It may also lead to the identification of hotspots. The patterns can then be targeted to manage the concentration level of pollutants. In this regard, employing spatial autocorrelation indices as important tools is inevitable. In this study, general and local indices of Moran's I and Getis-Ord statistics were assessed in their representation of the structural characteristics of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) polluted areas in Tehran, Iran, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. For this purpose, a grid (200 m × 200 m) was applied across the city, and the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method was used to allocate a value to each pixel. To compare the methods of detecting clusters meaningfully and quantitatively, the pollution cleanliness index (PCI) was established. The results ascertained a high clustering level of the pollutants in the study area (with 99% confidence level). PM2.5 clusters separated the city into northern and southern parts, as most of the cold spots were situated in the north half and the hotspots were in the south. However, the CO hotspots also covered an area from the northeast to southwest of the city and the cold spots were spread over the rest of the city. The Getis-Ord's PCI suggested a more polluted air quality than the Moran's I PCI. The study provides a feasible methodology for urban planners and decision makers to effectively investigate and govern contaminated sites with the aim of reducing the harmful effects of air pollution on public health and the environment. © 2017 by the Author.","Air pollution; Getis-Ord; Moran's I; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial clusters; Tehran",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029330884

As a consequence, many still existing glacier and permafrost landscapes probably transform within decades into new landscapes of bare bedrock, loose debris, sparse vegetation, numerous new lakes and steep slopes with slowly degrading permafrost. These new landscapes are likely to persist for centuries if not millennia to come. During variable but mostly extended future time periods, such new landscapes will be characterized by pronounced disequilibria within their geo- and ecosystems. This especially involves long-term stability reduction of steep/icy mountain slopes as a slow and delayed reaction to stress redistribution following de-buttressing by vanishing glaciers and to changes in mechanical strength and hydraulic permeability caused by permafrost degradation. Thereby, the probability of far-reaching flood waves from large mass movements into lakes systematically increases with the formation of many new lakes and systems of lakes in close neighborhood to, or even directly at the foot of, so-affected slopes. Results of recent studies in the Swiss Alps are reviewed and complemented with examples from the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and the Mount Everest region in Nepal. Hot spots of future hazards from potential flood waves caused by large rock falls into new lakes can already now be recognized. To this end, integrated spatial information on glacier/permafrost evolution and lake formation can be used together with scenario-based models for rapid mass movements, impact waves and flood propagation. The resulting information must then be combined with exposure and vulnerability considerations related to settlements and infrastructure. This enables timely planning of risk reduction options. Such risk reduction options consist of two components: Mitigation of hazards, which in the present context are due to effects from climate change, and reduction in consequences, which result from societal conditions and changes.

Varieties were planted in two progressive seasons in recently reclaimed lands, where two fields were selected the first is located in North Sinai while the second is situated to the south of Behira Governorate. Bio elicitors reduced abiotic stress and enhance physiological characteristic expressed as Proline, soluble carbohydrates %, Chl.a, Chl.b, Chl.a + b; Chl.a/Chl.b; Carotenoids and increased the concentration of Crude protein, N, P and total soluble carbohydrates in wheat grains. Using P. fluorescens exhibted increment in grain yield of wheat plants, cv sakha 93 amounted by 68.3% in Sinai region, while in Behira region the increement reached (45.5%) with P. polymyxa treatment. The response of Gemmiza 10 variety to the Bio-elicitors was less compared to Sakha 93 variety in both regions, where the highest increments due to P. putida treatment were18.9 and 19.7% in Sinai and beheirwa regions, respectively, compared to the control in each region. A remarkable increments of wheat growth, development and extended survival under salt and water limiting and restricting conditions.

Therefore, researchers should conduct precise measurements on energy consumption caused by vehicles to support the applications of green navigation. In most cases, energy consumption are resulted by vehicles driving on the roads, of which are numerous and great mobility and hard to be directly collected and monitored through energy-consumption sensing devices. So a lot of scholars used a model of vehicles' energy consumption based on computer technology and established a historical database through analyzing historic data to support the measurements of energy consumption. On hand, previous studies on energy-consumption models would collect a large amount of samples despite of the accuracy of data. And on the other hand, different structures of different road conditions which may influence the generation of energy consumption and result in the secondary loss of accurate data were neglected as well. Aimed at the problems mentioned above, I would like to set forth and conduct a measurement of energy consumption based on computer technologies and combined with a real-Time measurement of city roads of RBFNN, which would measure different road sections.

Tree planting projects primarily aimed at mitigating climate change frequently claim that they simultaneously reduce degradation. However, despite the centrality of ‘degradation’ in the forest carbon discourse, reference is rarely made to the significant body of literature questioning generalizations about degradation in Africa since the mid-1990s. Many studies have exposed biases and problematic underlying motives in claims of degradation in various African regions. Combining this literature with discourse analysis, we present a framework for analysing degradation narratives in order to explore the extent to which these are based on evidence or opinion. We acknowledge that environmental change is complex, and increasingly so today in the face of climate change, and we stress that narratives cannot be pinned down as ‘true or false’. However, unconfirmed ‘truths’ about degradation being acute have resulted in significant, costly and far-reaching actions to halt it. Thus there is a need to scrutinize the empirical evidence using the best available knowledge. Our framework, designed to be easily applicable for practitioners, could facilitate increased engagement with and scrutiny of degradation claims in forest carbon interventions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Africa; climate change; deforestation; degradation; narrative","carbon; climate change; deforestation; environmental degradation; tree planting; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966697246

It is commonly believed that bacteria are the major consumers of root exudates and that the role of fungi in the rhizosphere is mostly limited to plant-associated taxa, such as mycorrhizal fungi, pathogens and endophytes, whereas less is known about the role of saprotrophs. In order to test the hypothesis that the role of saprotrophic fungi in rhizosphere processes increases with increased time after abandonment from agriculture, we determined the composition of fungi that are active in the rhizosphere along a chronosequence of ex-arable fields in the Netherlands. Intact soil cores were collected from nine fields that represent three stages of land abandonment and pulse labeled with 13 CO 2. The fungal contribution to metabolization of plant-derived carbon was evaluated using phospholipid analysis combined with stable isotope probing (SIP), whereas fungal diversity was analyzed using DNA-SIP combined with 454-sequencing. We show that in recently abandoned fields most of the root-derived 13 C was taken up by bacteria but that in long-term abandoned fields most of the root-derived 13 C was found in fungal biomass. Furthermore, the composition of the active functional fungal community changed from one composed of fast-growing and pathogenic fungal species to one consisting of beneficial and slower-growing fungal species, which may have essential consequences for the carbon flow through the soil food web and consequently nutrient cycling and plant succession. © 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.",,"abandoned land; chronosequence; community dynamics; endophyte; food web; fungus; genetic analysis; hypothesis testing; nutrient cycling; pathogen; phospholipid; rhizosphere; secondary succession; stable isotope; Netherlands; Fungi; carbon; agriculture; bacterium; biomass; chemistry; classification; ecosystem; fungus; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; Netherlands; plant; plant root; rhizosphere; soil; Agriculture; Bacteria; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Fungi; Mycorrhizae; Netherlands; Plant Roots; Plants; Rhizosphere; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029649431

Paradoxically, the climate change mitigation strategy of fossil fuel divestment is in itself subject to shifts in weather patterns resulting from climate change. This is particularly true with solar power, which depends on local cloud cover. However, because observed shortwave radiation data usually span a decade or less, persistent long-term trends may not be identified. A simple linear regression model is created here using diurnal temperature range (DTR) during 2002-15 as a predictor variable to estimate long-term shortwave radiation (SR) values in the northeastern United States. Using an extended DTR dataset, SR values are computed for 1956-2015. Statistically significant decreases in shortwave radiation are identified that are dominated by changes during the summer months. Because this coincides with the season of greatest insolation and the highest potential for energy production, financial implications may be large for the solar energy industry if such trends persist into the future. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Renewable energy; Shortwave radiation; Temperature; Trends","Fossil fuels; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Temperature; Climate change mitigation; Diurnal temperature ranges; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Short-wave radiation; Simple linear regression; Solar energy industries; Trends; Climate change; climate change; cloud cover; diurnal variation; renewable resource; shortwave radiation; solar power; temperature anomaly; trend analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032666020

The imported wood pellets are (co-)fired in power plants with the aim of reducing overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity and meeting EU renewable energy targets. To assess whether GHG emissions are reduced and on what timescale, we construct the GHG balance of wood-pellet electricity. This GHG balance consists of supply chain and combustion GHG emissions, carbon sequestration during biomass growth and avoided GHG emissions through replacing fossil electricity. We investigate wood pellets from four softwood feedstock types: small roundwood, commercial thinnings, harvest residues and mill residues. Per feedstock, the GHG balance of wood-pellet electricity is compared against those of alternative scenarios. Alternative scenarios are combinations of alternative fates of the feedstock materials, such as in-forest decomposition, or the production of paper or wood panels like oriented strand board (OSB). Alternative scenario composition depends on feedstock type and local demand for this feedstock. Results indicate that the GHG balance of wood-pellet electricity equals that of alternative scenarios within 0–21 years (the GHG parity time), after which wood-pellet electricity has sustained climate benefits. Parity times increase by a maximum of 12 years when varying key variables (emissions associated with paper and panels, soil carbon increase via feedstock decomposition, wood-pellet electricity supply chain emissions) within maximum plausible ranges. Using commercial thinnings, harvest residues or mill residues as feedstock leads to the shortest GHG parity times (0–6 years) and fastest GHG benefits from wood-pellet electricity. We find shorter GHG parity times than previous studies, for we use a novel approach that differentiates feedstocks and considers alternative scenarios based on (combinations of) alternative feedstock fates, rather than on alternative land uses. This novel approach is relevant for bioenergy derived from low-value feedstocks. © 2017 The Authors.

Biofuels have been developed to replace fossil fuels to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. However, food security and water scarcity are other growing concerns, and the increased production of biofuels may increase these problems. This study focuses on whether biofuel development would stress China's water resources. Cassava-based fuel ethanol and sweet sorghum-based fuel ethanol are the focus of this study because they are the most typical nongrain biofuels in China. The spatial distribution of the total water requirement of fuel ethanol over its life cycle process was simulated using a biophysical biogeochemical model and marginal land as one of the types of input data for the model to avoid impacts on food security. The total water requirement of fuel ethanol was then compared with the spatial distribution of water resources, and the influence of the development of fuel ethanol on water resources at the pixel and river basin region scales was analyzed. The result showed that the total water requirement of fuel ethanol ranges from 37.81 to 862.29 mm. However, considering water resource restrictions, not all of the marginal land is suitable for the development of fuel ethanol. Approximately 0.664 million km2 of marginal land is suitable for the development of fuel ethanol, most of which is located in the south of China, where water resources are plentiful. For these areas, the value of fuel ethanol's water footprint ranges from 0.05 to 11.90 m3 MJ−1.

During the past few years, religious leaders have been called upon by their states and civil societies to draw upon intangible assets such as supplicating publicly and performing mass prayer meetings to beseech the Almighty to bring rain to their regions. Though the supplications of some were answered, others have been waiting for the Divine’s response by keeping their hands raised and their eyes upon the skies. The purpose of this essay is fourfold: first, to identify prayer as a critical intangible asset for religious traditions when they encounter a crisis; second, to broadly discuss the interconnections between religion (in this case, Islam) and climate change; third, to identify guidelines for when and why to perform the “prayer for rain”; and fourth, to describe the responses of African Muslim communities and the strategies of Muslim religious leadership in praying for rain during and beyond times of drought. © (2017) World Council of Churches.

At the Mengyuan section, on the northeastern margin of the Qilian Mountains, sandy silt provided three OSL ages that suggest deposition during a very cold, dry period in northeastern China between c. 29 and 19 ka (early part of marine isotope stage (MIS) 2). Load-casting into the underlying outwash gravel occurred during climate amelioration. In some cases, the sandy silt infilled the spaces left by underlying thawing blocks of ice without collapse of the surrounding gravel. The gravel must therefore be older than c. 30 ka and was probably deposited by outwash from glaciers on the higher parts of the Qilian Mountains during MIS 3. Included in them were buried contemporaneous or remnant blocks of glacial ice. Subsequently the surface became flat by unknown processes and was finally covered by a thin loess dating from 2.7 ka, indicating it was deposited in the first warmer period in the Neoglacial sequence of events. Thus, the last major cold event spanned the period through isotope stages 2 and 3 in this area (57 to c. 19 ka), during which the dominant effects of glaciation of the mountain tops were replaced by intensely dry, cold permafrost conditions for c. 10 ka.

Degraded forests in the Brazilian Amazon region are dominant in the pioneer front landscapes where the economic growth and agricultural expansion has converted the primary forest to a mosaic of pastures, crop land and forests in various stages of degradation. Understanding spatial structure and temporal trajectories of forest degradation is important to support forest conservation and management, aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, retrieving biomass, biological diversity and sustainable economic development. We present a method to evaluate and map different levels of forest degradation in Paragominas a county in the Arc of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. We used Landsat time series (2000-2015) and the CLASlite software to calculated the fractional cover maps with three bands of Photosynthetic Vegetation (PV), Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) and bare Soil (S) for each year and to produce annual maps of forest degradation. We analyzed the variance of each CLASlite band (PV, NPV, S) along the 2000-2015 period. Field observations of degraded forests, based on indicators of forest structure were used for the validation. The results showed that the CLASlite bands variances are relevant indicators of the forest degradation processes. © 2017 IEEE.","Brazilian Amazon; Forest degradation; Spectral mixture analysis; Time series","Agriculture; Conservation; Deforestation; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Image analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Agricultural expansion; Brazilian Amazon; Forest conservation; Forest degradation; Non-photosynthetic vegetation; Spectral mixture analysis; Sustainable economic development; Temporal trajectories; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032367828

Given the need to expedite natural recovery of disturbed areas through restoration interventions, we characterized litter accumulation and nutrient content (i.e., organic carbon, total N, and P) and quantified their association with key plant species. Plant species cover and litter characteristics were sampled at 18 successional forest plant communities along major roadways in Sichuan Basin, western China. Variation in litter across communities was assessed with principal component analysis (PCA) and species with the highest correlation to PCA axes were determined with Pearson’s r coefficients. Plant communities with the longest time since road construction (i.e., 70 years) were distinctly different in litter total N and organic carbon compared to plant communities with a shorter disturbance history. We encountered 59 plant species across sampling plots, but only four rare species (i.e., frequency < 5) were strongly correlated with litter characteristics (p < 0.01); none of which were the most abundant where they occurred. These results highlight the importance of site-specific factors (i.e., geographic location, disturbance age) regulating plant litter across heavily disturbed landscapes and how litter characteristics and rare plant species are correlated. © 2017 by the authors.

However, previous studies have found unsatisfactory control of NOx emissions for SCR-equipped urban buses, which has raised concern among policy-makers and researchers regarding the capability of SCR adopted by heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) in real-world applications. This study tested sixteen HDDTs in China between 2010 and 2014, including six SCR-equipped Euro IV HDDTs using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS). On-road emission measurement results show no significant difference in NOx emissions between Euro II and Euro III HDDTs. In contrast, we observed a substantial reduction in real-world NOx emissions, as low as 25.4 g kg-fuel–1, for six SCR-equipped HDDTs (Euro IV) compared with those without SCR systems (Euro II and Euro III), providing an overall reduction of ~50%. However, real-world brake-specific NOx emission factors for the SCR-equipped HDDTs were higher by ~45% than the lab test limit of 3.5 g kWh–1 due to off-cycle NOx emissions, indicating the importance of introducing real-world emission test requirements for HDDTs. Due to the introduction of SCR systems, distinctive impacts from real-world operating conditions are observed for HDDTs. For example, fuel-based NOx emission factors steadily decrease as the vehicle speed increases due to higher exhaust temperatures, which improve the efficiency of SCR systems. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Heavy-duty diesel trucks; NOx emission; PEMS; SCR","Air pollution control equipment; Automobiles; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Thyristors; Trucks; Heavy duty diesel vehicles; Heavy-duty diesel; NOx emissions; Operating condition; PEMS; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Selective catalytic reduction systems; Substantial reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; catalysis; concentration (composition); emission; emission control; European Union; nitrous oxide; policy making; standard (regulation); transport vehicle; trucking; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031732086

Kobresia pygmaea is the dominant species forming a typical turf layer resistant to disturbance; however, overgrazing may have exceeded that resistance. An integrated approach, including field monitoring, soil sampling, stable isotope hydrology, and physical modelling, was used to evaluate the hydrological consequences of meadow degradation with respect to normal meadow, degraded crust, and bare soil. Multiple evidence confirms that the soil moisture condition worsens when the meadow degrades. Bare soil has the coarsest soil texture, rapid infiltration, and low soil moisture in the root zone, and soil evaporation rate is high compared to normal meadow especially in dry periods. Crusted meadow soil has the lowest surface infiltration and a larger exposure of the leaf surface because of low plant cover over a dark surface, which favours high transpiration. Crusted meadow also has a drier condition in the root zone. These suggest that degradation is a positive feedback process in which leaf and soil exposure to radiation strengthen water demand for transpiration and facilitate non-productive water loss, leaving the root zone (0–20 cm) dry and subject to further soil erosion. This positive process suggests that recovery of the Kobresia meadow is a long-term task which has to consider the different levels of degradation and the effects of local climate change, in order to adapt the rangeland management practices, to the needs of meadow conservation and restoration.

By considering the impact of water stress and climate variability on such prediction, we found the predictable lead time reached up to 6 months in specific regions. This issue was addressed by enforcing three products into standard statistical analysis. We used the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 Satellite (GOME-2) retrieved SIF for investigation. The water stress and the climate variability was respectively measured in this paper with remotely sensed surface soil moisture and the large-scale oscillation indices provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The most direct effect on health from the UHI is due to heat risk, which is exacerbated in urban areas, particularly during heat waves. However, there may be health benefits from warming during colder months. This review highlights recent attempts to quantitatively estimate the health impacts of the UHI and estimations of the health benefits of UHI mitigation measures. Recent Findings: Climate change, increasing urbanisation and an ageing population in much of the world, is likely to increase the risks to health from the UHI, particularly from heat exposure. Studies have shown increased health risks in urban populations compared with rural or suburban populations in hot weather and a disproportionate impact on more vulnerable social groups. Estimations of the impacts of various mitigation techniques suggest that a range of measures could reduce health impacts from heat and bring other benefits to health and wellbeing. Summary: The impact of the UHI on heat-related health is significant, although often overlooked, particularly when considering future impacts associated with climate change. Multiple factors should be considered when designing mitigation measures in urban environments in order to maximise health benefits and avoid unintended negative effects. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Built environment; Cities; Heat; Mitigation; Mortality; Temperature","city; climate change; heat; human; public health; urban population; urbanization; Cities; Climate Change; Hot Temperature; Humans; Public Health; Urban Population; Urbanization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027460276

This paper investigates the effectiveness of these strategies and the provision of infrastructures in 30 UK cities, with a specific emphasis on those strategies that are within the remit of cities and local authorities. The climate mitigation strategies and supporting documents were obtained from 30 UK cities recommended by the Urban Audit Methodology. We show that 13 cities mention EVs in their strategies. Analysing EV registrations and the EV infrastructures that is provided by cities we found that there is no statistical difference in the number of charging points or EVs between the cities that have EVs as part of their climate change mitigation strategy and those that do not. It was shown that EV uptake was more generally associated with other factors (such as local vehicle population or income) rather than any documented EV/climate mitigation strategy. We demonstrate that local strategies are failing in achieving the much needed step change and make suggestions how to improve EV uptake as an even more radical thinking and policies may become necessary to achieve carbon reduction targets. © 2017 The Authors","Cars; Cities; Electric vehicles; Infrastructure; Strategies; Technology","Carbon; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Railroad cars; Technology; Vehicles; Cities; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Infrastructure; Mitigation strategy; Statistical differences; Strategies; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; electric vehicle; emission control; infrastructure planning; mitigation; policy strategy; technology adoption; urban planning; urban transport; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020412043

Sixteen years of data, from 2000 to 2015, were analyzed. During that time, the annual average PM10 concentrations declined almost linearly at a rate of −1.98 μg m−3 year−1. The number of high PM10 days declined faster than did the number of low PM10 days. This indicates that the bulk of the annual average PM10 mass concentration reduction was high-level PM10 concentrations. Further analysis of this data revealed two interesting points. First, though the annual average PM10 concentrations clearly lowered for period 1 (from 2000 to 2012; −2.28 μg m−3 year−1), they remained almost unchanged at a virtually constant value for period 2 (from 2012 to 2015; −0.02 μg m−3 year−1). Second, annual average PM10 concentrations showed a large spatial concentration gradient among all monitoring stations in the early 2000s. However, the spatial concentration gradient got gradually smaller until reaching a nearly no-gradient, uniform concentration among all monitoring stations from 2010 onward. Clear PM10 concentration reduction in period 1 was driven by local emission reduction. However, its reduction was not enough in period 2. The reduction of local emissions was negated by the increase of local activities and transported particulates, as well as the formation of secondary aerosol in Seoul from emissions transported from upwind regional sources. This resulted in PM10 concentrations becoming stagnant in period 2. PM10 reduction rate in the downwind area was faster than that in the upwind area. For the first 5 years, the reduction rate in the downwind area was great. Between all the stations observed, nearly all of the concentration difference was a result of more reduction in secondary aerosol. After 2005, coarse particles and primary elemental carbon (EC) played a key role in reducing the PM10 concentration. Our findings on these two data features, and their causes, will help people to understand the most recent characteristics of particulate matters, in turn helping to update the control strategy for the continued improvement of particulate air quality in Seoul. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Local and regional sources; Long-range transport; PM10; Secondary aerosol; Spatial concentration gradient; Stagnant reduction","aerosol; air quality; concentration (composition); elemental carbon; environmental gradient; long range transport; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020119531

Intelligent transportation systems based on vehicular ad-doc network (VANET) communications will improve many services, expressively, related to transport, security, reliability, management and including the assistance in the reduction of traffic congestion. In this context, we propose an intelligent system based, firstly, on a new clustering technique to control and maintain the stability of routes during inter-vehicular communications, and secondly, a bio-inspired systematically conducting mobility measurement of agent, intervening in cases of traffic congestion, in order to find new routes to those offered by the global positioning system. Obviously, by providing an appropriate route selection process, such routing concept could be helpful in exchanging control messages to inform the nearest medics willing to give first aid and routing of another alert to the nearest ambulance. Thus, in order to deal with these sophisticated optimization techniques, we evaluate in this article means of simulation experiments. According to that, we have anticipated particular incidents suitable to estimate the pertinence of the proposed system. The analysis and implementation in VANET will be based on three simulators, especially, SUMO, MOVE and NS2. The results prove the effectiveness of the approach by reducing fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions along with the rest of pollutant emissions in the case of an incident. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimization (ACO); Clustering; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Smart city; Smart clustering-optimized link state routing (SC-OLSR); VANET","Ad hoc networks; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Intelligent systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Smart city; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Transportation routes; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Clustering; Communication modeling; Intelligent transportation systems; Inter-vehicular communication; Optimization techniques; Optimized Link State Routing; VANET; Vehicular ad hoc networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019205125

These approaches suffer, however, from ‘traditional’ issues such as lack of enforcement, human and financial constraints as well as unclear or misguiding government mandates. Successes are witnessed using a community-based carbon project approach, ensuring high stakeholder participation via direct or indirect incentive programmes. Comprehensive coastal zone management approaches seem very promising, but success overall, and regarding carbon specifically, are yet to be reported.

Due to this effect, the comfort conditions of the citizens deteriorate. In the case of the city of Seville (Spain), several models of climate change forecast increases in the maximum temperatures ranging from 1.5 to 6 °C in summer. This article explores the role of green roofs as a supplement to the green spaces of the city, in order to buffer the negative effects of the increase of the maximum temperatures due to climate change. Images from the Landsat 7 ETM+ and Sentinel-2 satellites have been used in order to verify the inverse relationship between land surface temperature and the abundance of vegetation, expressed by the normalized difference vegetation index. For Seville, a green roof surface of 740 ha should be implemented, in the most adverse scenario, which means covering 40.6% of the existing buildings. In the most optimistic scenario, the forecasted green roof surface required is 207 ha (11.3% of the roofs). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Heat island; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing; Urban greening","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Landforms; Remote sensing; Roofs; Vegetation; Climate change mitigation; Comfort conditions; Heat island; Inverse relationship; Land surface temperature; Maximum temperature; Normalized difference vegetation index; Urban greening; Climate change; climate change; environmental planning; garden; greenspace; heat island; land surface; Landsat; NDVI; remote sensing; roof; satellite imagery; Sentinel; urban planning; Andalucia; Sevilla; Seville; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026508241

The diazofluorene consists of naphthoquinone, cyclopentadiene, and diazo substituents fused through a σ- and π-bonding network. Additionally, (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) is a potent cytotoxin, with half-maximal inhibitory potency (IC50) values in the low nanomolar range against many cancer cell lines. Because of limitations in supply, its mechanism of action had remained a ""black box"" since its isolation in the early 2000s. In this Account, I describe how studies directed toward the total synthesis of (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) provided a platform to elucidate the emergent properties of this metabolite and thereby connect chemical reactivity with cellular phenotype.We first developed a convergent strategy to prepare the diazofluorene (9 + 10 → 13). We then adapted this chemistry to the synthesis of lomaiviticin aglycon (21/22) and the natural monomeric diazofluorene (-)-kinamycin F (3). The key step in the lomaiviticin aglycon (21/22) synthesis involved the stereoselective oxidative coupling of two monomeric diazofluorenes (2 × 18 → 20) to establish the cojoining carbon-carbon bond of the target. As the absolute stereochemistry of the aglycon and carbohydrate residues of (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) were unknown, we developed a semisynthetic route to the metabolite that proceeds in one step and 42% yield by diazo transfer to the more abundant isolate (-)-lomaiviticin C (6). This allowed us to complete the stereochemical assignment of (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) and provided a renewable source of material. Using this material, we established that the remarkable cytotoxic effects of (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) derive from the induction of highly toxic double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. At the molecular level, 1,7-nucleophilic additions to each electrophilic diazofluorene trigger homolytic decomposition pathways that produce sp2 radicals at the carbon atoms of each diazo group. These radicals abstract hydrogen atoms from the deoxyribose of DNA, a process known to initiate strand cleavage. NMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics simulations were used to elucidate the mode of DNA binding. These studies showed that both diazofluorenes of (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) penetrate into the duplex. This mode of non-covalent binding places each diazo carbon atom in close proximity to each DNA strand. Throughout these studies, isolates containing one diazofluorene, such as (-)-lomaiviticin C (6) and (-)-kinamycin C (2), were used as controls. Consistent with our mechanistic model, these compounds do not induce DSBs in DNA and are several orders of magnitude less potent. Reactivity studies suggest that (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) is more electrophilic than simple monomeric diazofluorenes. We attribute this to through-space delocalization of the developing negative charge in the transition state for 1,7-addition. Consistent with this mechanism of action, (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) displays selective low-picomolar potencies toward DNA DSB repair-deficient cell types. The emergent properties of (-)-lomaiviticin A (4) derive from the specific arrangement of diazo, naphthoquinone, cyclopentadiene, and ketone functional groups. These functional groups work together to yield, essentially, a masked vinyl radical that can be exposed under biological conditions. Furthermore, the rotational symmetry of the metabolite, deriving from dimerization, allows it to interact with the antiparallel symmetry of DNA and affect cleavage of the duplex. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031707177

Design/methodology/approach: Two types of global circulation model and three scenarios for three periods were used. Daily climatic parameters were generated by LARS-WG (Long Ashton Research Station-Weather Generator). The CERES-wheat model was used to simulate future winter wheat growth, development and production. Findings: The results showed that CO2 had no effect on the phenology of winter wheat, and the negative impact of temperature on the grain yield was higher than the positive effect of CO2 enrichment. The length of the reproductive growth period of the winter wheat was significantly shortened as affected by the negative impacts of rise in temperature. The simulated results indicated that the grain yield of common (medium maturing) variety of winter wheat will decline, ranging from −0.27 to −18.71 per cent according to future climate changes. Adaptation strategies showed that the early maturing variety had a higher and more stable grain yield under climate change conditions than medium and delayed maturing varieties. Earlier planting date (20 October) increased wheat grain yield under future climatic conditions than common (November 5) planting date. In reverse, later planting (November 20) would accelerate harmful effects of climate change on wheat grain yield. Originality/value: The results highlighted the potential of early maturing variety and early planting date as the appropriate agronomical approaches for mitigating harmful impacts of climate change on winter wheat production in arid regions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","CERES-wheat; CO2; LARS-WG; Planting date; Variety","adaptive management; agricultural management; agronomy; arid region; climate change; climate conditions; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; growth; phenology; sowing; temperature effect; wheat; winter; England; Iran; Kerman [Iran]; Long Ashton; North Somerset; United Kingdom; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030317009

In this study, experts in different areas along supply chains co-operated in an interactive process to define future environmentally sustainable supply chains of milk and beef. The basis was to use existing techniques, to have production performance corresponding to the best quartile of today and to consider other sustainability aspects, such as economics. The work resulted in concrete descriptions of alternative product chains for delivered milk and beef. To also permit concrete descriptions of the latter part of the product chains, two consumer-packed end products were selected for monitoring, namely fresh milk and sirloin steak. The production systems investigated comprised cropping, livestock production, industrial processing and production, logistics, packaging and wastage and distribution, but not retailers or consumers. The study area was a Swedish county and the reference level was its production of milk and beef in 2012. The future product chains were assumed to deliver the same amounts of commodities as in 2012, but with reduced environmental impact. Primary production was required to be at least as profitable as today. Beside description of the current situation, three alternative scenarios were created, focusing on delivery of ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation and minimising climate impact, respectively. Life cycle assessments were performed for these four scenarios (reference plus three alternative scenarios) for single-product chains and county-wide. Furthermore, production costs in primary production were calculated for the four scenarios. The results revealed great potential to reduce the negative environmental impact of Swedish dairy and beef production at current volumes, irrespective of whether ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation or climate impact is in focus. The single most important factor for decreased environmental impact for livestock production was increased production efficiency. Measures in agriculture, especially concerning feeds, were critical, but actions in processing and distribution also contributed. All alternative scenarios resulted in lower production costs than at present. It was obvious that as dairy and beef systems are connected, the potential for their environmental improvement must be analysed together. In conclusion, increased efficiency can decrease the negative environmental impact of Swedish cattle production and also reduce costs to the farmer. © 2017 The Authors","Beef; Cattle; Food system scenarios; LCA; Milk; Sustainable food chains","alternative agriculture; cattle; cost analysis; dairy farming; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; food science; life cycle analysis; milk production; production system; supply chain management; Sweden; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020923159

A central element of this network of activity is the climate information website (CIW) that has seen a rapid and organic growth, yet with variable content and quality, and unfettered by any code of practice. This builds an ethical–epistemic dilemma that warrants assessment as the presence of CIWs contribute to real-world consequences and commitment. This study considers the context of CIW growth, and reviews a representative sample of CIWs to draw out key issues for consideration in CIW development. We assess content, function, and use-case value through a dual approach of a typology and user experience narratives to evaluate the general efficacy of a CIW. The typology reveals strong contrasts in content, complicated interfaces, and an overload of choice making it difficult to converge on a stable outcome. The narratives capture user experience and highlight barriers that include navigation difficulties, jargon laden content, minimal or opaque guidance, and inferred information without context about uncertainty and limits to skill. This illuminates four concerns: (1) the ethics of information provision in a context of real-world consequences; (2) interfaces that present barriers to achieving robust solutions; (3) weak capacity of both users and providers to identify information of value from the multimodel and multimethod data; and (4) inclusion of data that infer skill.

The gain medium is composed of a 300 ± 2 nm thin waveguide of an organic semiconductor, doped with 53 nm gold nanoparticle cores, isolated within silica shells. Upon loading the nanoparticles, the threshold of amplified spontaneous emission is reduced from 1.75 μJ cm-2 × 102 for an undoped gain medium, to 0.35 μJ cm-2 × 102 for a highly concentrated gain medium, and lasing spikes narrower than 0.1 nm are obtained. Most importantly, selection of silica shells with thicknesses of 10, 17 and 21 nm enables engineering of the plasmon-exciton energy coupling and consequently tuning of the laser slope efficiency. With this approach, the slope efficiency is increased by two times by decreasing the silica shell from 21 nm down to 10 nm, due to the enhancement of the localized electric field. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Electric fields; Gold nanoparticles; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Plasmonics; Shells (structures); Silica; Amplified spontaneous emissions; Emission enhancement; Exciton energies; Hybrid gain mediums; Organic semiconductor thin films; Random lasing; Silica shell; Slope efficiencies; Organic semiconductor materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041735647

The arid parts of sub-Saharan Africa harbour several interesting weevil lineages, the most spectacular being the larger flightless weevils such as the Microcerinae and Brachycerus. Here we map the species richness of these two groups to identify hotspots in their diversity, and make inferences regarding the factors that may have contributed to the observed patterns. Exceptional richness values in both groups are found in southern Africa, and more specifically in the Nama Karoo, which is unremarkable in terms of plant diversity. By comparisons, plant diversity hotspots such as the Succulent Karoo and the Cape Floristic Region appear to have high, but not exceptional, weevil richness. Species richness levels were also high in the grassland and savanna areas of south-eastern Africa, which are not arid. The representation of genera considered here and their closest relatives, suggest an African origin for both lineages. This, combined with recent insights into weevil evolution, raise the possibility that advanced weevils as a whole (the family Curculionidae) originated in Africa and that some of its earliest offshoots survived and subsequently diversified here thanks to multiple factors, relating to climate and plant diversity alike. © 2017 Magnolia Press.","Africa; Arid climate; Curculionidae; Mediterranean; Weevil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029787023

This is particularly evident in the policy domain of climate change, where a number of authors have observed a relocation of authority in global climate governance. These scholars claim that multilateral treaty making has lost much of its spark, and they emphasize the emergence of transnational governance arrangements, such as city networks, private certification schemes, and business self-regulation. However, the different types of interactions between the various transnational climate initiatives and the intergovernmental level have not been studied in much detail and only recently attracted growing scholarly interest. Therefore, the present article addresses this issue and focuses on the interplay between three different transnational climate governance arrangements and the international climate regime. The analysis in this article underscores that substate and nonstate actors have attained several authoritative functions in global climate policy making. Nevertheless, the three case studies also demonstrate that this development does not imply that we are witnessing a general shift of authority away from the intergovernmental level toward transnational actors. Instead, what can be observed in global climate governance is an ongoing reconfiguration of authority, which apparently reaffirms the centrality of the international climate regime. Thus, this article points to the need for a more nuanced perspective on the changing patterns of authority in global climate governance. In a nutshell, this study shows that the international climate regime is not the only location where the problem of climate change is addressed, while it highlights the persistent authority of state-based forms of regulation. © The Author (2017).

To do so, the chapter analyses the characteristics of New Zealand economy, the institutional and regulatory context for domestic abatement, and considers the barriers to the further uptake of these technologies in a range of sectors. The New Zealand Emission Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), as well as institutional responses to transport, distributed energy, and geothermal technologies, is all considered. The international dimensions of New Zealand's INDC's commitments arguably require harmonisation of regional carbon markets and an increased trade in environmental goods and services.

However, the mechanisms driving interannual to millennial variability of the westerlies remain poorly understood. Here, we present an 1800-yr record of westerly wind variability recorded in New Zealand fjord sediments. Located west of the Southern Alps, fjord basins receive large amounts of westerly-driven orographic precipitation (&gt;6 m yr−1) and strong winds lead to vigorous fjord mixing. Because of these links, reconstructing precipitation and fjord circulation provides information on westerly wind behavior over southwest New Zealand. Applying a multiproxy approach, we find several intervals of inferred regional wind variability. The intervals of 1450-1400, 825-775, 575-550, and 50-0 cal yr BP were anomalously wet, while 325-300 and 250-225 cal yr BP were anomalously dry. These interpreted intervals appear to be in phase with regional paleoclimate records. Two centennial-scale wet intervals align with a multi-centennial warm interval identified in the Pages2k Australasian temperature reconstruction, while the drier intervals generally occur during cooler times. The wet/dry intervals presented here are matched by opposite wind and/or precipitation trends reconstructed from the windfield core in Chile and the southern windfield margin in Antarctica. Such spatial patterns support the notion of centennial-scale latitudinal wind shifts or contraction/expansion of the core. Consistent with observations, all sites show wind strengthening from ∼50 cal yr BP to present, indicating an overall intensification of winds that is observed in modern instrumental and reanalysis data sets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fiordland; Fjord; Late Holocene; New Zealand; Southern Hemisphere westerly winds","Carbon; Fiordland; Fjord; Late Holocene; New zealand; Westerly winds; Wind; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; fjord; Holocene; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); reconstruction; regional climate; Southern Hemisphere; westerly; wind field; Antarctica; Australasia; Chile; New Zealand; New Zealand; South Island; Southern Alps; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026436883

The observation of these changes is one of the major objectives of the international climate monitoring strategy developed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Long-term glacier mass balance measurements are furthermore the basis for calibrating and validating models simulating future runoff of glacierised catchments. This is essential for Central Asia, which is one of the driest continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In the highly populated regions, water shortage due to decreased glacierisation potentially leads to pronounced political instability, drastic ecological changes and endangered food security. As a consequence of the collapse of the former Soviet Union, however, many valuable glacier monitoring sites in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains were abandoned. In recent years, multinational actors have re-established a set of important in situ measuring sites to continue the invaluable long-term data series. This paper introduces the applied monitoring strategy for selected glaciers in the Kyrgyz and Uzbek Tien Shan and Pamir, highlights the existing and the new measurements on these glaciers, and presents an example for how the old and new data can be combined to establish multi-decadal mass balance time series. This is crucial for understanding the impact of climate change on glaciers in this region. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Catchments; Ecology; Food supply; Atmospheric warming; Ecological changes; Glacier mass balance; Glacier monitoring; Global climate observing systems; Monitoring strategy; Northern Hemispheres; Political instability; Climate change; calibration; catchment; climate change; glaciation; glacier mass balance; measurement method; model validation; monitoring system; Northern Hemisphere; runoff; time series analysis; warming; Kyrgyzstan; Pamirs; Tien Shan; USSR; USSR; Uzbekistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031329376

The primary root of heat islands in cities is in absorption of solar radiation by the mass of building structures, roads and other solid materials. The absorbed heat is subsequently re-radiated into the surroundings and increases ambient temperatures. The vegetation can stop and absorb most of incoming solar radiation mostly via the photosynthesis and evapotranspiration process. However, vegetation in mild climate of Europe manifests considerable annual seasonality which can also contribute to the seasonal change in the cooling effect of the vegetation on the urban climate. Modern methods of high-resolution mapping and new generations of sensors have brought opportunity to record the dynamics of urban greenery in a high resolution in spatial, spectral, and temporal domains. In this paper, we use the case study of the city of Košice in Eastern Slovakia to demonstrate the methodology of 3D mapping and modelling the urban greenery during one vegetation season in 2016. The purpose of this monitoring is to capture 3D effects of urban greenery on spatial distribution of solar radiation in urban environment. Terrestrial laser scanning was conducted on four selected sites within Košice in ultra-high spatial resolution. The entire study area, which included these four smaller sites, comprised 4 km2 of the central part of the city was flown within a single airborne lidar and photogrammetric mission to capture the upper parts of buildings and vegetation. The acquired airborne data were used to generate a 3D city model and the time series of terrestrial lidar data were integrated with the 3D city model. The results show that the terrestrial and airborne laser scanning techniques can be effectively used to monitor seasonal changes in foliage of trees in order to assess the transmissivity of the canopy for microclimate modelling. © 2017 Authors.","3D city model; LiDAR; Urban greenery; Urban microclimate","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Laser applications; Mapping; Optical radar; Photomapping; Radiation effects; Solar radiation; Surface analysis; Vegetation; 3D city modeling; Absorption of solar radiation; Airborne Laser scanning; High-resolution mapping; Terrestrial laser scanning; Terrestrial lidars; Urban greenery; Urban microclimate; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033446627

In this paper, we analyze the global abatement costs for achieving the substantial reductions in HFC consumption agreed in the Kigali Amendment (KA) of the Montreal Protocol from October 2016. We estimate that compliance with the KA is expected to remove 39 Pg CO2eq or 61% of global baseline HFC emissions over the entire period 2018–2050. The marginal cost of meeting the KA targets is expected to remain below 60 €/t CO2eq throughout the period in all world regions except for developed regions where legislation to control HFC emissions has already been in place since a few years. For the latter regions, the required HFC consumption reduction is expected to come at a marginal cost increasing steadily to between 90 and 118 €/t CO2eq in 2050. Depending on the expected rate of technological development and the extent to which envisaged electricity savings can be realized, compliance with KA is estimated attainable at a global cost ranging from a net cost-saving of 240 billion € to a net cost of 350 billion € over the entire period 2018 to 2050 and with future global electricity-savings estimated at between 0.2% and 0.7% of expected future electricity consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Abatement cost; Energy efficiency co-benefits; Greenhouse gases; Hydrofluorocarbons; Kigali amendment; Montreal protocol","fluorinated hydrocarbon; air conditioning; Article; cooling; cost control; electricity; greenhouse effect; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); refrigeration; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020393608

High demand for drinking water in dry summer periods and the accompanying reduction in water resources lead to insufficiency in the availability of a number of water supplies, therefore causing limitations in water access. In some other cases, as a result of excessive precipitation, floods and flash floods evolved over karstic areas, and several water supplies had to be excluded from operation in order to avoid the risk of infections. The expected increase in the number of extreme weather conditions and further possible changes in future climate necessitates the analysis of the vulnerability of drinking water resources to climate change. Since 95% of the total drinking water supply in Hungary originates from subsurface layers, significance of groundwater resources is outstanding. Our work was carried out in the frames of the NAGiS (National Adaptation Geo-information System) project with the aim to devise a methodology for the study and determination of the vulnerability of drinking water supplies to climate. Methods have been chosen according to the CIVAS (Climate Impact and Vulnerability Assessment Scheme) model that has been developed in the frame of the international climate research project CLAVIER (Climate Change and Variability: Impact on Central and Eastern Europe). The CIVAS model, being based on the combined evaluation of exposure, sensitivity, impact, adaptability, and vulnerability provides a unified methodical scheme to quantitative climatic impact assessment. The investigation involves the analyses of climatic parameters primarily influencing drinking water supplies and hydrogeological characteristics of the geological media that significantly determines vulnerability. Apart from the expected environmental changes, societal and economic processes have also been taken into account. Climate vulnerability has been determined on the basis of the distribution and categorization of the chosen indicators. Further effects, independent of climate change and caused by anthropogenic activity, result in similar phenomena. It is often difficult to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic effects that occur simultaneously; therefore, anthropogenic activity is necessary to be taken into account. In the analyses we used data of two different climate models covering two separate future time periods. Results on the basis of both climate model projections suggest that a considerable number of regions in the area under investigation appear to be vulnerable to climate change to a certain extent, and vulnerability intensifies to the end of the 21st century. © 2018, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

The various approaches to making such estimates may or may not be entirely comparable. Knowing how the estimates produced by some commonly used approaches vary across forest types and regions allows users of carbon stock estimates to make informed comparisons. Here, we focus on equivalence of alternate estimates of aboveground live tree carbon in eastern U.S. forests derived from the carbon reports output by the Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE) to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Three approaches to estimating individual-tree carbon are compared by FVS variant and forest type. There are two approaches available in the FVS Fire and Fuels Extension (labeled FFE and Jenkins) and a third based on the U.S. Forest Service's forest inventory (component ratio method, labeled CRM). We found that the two volume-based approaches, CRM and FFE, are most often identified as equivalent within forest type group or whole-variant relative to the other two pairs of approaches. Equivalence is common in the Northeast and Southern variants, but relatively infrequent in the Central States and Lake States variants. The underlying volume equations of the FFE and CRM approaches influence the carbon equivalence patterns as indicated by differences in volume estimates between FVS and the U.S. Forest Service's forest inventory. Aggregation, or expanding forest estimates to include increasingly larger areas, tends to reduce apparent differences between approaches – that is, they become more equivalent. This result is most evident with the CRM-FFE pair or in softwood forest type groups. © 2017","Allometry; Biomass equation; Biomass estimation; Equivalence; Forest carbon stocks","Biology; Allometry; Biomass equations; Biomass estimation; Equivalence; Forest carbons; Forestry; aboveground biomass; allometry; assessment method; carbon sequestration; estimation method; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; Biomass; Carbon; Equations; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020288055

It is now established that climate change has affected every continent, from the equator to the poles, from the mountains to the coasts. The many kinds of extremes that climate change has contributed so far are heat waves, heavy rain and untimely floods, wildfires, drought and melting ice and snow contributing to sea level rise. This volume is based on a conference held in Brisbane, Australia in November 2016-1 year on from COP21. The main objective of this conference was to identify the key issues that need to be addressed in order for nations to achieve their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) proposed at COP21. With this in mind, this volume has focused on how one can add further to the present debate on emission control globally involving both developed and developing nations of the Asia-Pacific. This introductory chapter gets the debate to a level where it will be clear to readers how the aims and objectives of the volume can be achieved. The focus of this volume, thus, is on identifying solutions to the challenges facing governments, businesses and civil society from countries in the Asia-Pacific region in meeting mitigation targets. In other words, the aims are to: offer critical perspectives on the COP21 agreement and the challenges of meeting the targets; offer solutions to challenges of achieving a sustainable economy using climate change mitigation as a driver for change; and provide cases in Australia and Asia that can exemplify how such challenges can be faced. The overall outcome of the volume suggests that there are considerable challenges for nations to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement in 2015. In this volume, the efforts of the contributors were to analyse how to bridge the gap between COP21 commitments and targets of emissions control while employing an interdisciplinary approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Asia-Pacific; Climate change; COP21; Net zero emissions future; Sustainable economy; UNESCO HQ; UNFCCC",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042397882

Herein, the Al-increased and Ni-,Co-decreased electrode surface is fabricated through tailoring element distribution in micrometer-sized spherical NCA secondary particles via coprecipitation and solid-state reactions, aimed at stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface during continuous cycles. As expected, it shows much extended cycle life, 93.6% capacity retention within 100 cycles, compared with that of 78.5% for the normal NCA. It also delivers large reversible capacity of about 140 mAh g-1 even at 20 C, corresponding to energy density of around 480 Wh kg-1, which is enhanced by 45% compared to that of the normal NCA (about 330 Wh kg-1). Besides, the delayed heat emission temperature and reduced heat generation mean remarkably improved thermal stability.

If the agricultural sector is to mitigate its contributions, farmers must actively adopt conservation practices. Recent studies have shown farmers’ beliefs about climate change to be influential in their support for adopting these practices. This study explores how social groups and their climate change messages interact with regional biophysical expressions of climate change to influence farmers’ climate change beliefs. We apply a recently revised realist framework to qualitative data from 104 interviews with corn farmers in Iowa and Indiana, United States (US). Our findings illustrate that many farmers are able to detect the biophysical expressions of climate change; however, their acknowledgement of the impacts of climate change in most cases does not translate into an acknowledgement of the anthropogenic nature of climate change. Conflicting social messages produce uncertainty about or disbelief in humans’ causal role. These results show that realist frameworks, like the one applied here, can serve as useful guides for analyses and intervention related to climate change mitigation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agriculture; beliefs; Climate change; climate change denial; realism; social–ecological systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050718898

The application of new GHG mitigation technologies are essential to promote a cleaner environment. This is critical since not all new technologies are environmentally friendly. To understand whether and to what extent such technologies mitigate GHG, this survey study was conducted to measure the amount of the dynamic energy consumption and productivity growth of pomegranate production during 2009–2015 in the Fars province, Southwest Iran. Dynamic DEA models were employed for the efficiency analyses. The data were gathered from pomegranate gardeners through questionnaires by face-to-face interviews. The validity and reliability of the questionnaires were tested and confirmed respectively through a pilot study and Cronbach's alpha. Using simple random sampling method, 55 pomegranate gardeners were chosen for the survey. The dynamic DEA revealed that our gardeners had the best performance in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The average energy consumption was 42,230 MJ/ha to produce 17,300 kg/ha pomegranate. The highest output-input energy ratio was also obtained in 2013, 2014 and 2015 of 1.013. The most efficient gardeners consumed more renewable energy especially in the form of farm yard manure. Accordingly, the gardeners with the least efficiency should enhance pomegranate yield and reduce the extra energy inputs of around 10,000 kg/ha (58% of average) and 25,000 MJ/ha (59% of the average), respectively. Malmquist index showed that the best efficient gardeners had annual positive technology change of 8.3%. Statistical analyses confirmed that each positive percentage of technology change reduces the energy input by 710 times and CO2 emission mitigation by 634 times meaning that the gardeners used some energy efficient technologies that lead to lower GHG emissions. The technology change can be predicted by some of the socio-demographic attributes of the gardeners such as farming experience, net income and participating in extensional classes. The study concludes that highly efficient pomegranate production besides new technology use policies would ultimately contribute to the robust climate change mitigation from this sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental risks; GHG mitigation; Productivity growth; Technology use efficiency","Climate change; Data envelopment analysis; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Productivity; Surveys; Climate change mitigation; Dynamic energy consumption; Energy efficient technology; Environmental risks; GHG mitigation; Output-input energy ratio; Productivity growth; Technology use; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024104247

Managing them well is vital to human well-being as well as the maintenance of marine biodiversity and ocean-dependent economies. Carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly recognized as a valuable service provided by coastal vegetation. Carbon sequestered and stored by mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows is known as ‘blue’ carbon. These habitats capture and store carbon within the plants themselves and in the sediment below them. When the habitats are destroyed, much of their carbon is released back to the atmosphere and ocean contributing to global climate change. Therefore, blue carbon ecosystem protection is becoming a greater priority in marine management and is an area of interest to scientists, policy makers, coastal communities, and the private sector including those that contribute to ecosystem degradation but also those that are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. A range of policy and management responses aim to reduce coastal ecosystem loss, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper explores how MPA design, location, and management could be used to protect and increase carbon sequestration and ensure integrity of carbon storage through conservation and restoration activities. While additional research is necessary to validate the proposed recommendations, this paper describes much needed first steps and highlights the potential for blue carbon finance mechanisms to provide sustainable funding for MPAs.

Current methods of analysis were not built to represent such a complex system and are insufficiently equipped to capture and understand positive and negative externalities generated by the interactions among different stakeholders involved in the energy-food-water nexus. Potential amplification effects, time delays and path dependency of climate policies are also inadequately represented. This paper seeks to explore how knowledge co-production can help identify opportunities for building more effective, sustainable, inclusive and legitimate decision making processes on climate change. This would enable more resilient responses to climate risks impacting the nexus while increasing transparency, communication and trust among key actors. We do so by proposing the operationalization of an interdisciplinary approach of analysis applying the novel methodology developed in Howarth and Monasterolo (2016). Through a bottom-up, participative approach, we present results of five themed workshops organized in the UK (focusing on: shocks and hazards, infrastructure, local economy, governance and governments, finance and insurance) featuring 78 stakeholders from academia, government and industry. We present participant's perceptions of opportunities that can emerge from climate and weather shocks across the energy-food-water nexus. We explore opportunities offered by the development and deployment of a transdisciplinary approach of analysis within the nexus boundaries and we analyse their implications.

The UK's 2050 climate targets provide indicatives frames through which emissions reductions could be translated to different contexts. The scenarios outlined in the UK's fifth carbon budget will require lifestyle changes which may need to counter low levels of acceptance of the need to change through technological, political and behavioural initiatives. This paper explores the role of narratives of the UK's fifth carbon budget in increasing engagement to climate change. Data are presented from thirty semi-structured interviews with UK academic, policy and practitioner communities. Six narratives are identified that could enable positive engagement with a low carbon future and better engagement on climate change: (i) showcasing investment opportunities; (ii) maintaining independence and freedom of choice; (iii) guiding audiences to visualise a low carbon future; (iv) demonstrating broader appeal, salience and impact of not doing anything; (v) supporting transitions and change; (vi) highlighting benefits to quality of life. Implications of these findings to public engagement on climate change and perceptions of how life may need to be reconfigured in a low carbon future are discussed. © 2017 The Author(s)","Climate change; Fifth carbon budget; Low-carbon future; Narratives",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020432795

This chapter triangulates a broad range of sources from the academic literature and synthesises them with the findings of previous research by the author. It is argued that governments can assist with the transition to a more sustainable low-carbon economy by using EM to design policies that promote technological innovation, engage with economic imperatives, implement institutional change, improve community engagement and change the public discourse to focus on practical ""win-win"" scenarios. The theoretical framework of EM was developed in Europe during the 1980s and will need to be adapted for countries like Australia that have a very different political context. Examples are given of how business models can be changed and how government policies can encourage the transition. The adoption of this proposal would increase community empowerment and improve democratic decision-making. This chapter undertakes an original synthesis of sustainable development, climate change mitigation and strong EM to create practical changes to business models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Climate change mitigation; Ecological modernisation; Energy; Sustainability; Sustainable development",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042425659

Estimated ΔMort values due to adult ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer are 0.30, 0.73, 0.14, and 0.13 million in 2013, respectively, leading to a total ΔMort of 1.3 million.

Tests have been conducted with a Nissan LEAF under a typical driving cycle on the Beijing road network in order to improve understanding of variations in energy efficiency among drivers under different urban traffic conditions. Energy consumption and operation parameters were recorded in both peak and off-peak hours for a total of 13 drivers.The analysis reported in this paper shows that there are clear patterns in energy consumption along a route that are in part related to differences in infrastructure design, traffic conditions, and personal driving styles.The proposedmethod for analyzing time series data about energy consumption along routes can be used for research with larger fleets of EVs in the future. © 2017 Kezhen Hu et al.",,"Automobile drivers; Behavioral research; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Highway traffic control; Motor transportation; Time series analysis; Driving behavior; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental benefits; Infrastructure design; Operation parameters; Temporal and spatial; Time-series data; Traffic conditions; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030713525

As one of the pilot cities, Beijing has been pursuing low-carbon development strategies under state intervention and market regulation. This paper chooses the carbon market, a medium through which Beijing manages emission reduction, as the object of study. Firstly, we compare the basic construction circumstances of Beijing with other pilot cities. Then we qualitatively analyze the development of Beijing's carbon market from the perspective of transaction status, execution of the contract, and improvement of the policies and regulations. Finally, we use the TOPSIS model to develop a comprehensive evaluation system of Beijing's carbon market. It is used to quantitatively evaluate the operational performance and maturity of the mechanism. The results show that: Beijing's carbon market has good comprehensive capabilities, ranking second place among seven pilot markets; but the maturity of Beijing's carbon market is relatively poor for insufficient market liquidity; its operations are well managed, but economic efficiency still need to be improved; the depth of transaction and the effect of reduction in emissions make it meaningful. Therefore, in order to improve the construction of Beijing's carbon market, measures should be taken as follows:(1) strengthening the quota management, and increasing carbon trading activity to avoid poor market liquidity; (2) accelerating emission reduction actions and encouraging technology innovation, such as: carrying out several policies and measures supporting new energy and energy saving & emission reduction, and increasing investment and subsidy in research and development for the technology innovation of firms etc.; (3) improving regulatory mechanism and enhancing the disclosure of carbon trading, such as: drawing lessons from the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) about measuring, reporting and verification system (MRV). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; ETS pilot; Maturity; Performance; TOPSIS model","Emission control; Energy conservation; Engineering research; Innovation; Research and development management; Beijing; ETS pilot; Maturity; Performance; TOPSIS models; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017392696

Over the years, sound tools have been developed to support the life-cycle assessment of building carbon emissions performance. However, most of these tools have been primarily focused on building-scale modelling and evaluation, leaving the emissions related to infrastructure and occupant activities as well as the carbon offsetting from implementing district-scale renewable energy systems, often neglected. The uptake of macro perspective carbon evaluations at the urban precinct level has been slow due to various barriers such as system boundary definition, quantification of complex inter-building effects, availability of comparable data, integrated modelling and uncertainties related to occupants’ life styles. This research developed an integrated life-cycle model to support the precinct-scale evaluation of carbon footprint for a comprehensive understanding of the emission profile. This is expected to further support low carbon planning and (re)development of urban precincts. The model structure is underpinned by four major components at the precinct level, i.e. embodied, operational and travelling associated carbon emissions, as well as the carbon offsetting from solar energy harvesting. The utility of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through preliminary case studies on representative suburban precincts in Adelaide, South Australia. Comparative studies and scenario analysis are also involved to identify the critical elements affecting the overall carbon performance of urban precincts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon offsetting; Integrated modelling; Inter-building effects; Life-cycle emissions; Precinct","Buildings; Carbon footprint; Energy harvesting; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Uncertainty analysis; Building effects; Comparative studies; Integrated modelling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle emissions; Low carbon planning; Precinct; Renewable energy systems; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029693615

However, considering only economical criterion with technological constraints is not enough in sustainable manufacturing practice; formerly, criteria about low carbon emission awareness have seldom been taken into account in process planning optimization. In this paper, a mathematical model that considers both machining costs reduction as well as carbon emission reduction is established for the process planning problem. However, due to various flexibilities together with complex precedence constraints between operations, the process planning problem is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard problem. Aiming at the distinctive feature of the multi-objectives process planning optimization, we then developed a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II to tackle this problem. A local search method that considers both the total cost criterion and the carbon emission criterion are introduced into the proposed algorithm to avoid being trapped into local optima. Moreover, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is also adopted to determine the best solution from the Pareto front. Experiments have been conducted using Kim's benchmark. Computational results show that process plan schemes with low carbon emission can be captured, and, more importantly, the proposed hybrid NSGA-II algorithm can obtain more promising optimal Pareto front than the plain NSGA-II algorithm. Meanwhile, according to the computational results of Kim's benchmark, we find that both of the total machining cost and carbon emission are roughly proportional to the number of operations, and a process plan with less operation may be more satisfactory. This study will draw references for the further research on green manufacturing in the process planning level. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Evolutionary algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-II algorithm; Process planning","benchmarking; carbon emission; cost analysis; experimental study; genetic algorithm; manufacturing; numerical model; optimization; planning process; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030450550

This review describes recent progress in dryland climate change research. Recent findings indicate that the long-term trend of the aridity index (AI) is mainly attributable to increased greenhouse gas emissions, while anthropogenic aerosols exert small effects but alter its attributions. Atmosphere-land interactions determine the intensity of regional response. The largest warming during the last 100 years was observed over drylands and accounted for more than half of the continental warming. The global pattern and interdecadal variability of aridity changes are modulated by oceanic oscillations. The different phases of those oceanic oscillations induce significant changes in land-sea and north-south thermal contrasts, which affect the intensity of the westerlies and planetary waves and the blocking frequency, thereby altering global changes in temperature and precipitation. During 1948–2008, the drylands in the Americas became wetter due to enhanced westerlies, whereas the drylands in the Eastern Hemisphere became drier because of the weakened East Asian summer monsoon. Drylands as defined by the AI have expanded over the last 60 years and are projected to expand in the 21st century. The largest expansion of drylands has occurred in semiarid regions since the early 1960s. Dryland expansion will lead to reduced carbon sequestration and enhanced regional warming. The increasing aridity, enhanced warming, and rapidly growing population will exacerbate the risk of land degradation and desertification in the near future in developing countries. ©2017.

Examining changes in species abundance structures at a continental scale enables robust evaluation of climate change influences, but few studies have conducted these evaluations due to limited data and methodological constraints. In this study, we estimate temporal changes in abundance from North American Breeding Bird Survey data at the scale of physiographic strata to examine the relative influence of different components of climatic factors and evaluate the hypothesis that shifting species distributions are multidirectional in resident bird species in North America. We quantify the direction and velocity of the abundance shifts of 57 permanent resident birds over 44 years using a centroid analysis. For species with significant abundance shifts in the centroid analysis, we conduct a more intensive correlative analysis to identify climate components most strongly associated with composite change of abundance within strata. Our analysis focus on two contrasts: the relative importance of climate extremes vs. averages, and of temperature vs. precipitation in strength of association with abundance change. Our study shows that 36 species had significant abundance shifts over the study period. The average velocity of the centroid is 5.89 km·yr−1. The shifted distance on average covers 259 km, 9% of range extent. Our results strongly suggest that the climate change fingerprint in studied avian distributions is multidirectional. Among 6 directions with significant abundance shifts, the northwestward shift was observed in the largest number of species (n = 13). The temperature/average climate model consistently has greater predictive ability than the precipitation/extreme climate model in explaining strata-level abundance change. Our study shows heterogeneous avian responses to recent environmental changes. It highlights needs for more species-specific approaches to examine contributing factors to recent distributional changes and for comprehensive conservation planning for climate change adaptation.

In this study, the effectiveness of sulfate-reducing mechanisms on toluene and copper contaminated groundwater cleanup was evaluated in microcosm experiments. Sulfate was supplied into microcosms containing toluene (17.5 mg/L) and copper (12 mg/L) contaminated groundwater to activate the sulfate reducing process. The inocula used in the microcosms contained petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated soils and sludge collected from an anaerobic basin of a wastewater treatment facility. Approximately 99% of toluene and copper could be removed during the 40-day operational period with the decay rates of 0.19 and 0.12 1/d, respectively. Under sulfate-reducing mechanisms, toluene could be biodegraded and a consumption of 0.105 g/L of sulfate was observed. Copper removal (dropped to below 0.1 mg/L) was due to the bioprecipitation mechanisms, which could be confirmed by the occurrence of sulfate reduction mechanisms (sulfide increased from 8.6 to 686 μg/L) and copper sulfide formation. Increased hydrogen sulfide concentrations also resulted in the inhibition of microbial growth. Dominant bacterial species and microbial communities were characterized by molecular biological technologies. A total of 12 dominant sulfate-reducing bacteria and petroleum-hydrocarbon degraders were detected. Results show that simultaneous toluene and copper removal could be achieved via the sulfate reduction and heavy metal bioprecipitation mechanisms. Sulfate reduction became the predominant biodegradation mechanism after sulfate supplement under anaerobic conditions. Results from this study can be applied to develop a cost-effective bioremedial system to cleanup heavy-metal and petroleum-hydrocarbon polluted groundwater. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioprecipitation; Bioremediation; Groundwater contamination; Heavy metal; Sulfate reduction; Toluene","Bacteria; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Contamination; Copper; Cost effectiveness; Decay (organic); Groundwater; Heavy metals; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum chemistry; Reduction; Remediation; Soil pollution; Sulfur compounds; Toluene; Wastewater treatment; Bio-precipitation; Contaminated groundwater; Groundwater contamination; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Sulfate reduction; Sulfide concentration; Wastewater treatment facilities; Groundwater pollution; bioavailability; bioremediation; cleanup; copper; groundwater pollution; heavy metal; inhibition; microcosm; pollutant removal; reduction; sulfate; toluene; wastewater treatment; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016793629

Twenty-six HICO images were used from four study sites representing different vegetation types: grasslands, shrubland, and forest. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) data from eddy covariance were matched with HICO-derived spectra. Multiple algorithms were successful relating spectral reflectance with GEP, including: spectral vegetation indices (SVI), SVI in a light-use efficiency model framework, spectral shape characteristics through spectral derivatives and absorption feature analysis, and statistical models leading to multiband hyperspectral indices from stepwise regressions and partial least squares regression. Successful algorithms were able to achieve r2 better than 0.7 for both GEP at the overpass time and daily GEP. These algorithms were successful using a diverse set of observations combining data from multiple years, multiple times during growing season, different times of day, with different view angles, and different vegetation types. The demonstrated robustness of the algorithms presented in this study over these conditions provides some confidence in mapping spatial patterns of GEP, describing variability within fields, as well as the regional patterns. The ISS orbit provides periods with multiple observations collected at different times of the day within a period of a few days. Diurnal GEP patterns were estimated comparing the half-hourly average GEP from the flux tower against HICO estimates of GEP (r2 = 0.87) if morning, midday, and afternoon observations were available. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Ecosystems; hyperspectral imaging; remote sensing","Carbon; Ecology; Hyperspectral imaging; Least squares approximations; Mapping; Orbits; Pigments; Remote sensing; Space optics; Space stations; Spectroscopy; Stresses; Vegetation; Ecosystem productivity; Gross ecosystem productions; International Space stations; Light-use-efficiency models; Optical remote sensing; Partial least squares regression; Spectral vegetation indices; Vegetation mapping; Ecosystems; algorithm; carbon flux; coastal zone; marine ecosystem; multispectral image; remote sensing; vegetation type",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030755196

Through incorporation of an oxygen carrier into a high pressure, pulverized fuel based oxy-fluidized bed combustor it should be possible to reduce or eliminate regions with insufficient oxygen present to complete combustion. In this paper we investigate the use of a Canadian ilmenite ore based oxygen carrier to enhance combustion performance and sulfur capture for atmospheric and pressurized oxy-FBC systems. The paper includes a description of potential pressurized system configurations with a discussion of related benefits and potential challenges. CanmetENERGY's 50 kWth pilot scale atmospheric pressure oxy-fluidized bed combustor (oxy-FBC) was used to demonstrate the concept of oxygen carrier assisted combustion using two Canadian coals with under bed fuel and sorbent injection. The CO emissions were significantly reduced by replacing the inert bed material with the oxygen carrier (ilmenite ore); with CO concentrations in the flue gas reduced up to 30 vol % and 13 vol % when burning Highvale coal and Poplar River coal, respectively. The improvement in combustion was even more pronounced in the bed region, in particular, under conditions of low excess oxygen and/or low bed temperature. Analysis of solid samples (XRD) and flue gas condensates (acidity) has provided further evidence of the oxygen carrier improving combustion performance and reducing the risk of bed agglomeration. © 2017, American Chemical Society.

For each province in South Africa, we used generalized linear mixed models to determine the combination of variables that explain spatial variation in sampling effort (number of visits per 5′ × 5′ grid cell, or “pentad”). The explanatory variables were distance to major road and exceptional birding locations or “sampling hubs,” percentage cover of protected, urban, and cultivated area, and the climate variables mean annual precipitation, winter temperatures, and summer temperatures. Further, we used the climate variables and plant biomes to define subsets of pentads representing environmental zones across South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland. For each environmental zone, we quantified sampling intensity, and we assessed sampling completeness with species accumulation curves fitted to the asymptotic Lomolino model. Sampling effort was highest close to sampling hubs, major roads, urban areas, and protected areas. Cultivated area and the climate variables were less important. Further, environmental zones were not evenly represented by current data and the zones varied in the amount of sampling required representing the species that are present. SABAP2 volunteers' preferences in birding locations cause spatial bias in the dataset that should be taken into account when analyzing these data. Large parts of South Africa remain underrepresented, which may restrict the kind of ecological questions that may be addressed. However, sampling bias may be improved by directing volunteers toward undersampled regions while taking into account volunteer preferences. © 2017 The Authors.

Here we determine that the protein YmfI catalyzes the reduction of EF-P-5 aminopentanone to EF-P-5 aminopentanol. In the absence of YmfI, accumulation of 5-aminopentanonated EF-P is inhibitory to swarming motility. Suppressor mutations that enhanced swarming in the absence of YmfI were found at two positions on EF-P, including one that changed the conserved modification site (Lys 32) and abolished post-translational modification. Thus, while modification of EF-P is thought to be essential for EF-P activity, here we show that in some cases it can be dispensable. YmfI is the first protein identified in the pathway leading to EF-P modification in B. subtilis, and B. subtilis encodes the first EF-P ortholog that retains function in the absence of modification. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"bacterial protein; carbonyl derivative; elongation factor; elongation factor P; lysine; unclassified drug; YmfI protein; alcohol dehydrogenase; aminopentol; carboxylic acid; elongation factor; factor EF-P; Article; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial mutation; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium swarming motility; bioaccumulation; carbonyl reduction; catalysis; cell motility; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein modification; protein processing; reduction (chemistry); Bacillus subtilis; cell motion; genetics; metabolism; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Bacillus subtilis; Carboxylic Acids; Cell Movement; Peptide Elongation Factors; Protein Processing, Post-Translational",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030628372

The work draws on the impact made by the national (UK) and regional (EU) low carbon policy instruments on the UK road sector. The results show that the transformation pathway, which is at the take-off phase on a large scale, is the only fully active pathway. The transformation is mainly characterized by the adoption of biofuel blends and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as niche technologies. For the emergence of an ideal low carbon road system in the UK, it is shown that the transformation pathway is insufficient and the likely pathway sequence to full decarbonization will be transformation-substitution-de-alignment/re-alignment.

In this study, we elucidate the role of remote substrate binding interactions contributing to the rate enhancement by 3α-HSD/CR through steady-state kinetic studies with the truncated substrate analogs. No enzyme activity was detected for methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol, which lack the steroid scaffold of androsterone, implying that the steroid scaffold plays an important role in enzyme catalytic specificity. As compared to cyclohexanol, the activity for 2-decalol, androstenol, and androsterone increases by 0.9-, 90-, and 200-fold in kcat, and 37-, 1.9 × 106-, and 1.8 × 106-fold in kcat/KB, respectively. The rate limiting step is hydride transfer for 3α-HSD/CR catalyzing the reaction of cyclohexanol with NAD+ based on the observed rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism and equal deuterium isotope effects of 3.9 on V and V/K for cyclohexanol. The kcat/KB value results in ΔG‡ of 14.7, 12.6, 6.2, and 6.2 kcal/mol for the 3α-HSD/CR catalyzed reaction of cyclohexanol, 2-decalol, androstenol, and androsterone, respectively. Thus, the uniform binding energy from the B-ring of steroids with the active site of 3α-HSD/CR equally contributes 2.1 kcal/mol to stabilize both the transition state and ground state of the ternary complex, leading to the similarity in kcat for 2-decalol and cyclohexanol. Differential binding interactions of the remote BCD-ring and CD-ring of androsterone with the active site of 3α-HSD/CR contribute 8.5 and 6.4 kcal/mol to the stabilization of the transition state, respectively. The removal of the carbonyl group at C17 of androsterone has small effects on catalysis. Both uniform and differential binding energies from the remote sites of androsterone compared to cyclohexanol contribute to the 3α-HSD/CR catalysis, resulting in the increases in kcat and kcat/KB. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase; Binding energy; Enzyme catalysis; Gibbs free energy; Kinetic isotope effect; Steady-state kinetics","2 decalol; 2 propanol; 3alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; alcohol; androstenol; androsterone; carbonyl reductase; compounds according to chemical structure; cyclohexanol; deuterium; molecular scaffold; steroid; unclassified drug; 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-carbonyl reductase; androsterone; bacterial protein; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Article; catalysis; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme mechanism; enzyme specificity; enzyme substrate complex; hormone structure; steady state; biocatalysis; chemistry; Comamonas testosteroni; enzymology; high performance liquid chromatography; kinetics; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; tandem mass spectrometry; thermodynamics; Androsterone; Bacterial Proteins; Biocatalysis; Catalytic Domain; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Comamonas testosteroni; Deuterium; Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Kinetics; NAD; Oxidation-Reduction; Substrate Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011286190

In order to mitigate negative effects of climate change in protected areas it is necessary to create and apply management programs, based on future ecosystems needs. The main aim of presented study was to evaluate sensitivity of rare and vulnerable species to climate change in order to suggest measures for better management of nature reserves in the future. According to scientific literature, 12 biological and ecological plant characteristics determining sensitivity of species (limiting factors) have been detected. 73 plant species that are protected in Lithuanian reserves were evaluated qualitatively according to limiting factors of climate change. As the result, it was offered to apply additional protection measures to 47 species in the light of climate change. Groups of plant species that should be affected highly negatively or highly positively were identified. 16% of plant species protected in nature reserves were evaluated as very sensitive to climate change and the condition of these plants may worsen. On the other hand, 14 plant species were given as least sensitive to negative effects and future climate is more favorable to species growth and spread than the existing. The highest danger is predicted for Silene chlorantha (Willd.) Ehrh., and the best condition is predicted for Mentha longifolia (L.) Huds. Dactylorhiza incarnata (L.) Soó. The study also gives recommendations for the protection of rare plants in the future. Different management measures are taken into account: Mitigation of the direct effect of climate change (I), improvement of an existing level of rareness (II), respecting the relation to physical and biological environment (III), consideration of spread and geographical limits (IV). Three management intensity levels were suggested according to species sensitivity. © 2017 Archives of Environmental Protection.","Biodiversity; factors important to species protection; protection intensity; species sensitivity to climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029586011

Graphitisation in the solid state in steels (and also, for useful comparison, in cast irons) has previously received little attention. However, FIB/FEGSEM has permitted specimen preparation of the relatively coarse microstructures, thus enabling high-resolution observation previously limited for graphite formation in cast irons and steels. The study has importance to the potential development of more economic and user-friendly machining steels, which would rely upon internal lubrication by graphite nodules within the microstructure.

Marconi, Napoli, 80125, Italy","The use of biofuels, especially in transportation and industrial processes, is seen as one of the most effective solutions to promote the reduction of greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions, as well as to lighten the dependence from petro-fuel producers. Biofuels are defined as a wide range of energy sources derived from biomass. In this category, alcohols produced through fermentation, such as ethanol and butanol, are considered some of the most suitable alternatives for transportation purposes. The benefits of bio-ethanol addition to gasoline have always been recognized for practical reasons. Apart from the variety of sources which it can be produced from, ethanol can raise the octane rating, given its improved anti-knock characteristics, allowing the use of higher compression ratios and higher thermal efficiency. However, ethanol's high latent heat of vaporization can cause problems during cold-start due to poor evaporation. On the other hand, in hot climates ethanol fuelling can result in adverse effects such as vapour lock. Butanol can be considered as an emergent alternative fuel. Normal butanol has several well-known advantages when compared to ethanol, including increased energy content, greater miscibility with transportation fuels, and lower propensity for water absorption. Despite of these pros, the costs of n-butanol production are higher due to lower yields compared to ethanol. Moreover, vaporization remains a critical aspect of this biofuel. Understanding the effect of biofuels on in-cylinder combustion processes is a key-point for the optimization of fuel flexibility and achieving lower CO2 emissions. To this aim, a combined thermodynamic and optical investigation was performed on a direct injection spark ignition engine fuelled with ethanol, butanol and gasoline. Fuels were compared by fixing the injection and spark ignition strategies. Thermodynamic measurements were coupled with optical investigations based on cycle resolved flame visualization. Optimized procedures of image processing were applied to follow the evolution of the flame front in terms of morphological parameters and to evaluate the local distribution of diffusive flames induced by oxidation of fuel deposits during late combustion. These data were correlated with exhaust gas measurements. The experiments confirmed that the chemical-physical specifications of the tested fuels strongly influenced the temporal and spatial evolution of the flame front.

The objective of this paper is to assess the sensitivity of precipitation regions to the temporal resolution (monthly, seasonal, annual and the annual maximum series) of the data. The presented method uses the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to partition climate sites into statistically homogeneous precipitation regions. The regions are validated using an approach based on L-moment statistics. The method is conducted in two climatically different study areas in western and eastern Canada. There does not appear to be a relationship between the spatial distributions of the regions formed using different temporal resolutions of the precipitation data. It is recommended to delineate precipitation regions that are specific to the task at hand, and to select a temporal resolution that is consistent with the final application of the regional precipitation dataset.

Keeping uniformity of air/fuel mixture and decreasing fuel adhesion on walls of cylinder and piston are effective in order to reduce the engine emissions. In order to achieve the target fuel-spray, fuel injectors for gasoline direct injection engines need to be designed to deal with multiple injections with high speed of opening and closing of valves. One of the difficulties in the multiple injections is to control fuel-spray behaviors during opening and closing of valve; flow rate and spray penetration which are changed due to slow velocity of fluid during opening and closing of valve cause nonuniformity of air/fuel mixture that results in the increase of PM. Fuel-spray behaviors are controlled by the valve-lifts of fuel injectors; therefore, air/fuel mixture simulations that integrate with inner flow simulations in fuel injectors during the opening and closing of valves are essential for studying the effects of valve motions on air/fuel mixtures. In this study, we developed an air/fuel mixture simulation that is connected with an inner-flow simulation with a valve opening and closing function. The simulation results were validated by comparing the simulated fuel breakup near the nozzle outlets and the air/fuel mixtures in the air region with the measured ones, revealing good agreement between them. The effects of opening and closing the valve on the air/fuel mixtures were also studied; the opening and closing of the valve affected the front and rear behaviors of the air/fuel mixture and also affected spray penetrations. The developed simulation was found to be an effective tool for studying the effects of valve motions on the air/fuel mixtures. It was also found that the magnetic circuit with the solenoid needs to be designed to achieve high-speed valve motion and also keeps same valve motion in each injection, especially during opening and closing of valve.

We draw on analysis of policy documents and interviews with stakeholders in both countries. Our results show that commitment to the pursuit of justice in both cases is limited when examined through the elements of TEL. Efforts to recognize the tenure rights of indigenous peoples, effective representation in decision making and transparent disclosure of information to all stakeholders were limited in Ghana by the tacit evasion of tenure ambiguities, especially in the migrant-dominated REDD+ pilot areas. In Nigeria, such limits were shown in a similar evasion and in the strategic orchestration of tenure complexities evident in the changing local forest access under a protectionist regime. We argue that explicit attention to TEL as mediating dimensions of the normative elements of justice provides important insights into how environmental policy instruments such as REDD+ might both enable and disable justice for local people living around project sites. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2017.","Environmental governance; Ghana; Justice; Nigeria; REDD+; West Africa","Behavioral research; Carbon; Decision making; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Transparency; Environmental governances; Ghana; justice; Nigeria; REDD; West Africa; Forestry; decision making; environmental justice; environmental planning; environmental policy; equity; governance approach; policy implementation; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; Ghana; Nigeria; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010867770

We used a dataset of 93 forage production collected from 16 rangeland sites during 8 years in Isfahan province. Climatic and topographic variables were obtained using a digital elevation model and geographical information system. SMI is derived using a triangle space concept between the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index from MODIS satellite data over Isfahan province. Using Nonparametric Multiplicative Regression model, we produced two distinct models to predict forage production, the first model with climatic and topographic variables (reduced model) and the second model with climatic, topographic and SMI variables (complete model). The inclusion of SMI significantly improved the quality of forage production predictions within the study area. The forage production is predicted to vary from 41.4 to 474 kg ha−1 in first model and 20.5 to 485 kg ha−1 in second model.

Goodwin Ave., Urbana, IL  61801, United States","Countries are grappling with how to monitor and evaluate the social impacts of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) at national and sub-national scales as they develop REDD+ safeguard information systems (SIS). Given limited resources for social safeguard measuring, reporting and verification (MRV), and the fact that REDD+ is a performance based mechanism requiring monitoring over the medium to long-run, there is a need to develop SIS that are low cost, rigorous, and sustainable over time. Of critical importance are approaches that adequately operationalize social safeguards, provide opportunities for ongoing MRV, and are feasible in terms of within country human and financial capital. In this paper we provide an illustration of how publicly available social and spatial data can be used for the quantitative evaluation of the social impacts of early REDD+ activities using the example of Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our analysis suggests that in the very early stages REDD+ projects are doing a reasonably good job of protecting rights (Safeguard #3), and are having a negative impact on human welfare (Safeguard #5). Other social safeguards could not be effectively evaluated due to lack of appropriate indicators in publicly available population representative datasets. Our experience suggests that there are several opportunities and challenges for countries as they move forward with REDD+ SIS. We find that for Indonesia there is sufficient data to estimate impacts for some, but not all, aspects of REDD+ social safeguards. More recently collected data have greater potential for the linking of social and spatial datasets, and fairly straight forward matching methods can be applied to construct appropriate treatment and comparison groups. Challenges include limited ability to operationalize some safeguards using existing data sources, lack of geo-referencing in several publicly available datasets, incompatibility of data layers in terms of their spatial and temporal resolution and frequency, and the complexity of generating appropriate counterfactual scenarios. Despite the limitations of existing data sources, we recommend against designing entirely new systems for REDD+ SIS. Strengthening ongoing national and sub-national data collection efforts to include appropriate geo-referenced indicators for the full range of REDD+ social safeguard indicators, and integration of carbon and social MRV systems are important avenues to explore. © 2017 The Authors","Climate change; Forests; Impact evaluation; Kalimantan; Monitoring and evaluation; Rights","carbon; Article; deforestation; environmental protection; human; Indonesia; information processing; information system; priority journal; reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; social welfare; software; welfare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021295483

This study evaluated two stove intervention programs and compared them for health effects (respiratory and eye symptoms, lung function, blood pressure and burns) among women who were the main cook of the household. A total of 83 and 134 improved and 209 and 179 traditional stoves in Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan, respectively, were evaluated after 3 months of installation, during June to September, 2014. Twenty-four-hour particulate matter (&lt;2.5 μm) (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) levels were measured in the kitchens in a subsample (n = 40). Multivariate logistic regression and general linear model were used to determine the health impact of improved stoves among women.

Against the background of restrictions on landfill disposal, the increased use of alternative materials such as industrial byproducts in pavement construction has gained great attention from academic and industrial sectors. However, comprehensive research covering various aspects of pavements incorporating different byproducts is lacking. The main purpose of this state-of-the-art study is to bridge this gap via the analysis of the performance of pavements incorporating two types of byproducts, blast furnace slag, and fly ash, from the perspectives of structural performance, energy saving potential, and greenhouse gas emission reduction at various phases of pavement life. Therefore, the contents of 150 published documents, including research papers, theses, and academic and industrial reports published over a span of 49 years (1968–2017) were analyzed. The major findings indicated that incorporation of the byproducts may have positive or negative consequences in various phases of pavement life. However, the new pavements are advantageous from the viewpoint of raw material processing because of low consumption of raw materials and pertinent environmental footprints. In addition, several scenarios are proposed for ranking the alternative materials on the basis of the technical and environmental requirements for a paving project; these scenarios can be useful for the preliminary selection of alternative materials. Finally, some gaps are highlighted for future research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Low energy pavement; Sustainable pavement; Sustainable policy; Sustainable production; Waste management","Blast furnaces; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial research; Natural resources; Pavements; Pollution control; Slags; Structural analysis; Sustainable development; Waste management; Cleaner production; Environmental footprints; Environmental requirement; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Non-renewable natural resources; Sustainable pavements; Sustainable policies; Sustainable production; Byproducts",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027522584

While quantifying anthropogenic methane emissions is important for evaluation measures applied for climate change mitigation, large emission uncertainties still exist for many source categories. To evaluate anthropogenic methane emission inventory in various regions over the globe, we extract emission signatures from column-average methane observations (XCH4) by GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) satellite using high-resolution atmospheric transport model simulations. XCH4 abundance due to anthropogenic emissions is estimated as the difference between polluted observations from surrounding cleaner observations. Here, reduction of observation error, which is large compared to local abundance, is achieved by binning the observations over large region according to model-simulated enhancements. We found that the local enhancements observed by GOSAT scale linearly with inventory based simulations of XCH4 for the globe, East Asia and North America. Weighted linear regression of observation derived and inventory-based XCH4 anomalies was carried out to find a scale factor by which the inventory agrees with the observations. Over East Asia, the observed enhancements are 30% lower than suggested by emission inventory, implying a potential overestimation in the inventory. On the contrary, in North America, the observations are approximately 28% higher than model predictions, indicating an underestimation in emission inventory. Our results concur with several recent studies using other analysis methodologies, and thus confirm that satellite observations provide an additional tool for bottom-up emission inventory verification. © 2017 by the authors.","Anthropogenic emission; GOSAT XCH4; Greenhouse gases; Lagrangian model; Methane emission inventory","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Lagrange multipliers; Satellites; Scales (weighing instruments); Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric transport model; Climate change mitigation; Emission uncertainties; GOSAT XCH4; Greenhouse gases observing satellites; Lagrangian models; Methane emissions; Methane",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029362290

The conformation of the 1-(diaminomethylene)thiouron-1-ium cation is not strictly planar, but slightly twisted. Both planar arms of the cation are oppositely rotated by 2.1(1)° around the C[sbnd]N bonds involving the central N atom. The propionate(−) anion is also non-planar, the carboxylate group is turned by 4.3(1)° in relation to the planar carbon chain. The arrangement of oppositely charged components, i.e. 1-(diaminomethylene)thiouron-1-ium cations and propionate(−) anions in the crystal is mainly determined by ionic and N[sbnd]H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions forming two-dimensional network aligned to (100) plane. The neighbouring 2D layers interact via much weaker N[sbnd]H⋯S hydrogen bonds forming three-dimensional hydrogen bonded network. Hirshfeld surface and the analysis of 2D fingerprint plots are illustrating both quantitatively and qualitatively interactions governing the supramolecular assemblies. The compound was also characterised by the FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. The vibrational assignments have been supported by the isotopic frequency shift. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","1-(diaminomethylene)thiouron-1-ium propionate; Crystal structure; Hirshfeld surface; Hydrogen bonds; Vibrational spectroscopy","Carbon; Carboxylation; Complexation; Crystal structure; D region; Negative ions; Positive ions; Single crystals; Vibrational spectroscopy; X ray analysis; 1-(diaminomethylene)thiouron-1-ium propionate; Hirshfeld surfaces; Hydrogen bonded network; Hydrogen bonding interactions; Solid-state structures; Solution growth technique; Supramolecular assemblies; Two-dimensional networks; Hydrogen bonds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019966811

Nevertheless, little effort has been made to address the palaeoenvironmental characteristics of the Tertiary carbonates in the key sector of Central Luconia. We study the sedimentology and petrography of core samples from a well in Central Luconia, for which thirteen microfacies have been identified reflecting different depositional settings. This is the first microfacies scheme elaborated for Luconian carbonates. Lithofacies and microfacies distribution are compatible with deposition in a reef complex, originating around a framework reef, within the euphotic zone. Sediments were deposited in environments of backreef, reef crest, and forereef. The fair weather wave base is marked by the presence of coralline red algae, foraminifera, decreasing degree of bioclast fragmentation and other microfacies features. As a result, a depositional-environmental model is constructed, depicting a reef complex built around a framework reef developed on the margin of an isolated platform. In addition, an innovative, preliminary time series analysis of facies, microfacies and depositional environment data reveal the existence of seasonal cycles in the stacking patterns of facies and microfacies. © 2017 Geological Society of China","central Luconia; depositional environments; microfacies; reef complex; sedimentology; time series","carbonate platform; complexity; depositional environment; depositional sequence; euphotic zone; facies; microfacies; Miocene; paleoenvironment; petrology; reef; sedimentology; time series analysis; Central Luconia; East Malaysia; Malaysia; Pacific Ocean; Sarawak; South China Sea; Foraminifera; Rhodophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050578772

To answer these questions, we develop a multiple regression model relating HOV lanes and other socioeconomic factors to carpooling propensity in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, then calculate the extent to which increasing HOV lane-kilometers would lead to reductions in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and major air pollutants across the U.S., by state. Increasing HOV lane extent has the greatest potential to reduce annual CO2e in the District of Columbia, followed by Hawaii and New York. The smallest potential is found in states with the lowest population density, led by North Dakota. We then explore the extent to which recommendations made at one level of data aggregation (that of individual states) may be valid for another level, such as individual counties. The only state with sufficient data available to disaggregate the model to the county level is California, where we found a lower potential for state-wide CO2e emission reductions under the county-level model as compared to the state-level model (0.69% as compared to 1.08%, under the same hypothetical scenario), albeit with significant differences in emission reduction potential between counties with higher vs. lower population densities. This analysis demonstrates the potential to generate generalizable insight into the magnitude of vehicle emission reductions that might be achieved through expanding HOV lanes, and highlights the importance of data disaggregation in identifying the optimal locations for potential reductions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Carbon emission reductions; Carpooling; CO2e; HOV lanes; Transportation Infrastructure","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Vehicles; Air pollutants; Carbon emission reductions; Carpooling; CO2e; HOV lanes; Transportation infrastructures; High occupancy vehicle lanes; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; quantitative analysis; road; transportation infrastructure; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027233929

In this paper, we present insights from a novel Agent Based Model (ABM), applied to a London case study of surface water flood risk, designed to assess the interplay between different adaptation options; how risk reduction could be achieved by homeowners and government; and the role of flood insurance and the new flood insurance pool, Flood Re, in the context of climate change. The analysis highlights that while combined investment in property-level flood protection and sustainable urban drainage systems reduce surface water flood risk, the benefits can be outweighed by continued development in high risk areas and the effects of climate change. In our simulations, Flood Re is beneficial in its function to provide affordable insurance, even under climate change. However, the scheme does face increasing financial pressure due to rising surface water flood damages. If the intended transition to risk-based pricing is to take place then a determined and coordinated strategy will be needed to manage flood risk, which utilises insurance incentives, limits new development, and supports resilience measures. Our modelling approach and findings are highly relevant for the ongoing regulatory and political approval process for Flood Re as well as for wider discussions on the potential of insurance schemes to incentivise flood risk management and climate adaptation in the UK and internationally. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Insurance; Risk; Surface water flooding","Autonomous agents; Climate models; Computational methods; Economics; Flood control; Flood insurance; Floods; Insurance; Oil well flooding; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Surface waters; Adaptation; Agent-based model; Coordinated strategies; Financial pressure; Flood protection; Flood risk management; Management strategies; Sustainable urban drainage systems; Climate change; surface water; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; flood forecasting; flooding; future prospect; hydrological response; insurance system; risk assessment; surface water; Article; climate change; flooding; government; human; insurance; population growth; risk assessment; risk management; risk reduction; simulation; surface water flooding; United Kingdom; urbanization; winter; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016725720

Our objective was to gain insight into the relationships between denitrifier community size, structure, and activity for a range of pasture soils. We collected 10 dairy pasture soils with contrasting soil textures, drainage classes, management strategies (effluent irrigation or non-irrigation), and geographic locations in New Zealand, and measured their physicochemical characteristics. We measured denitrifier abundance by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and assessed denitrifier diversity and community structure by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the nitrite reductase (nirS, nirK) and N2O reductase (nosZ) genes. We quantified denitrifier enzyme activity (DEA) using an acetylene inhibition technique. We investigated whether varied soil conditions lead to different denitrifier communities in soils, and if so, whether they are associated with different denitrification activities and are likely to generate different N2O emissions. Differences in the physicochemical characteristics of the soils were driven mainly by soil mineralogy and the management practices of the farms. We found that nirS and nirK communities were strongly structured along gradients of soil water and phosphorus (P) contents. By contrast, the size and structure of the nosZ community was unrelated to any of the measured soil characteristics. In soils with high water content, the richnesses and abundances of nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes were all significantly positively correlated with DEA. Our data suggest that management strategies to limit N2O emissions through denitrification are likely to be most important for dairy farms on fertile or allophanic soils during wetter periods. Finally, our data suggest that new techniques that would selectively target nirS denitrifiers may be the most effective for limiting N2O emissions through denitrification across a wide range of soil types. © Author(s) 2017.",,"abundance; anoxic conditions; community structure; denitrification; enzyme; enzyme activity; grassland soil; nitrous oxide; pasture; physicochemical property; polymerase chain reaction; soil property; soil water; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029928771

These global-scale processes involve links between oceanic conditions in one locale and weather in another, often distant, locale. An example is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which can affect rainfall and then the properties of lakes in Europe, Africa, North and South America. It affects rainfall, droughts and the depth of lakes in Florida, USA. It is predicted that the amplitude of variation in the ENSO will increase with global warming and, therefore, droughts will become more severe and periods of rain more intense. We investigated possible effects of climate on the zooplankton in shallow subtropical lakes by studying 16 years of monthly data from six shallow eutrophic lakes located north of Orlando, Florida. Results indicate that water depth and lake volume are tightly coupled with rainfall, as expected. During droughts, when lake depth and volume were greatly reduced, there were intensified cyanobacterial blooms, and the zooplankton shifted towards greater relative biomass of copepods compared to cladocerans. The change of zooplankton was likely due to the intensified selective fish predation in the reduced water volume, and/or selective adverse effects of cyanobacteria on cladocerans. The greatly reduced volume might lead to a 'perfect storm' of top-down and bottom-up factors that favor copepods over cladocerans. The mechanism needs further study. Regardless, this study documents a direct link between climate variability and zooplankton composition, and suggests how future changes in climate might affect plankton communities. © 2017 by the authors.

Beijing municipal government therefore issued 2 red alerts on December 7 and 19, respectively, and also implemented emergency control measures to alleviate the negative effects of pollution. It is estimated that the heavy pollutions in 2 red alert periods in Beijing were due mainly to the accumulation of air pollutants from local emission sources and the transboundary transport of pollutants from surrounding areas. The collected meteorological and PM2.5 data indicate that the severity of air pollutions were enlarged by the poor meteorological conditions along with lower mixing layer height. In this study, the WRF-CAMx modeling system was utilized not only for analyzing the contributions of PM2.5 from different sources, but also for quantitatively assessing the effects of implementing various emergency control measures on PM2.5 pollution control during the red alert periods. The modeling results show that local emissions were the most dominant contributors (64.8%–83.5%) among all emission sources, while the main external contributions came from the city of Baoding (3.4%– 9.3%). In addition, among 5 different emission source categories, coal and traffic were the two dominant contributors to PM2.5 concentration in urban area of Beijing. Then four pollution control scenarios were designed particularly to investigate the effectiveness of the emergency control measures, and the results show that, generally these emergency control measures have positive effects on air pollution reduction.

Surface oxides can play a critical role in tuning the surface oxidation state of metal catalysts for a proper binding with CO2RR reaction intermediates, which may significantly improve the catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate the importance of surface-bonded oxygen on silver nanoparticles in altering the reaction pathways and improving the CO2RR performances. A comparative investigation on air-annealed Ag (Air-Ag) catalyst with or without the post-treatment of H2 thermal annealing (H2-Ag) was performed. In Air-Ag, the subsurface chemically bonded O species (O-Agδ+) was identified by angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques, and contributed to the improved CO selectivity rather than H2 in CO2RR electrolysis. As a result, though the maximal CO Faradaic efficiency of H2-Ag is at ∼30%, the Air-Ag catalyst presented a high CO selectivity of more than 90% under a current density of ∼21 mA/cm2. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide reduction; Reaction selectivity; Silver catalyst; Surface bonded oxygen; X-ray absorption spectroscopy","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Electronic structure; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Oxygen; Photoelectrons; Photons; Pollution control; Reaction intermediates; Reduction; Silver; Surface reactions; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Angle resolved x ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide reduction; Faradaic efficiencies; Reaction selectivity; Silver catalyst; Silver nanoparticles; Surface electronic structures; Surface oxidations; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030480642

The first leading mode accounts for 29% of the total interannual variance, corresponding to the evolution of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from its developing to decaying phases. During the ENSO developing phase in the summer and fall, the contribution of surface seawater CO2 partial pressure anomalies is greater than that of gas transfer/solubility anomalies, which contribute to increasing oceanic CO2 uptake over the WNP. During the ENSO mature phase in the winter, the anomalous southwesterly northwest of the western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) reduces the surface wind speed in the China marginal sea and thus decreases oceanic CO2 uptake by reducing the gas transfer coefficient. In the subsequent spring, the WNPAC maintains with an eastward shift in position. The anomalous southwesterly warms sea surface temperatures in the China marginal sea by reducing evaporation and thus decreases oceanic CO2 uptake by enhancing surface seawater CO2 partial pressure. This process, rather than the effect of decreasing gas transfer coefficient, dominates CO2 flux anomalies in the spring. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Air-sea CO2 flux; ENSO; Interannual variability; Western North Pacific","Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Oceanography; Orthogonal functions; Seawater; Surface waters; Wind; CO2 fluxes; ENSO; Gas transfer coefficients; Interannual variability; Sea surface temperature (SST); Season-reliant empirical orthogonal functions; Southern oscillation; Western North Pacific; Carbon dioxide; air-sea interaction; annual variation; anticyclone; carbon flux; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; sea surface temperature; seasonality; seawater; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028305563

The magnitude of generation from a solar power project is influenced by the solar resource quality, but locations with high insolation do not necessarily yield the greatest emission reduction benefits. This study simulates the power system response to 10 identical solar projects in different regions across the United States, selected to represent a wide range of solar resource quality and power grid configurations. The power grid mix is often a key determinant in offsetting CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions, illustrating how lower-quality solar resources can be more effective than sunnier sites at emissions mitigation when one considers characteristics of the power grid. The analysis shows a strong relationship between emissions mitigation and the share of offset generation that is coal-fired. The strongest correlation is shown for CO2; the presence or absence of emissions control equipment and the sulfur content of the coal complicates the relationship of SO2 and NOx. The emissions intensity of offset generation is insensitive to whether the solar project is fixed tilt or single-axis tracking. When seeking to mitigate power sector emissions, the impacts of solar design considerations on the temporal profile of generation are less important than the overall amount of generation and the location of interconnection. Public policies that target only the magnitude of generation from renewables (e.g., many Renewable Portfolio Standards) or the installed cost (e.g., the Investment Tax Credit) will likely lead to suboptimal emissions mitigation.

While the US Midwest has been recognized as key to providing maize stover for meeting near-term cellulosic biofuel production goals, there is uncertainty that such feedstocks can produce biofuels that meet federal cellulosic standards. Here, we conducted extensive site-level calibration of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) terrestrial ecosystems model and applied the model at high spatial resolution across the US Midwest to improve estimates of the maximum production potential and greenhouse gas emissions expected from continuous maize residue-derived biofuels. A comparison of methodologies for calculating the soil carbon impacts of residue harvesting demonstrates the large impact of study duration, depth of soil considered, and inclusion of litter carbon in soil carbon change calculations on the estimated greenhouse gas intensity of maize stover-derived biofuels. Using the most representative methodology for assessing long-term residue harvesting impacts, we estimate that only 5.3 billion liters per year (bly) of ethanol, or 8.7% of the near-term US cellulosic biofuel demand, could be met under common no-till farming practices. However, appreciably more feedstock becomes available at modestly higher emissions levels, with potential for 89.0 bly of ethanol production meeting US advanced biofuel standards. Adjustments to management practices, such as adding cover crops to no-till management, will be required to produce sufficient quantities of residue meeting the greenhouse gas emission reduction standard for cellulosic biofuels. Considering the rapid increase in residue availability with modest relaxations in GHG reduction level, it is expected that management practices with modest benefits to soil carbon would allow considerable expansion of potential cellulosic biofuel production. © 2017 The Authors.

In this study, a spatially explicit statistical model framework was integrated with empirical stream temperature data (approximately four million bi-hourly recordings) and high-resolution climate and land surface data to estimate monthly stream temperatures and potential change under future climate scenarios in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, USA and Canada (72,000 km2). Moderate and extreme warming scenarios forecast increasing stream temperatures during spring, summer, and fall, with the largest increases predicted during summer (July, August, and September). Additionally, thermal regimes characteristic of current August temperatures, the warmest month of the year, may be exceeded during July and September, suggesting an earlier onset and extended duration of warm summer stream temperatures. Models estimate that the largest magnitude of temperature warming relative to current conditions may be observed during the shoulder months of winter (April and November). Summer stream temperature warming is likely to be most pronounced in glacial-fed streams where models predict the largest magnitude (&gt; 50%) of change due to the loss of alpine glaciers.

This paper explores constraints to the implementation of building codes in the context of changing roles and responsibilities of local authorities in Bihar in India. In-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders across major urban centres in north Bihar. Some factors, such as: code complexity; competition between the public and private sectors for qualified personnel; and low public risk perception were found to be less significant in Bihar than has been noted elsewhere, while other factors such as: the cost of earthquake-resistant measures; political interests; corrupt practices; and lack of government capacity were important. Additional factors were also revealed by the research, some of which are exacerbated by the neoliberal climate of urban governance. While the recent 2014 byelaws represent an improvement in the system and a degree of re-regulation, ambiguities create opportunities for failures arising from ‘normalised irresponsibility’. © 2017 The Author(s).

Hence, it is prone for EMI related problems as encountered by any other electronic equipment. As large number of urban population uses these transport services, they need to be operated taking into consideration all safety precautions inclusive of EMI compliance. The EMI related incidence could create a situation wherein lot of people gets stranded or in worst case scenario put lot of lives in danger. In addition to the routine measurements, the measurements relevant to human physiology (passenger wearing a pacemaker in the heart) also needs to be considered. Many EMI incidences have been reported elsewhere in the world. The product specific standard EN 50121-X series is available for which not only the rolling stock needs to be complied for EMI norms but the whole railway system encompassing Traction Sub Stations (TSS), Auxiliary Sub Stations, Beam switch etc. needs to be considered for measurements. Considering the terrain, other noise sources present around and the nature of EUT (always moving), the radiated emission measurement to be conducted for rolling stock is challenging preposition. Due to a very short time of the rolling stock available in front of the receiving antenna for executing a scan for the entire frequency range, various methodology have to be adopted which includes breaking up the band, taking multiple runs, changing the resolution bandwidth or reducing the scan time. In this paper, we are presenting the methodology and results of the radiation emission measurements conducted for Mumbai Monorail, Phase - I project encompassing rolling stock, Traction Sub Station (TSS), Auxiliary Sub Station (ASS) and Beam Switch Assembly.

Aim: A cross sectional study was conducted to assess the awareness and practices regarding factors of Climate Change among the urban residents of Pune city. Materials and Methods: Urban area of Pune city was selected for study. The sample size was 116 selected by simple random methods from two different urban settings. Structured questionnaire was prepared and data was collected. Results: The sample consists of 92 (79.3%) female and 24 (20.7%) male. 58% respondents were aware about climate change with mean 17.38 and mean adaptive practice score was 8.6 (53.89%). About 93(80%) respondents responded that climate is changing. Out of 116, 64(74%) respondents still using bio-mass as fuel. Only 60 (69%) respondents were aware of nonpolluting CNG vehicles. There is positive correlation between awareness level and adaptive practices (r= 0.678). Research implications: It revealed that awareness level is average but adaptive practices among urban population are poor which is far below expected level. There is a need to spread mass awareness among population to reduce the impact of Climate Change. Novelty/Originality: Paper is significant to the health educators, social activists and mass media personnel to organize mass campaign regarding global warming and climate change. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The Peng-Robinson equation of state combined with the Krichevsky-Ilinskaya equation were used to obtain Henry's law constants, partial molar volumes at infinite dilution, and Margules parameters for these systems. The new Henry's law constants were correlated with the Li-Mather model. The new binary (N2O + MDEA) interaction energy parameters correlated the Henry's law constants of N2O in both of the aqueous MDEA solutions to within 1.2%. As part of the solubility and Henry's law constant model development, new models for the density of pure MDEA and (MDEA + H2O) solutions were developed.

While this approach is applicable in many cases, it faces limitations when emitters are situated very close to material boundaries and nonlocal quantum wave functions become comparable in size with distances to boundaries and materials' lattice constants. Here a semiclassical model taking into account a material's granularity is developed, and spontaneous emission processes next to flat boundaries are analyzed. The material is divided into a pair of areas: the far zone is modeled as a continuous phase, while the near zone next to a nonlocal emitter is represented with a discrete array of polarizable particles. Local field effects were shown to provide orders of magnitude corrections to spontaneous emission rates in the case of sub-nanometer emitter-surface distances. The developed mesoscopic model addresses aspects of local field corrections in scenarios where quantum ab initio techniques face challenges. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","local field correction; mesoscopic models; Purcell effect; spatial dispersion; spontaneous emission; surfaces","Lattice constants; Spontaneous emission; Superconducting materials; Surfaces; Wave functions; Electromagnetic materials; Light-matter interactions; Local field corrections; Mesoscopic models; Purcell effect; Quantum wave functions; Spatial dispersion; Spontaneous emission rates; Dispersions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029721308

Projections foreseeing growing solar panel deployment rates show that photovoltaic installations will be an important asset in developing a more sustainable world economy. Yet, increasing deployment rates will lead to large volumes of waste photovoltaic modules in the future and large volumes of decommissioned panels can be expected by the middle of this century. Efficient end-of-life treatments will be needed to recover valuable components. Perovskite solar cells were first reported half a decade ago and improvements in efficiency of laboratory scale devices have been achieved at an unprecedented pace. This Perspective discusses some important environmental, regulatory, and practical aspects potentially arising at the end of life of decommissioned perovskite solar cells. With increasing PV deployment rates, resulting waste volumes can be foreseen with a 20- to 30-year lag. Photovoltaic installations have become a key technology in many countries’ attempts to decrease the use of finite fossil fuels, decrease dependence on imports, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change. While PV installations do not emit waste products during operation, growing installed capacity will mean growing PV waste streams in future decades. To date, there is no universally employed recycling process for waste PV installations. Perovskite solar cells are an emerging technology that has attracted widespread attention from the scientific community as well as the industry. Their active material is based on a soluble lead compound, which is of concern from both regulatory and environmental health perspectives and may represent challenges at the end of life as well. Furthermore, all photovoltaic technologies contain valuable materials whose recovery may become important to sustainable production of new panels in the future. Perovskite solar cells are a novel PV technology. Although confined to the lab and small pilot projects to date, the emergence of this new class of solar cells has received widespread attention. While their lead-based active material may call for special precautions, other valuable components of perovskite modules may warrant recovery for re-use in specialized end of life treatment processes. © 2017","environmental impact; life cycle assessment; perovskite lead toxicity; perovskite PV; recycling PV; solar cells","Climate change; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; Photovoltaic cells; Recovery; Recycling; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Emerging technologies; End of life treatments; Laboratory-scale devices; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Photovoltaic installation; Photovoltaic modules; Photovoltaic technology; Sustainable production; Solar cells; environmental impact; lead; life cycle analysis; perovskite; photovoltaic system; recycling; solar power; toxicity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032970831

Due to the different vulnerability and adaptive capacity of various regions, the impacts and problems should also be handled in a differentiated way. The key areas of climate safe planning are: water safety, food security, human health security, safety of infrastructure, energy security, natural environment. Successful adaptation to climate change is inconceivable without having a sound knowledge of the impacts of climate change. The National Adaptation Geo-information System (NAGiS) may be used by national, regional, and local decision makers and stakeholders. It provides information on the climate status of the country, on the impacts of strategic risks connected to climate change and other long-term natural resource management issues, and on the correspondent adaptation possibilities, based on indicators, analyses, and impact studies. Data layers of NAGiS were elaborated by the Geological and Geophysical Institute of Hungary and partner projects funded by the Adaptation to Climate Change programme of the EEA Grants. The main parts of the NAGiS are a map-visualization system with 650 data layers; a database containing the calculation results based on modeling (GeoDat with 910 data layers); and a meta-database to help finding relevant data. NAGiS can be a useful tool for climate safe planning, analyzing, decision-support activities in governmental strategic planning; or for municipalities in spatial planning, settlement planning, organizing public services. It can be used in climate policy, energy policy planning, transport, and energy infrastructure design and numerous other fields. The further development of NAGiS is financed by the Environmental and Energy Efficiency Operative Programme. Between 2016 and 2018, the project will elaborate a decision support toolbox for underpinning policy and municipal adaptation measures, based on the development of the databases, methodologies, and evaluation modules of NAGiS. © 2018, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Enhancing understanding of factors underlying the emergence of these efforts can help strengthen incentives for action, address implementation challenges, and anticipate inequities. This paper uses survey responses from 287 cities and logistic regression analyses to explore conditions and policy actions associated with potential climate compatible development efforts when economic development, sustainability, climate change mitigation, and climate change adaptation considerations overlap. It finds evidence that potential climate compatible development efforts were present in 10% of the cities studied. Adaptation was the issue most likely to act as the missing link when each of these other issues influenced city policy actions, and mitigation was the least likely. Contextual factors associated with these efforts included budget stress, leadership from a policy entrepreneur, higher college degree attainment rates, having an environmental department or commission, and the area of the city composed of water versus land. Examining factors associated with these issues acting as missing links revealed contradictions that highlight the necessity of further exploration of processes affecting the pursuit of climate compatible development. © 2017 by the author.","Climate change policy experiments; Co-benefits; Municipal governance; Trade-offs; Wicked problems","adaptive management; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; economic development; environmental policy; exploration; governance approach; identification method; implementation process; incentive; leadership; sustainable development; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029504260

Climate model projections exhibit a large spread in the magnitude and pattern of tropical Pacific warming in response to greenhouse-gas forcing. Here, we show that part of this spread can be explained by model biases in the simulation of interannual variability, namely the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. We show that models that exhibit strong ENSO nonlinearities simulate a more accurate balance of ENSO feedbacks, and their projected tropical Pacific sea surface temperature warming pattern is closely linked to their projected ENSO response. Within this group, models with ENSO nonlinearity close to observed project stronger warming of the cold tongue, whereas models with stronger than observed ENSO nonlinearity project a more uniform warming of the tropical Pacific. These differences are also manifest in the projected changes of precipitation patterns, thereby highlighting that ENSO simulation biases may lead to potentially biased projections in long-term precipitation trends, with great significance for regional climate adaptation strategies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","El Niño; ENSO asymmetry; ENSO nonlinearity; Global climate models; Tropical pacific warming","atmospheric forcing; climate modeling; El Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global climate; nonlinearity; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; warming; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006427475

In Germany, landscape plans assess and organize the spatial allocation of land use as an environmental contribution to general spatial planning. Collaborative planning processes are important to develop sustainable and ecosystem-based strategies to make coastal landscapes climate proof. However, there is little experience with collaborative processes in practical planning in Germany, and probably in other countries as well. This paper conducts an empirical case study in the low-lying coastal areas of northwest Germany. During a collaborative landscape planning process, four different ecosystem-based land management scenarios have been co-designed by regional experts and researchers. The participatory and iterative process included the development of scenario narratives to define planning goals, the use of land use elements and their relations to ecosystem services as planning entities in terms of indicators, the art-based illustrations of the different scenarios, and an evaluation and monitoring of the outcomes by regional experts.

Nevertheless, at regional scales, the position of uppermost tree stands also reflects other climatic factors, including wind action. It remains uncertain, however, how much do intense winds depress the treeline below its potential position. Our objective was to quantify the effect of wind speed on the possible depression of upper forest margins below the potential treeline in a windy mountain range with the treeline located close to summit areas. In the Giant Mountains, Czech Republic, growth parameters and symptoms of wind-induced loss of biomass were determined for Norway spruce (Picea abies [L] Karst.) in 70 plots distributed along a gradient of wind speed within the treeline ecotone. Wind speed was modelled for each plot. General linear models were applied to discern the effect of wind on tree growth. Our results show that high wind speeds are reflected in the presence of clonal tree islands and irregular tree crowns. Despite evident wind-induced biomass loss, radial growth was not significantly affected, and the effect of wind on height increment was limited only to parts of the stem from 2 m above ground. Considering that the height growth was substantially reduced by wind in about half of the treeline area, and wind was able to limit only growth of trees taller than 2 m, the overall wind-induced depression of highest treeline positions is probably low, even in windy mountain regions. © 2017, Swiss Botanical Society.","Height increment; Picea abies; Radial growth; Thigmomorphogenesis; Tree rings","biomass; coniferous tree; ecotone; growth; height; morphogenesis; mountain region; quantitative analysis; temperature effect; tree ring; treeline; wind velocity; Czech Republic; Karkonosze Mountains; Sudetes; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014005102

Many efforts have been made to make hardware less energy consuming, reduce cooling energy of data and computing centers by relocating those facilities to cool regions and other. A novel approach to make the computing domain greener is to add renewable energy sources for the power supply. The challenge of this work is to consider computing facilities which are solely run by renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. In this work we tackle the problem of scheduling independent tasks within a predicted power envelope that varies during the time. First we evaluate different instances of the problem from a theoretical point of view. Then we propose several heuristics for the case of multi-core architectures and we assess their performance on synthetic workloads and power envelopes. © 2017 IEEE.","Complexity; Computing center; Energy efficiency; Optimization; Scheduling","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Natural resources; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Wind turbines; Complexity; Computing center; Computing facilities; Independent tasks; Multicore architectures; Renewable energy source; Synthetic workloads; Theoretical points; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030641875

This research offers a new paradigm to reduce methane emissions from ruminants by breeding climate-clever clovers. We demonstrate wide genetic diversity for the trait methanogenic potential in Australia’s key pasture legume, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). In a bi-parental population the broadsense heritability in methanogenic potential was moderate (H2 D 0.4) and allelic variation in a region of Chr 8 accounted for 7.8% of phenotypic variation. In a genome-wide association study we identified four loci controlling methanogenic potential assessed by an in vitro fermentation system. Significantly, the discovery of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on Chr 5 in a defined haplotype block with an upstream putative candidate gene from a plant peroxidase-like superfamily (TSub_g18548) and a downstream lectin receptor protein kinase (TSub_g18549) provides valuable candidates for an assay for this complex trait. In this way haplotype variation can be tracked to breed pastures with reduced methanogenic potential. Of the quantitative trait loci candidates, the DNA-damage-repair/toleration DRT100-like protein (TSub_g26967), linked to avoid the severity of DNA damage induced by secondary metabolites, is considered central to enteric methane production, as are disease resistance (TSub_g26971, TSub_g26972, and TSub_g18549) and ribonuclease proteins (TSub_g26974, TSub_g26975). These proteins are good pointers to elucidate the genetic basis of in vitro microbial fermentability and enteric methanogenic potential in subterranean clover. The genes identified allow the design of a suite of markers for marker-assisted selection to reduce rumen methane emission in selected pasture legumes. We demonstrate the feasibility of a plant breeding approach without compromising animal productivity to mitigate enteric methane emissions, which is one of the most significant challenges to global livestock production. © 2017 Kaur, Appels, Bayer, Keeble-Gagnere, Wang, Hirakawa, Shirasawa, Vercoe, Stefanova, Durmic, Nichols, Revell, Isobe, Edwards and Erskine.","Forage crops; Genetic and genomic analyses; Greenhouse gas emissions; Natural variation; Ruminant enteric methanogenesis; Selecting haplotypes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029041046

Renewable DGs, in spite of high investment cost and intermittent generation, are compulsive choice for environment friendly planning and sustainable growth. Clean energy DG technologies can provide solution to ever increasing power demand in sustainable and cost effective manner by adopting appropriate incentive mechanism. Clean energy technologies can also be encouraged by penalizing the conventional resources for harmful emissions. The proposed method minimizes the annual cost by maximizing the emission reduction and carbon credit revenue. The proposed formulation yields solution in terms of type, optimal size and location while fulfilling the criterion in terms of economic, technical or techno-economic.

Importance of each objective is mapped with optimal weight allocation, thereby maintaining the consistency among all objectives.

To achieve this purpose more effectively, the power used for driving EVs should be provided by renewable energy such a photovoltaic unit, and charging of in-vehicle batteries also should be scheduled optimally considering customers' requests and renewable generation. This means that all EVs and those State-of-Charge (SoC) must be managed individually. In one-way trip services, however, conventional researches have focused on the management of distribution of EVs without individual SoC management.

Motivation often flows from a resilience mindset - how cities can prepare for and be resilient to future shocks. The conflation of sustainability and resilience jeopardizes the success of sustainability efforts and limits their scope. Institutionalizing sustainability in city governments requires building capacity for city leadership to link sustainability and resilience objectives. This article builds on previous work in sustainability education to demonstrate how key competencies, or ways of thinking, in sustainability can be adapted for use with city leadership. The article introduces a novel board game entitled Future Shocks and City Resilience as a method for creating an interactive educational environment that facilitates learning while contributing to cultural change within a city administration.

The key activity is disaster risk reduction including climate change adaptation, for which many concepts and techniques have emerged from island studies. Although these concepts and techniques are not exclusive to island contexts, this paper focuses on island communities in order to illustrate the importance of human actions in causing and dealing with disasters involving environmental hazards. This point is demonstrated by examining key human and physical geography characteristics representing 'islandness': population, area, geomorphology and connectedness. The characteristics are not mutually exclusive, but island stereotypes emerge as small and static populations, small resource areas, highly volatile and changing geomorphology and limited connectedness. In exploring exceptions and diversities amongst islands, stereotypes are sometimes seen and sometimes not seen in reality. Advantages and disadvantages are demonstrated for different island settings dealing with environmental hazards and hazard drivers. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2017.","CCA; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Disasters; DRR; Environmental hazards; Islands; Resilience; Risk; Vulnerability","Disasters; Geomorphology; Hazards; Landforms; Risks; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reductions; Environmental hazards; islands; resilience; vulnerability; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; ecosystem resilience; environmental hazard; geomorphology; human activity; island; physical geography; risk assessment; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014995010

Pledges under the Agreement are currently inadequate to limit global warming to safe levels. However, it is intended to be a system that evolves over time and changes state behaviour to encourage increasingly ambitious emissions reductions from members. The Agreement is designed to increase action through a ratchet mechanism obligating countries to put forward stronger targets, political pressure and a ""signal"" to investors to transition towards low-carbon portfolios and activities. An analysis using causal loop diagrams finds that none of these mechanisms for change are convincing. The legal wording of the Paris Agreement means that no ""ratchet mechanism"" exists. Political pressure through a pledge and review process has rarely worked in other international agreements or in previous international efforts on climate change. The idea of international law sending an investment signal is tenuous at best, and existing evidence in renewable energy and fossil fuel markets suggests that the signal is currently not functioning. Moreover, the Paris Agreement has inbuilt delay, making the lock-in of emissions-intensive trajectories likely. In short, the mechanisms for change designed into the Paris Agreement are unlikely to work. The Agreement as a system for changing state behaviour in a sufficient timescale is likely to fail. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Climate policy; COP21; Environmental policy; International relations; Paris; Systems dynamics",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042449240

Through 20 years of changes, evidenced in systematic data from the mid-1990s, a different perspective is found. None of the urban regions appear near to or even capable of becoming automobile cities. Physical limits are already being reached that make higher levels of private motorised mobility very problematic if transport systems are to remain functional and the cities livable. These limits appear already to be reversing the decline in non-motorised modes and creating an upturn in transit systems, especially urban rail. That these cities have been able to either hold their own, or somewhat increase their share of total motorised mobility by transit over a 20-year period, is some indication that they are 'hitting mobility walls' much sooner in the motorisation path than cities in North America and Australia, which grew up with and were designed around the spatial needs of cars. Like many cities in the developed world that have shown a decoupling of car use and total passenger mobility from GDP growth from 1995 to 2005, there is now evidence that this is happening in less wealthy cities. This is important because it assists global and local goals for reduced CO2 from passenger transport, while allowing for economic progress. Such evidence suggests that automobile dependence is not an irresistible force in emerging economies. © 2017 by the author.

Yet effects of encroachment on pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential fitness impacts of interference from encroaching Salix (willows) on pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. Overlap in flowering time of Salix and Polemonium is a precondition for interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting Polemonium flowers and on Polemonium pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring the correlation between Salix pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated Polemonium. To ascertain whether Salix interference occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and Salix pollen addition. In current and past contact zones Polemonium and Salix overlapped in flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, Salix and Polemonium showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. Salix pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting Polemonium flowers and accounts for up to 25% of the grains on Polemonium pistils. Salix contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for Polemonium and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing. © 2017 The Authors.

Temporal trends in CO were analyzed on an annual and seasonal basis in reference to other important air pollutants such as methane (CH4), particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), mercury (Hg), and ozone (O3). The annual mean of CO for the entire period was 0.93 ± 0.22 ppm. CO levels were reduced by 83% from 3.25 ± 0.78 ppm (1987) to 0.51 ± 0.31 ppm (2013). Its relative reduction was compared over three periods chosen arbitrarily as period 1 (fast reduction, 1987–1988), period 2 (intermediate reduction, 1999–2000), and period 3 (slow reduction, 2004–2013). The concentrations of CO were strongly correlated with others (e.g., SO2, NO, NO2, O3, and Hg), suggesting the effects of similar source processes (e.g., fuel combustion). The reduction in its level was marginally consistent with the decreasing trend in the total CO column concentration in Seoul by the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite between 2000 and 2013, indicating decreasing anthropogenic CO emissions (despite increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions). The rapid relative reduction of CO in period 1 and the subsequent slower but moderate reduction thereafter appear to reflect the effects of both enforcement of administrative regulations and advances in emissions control technologies. © 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Long-term analysis; Seoul; Temporal; Yongsan",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017362190

Here we assess the impact of topographic and socio-economic factors on the climate sensitivity of surface water quality, estimated using an elasticity approach (climate elasticity of water quality (CEWQ)), and identify potential risks of instability in different regions and climatic conditions. Large global datasets were used for 12 main water quality parameters from 43 water quality monitoring stations located at large major rivers. The results demonstrated that precipitation elasticity shows higher sensitivity to topographic and socio-economic determinants as compared to temperature elasticity. In tropical climate class (A), gross domestic product (GDP) played an important role in stabilizing the CEWQ. In temperate climate class (C), GDP played the same role in stability, while the runoff coefficient, slope, and population density fuelled the risk of instability. The results implied that watersheds with lower runoff coefficient, thick population density, over fertilization and manure application face a higher risk of instability. We discuss the socio-economic and topographic factors that cause instability of CEWQ parameters and conclude with some suggestions for watershed managers to bring sustainability in freshwater bodies. © 2017 The Author(s).

Apart from climate change, there is another side to this coin, and that is the risks surrounding energy security and future oil supplies. Vehicle manufacturers are increasingly recognizing their role in contributing to the goal of decarbonizing the economy and reduce dependence on oil. Out of available alternate fuels compressed natural gas (CNG) is the one which is meeting the maximum needs of countries worldwide, who want to switch over to alternate fuels. However, despite the fact that CNG are often seen as a panacea by policy-makers, there are a number of barriers to their widespread market penetration and diffusion. This study aims to identify an approach to strategic framework for addressing the barriers to widespread adoption of compressed natural gas as transportation fuel. Besides assessing the barriers to natural gas vehicles, the study attempts to identify how they can affect various stakeholders. The paper systematically examines natural gas vehicles (NGVs) adoption patterns and the evolution of pertinent market structures throughout the world but majorly concentrated on eleven countries: China, Iran, Pakistan, Argentina, India, Brazil, Italy, United States, Germany, Sweden and South Korea.

For policy implementation to involve this major ownership group in climate change mitigation activities in this region, it is important to understand their forest management motivations and understanding toward carbon sequestration. This study develops a regional typology of NIPF landowners based on reasons for owning forest land in the southern US. The specific goals were to: (1) segment NIPF landowners into smaller homogeneous groups based on reasons for owning forest land; (2) identify landownership characteristics and forest management behavior by ownership groups; and (3) assess their climate change beliefs and understanding of forest carbon sequestration by ownership groups. A principal component-cluster analysis of 735 responses to a mail questionnaire distributed to NIPF landowners in the southern US revealed three groups, which were named amenity, multi-objective, and timber-oriented landowners. The amenity group included 21% of the landowners, while the timber and multi-objective groups included 40% and 39% of the landowners, respectively. These landowner groups varied in terms of owner characteristics, forest species type and management behavior, climate change beliefs and understanding of carbon sequestration. The amenity and multi-objective owners tend to have more positive belief toward climate change than the timber group, but more landowners in each group indicated having poor understanding of forest carbon sequestration.

A strong dependence on the cation of the electrolyte was exhibited on the flat Au electrode surface. CO selectivity and capacitance dispersion are significantly higher with the KHCO3 electrolyte. On the other hand, the nanostructured Au electrodes, having much more improved activity and durability of CO2 reduction, showed much less electrolyte-dependent catalytic activity. The difference in CO selectivity with KHCO3 and NaHCO3 electrolytes can be explained by the difference in hydration level and consequent adsorption strength of the cations on the flat Au metal electrodes, implying that ion-pairing interactions between the metal, cations, CO2, and its intermediate play an important role in the reduction reaction. The local electric field fluctuation caused by the nanostructured rough Au surface can affect the electric double layer near the electrode surface and suppress the electrolyte-dependency of the reduction.

Given a growing global population and rapid urbanization, shifting contemporary carbon-intensive food consumption trends is essential. As such, encouraging pro-environmental behaviour change and pro-environmental food consumption behaviour in particular is as an important challenge; reducing our collective foodprint is an important way of reducing our collective carbon footprint. Yet, despite widespread consumer awareness of climate change, consumption behaviours are rarely consistent with environmentally friendly aspirations. This empirical research emphasizes the contribution and the potential of community gardens as a means of fostering pro-environmental behaviour change towards low-carbon food consumption. It evaluates the role of London’s community gardens in promoting participants’ environmentally friendly food consumption patterns, thereby lowering London’s foodprint on the consumer side. To collect data, ninety-five community gardens in London were asked to circulate an online survey to their gardeners. In total, forty-eight community gardeners responded to the survey. These responses were complemented with semi-structured interviews held with community garden participants. The paper investigates London community gardeners’ food consumption patterns including food self-sufficiency, food shopping habits, dietary choices, and food waste management in terms of their carbon footprint. In addition, it verifies that the timespan of community garden participation is not an absolute indicator of low-carbon food consumption choices, despite its influence on certain changes. It also accounts for experiential and social learning as the two key aspects of community gardening that promote gardeners’ behavioural change, resulting in a lower foodprint in daily life. © 2017 The Institute of Urban Sciences.","Community gardens; food consumption patterns; food-related carbon footprint; pro-environmental behaviour change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017581415

Growth and CO2 uptake by plants are constrained to a large extent by drought. Therefore, it is important to understand the spatial and temporal responses of vegetation to drought across the various land cover types and different regions. Leaf area index (LAI) derived from Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) data was used to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought occurrence across Yunnan Province, China (2001–2010). The meteorological drought was assessed based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. Pearson’s correlation coefficients between LAI and SPI were examined across several timescales within six sub-regions of the Yunnan. Further, the drought-prone area was identified based on LAI anomaly values. Lag and cumulative effects of lack of precipitation on vegetation were evident, with significant correlations found using 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month timescale. We found 9-month timescale has higher correlations compared to another timescale. Approximately 29.4% of Yunnan’s area was classified as drought-prone area, based on the LAI anomaly values. Most of this drought-prone area was distributed in the mountainous region of Yunnan. From the research, it is evident that GLASS LAI can be effectively used as an indicator for assessing drought conditions and it provide valuable information for drought risk defense and preparedness. © 2017, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Drought; Leaf area index distribution; MODIS; Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); Yunnan","drought; land cover; land surface; leaf area index; MODIS; physiological response; precipitation intensity; timescale; vegetation cover; China; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029151524

Due to the recognised threats of such particulate materials within urban areas, counter measures against PM2.5 have been largely explored; however, the methods in the context of planting types and structures have been neglected. Therefore, this study investigated and analysed the concentration levels of PM2.5 in roads, planting areas, and residential zones within urban areas. Moreover, the study attempted to identify any meaningful factors influencing the reduction of PM2.5 and their efficiencies. After surveying PM2.5 in winter and spring season, there were serious reductions of PM2.5 concentrations within the areas of pedestrian paths, planting, and residential areas compared to other urban areas. In particular, a significant low level of PM2.5 concentrations was shown in the residential areas located behind planting bands as green buffer. This research also found that three-dimensional volumes and quantity of planting rows play a critical role in reducing PM2.5. A negative correlation was shown between the fluctuated concentration rate of PM2.5 and quantity of planting rows-single row of trees showed fluctuated concentration rate of PM2.5, 84.77%, followed by double rows of trees 79.49%, and triple rows of trees 75.02%. Especially, trees need to be planted at certain distance to allow wind to diffuse fine particles rather than dense planting. Finally, planting shrubs also significantly reduces the concentration level of PM2.5-the fluctuated concentration rate of the single layer showed 88.79%, while the double layer and the multi-layer showed 81.16% and 68.93%, respectively-since it increases three-dimensional volume of urban plantings. © 2017 by the authors.","Fine particles; Green coverage rate; Green volume coefficient; PM2.5; Three-dimensional vegetation volumes; Tree and shrub structure","concentration (composition); correlation; greenspace; particulate matter; seasonal variation; surveying; sustainability; sustainable development; three-dimensional modeling; tree; tree planting; urban area; urban design; urban development; volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029808590

Compared with conventional bismuth film grown by direct current electrodeposition, Bi nanoflakes have large number of edge and corner sites. As it has been proven by numerical simulation, sharp edge or corner sites of the nanostructures form strong local electric fields, which boost the catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in aqueous solution. The Bi nanoflakes showed a high HCOO- faradaic efficiency (FE = 79.5%) at low potential of −0.4 VRHE and achieved a maximum FE close to 100% at −0.6 VRHE, meaning that the shape control of Bi electrocatalyst is indeed an efficient way to reduce the electrical power consumption for HCOO- production. Moreover, Bi nanoflakes were stable during 10 h operation in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-MOD17 data product is a widely used remote sensing-based model that provides global estimates of spatiotemporal trends in GPP. When the MOD17 algorithm is applied to regional scale heterogeneous landscapes, input data from coarse resolution land cover and climate products may increase uncertainty in GPP estimates, especially in high productivity tropical ecosystems. We examined the influence of using locally specific land cover and high-resolution local climate input data on MOD17 estimates of GPP for the State of Hawaii, a heterogeneous and discontinuous tropical landscape. Replacing the global land cover data input product (MOD12Q1) with Hawaii-specific land cover data reduced statewide GPP estimates by ~8%, primarily because the Hawaii-specific land cover map had less vegetated land area compared to the global land cover product. Replacing coarse resolution GMAO climate data with Hawaii-specific high-resolution climate data also reduced statewide GPP estimates by ~8% because of the higher spatial variability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the Hawaii-specific climate data. The combined use of both Hawaii-specific land cover and high-resolution Hawaii climate data inputs reduced statewide GPP by ~16%, suggesting equal and independent influence on MOD17 GPP estimates. Our sensitivity analyses within a heterogeneous tropical landscape suggest that refined global land cover and climate data sets may contribute to an enhanced MOD17 product at a variety of spatial scales. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

In plants, fungal symbionts can ameliorate the abiotic stressors that accompany climate warming and thus could influence plants under a changing climate. Forecasting future plant–microbe interactions first requires knowledge of current fungal symbiont distributions, which are poorly resolved relative to the distributions of plants. Location: We used meta-analysis to summarize the biogeographic distributions of plant-fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems worldwide, because these ecosystems are likely to be among the first to experience climate change-induced range shifts. Methods: We analysed 374 records from 53 publications to identify general trends, pinpoint areas in need of greater study and develop reporting guidelines to facilitate future syntheses. Results: Elevational patterns varied strongly among fungal and plant functional groups. Fungal diversity and abundance increased with altitude for the ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and localized foliar endophytes declined in either abundance or diversity with altitude. In shrubs, fungal abundance increased with elevation, but in C3 grasses, fungal abundance declined with elevation. Altitudinal patterns in fungal composition were stronger than gradients in fungal abundance or diversity, suggesting that species turnover contributes more to elevational gradients in fungal symbionts than does variation in abundance or richness. Plant functional groups were overrepresented by C3 grasses and trees, with surprisingly few data on sedges or shrubs, despite their ecological dominance in mountain ecosystems. Similarly, epichloae, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes were understudied relative to other fungal groups. Main Conclusions: Meta-analysis revealed broad biogeographic patterns in plant-fungal symbiont abundance, diversity and composition that inform predictions of future distributions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","altitudinal gradients; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizal fungi; ericoid mycorrhizal fungi; foliar endophytes; fungal distributions; root endophytes","abundance; altitude; arbuscular mycorrhiza; biogeography; climate change; ectomycorrhiza; endophyte; functional group; fungus; grass; meta-analysis; mountain region; sedge; shrub; species diversity; species richness; symbiont; tree; Carex; Fungi; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028541648

To promote the use of local wood in pile foundation, diagnostic and prediction methodology of wood decay in soil need to be improved. Outdoor mesocosm decay experiments were performed to evaluate the potential use of beech wood as foundation piles. The stochastic occurrence of soil fungal inoculum in contact with mini-stakes and water gradient in wood explained the observed patchy wood decay pattern. Various patterns of wood rotting fungi were identified. The correlation between measured strength loss and mass loss was weak. Multivariate analyses using biochemical and physico-chemical data as inputs allowed section categorizations and prediction of wood strength. Accuracy of the prediction was validated by experimental measurement of the compression parallel to the grain (fc,o). The categorization of unknown sections was computed by PLS-DA and provided clues inferring their service life.

Yet, despite increasing scientific evidence of the positive impacts that urban green infrastructure (UGI) is having on the urban microclimate, this evidence is not being incorporated into urban design practice. This explorative study was executed to create design guidelines for climate-responsive UGI that stem from scientific knowledge and are useful to design practice. A participatory ‘Research through Design’ (RTD) approach was applied in two design studios to have landscape architects test evidence-based preliminary guidelines. The researchers made observations, plan analyses, and executed questionnaires in the studios to assess the usefulness of the preliminary guidelines and, subsequently, to refine them. This paper presents the revised guidelines for the city, park, and street scale levels and elaborates the knowledge on the microclimate and operational principles needed for implementation. This paper argues that a participatory RTD approach helps to link knowledge from research to practice. © 2018 The Author(s).

We report on conceptual and geographic trends within the literature, including the practice of assessing local knowledge against scientific benchmarks, and present results of a textual network analysis that illustrates overlap and co-occurrence among different characterizations of local knowledge. In critically assessing the dominant trends we draw special attention to problems associated with the extraction of local knowledge without due consideration of how this process is embedded and inextricable from local contexts and sociotechnical orders. Drawing on theories of science and technology that examine the ontological politics of research practices, we propose a co-productive path forward for local knowledge mobilization to inform adaptation decision-making, which we argue facilitates the transformation of the institutional and governance arrangement of climate adaptation to provide greater flexibility and experimentalism in research and decision-making.

In contrast to land-based production, open-ocean aquaculture is constrained by oceanographic factors, such as current speeds and seawater temperature, which are dynamic in time and space, and cannot easily be controlled. As such, the potential for offshore aquaculture to increase seafood production is tied to the physical state of the oceans. We employ a novel spatial model to estimate the potential of open-ocean finfish aquaculture globally, given physical, biological and technological constraints. Finfish growth potential for three common aquaculture species representing different thermal guilds-Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and cobia (Rachycentron canadum)-is compared across species and regions and with climate change, based on outputs of a high-resolution global climate model. Globally, there are ample areas that are physically suitable for fish growth and potential expansion of the nascent aquaculture industry. The effects of climate change are heterogeneous across species and regions, but areas with existing aquaculture industries are likely to see increases in growth rates. In areas where climate change results in reduced growth rates, adaptation measures, such as selective breeding, can probably offset potential production losses. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The positive influence of increased intersection performance to reduce delays and queues, as well as negative impacts on the atmosphere is presented in this paper. The case study includes two single-lane roundabouts located close to each other in Žilina. Both roundabouts do not comply with the current traffic loads. This results in long queues and delays lasting not just during the peak hours. The solution to this problem is a new type of roundabout - turbo-roundabout. Capacity characteristics of both the current and new state are determined by microsimulation using PTV Vissim software. Obtained main characteristics of traffic flows are used as inputs to establish emission productions of NOx, CO and HC at the roundabout entries. The paper shows that proposed basic turbo-roundabout provides significant higher capacity performance compared with current state. Waiting times and queue lengths decrease about ten times. Due to this reduction, emission productions decrease about 50-60%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Traffic control; Transportation; Acceleration and deceleration; Capacity characteristics; Capacity enhancement; Capacity performance; Microsimulation; Queue lengths; Single lane roundabouts; Traffic loads; Queueing theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034113073

The phase composition and equilibrium characteristics are calculated by means of a database regarding the properties of individual materials. The database in Astra 4 software consists of thermodynamic, thermophysical, and thermochemical properties of materials. It includes data systematized at the Institute of High Temperatures, Academy of Sciences of the USSR and at the United States National Standards Bureau; data published in journals, monographs, and handbooks; and also data analyzed and calculated at Bauman Moscow State Technical University. The chemical and phase transformations in the system are simulated in the range 1573–2573 K, with 5, 10, and 15% C in the system, at a pressure of 0.1 MPa. Modeling shows that the maximum conversion of manganese to Mn3Si3 (in the condensed state) is 95.3 at T = 1873 K, with 30% carbon in the system. With further increase in temperature, the manganese begins to enter the gas phase. In comparison with manganese, silicon is less easily reduced and, with increase in the temperature, it begins to enter the gas phase. The best temperature range for the reduction of silicon is 1773–1873 K, with 15–30% C in the system. Calculation of the iron transfer αFe (%) as a function of the temperature and the carbon content indicates that the temperature range 1773–1873 K is optimal, with 15% C. On the basis of thermodynamic modeling of the phase transitions in a system consisting of oxidized manganese ore and reducing agent, it is possible to assess the possibility of producing ferrosilicomanganese by the electrosmelting of Western Kamys ore, which is hard to enrich. © 2017, Allerton Press, Inc.","carbon; chemical and phase transitions; condensed phase; electrosmelting; ferroalloys; gas phase; manganese; metals; oxidized manganese ore; silicon; thermodynamic analysis; thermodynamic modeling","Carbon; Chemical analysis; Ferroalloys; Gases; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Materials properties; Metals; Ore analysis; Ores; Oxidation; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Software agents; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamics; Condensed phase; electrosmelting; Gasphase; Manganese ore; Thermo dynamic analysis; Thermodynamic model; Phase transitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038897586

In addition, the choice of gas analysis systems for CEM&ASs should be maximally objective and not depend on preferences of separate experts and specialists. The technique of choosing gas analysis equipment that was developed in previous years at Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) has been analyzed and the applicability of the mathematical tool of a multiple criteria analysis to choose measuring equipment for the continuous emission monitoring and accounting system have been estimated.

The results indicate that a combined system has potential benefits in local energy security, in emission reduction, and in lowering the operating costs of CHP systems in an energy hub as compared to independent systems. The results also indicate that application of CHP technology in a Toronto scenario results in a decrease in operational costs compared to a conventional HVAC system.

The chirality is achieved owing to a strong optical spin-locking effect, which in an ideal case gives perfect unidirectional excitation transport. We obtain a simple analytical solution for a single excitation dynamics in the Markovian limit, which directly shows the tolerance of the system with respect to the fluctuations of emitters position. We also show that the Dicke state, which is well known to be superradiant, has twice lower emission rate in the case of unidirectional quantum interaction.

This paper analyses the effect of takeoff roll thrust setting variability on the magnitude and spatial distribution of NOX emissions using high-resolution data records for 497 Airbus A319 activities at London Heathrow. Thrust setting varies between 67 and 97% of maximum, and aircraft operating in the bottom 10th percentile emit on average 514 g less NOX per takeoff roll (32% reduction) than the top 10th percentile, however this is dependent on takeoff roll duration. Spatial analysis suggests that peak NOX emissions, corresponding to the start of the takeoff roll, can be reduced by up to 25% by adopting reduced thrust takeoff activities. Furthermore, the length of the emission source also decreases. Consequently, the use of reduced thrust takeoff may enable improved local air quality at airports. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aircraft takeoff; Airport operations; Environmental impact; NOX emissions; Reduced thrust","aircraft; airport; emission inventory; environmental impact; nitrogen oxides; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; England; Heathrow Airport; Hillingdon; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021822409

Threats activate the body for action by mediating increases in arousal, respiration, and motor readiness. In previous studies, a range of cardiac, endocrine, brain-based, attention-bias, and behavioral measures have been used to demonstrate increases in arousal, vigilance, and motor readiness in patients with PNES. The current study uses respiratory measures to assess both the motor readiness of the respiratory system and the respiratory regulation of CO2. Baseline respiratory rates during clinical assessment and arterial CO2 levels during the hyperventilation component of routine video electroencephalogram were documented in 60 children and adolescents referred for treatment of PNES and in 50 controls. Patients showed elevated baseline respiratory rates [t(78) = 3.34, p = .001], with 36/52 (69%) of patients [vs. 11/28 (39%) controls] falling above the 75th percentile (χ2 = 6.7343; df = 1; p = .009). Twenty-eight (47%) of patients [vs. 4/50 (8%) controls] showed a skewed hyperventilation-challenge profile—baseline PCO2 &lt;36 mmHg, a trough PCO2 ≤ 20 mmHg, or a final PCO2 &lt;36 mmHg after 15 min of recovery—signaling difficulties with CO2 regulation (χ2 = 19.77; df = 1; p &lt; .001). Children and adolescents with PNES present in a state of readiness-for-action characterized by high arousal coupled with activation of the respiratory motor system, increases in ventilation, and a hyperventilation-challenge profile shifted downward from homeostatic range. Breathing interventions that target arousal, decrease respiratory rate, and normalize ventilation and arterial CO2 may help patients shift brain–body state and avert PNES episodes. © 2017, The Author(s).","Conversion disorder; Dissociative convulsions; Functional neurological symptom disorder; Hyperventilation; Non-epileptic seizures","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; adolescent; arousal; arterial carbon dioxide tension; Article; biofeedback; breathing; breathing rate; child; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; electroencephalography; female; human; hyperventilation; major clinical study; male; motor performance; patient referral; psychogenic nonepileptic seizure; respiration control; respiratory system; videorecording; brain; pathology; procedures; psychology; seizure; Adolescent; Brain; Carbon Dioxide; Child; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Seizures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016177748

Consequently, PFCs breaches cholesterol biotransformation in mitochondria and cause fatal consequences in steroidogenesis, however, these were poorly characterized. In the present study, we have evaluated toxic potencies, nuclear mediated probabilities and interaction profiles with StAR of PFCs using computational system biology tools. Toxicity endpoints revealed that PFCs contain high carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity, skin sensitization effects with low mutagenic activity. Consensus qualitative nuclear receptor agonist models show higher probability rates towards ER and PPAR-γ receptor than AR and AhR models were observed. To poise the subtle fluctuations of actual predictions, balanced accuracy and MCC were computed, and they signify perfect correlation ranges in all models. Screening studies resulting protein-ligand interaction profiles showed that residues Asn148, Asn150, Glu169, Ala171, Arg182, Phe184, Arg188, Trp241, Thr263 and Phe267 were identified as novel hotspots, participated in halogen bonds, H-bonds, atomic π-stacking, π-cation interactions and salt-bridges formation. Thus, the additional bonds contribute conformer stability that holds the protein structure at flexible state, so that PFCs acts as a barrier to cholesterol binding. From docking outcomes, representation space was created, that specifies high and medium StAR binders were occupied in toxic endpoints space with active concern.

As a result of the growing world population and the recognition of the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, this anthropogenic source of CH4 has received much recent attention. However, the accurate assessment of the CH4 emissions from landfills by modeling and existing measurement techniques is challenging. This is because of inaccurate knowledge of the model parameters and the extent of and limited accessibility to landfill sites. This results in a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the emissions of CH4 from landfills and waste management. In this study, we present results derived from data collected during the research campaign COMEX (CO2 and MEthane eXperiment) in late summer 2014 in the Los Angeles (LA) Basin. One objective of COMEX, which comprised aircraft observations of methane by the remote sensing Methane Airborne MAPper (MAMAP) instrument and a Picarro greenhouse gas in situ analyzer, was the quantitative investigation of CH4 emissions. Enhanced CH4 concentrations or ""CH4 plumes"" were detected downwind of landfills by remote sensing aircraft surveys. Subsequent to each remote sensing survey, the detected plume was sampled within the atmospheric boundary layer by in situ measurements of atmospheric parameters such as wind information and dry gas mixing ratios of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the same aircraft. This was undertaken to facilitate the independent estimation of the surface fluxes for the validation of the remote sensing estimates. During the COMEX campaign, four landfills in the LA Basin were surveyed. One landfill repeatedly showed a clear emission plume. This landfill, the Olinda Alpha Landfill, was investigated on 4 days during the last week of August and first days of September 2014. Emissions were estimated for all days using a mass balance approach. The derived emissions vary between 11.6 and 17.8 ktCH4 yr-1 with related uncertainties in the range of 14 to 45 %. The comparison of the remote sensing and in situ based CH4 emission rate estimates reveals good agreement within the error bars with an average of the absolute differences of around 2.4 ktCH4 yr-1 (±2:8 ktCH4 yr-1). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported inventory value is 11.5 ktCH4 yr-1 for 2014, on average 2.8 ktCH4 yr-1 (±1:6 ktCH4 yr-1) lower than our estimates acquired in the afternoon in late summer 2014. This difference may in part be explained by a possible leak located on the southwestern slope of the landfill, which we identified in the observations of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) instrument, flown contemporaneously aboard a second aircraft on 1 day.",,"airborne survey; anthropogenic source; AVIRIS; boundary layer; carbon dioxide; in situ measurement; landfill; methane; remote sensing; waste disposal; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029771340

We investigate the case of urban neighbourhood activation for the support of the elderly during the more likely occurring extreme heat waves generated by climate change. The proposed integrative theoretical consideration makes on the one hand reference to social dilemma theory and on the other to concepts from behavioural theory and social psychology. The case context is particularly challenging because it involves intra-individual dynamics of psychological processes, inter-individual dynamics of social influence and environmental dynamics governed by future climate scenarios. To account for the spatial and temporal dynamics of social mobilisation the proposed methodical approach is agent-based modelling. The presented social simulation experiments obtain their empirical grounding from a fine grained set of socio-geographic data for the target area which groups the population according to sociological lifestyles in a spatially explicit way. Simulation results show that social mobilisation of neighbourhood support can be substantially inhibited because passive habits establish quicker than prosocial behaviours which require successful social coordination prior to becoming habitual. In contrast, an alternative scenario simulation reveals that a time-limited intervention can provide an enlarged temporal window of opportunity for cooperative habits to stabilise and to persist after the end of the intervention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Climate change adaptation; Collective action; Habits; Public good dilemma; Social influence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970021248

We find that the beliefs concerning the reality of anthropogenic climate change, the importance of ecology over economy and desirability of governmental regulation divide organizations into three advocacy coalitions: the economy, ecology and science coalitions. Policy preferences such as cap and trade do not; they find support across coalition lines. Based on these findings, we suggest that ACF theory could be clarified to better account for how beliefs concerning policy instruments contribute to coalition formation.

The choice of technology for addressing this need may have important sustainability implications. In this study, we used life cycle assessment to compare environmental impacts and nutrient recovery potentials of four different options for providing everyone in India with access to improved sanitation: (i) centralised wastewater treatment with sequential batch reactors (SBR), (ii) twin-pit latrines, (iii) latrines with source separation only and (iv) latrines with source-separation of urine and faeces connected to biogas plants. Results revealed large variability. Closing the sanitation gap through pit latrines would be expected to cause large increases of India’s annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, equivalent to 7% of current levels. Source separation only and centralised plants with SBR will be associated with lower GHG emissions, while the biogas scenario shows a potential to provide net emission reduction. The study revealed that source separating systems can provide significant quantities of plant available nitrogen and phosphorus at the country level.

Similarly change in yield of wheat at increased CO2 at 700 ppm and 850 ppm was studied. The effect of different combinations of increased temperature and CO2 on wheat yield was also studied. Simulated wheat productivity revealed the reduction in grain yield by 7.4 to 38.6 per cent in response to temperature rise up to 40 C at all locations. The elevated CO2 (from 350 ppm up to 850 ppm) increased the yield by 39.1 per cent. Increased temperature with combination of increased CO2 concentration reduced the yield by 2.1-16.0 per cent for different combinations at different locations. The maximum reduction in simulated wheat yield was observed at combination of 2° C increase in temperature with 450 ppm CO2 concentration at all locations in Bihar. © 2017, Association of Agrometeorologists.

Due to current climate changes, the snow cover period in many Russian regions has become shorter because of the later onset of snowpack formation and earlier start of snow cover loss. This study focuses mainly on the estimation of cold-season CO2 effluxes from soils at different snow cover depths under the temperate continental climate. An experiment with regulated snow cover was established on grassland and bare soil Haplic Luvisols (in the Moscow region). For each land cover type, the following winter scenarios were applied: (1) reference plot, designated “Ref”, with natural depth of snowpack, (2) no-frost, “NoFr” (simulation of snow addition using artificial heat insulation material), and (3) no-snow, “NoSn” (removal of snowpack). The reduction of snow cover depth accompanied by the frost penetration into the soil was shown to decrease the cold-season CO2 effluxes from soil by 1.7–2.5 times in comparison with unfrozen soil. During the cold season, there were four thaw events, which induced CO2 efflux pulses of varying intensity. The highest peaks of CO2 efflux (up to a 26-fold increase compared to the pre-thawing period) were revealed during the early spring thaw. These pulses in CO2 effluxes during early spring contributed between 43 and 70% to the total cold-season CO2 effluxes from frozen soils (‘Ref” and “NoSn” variants) while the contribution of spring fluxes from unfrozen soils (“NoFr” treatment) was about 22–23%. Grass cover provided both a later winter freezing and delay of spring thawing of soils. Our findings produce evidence that warm and dry winter of 2014–2015 in the temperate continental region is followed by disturbances of the seasonal snowpack, frequent thawing events, prolongation of the period when soils remain frozen that result in the cooling of soils and significant reduction of the cold-season CO2 effluxes from soils. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cold-season CO2 efflux; Freezing–thawing events; Grassland and bare soils; Snowpack manipulation experiment; Winter warming","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climatology; Freezing; Reinforcement; Snow; Soils; Thawing; Bare soils; Cold season; Continental climate; Freezing-thawing; Frost penetrations; Heat insulation materials; Seasonal snowpack; Winter warming; Frozen soils; air-soil interaction; bare soil; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; freeze-thaw cycle; grass; land cover; Luvisol; seasonal variation; snow cover; snowpack; winter; Moscow [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008659735

To meet increasingly stringent emission regulations, diesel powertrains employ aftertreatment devices to control nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter emissions and use active exhaust warm-up strategies to ensure those devices are active as quickly as possible. A typical strategy for exhaust warm-up is to operate with retarded combustion phasing, limited by combustion stability and HC emissions. The amount of exhaust enthalpy available for catalyst light-off is limited by the extent to which combustion phasing can be retarded. Diesel cetane number (CN), a measure of fuel ignition quality, has an influence on combustion stability at retarded combustion phasing. Diesel fuel in the United States tends to have a lower CN (both minimum required and average in market) than other countries. It is unclear from existing literature to what extent low CN influences the ability to retard combustion phasing while limiting engine-out hydrocarbon emissions during the catalyst light-off phase. To begin to address this question, a single-cylinder engine study was conducted to compare the ability to generate exhaust temperature and enthalpy with low emissions with fuels of 46 and 53 CN. The fuels were found to produce comparable exhaust temperature, enthalpy and emissions when the engine was operated at the same calibration. However, when the calibrations were optimized separately for each fuel to maximize exhaust temperature and enthalpy while controlling emissions at or below a target level, the higher CN fuel tolerated significantly greater post injection retard within the hydrocarbon and particulate matter emissions constraints, thus enabling increased exhaust enthalpy and temperature. This study suggests that while a change in market CN would have only a slight impact on catalyst light-off and tailpipe emissions in legacy vehicles, future vehicles may be limited by low cetane fuel in their ability to achieve ultra-low emissions such as those required for California LEV III and Federal Tier 3. The study also highlights the importance of the assessment methodology when making conclusions about the effect of fuels on legacy and future vehicles.

High moisture and fine fractional composition of waste causes the application of their deep dehydration and lumping. To reduce environmental emissions the non-thermal method of dehydration is considered - adsorption-contact drying. As a sorbent, the pyrolysis product of coals from the Kansko-Achinsky basin - brown coal semi-coke (BSC) obtained by the technology ""Thermokoks"". Experimental data on the dehydration of high-moisture wastes with the help of BSC showed high efficiency of the selected material. The lumping of the dried converter dust was carried out by thermo-chemical coking with coals of grades GZh (gas fat coal) and Zh (fat coal). As a result, an iron-containing product was obtained - ferrocoke, which is characterized by almost complete reduction of iron oxides, as well as zinc transition into a vapor state, and is removed with gaseous process products. Based on the results of the experimental data a process basic diagram of the utilization of converter sludge to produce ferrocoke was, which can be effectively used in various metallurgical aggregates, for example, blast furnaces, converters and electric arc furnaces.

Resilience has greater appeal as a framing device over adaptation to such actors given its potential to enable buy-in from a wider city-regional governance network. However, this paper also highlights the ‘resilience trap’: the dangers of adopting short-term strategies, re-badging existing strategies and widening governance networks that obfuscate sub-national mobilization around adaptation.

This monument is undoubtedly one of the main touristic attractions of Rome. During the restoration held between 2014 and 2015, some diagnostic analyses had been carried out. It has been highlighted that the sheltered surfaces suffer the formation of black crust, especially on the marble statues. The possibility to sample those degradation products, together with the unaltered substrate, represented an excellent opportunity to characterize the marble itself, to assess the impact of the urban air pollution on the stone material, and to detect the pollutant on a precise timescale. In fact, it is known that the previous restoration of the fountain had been carried out between 1989 and 1991 then, information about the air pollution over the last 25 years can be highlighted, because it has been proved that black crusts act as passive samplers of pollution. In order to fully characterize those samples, several techniques were used, including optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and ion chromatography. Furthermore, a new methodology based on CHN (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen) analysis has been developed for the quantification of the two main constituents of the carbonaceous fraction present in the black crusts, i.e. OC (organic carbon) and EC (elemental carbon).

The regression equations describing the relationship between the standardized precipitation index SPI (meteorological drought) and the crop drought index CDI (evapotranspiration reduction) were used in a first step. Then the FAO equation describing the relationship between CDI and yield reduction was used. Crop water deficit measured by CDI is spatially differentiated and depends on the intensity of meteorological drought and soil water availability. The greatest evapotranspiration reduction is found for late potato growing in the central-west Poland (30-60%). The smallest reduction of evapotranspiration was stated for winter rape (12-16%) in the same region on soils with small water retention and no reduction can be on soils with large water retention. A good correlation between estimated and observed yield reduction was found. Potential yield reduction of late potato can reach more than 50% in central Poland. Least yield reduction is for winter wheat and winter rape. The main advantage of the method used in the study is the combination of meteorological drought, soil water retention capacity, evapotranspiration, soil water balance and crop yield, and so help provide more accurate assessments. © 2017 Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) in Warsaw; © 2017 Institute of Technology and Life Sciences (ITP) in Falenty.","crop drought index CDI; crop water deficit; drought; soil water balance; standardized precipitation index SPI; yield reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032731308

We used these data to determine the ratio of the 2.2 μm extinction coefficient to the 850 μm opacity and found the value to be close to that found in similar studies of the Orion B and Perseus clouds but higher than that characterizing the Orion A cloud, indicating that variations in the fundamental optical properties of dust may exist between local clouds. We show that over a wide range of extinction, the column density probability distribution function (pdf) of the cloud can be well described by a simple power law (i.e., PDFN AK -n) with an index (n = 4.0 ± 0.1) that represents a steeper decline with AK than found (n 3) in similar studies of the Orion and Perseus clouds. Using only the protostellar population of the cloud and our extinction maps we investigate the Schmidt relation, that is, the relation between the protostellar surface density, Σ-, and extinction, AK, within the cloud. We show that Σ- is directly proportional to the ratio of the protostellar and cloud pdfs, i.e., PDF-(AK)/PDFN(AK). We use the cumulative distribution of protostars to infer the functional forms for both Σ- and PDF-. We find that Σ- is best described by two power-law functions. At extinctions AK2.5 mag, Σ-AK β with β = 3.3 while at higher extinctions β = 2.5, both values steeper than those (2) found in other local giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We find that PDF- is a declining function of extinction also best described by two power-laws whose behavior mirrors that of Σ-. Our observations suggest that variations both in the slope of the Schmidt relation and in the sizes of the protostellar populations between GMCs are largely driven by variations in the slope, n, of PDFN(AK). This confirms earlier studies suggesting that cloud structure plays a major role in setting the global star formation rates in GMCs. © 2017 ESO.","Dust, extinction; ISM: clouds; ISM: individual objects: California Molecular Cloud; Stars: formation","Clouds; Distribution functions; Dust; Optical properties; Probability density function; Probability distributions; California; Cumulative distribution; Dust , extinction; Extinction coefficients; Giant molecular clouds; ISM : clouds; Star formation rates; Stars: formation; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032005437

This paper investigates the particulate concentrations in nine Chinese cities (Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Tianjin, Xi’an, Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, along with Hong Kong (a Special Administrative Region) and Taipei and Kaohsiung (Taiwan) with a particular focus on the celebrations of 2015. Extremely high concentrations of particulate matter were observed, with some sites revealing peak PM10 concentrations in excess of 1000 μg m−3 in the early hours of the New Year. In Beijing, Tianjin and Chongqing, the activities caused high particulate matter concentrations at most sites throughout the city. These peaks in particulate load in the early hours of Chinese New Year do not appear to be closely related to meteorological parameters. However, in cities where fireworks appear to be better regulated, there are fewer sharp pollution peaks just after midnight, although lowered air quality can still be found in the outer parts of some cities, remote from regulatory pressures. A few cities seem to have been effective at reducing the impact of the celebrations on air quality, with Nanjing a recent example. An increasing focus on light displays and electric lanterns also seems to offer a sense of celebration with much reduced impacts on air quality. © 2017, The Author(s).","China; Fireworks; Hong Kong; PM10; PM2.5; Taiwan","Air quality; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; China; Fireworks; Hong-kong; PM10; PM2.5; Taiwan; Explosives; air pollution; air quality; city; driver; Hong Kong; human; meteorology; particulate matter; spring; Taiwan; air pollutant; analysis; China; city; environmental monitoring; leisure; meteorology; particulate matter; procedures; season; Taiwan; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Holidays; Humans; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028080291

Energy production contributes more than half of the global greenhouse gas emissions, and thus the mitigation potential of local municipal energy systems is important for cities to recognize. The purpose of the study is to analyze the role of local municipal energy systems in the consumption-based carbon footprint of a city resident. The research supplements the previous carbon footprint assessments of city residents with an energy system implication analysis. The study includes 20 of the largest cities in Finland. The main findings of the study are as follows: first, the municipal combined heat and power energy system contributes surprisingly little (on average 18%) to the direct carbon footprint of city residents, supporting some previous findings about a high degree of outsourcing of emissions in cities in developed countries. Second, when indirect emissions (i.e., the implication of a municipal energy system on the national energy system) are allocated to city residents, the significance of the local energy system increases substantially to 32%. Finally, without the benefits of local combined heat and power technology based electricity consumption, the carbon footprints would have increased by an additional 13% to 47% due to the emissions from compensatory electricity production. The results also show that the direct application of consumption-based carbon assessment would imply a relatively low significance for municipal energy solutions. However, with a broader understanding of energy system dynamics, the significance of municipal energy increases substantially. The results emphasize the importance of the consequential energy system implications, which is typically left out of the evaluations of consumption-based carbon footprints. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon footprint assessment; Climate change mitigation; Energy systems; Life cycle assessment","adaptive management; carbon footprint; climate change; combined heat and power; electricity generation; emission inventory; life cycle analysis; local government; residential energy; urban area; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030623059

Climate governs pedogenesis, yet how climate modulates responses of soil food webs to soil ageing remains unexplored because of the paucity of appropriate model systems. We characterised soil food webs along each of four retrogressive soil chronosequences situated across a strong regional climate gradient to show that belowground communities are predominantly shaped by changes in fertility rather than climate. Basal consumers showed hump-shaped responses to soil ageing, which were propagated to higher-order consumers. There was a shift in dominance from bacterial to fungal energy channels with increasing soil age, while the root energy channel was most important in intermediate-aged soils. Our study highlights the overarching importance of soil fertility in regulating soil food webs, and indicates that belowground food webs will respond more strongly to shifts in soil resources than climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Bacteria; climate; energy channel; fungi; microarthropod; nematode; pedogenesis; precipitation; retrogression; succession","Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; climate; climate change; food chain; soil; Climate; Climate Change; Food Chain; Soil",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029589400

Process based Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are a valuable tool to investigate the determinants of vegetation distributions; however, many DGVMs fail to predict the spatial distribution or indeed presence of the South American savanna biome. Evidence suggests that fire plays a significant role in mediating forest–savanna biome boundaries; however, fire alone appears to be insufficient to predict these boundaries in South America. We hypothesize that interactions between precipitation, constraints on tree rooting depth and fire affect the probability of savanna occurrence and the position of the savanna–forest boundary. Location: Tropical forest and savanna sites in Brazil and Venezuela north of 23 ° S. Methods: We tested our hypotheses using a novel DGVM, aDGVM2, which allows plant trait spectra, constrained by trade-offs between traits, to evolve in response to abiotic and biotic conditions. Plant hydraulics is represented by the cohesion–tension theory, this allowed us to explore how soil and plant hydraulics control biome distributions and plant traits. The resulting community trait distributions are emergent properties of model dynamics. Results: We showed that across much of South America the biome state is not determined by climate alone. Interactions between plant rooting depth, fire and precipitation affected the probability of observing a given biome state and the emergent traits of plant communities. Simulations where plant rooting depth varied in space provided the best match to satellite derived biomass estimates and generated biome distributions that reproduced contemporary biome maps well. Main conclusions: Our findings support the contention that areas where multiple vegetation states are possible are widespread and highlight the importance of considering the influence of fire and constraints on plant rooting depth for predicting biome boundaries. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aDGVM2; community assembly; fire; forest–savanna biome transitions; plant rooting depth; plant traits; vegetation modelling","assembly rule; biome; climate effect; fire; plant community; probability; root; savanna; spatial distribution; trade-off; tropical forest; vegetation dynamics; Africa; Australia; Brazil; Venezuela",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020637861

Signaling by IL-10 occurs through the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), which is expressed in numerous cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), where it is associated with development and maintenance of barrier function. Guided by an unbiased metabolomics screen, we identified tryptophan (Trp) metabolism as a major modifying pathway in interferon-γ (IFNγ)-dominant murine colitis. In parallel, we demonstrated that IFNγ induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of Trp to kynurenine (Kyn), induces IL-10R1 expression. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that IL-10R1 expression on IEC is regulated by Trp metabolites. Analysis of the promoter region of IL-10R1 revealed a functional aryl hydrocarbon response element, which is induced by Kyn in luciferase-based IL-10R1 promoter assays. Additionally, this analysis confirmed that IL-10R1 protein levels were increased in response to Kyn in IEC in vitro. Studies using in vitro wounding assays revealed that Kyn accelerates IL-10-dependent wound closure. Finally, reduction of murine dextran sodium sulfate colitis through Kyn administration correlates with colonic IL-10R1 expression. Taken together, these results provide evidence on the importance of IL-10 signaling in intestinal epithelia and implicate AHR in the regulation of IL-10R1 expression in the colon. © 2017 Society for Mucosal Immunology.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; gamma interferon; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; interleukin 10 receptor; kynurenine; tryptophan; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; dextran sulfate; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, human; interleukin 10; interleukin 10 receptor alpha; tryptophan; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis; in vitro study; interferon induction; intestine epithelium; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; signal transduction; tryptophan metabolism; wound healing assay; animal; C57BL mouse; colitis; disease model; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; immunology; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; metabolism; wound healing; Animals; Colitis; Dextran Sulfate; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-10 Receptor alpha Subunit; Intestinal Mucosa; Kynurenine; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Signal Transduction; Tryptophan; Wound Healing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018820908

This issue has been ignored for several years, especially in building sector, but the impacts of natural hazards and climate change are becoming more and more influential and frequent. Moreover, urban areas are responsible of a great part of global energy consumption and CO2 emissions, in addition to the intensification of greenhouse effect. For this reason, the use of new technologies (PCM and cool materials) for buildings can affect not only indoor microclimate, but also urban environment. Starting from the dynamic simulations of common buildings in South of Italy and then in other hotter Mediterranean climate (Athens, Tunis), the research analyses various typologies of these materials and possible combined applications.

We show that the higher biomass demand for energy needed to reach the 2 °C target can be achieved without significant distortions to woody biomass material use and that it can even benefit certain forest industries and regions. This is because the higher woody biomass use for energy increases the demand for forest industry by-products, which makes forest industry final products production more profitable and compensates for the cost effect of increased competition over raw materials. The higher woody biomass use for energy is found to benefit sawnwood, plywood and chemical pulp production, which provide large amounts of by-products, and to inhibit fiberboard and mechanical pulp production, which provide small amounts of by-products. At the regional level, the higher woody biomass use for energy is found to benefit material production in regions, which use little roundwood for energy (Russia, North-America and EU28), and to inhibit material production in regions, which use large amounts of roundwood for energy (Asia, Africa and South-America).

The present paper analyzes the value of climate services which are aimed at improving agricultural productivity through a reduction in weather-associated risks. The first part provides a theoretical foundation for estimating the value of climate services based on a stochastic life-cycle model of a rural household which faces uncertainty with respect to the timing and the size of an adverse weather shock. We subsequently calibrate the model to match the environment of coffee producers in the Cusco region of Peru and provide a range of estimates for the value of climate services for a single average household, the region, and the country as a whole. In the second part of the paper we use empirical data to corroborate the numerical estimates. We assess the value of climate services in the agricultural sector in Cusco based on a choice experiment approach. Data are analyzed using a standard as well as a random parameter logit model allowing for preference heterogeneity. Farmers show a significant willingness-to-pay for enhanced climate services which is particularly related to the service accuracy and geographic resolution.

An intelligent traffic surveillance should be able to detect and track multiple vehicles in real-time using only limited resources. Conventional tracking methods usually run at a high video-sampling rate, assuming that the same vehicles in successive frames are similar and move only slightly. However, in cost effective embedded surveillance systems (e.g., a distributed wireless network of smart cameras), video frame rates are typically low because of limited system resources. Therefore, conventional tracking methods perform poorly in embedded surveillance systems because of discontinuity of the moving vehicles in the captured recordings. In this study, we present a fast and light algorithm that is suitable for an embedded real-time visual surveillance system to detect effectively and track multiple moving vehicles whose appearance and/or position changes abruptly at a low frame rate. For effective tracking at low frame rates, we propose a new matching criterion based on greedy data association using appearance and position similarities between detections and trackers. To manage abrupt appearance changes, manifold learning is used to calculate appearance similarity. To manage abrupt changes in motion, the next probable centroid area of the tracker is predicted using trajectory information. The position similarity is then calculated based on the predicted next position and progress direction of the tracker. The proposed method demonstrates efficient tracking performance during rapid feature changes and is tested on an embedded platform (ARM with DSP-based system). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Appearance and position similarities; Data association; Traffic surveillance; Trajectory identification; Vehicle detection and tracking","Cost effectiveness; Embedded systems; Monitoring; Smart city; Tracking (position); Traffic congestion; Trajectories; Vehicles; Appearance similarities; Data association; Distributed wireless networks; Position similarity; Traffic surveillance; Trajectory information; Vehicle detection; Visual surveillance systems; Security systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015399626

However, the siting and operation of a biofuel production facility can impact the members of the host community both positively (e.g. local jobs and income) and negatively (e.g. pollution and noise). Such ambivalent and heterogeneous external impacts result in either local support or opposition to the facility, which in turn becomes a key factor affecting biorefinery location decisions, and subsequent success of biorefineries. While a number of prior studies have analyzed economic and environmental impacts of biofuels, systematic analysis of local acceptability of biofuel production facilities is lacking. Our study explores factors that influence community attitudes towards biofuel facilities. We assess the strength of acceptability or opposition by estimating the local community's willingness to pay (WTP) either to support or to oppose a proposed biorefinery. We posit that such WTP estimates provide a more comprehensive measure of local acceptability. Results also suggest that county level socio-economic characteristics significantly influence these attitudes and WTP. © 2017 The Authors","Biorefinery; Climate change; Local acceptance; Willingness to pay","Bioconversion; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Refining; Biofuel production; Biorefineries; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Local acceptance; Location decisions; Socio-economics; Systematic analysis; Willingness to pay; Biofuels; climate change; heterogeneity; local participation; public attitude; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031721053

This research was performed in the catchment of the Schwabach River, a typical mid-latitude small headwater stream in Germany emplaced mainly in karstic bedrock. The DIC data indicated the dominance of mineral weathering as a DIC source, with a noticeable dilution effect during periods of high river flow. A weakly negative relationship between discharge and δ13CDIC hints at a greater importance of plant-derived organic matter during flooding events, likely transported to river waters via overland runoff and intermediate flow. DOC inputs appeared to be enhanced during periods of high discharge, indicating a greater importance of overland runoff as a DOC source. POC concentrations seem unaffected by changes in discharge, although a slight negative correlation between δ13CPOC and discharge may be derived from increased inputs of C4 plant material. Estimated CO2 concentrations were in excess of ambient atmospheric values throughout the year, confirming that the surface waters of the Schwabach River are a net CO2 source. The total riverine carbon flux was dominated by DIC (70%), followed by CO2 outgassing (21%), DOC (7%), and POC (2%). While the selection of a bi-monthly sampling scheme yielded a broadly similar carbon flux estimate to that utilizing the entire dataset, the use of a monthly sampling interval differed by as much as 19% from values using the high-resolution data set. This discrepancy is due to the inability of a monthly sampling scheme to capture sudden and large variations in river discharge and associated changes in dissolved/particulate carbon concentrations, such as those observed during flooding. We suggest that bi-monthly sampling is the minimum timeframe required to achieve an acceptable degree of accuracy in the calculation of carbon fluxes, at least during periods of high runoff. The application of high sampling frequencies and comprehensive DIC, DOC, and POC studies in future research would greatly reduce uncertainties in local riverine carbon budgets, and help clarify the role of smaller streams in the global carbon cycle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Floods; Rivers; Sampling; Carbon concentrations; Global carbon cycle; High resolution data; High sampling frequencies; Negative correlation; Riverine carbon fluxes; Sampling resolution; Stable carbon isotopes; Runoff; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; catchment; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; headwater; karst; river discharge; river flow; runoff; weathering; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029385544

It is found at high levels at public bus stations, where many passengers and workers may be exposed to PM2.5 emissions from idling diesel engines. This study evaluated the restriction on idling vehicles as a strategy to control PM2.5 levels at bus stations by measuring the PM2.5 and the chemical properties at both upwind and exposure sites for comparable data. The sampling took place on weekends and weekdays and before and after the idling restriction was applied. Originally, the exposure site showed a PM2.5 level that was 7% higher, non-neutralized nitrate content, anthropogenic metal elements, and higher mobile source contributions, as evaluated by a chemical mass balance model (CMB8.2). After the prohibition on idling heavy-duty diesel vehicles, the PM2.5 mass concentrations at the exposure site were reduced to levels comparable to those at the upwind site. Additionally, the nitrate content was reduced in the background. Moreover, the contributions of several anthropogenic metals (Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, Cr, V, Ni, and Ti) in PM2.5 were reduced while those of crustal elements (Na, Mg, Al, K, and Ca) significantly increased after the restriction. Finally, the mobile contribution decreased to only 33.7–34.5%. Consequently, these findings verify that the prohibition policy on idling vehicles works well as a control strategy to manage the PM2.5 emissions at local hotspots such as bus stations. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Chemical composition; CMB model; Idling operation; PM2.5; Source apportionment","Bus terminals; Buses; Copper; Diesel engines; Law enforcement; Lead; Magnesium; Manganese; Nitrates; Speed control; Titanium; Vehicles; Chemical compositions; CMB models; Idling operation; PM2.5; Source apportionment; Particles (particulate matter); anthropogenic source; atmospheric modeling; chemical composition; chemical mass balance; chemical property; concentration (composition); diesel engine; health impact; metal; nitrate; operations technology; particulate matter; pollution control; sampling; source apportionment; trace element; traffic emission; transport vehicle; transportation infrastructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031750184

Seasonal coverage of the Amazon plume on the French Guiana continental shelf further north, was provided by CO2 monitoring using a merchant ship sailing from France to French Guiana (2006-2016). Salinity ranged from 1 to 36 (transects in April 2013, and May 2014). At salinity below 10, strong outgassing was observed with fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) over 2,000μatm. This region displayed net heterotrophy, fueled by organic matter with terrestrial origin, as shown by γ13C and γ15N values of suspended particles. A γ13C cross shelf average of -31% was measured during May 2014, contrasting with oceanic values in excess of -20%. The reactivity of this terrestrial material resulted in the local production of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon as well as fluorescent humic compounds. Further offshore, the dilution of freshwater by ocean waters created a sink for CO2, enhanced by biological activity. The strongest CO2 drawdowns, associated with high chlorophyll a concentrations, were observed on the French Guiana continental shelf in the outer Amazon plume, with fCO2 values below 150 μatm. Here, a CO2 sink was present almost throughout the year, with a seasonal maximum of -9.2 mmol CO2 m-2d-1 observed in June 2015. However, both the CO2 and salinity distributions could vary significantly within a few days, confirming the presence of many eddies in this region. The Amazon continental shelf hence behaved as a transition zone between an inshore source of CO2 to the atmosphere and an offshore sink. Some marine phytoplankton production was detected but occurred mainly close to the French Guiana shelf. A mean net CO2 outgassing of 44 ± 43.6mmol m-2d-1 was estimated for the area. Quantifying the CO2 flux for the entire Amazon shelf area led to a revised annual estimate of the net ocean carbon export of 2.86 1012 mol C from the region. © 2017 Lefèvre, Flores Montes, Gaspar, Rocha, Jiang, De Araújo and Ibánhez.","Amazon continental shelf; Amazon plume; Carbon cycle; FDOM; French Guiana shelf; Fugacity of CO2; Stable isotopes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028958500

Two forms of regulation are considered: floor area ratio (FAR) restrictions and urban growth boundaries (UGBs). The model is designed so that regulation causes an endogenous adjustment of urban spatial structure, which in turn leads to changes in residential and transportation emissions. A novel aspect of the framework is that it captures regulation-induced inter-city migration. Results indicate that cities with low emission intensities should be cautious about adopting smart growth controls for climate change mitigation purposes. Even if such a regulation reduces per capita emissions everywhere, it can have the unintended consequence of increasing total emissions by pushing households to cities with higher emission intensities. Model variations reveal that this outcome is less likely if migration is costly or all urban areas are subject to some degree of regulation. Reducing emissions through land-use regulation generally carries a high abatement cost because consumers suffer from higher housing prices. Nevertheless, it could be an attractive mitigation option if policies are deployed in the right places, coordinated across cities, or generate substantial co-benefits (e.g., improved air quality, agglomeration economies, avoided infrastructure expansion). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use; Smart growth; Urban form; Zoning","climate change; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; land use planning; regulatory framework; smart city; urban planning; zoning policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026249522

DNP is efficiently mediated by quasi one-dimensional spin diffusion through the hydroxyl columns present in the CHAp structure (thought of as ""highways"" for spin diffusion). For spherical nanoparticles and Φ &lt; 100 nm, it is numerically shown that spin diffusion allows their study as a whole. Most importantly, we demonstrate also that the DNP study at 100 K leads to data which are comparable to data obtained at room temperature (in terms of spin dynamics and line shape resolution).

We determined spatial and temporal patterns of post-orogenic stream incision from a sequence of well-preserved staircase terraces developed over the last 1 Ma in the Central Pyrenees and its southern foreland Ebro basin (NE Spain). Extensive remnants of ten vertically separated terraces (Qt1 to Qt10, from oldest to youngest) were mapped along 170 km of the Cinca River valley, transverse to the Pyrenean mountain belt. Multiple outcrops appear in the upper reach of the valley (Ainsa sector, 50 km from headwaters) as well as in the lower reach (Albalate sector, 125 km from headwaters). Fluvial incision into bedrock was calculated using (i) differentially corrected GPS measurements of the altitude of straths and (ii) numerical dating of alluvial sediments from the lower terraces (Qt5 to Qt9) by Optically Stimulated Luminescence, previously reported by Lewis et al. (2009), and supplemented with new dates for the upper terraces (Qt1, Qt2 and Qt3) based on paleomagnetism and supported by soil development. Considering altitude differences and the elapsed time between successive well preserved terrace couples (Qt3–Qt7, Qt7–Qt9 and Qt9-Active channel), mean bedrock incision rates ranged from 0.76 to 0.38 m ka− 1, at the upper reach of the valley (Ainsa section), and from 0.61 to 0.20 m ka− 1, at the lower reach (Albalate section). River incision along the valley produced vertically separated, near-parallel longitudinal terrace profiles evidencing a rapid near-uniform regional uplift as response to (i) the tectonic lithospheric thickening in NE Iberia and (ii) the erosional download rebound related to the Ebro basin exorheism. Moreover, a subtle upstream divergence of strath profiles may have been a consequence of an increase in uplift rate toward the head of the valley. Additionally, incision rates changed over time as indicate results from the lower reach (Albalate section); the maximum rate was 1.48 m ka− 1 between Qt7 (61 ka) and Qt8 (47 ka), and the minimum rate was 0.11 m ka− 1 between Qt3 (401 ka) and Qt5 (178 ka). The highest incision rates were produced after the Marine Isotope Stage 4 most likely in response to (i) an increased snowmelt discharge during the subsequent deglaciation related to the last maximum advance of glaciers in the southern Pyrenees, and (ii) a limited width of the valley after Qt7 formation, resulting from the deactivation of the westward river migration. Therefore, incision rates over the last 1 Ma in the Cinca River valley were basically controlled by near-uniform bedrock uplift, in the context of climate variability. The results reported in this study represent significant data on fluvial incision in NE Iberia, and provide an assessment of the regional post-tectonic landscape evolution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Fluvial incision; Mid- to Late-Pleistocene; Southern Pyrenees and Ebro Basin; Staircase terraces; Uplift","climate change; climate effect; foreland basin; landscape evolution; outcrop; Pleistocene; tectonic evolution; terrace; uplift; Ebro Basin; Iberian Peninsula; Pyrenees; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019070720

Due to its advantages over some of the more traditional joining technologies, self-piercing riveting (SPR) has been widely used for these lightweight structures. Research has showed that friction is a very important factor that influences both the riveting process and joint strength for SPR, but these influences have not been fully understood. In this paper, an innovative method was used to modify the local surface of the top sheet around the rivet piercing location with different impression tools (the central pin, the small ring, the medium ring and the large ring) and garnet particles to study the influence of local frictions on rivet inserting process, joint features and static lap shear strength. The results showed that the local surface textures on the aluminium sheet did not have significant influence on the rivet inserting process based on displacement-force curve analysis. The local surface textures could slightly change the joint features, especially the rivet head height, but overall this influence was not significant. The lap shear tests showed that ring impressions with garnet particles and central pin impressions on the bottom surface of the top sheet increased the static lap shear strength of the SPR joints. The results confirmed that the critical location for local friction influence on the lap shear strength was around the rivet leg piercing location. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Friction; Lap shear strength; Self-piercing riveting; Surface texture; Tool impression","Aluminum; Friction; Garnets; Joining; Location; Piercing; Riveting; Tribology; Critical location; Displacement force; Innovative method; Joining technology; Lap shear strength; Riveting process; Self-piercing riveting; Surface textures; Rivets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027889759

This scheme integrates the spontaneous emission, the light shift of atoms in the presence of dispersive microwave field, and the quantum Zeno dynamics induced by continuous coupling, to obtain a unique steady state irrespective of initial state. Even for a large cavity decay, a high-fidelity entangled state is achievable at a short convergence time, since the occupation of the cavity mode is inhibited by the Zeno requirement. Therefore, a low single-atom cooperativity C = g2/(κγ) is good enough for realizing a high fidelity of entanglement in a wide range of decoherence parameters.

The changes or the differences in national and regional CO2 emissions during 2000–2014 are decomposed into nine underlying determinants. Temporal decomposition results show that economic scale effect is the dominant driving force leading to the increases in both national and regional CO2 emissions, while energy intensity effect is the main contributor to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Contribution of various variables to CO2 emissions between eastern region and central region are roughly same. Spatial decomposition results demonstrate that the differences of CO2 emissions among China's 30 regions are expanding increasingly. Economic scale effect is main driving force responsible for the difference in CO2 emissions among regions, and energy intensity effect, energy structure effect and industrial structure effect are also important factors which result in the increasing differences in regional CO2 emissions.

However, there are few studies that holistically examine the physical and social factors associated with travel CO2 emissions. Using a survey of 1525 shoppers conducted in Shenyang, China, this study estimated shopping-related travel CO2 emissions and examined how the built environment and individual socioeconomic characteristics contribute to shopping travel behavior and associated CO2 emissions. We found that, firstly, private car trips generate nearly eight times more carbon emissions than shopping trips using public transport, on average. Second, there was significant spatial autocorrelation with CO2 emissions per trip, and the highest carbon emissions were clustered in the inner suburbs and between the first and second circumferential roads. Third, shopping travel CO2 emissions per trip were negatively correlated with several built environment features including population density, the quantity of public transport stations, road density, and shop density. They were also found to be significantly related to the individual socio-economic characteristics of car ownership, employment status, and education level using a multinomial logistic regression model. These empirical findings have important policy implications, assisting in the development of measures that contribute to the sustainability of urban transportation and meet carbon mitigation targets. © 2017, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","built environment; China; shopping trips; socio-economic factors; transport carbon emission; travel behavior","car ownership; carbon emission; educational attainment; employment; holistic approach; public transport; shopping activity; socioeconomic impact; traffic emission; travel behavior; China; Liaoning; Shenyang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029084600

However, oral administration of fluoroquinolones may affect the composition and abundance of a number of bacterial taxa in the chicken intestine. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the microbial shifts in the gut of Salmonella infected chickens in response to enrofloxacin treatments at different dosages (0, 0.1, 4, and 100 mg/kg b.w.) were quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that the shedding levels of Salmonella were significantly reduced in the high dosage group as demonstrated by both the culturing method and 16S rRNA sequencing method. The average values of diversity indices were higher in the control group than in the three medicated groups. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis results showed that the microbial community of high dosage group was clearly separated from the other three groups. In total, 25 genera were significantly enriched (including 6 abundant genera: Lactococcus, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Acinetobacter) and 23 genera were significantly reduced in the medicated groups than in the control group for the treatment period, but these bacterial taxa recovered to normal levels after therapy withdrawal. Additionally, 5 genera were significantly reduced in both treatment and withdrawal periods (e.g., Blautia and Anaerotruncus) and 23 genera (e.g., Enterobacter and Clostridium) were significantly decreased only in the withdrawal period, indicating that these genera might be the potential targets for the fluoroquinolones antimicrobial effects. Specially, Enterococcus was significantly reduced under high dosage of enrofloxacin treatment, while significantly enriched in the withdrawal period, which was presumably due to the resistance selection. Predicted microbial functions associated with genetic information processing were significantly decreased in the high dosage group. Overall, enrofloxacin at a dosage of 100 mg/kg b.w. significantly altered the microbial community membership and structure, and microbial functions in the chicken intestine during the medication. This study fully investigates the chicken intestinal microbiota in response to enrofloxacin treatment and identifies potential targets against which the fluoroquinolones may have potent antimicrobial effects. These results provide insights into the effects of the usage of enrofloxacin on chicken and will aid in the prudent and rational use of antibiotics in poultry industry.","16S rRNA gene; Chicken; Enrofloxacin; Intestinal microbiota; Salmonella Typhimurium","fresh water; nitrate; nitrite; Article; biodiversity; carbon nitrogen ratio; community structure; controlled study; denitrification; DNA extraction; eutrophication; gene; heavy metal removal; human; incubation time; nirk gene; nirS gene; nirz gene; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pond; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sediment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029220037

However, with increased penetration and improved dispatch of renewables, this assumption may be outdated. Here, we improve the methodology to incorporate renewables in MEF estimates and demonstrate a case study for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) system where wind has been commonly dispatched on the margin. We also illustrate spatiotemporal variations of MEFs and explore implications for energy storage technologies. Results show that because the share of renewables in MISO is still relatively low (6.34%), conventional MEFs focused on emitting sources can provide a good estimate in MISO overall, as well as in the Central and South subregions. However, in the MISO North subregion where wind provides 22.5% of grid generation, neglecting nonemitting sources can overestimate MEFs for CO2, SO2, and NOx by about 30%. The application of expanded MEFs in this case also reveals heightened emission increases associated with load shifting of storage technologies. Our study highlights the importance of expanded MEFs in regions with high and growing renewables penetration, particularly as renewable energy policy seeks to incorporate demand-side technologies. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Electric energy storage; Electricity sector; Emission factors; Emitting sources; Energy storage technologies; Independent system operators; Renewable energy policy; Spatio-temporal variation; Storage technology; Electric utilities; fuel; carbon dioxide; demand analysis; electricity generation; emission; energy policy; estimation method; nitrous oxide; renewable resource; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; Article; electricity; marginal emission factor; Midcontinent Independent System Operator system; renewable energy; wind; pollutant; technology; Midcontinent; United States; Electricity; Environmental Pollutants; Renewable Energy; Technology; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030723821

The impacts of reductant type, specifically carbon-free (hydrogen (H2)), olefin (propylene (C3H6)), and alkane (propane (C3H8)) on the NOx and reductant conversions and product yields are reported over a range of feed temperature (Tf), catalyst temperature (Ts), and cycle time. The NOx conversion is enhanced at elevated temperatures (Tf &gt;350 °C) independent of reductant type by decreasing the cycle time from 70 to 7 s for a fixed rich duty cycle (14%). This is in contrast with a noted dependence on reductant type at intermediate temperatures (Tf = 250–325 °C), with C3H8 exhibiting a detrimental effect of cycle time but C3H6 exhibiting an enhancing effect. The high temperature enhancement is contributed in part to an increased generation of active surface intermediates, more frequent regeneration of NOx storage sites, and from exothermic heat effects of the reductant oxidation. The opposite, intermediate temperature trend observed with C3H8 is attributed to kinetic limitations of C3H8 dehydrogenation. The contrasting features obtained with H2, C3H6, and C3H8 during cyclic operation and steady-state in situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) help provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism. Surface intermediates are identified with C3H6 that are not observed with C3H8. Experiments with mixtures of C3H6 and C3H8 reveal NOx conversion enhancement of up to 50% when substituting only a small amount of C3H6 into C3H8. This enhancement results from the lower feed temperature light-off of C3H6 compared to C3H8. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","NOx storage and reduction; Propane; Propylene; Rapid pulsing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031429467

To address this problem, an online tool condition monitoring (TCM) system plays a significant role in metal cutting field. To reveal the relationship between the mill signal features and the wear degradation behavior of milling tool and improve the accuracy of tool wear recognition, this paper presents a methodology to identify tool wear states online based on AR Bispectrum, Chaotic Characteristics and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), using cast iron material and steel J45 material high-speed milling as a case study. The acoustic emission and vibration acceleration signals were collected continuously during the tool's whole life-cycle time. The extracted features associate with AR bi-spectrum coefficients, fractal box dimensions (FBD) and Largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) are given as an input to the HMM classification model to identify the wear state of milling tool. Experimental results are shown that the nonlinear features are superior to conventional statistical features in term of recognition accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.","AR bi-spectrum; Chaotic characteristics; Hidden Markov model; Milling tool wear","Acoustic emission testing; Cast iron; Condition monitoring; Hidden Markov models; Life cycle; Lyapunov methods; Markov processes; Metal cutting; Milling (machining); Nonlinear analysis; Pattern recognition; Wear of materials; Bispectrum; Chaotic characteristics; Classification models; Degradation behavior; Largest Lyapunov exponent; Milling tools; Quality of machined surface; Vibration acceleration; Cutting tools",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035773055

Though some full-chain CCUS pilot projects have operated in China, many barriers exist when stepping up to commercial applications, including significant negative perceptions of the environmental risk of CCUS. Therefore, to tailor constructive training or outreach programs for public acceptance of CCUS in China, a large national survey of public perceptions of CCUS technology was conducted in 2013. The questionnaire contained four themes focusing on people with a tertiary education. Six hundred paper–pencil questionnaires were dispatched to 22 universities/enterprises across 19 provinces and 2 municipalities, with a response rate of 95%. The results show that 91.4% of the participants agreed that the earth was experiencing climate change, and 74.3% were interested in low-carbon technologies, but while 22% had heard of CCUS, although with limited knowledge, only 3.6% had a good understanding of the technology. The results from the second part of the questionnaire show that 80.4% of participants believed that CCUS may help to mitigate the impacts of global warming, but the “Not in My Back Yard” (NIMBY) phenomenon was obvious from the location-based objections to transportation and storage processes. In addition, ten listed CCUS environmental management policies received extensive recognition from the participants, and about half of the participants considered that the related government departments should be responsible for environmental management as a first priority. The survey also indicates that the most trusted sources through which the survey participants obtain CCUS information are academic journals and textbooks, television, radio and newspapers, expert lectures and brochures on CCUS demonstration projects. According to the survey of public awareness of the environmental impact and management of CCUS technology in China, CCUS technology rates well for environmental benefits, but high environmental risk perceptions of CCUS lead to a lower acceptance of this carbon emissions reduction technology. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage (CCUS); Climate change; Environmental management; Low-carbon technology; Public perception","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Earth (planet); Emission control; Environmental management; Global warming; Risk perception; Storage management; Surveys; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon emissions reductions; Commercial applications; Environmental benefits; Environmental risk perceptions; Government departments; Low-carbon technologies; Public perception; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021809788

However, the carbon dioxide emissions obtained by the instruments are unreliable due to time delay error. In order to improve the reliability of data, we propose a method to correct the measured vehicles' carbon dioxide emissions from instrument based on the CMEM model. Firstly, the synthetic time series of carbon dioxide emissions are simulated by CMEM model and GPS velocity data. Then, taking the simulation data as the control group, the time delay error of the measured carbon dioxide emissions can be estimated by the asynchronous correlation analysis, and the outliers can be automatically identified and corrected using the principle of DTW algorithm. Taking the taxi trajectory data of Wuhan as an example, the results show that (1) the correlation coefficient between the measured data and the control group data can be improved from 0.52 to 0.59 by mitigating the systematic time delay error. Furthermore, by adjusting the outliers which account for 4.73% of the total data, the correlation coefficient can raise to 0.63, which suggests strong correlation. The construction of low carbon traffic has become the focus of the local government. In order to respond to the slogan of energy saving and emission reduction, the distribution of carbon emissions from motor vehicle exhaust emission was studied. So our corrected data can be used to make further air quality analysis. © Authors 2017.

The dynamic spatial regression results show that industrial structure rationalization, industrial structural transformation and industrial structural upgrading significantly reduced carbon emissions. Industrial structural transformation provided the greatest contribution to carbon emissions. Technological progress was also conducive to reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, efficiency improvements and technological innovation reduced carbon emissions, and efficiency improvements played a relatively greater role.

A multitude of literatures mainly focused on single technological impact on environmental issues at national level, while comprehensive studies concerning technological factors at regional level are rare. This paper employs environmental learning curve model to investigate the learning effects of different technological channels on CO2 emissions at the national and regional levels using panel data of China’s 29 provinces from 1997 to 2014. The technological advancement is disaggregated into indigenous research and development (R&amp;D), foreign technology import and technological revolution. Furthermore, to comprehend the characteristics of various provinces with regard to CO2 emissions and emission efficiency, China’s 29 provinces are divided into four regions according to the features of “CO2 emissions-efficiency”. Empirically results manifest that technical renovation is the paramount driver to mitigate the national CO2 emissions. The CO2 learning abilities of indigenous R&amp;D in high emissions regions are greater than those in the low ones, while boosting the investment of foreign technology import in low emission regions has significantly positive impacts on CO2 emissions, and the technical renovation is effective in abating CO2 emissions in all regions.

Here, the gene expression profiles of pig liver under both conditions were investigated and changes in hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) levels under different diet conditions were determined. In this study, both fasting and HFD conditions significantly increased hepatic TG levels and serum levels of cholesterol, TG, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein B. Transcriptome sequencing analysis identified 580 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the fasting group and the control group (F/C group) and 613 between the HFD group and the control group (H/C group). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis found that the DEGs of the F/C group were mainly enriched in the synthesis pathways of fatty acids (FAs) with less than 16 carbons, while the DEGs of the H/C group were mainly enriched in the synthesis pathways of FAs with more than 16 carbons. In order to verify whether changes in the expression levels of the DEGs caused changes in FA metabolism, the composition and saturation of the FAs in liver TG were analyzed, which showed that under fasting conditions, the contents of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FAs had increased, while the proportion of saturated FAs had decreased.

This study was the first initiative to develop a complete and transparent GHG inventory of Beijing, to document the current situation and to help governmental officials to clarify their priorities for reducing GHG emissions. The authors investigated and calculated the emission sources defined by the GPC, and assessed data accuracy. The contents of the detailed inventory were documented and are open for research verification and for methodological references for other cities. The results showed that three emission sources, i.e. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from industrial production and CH4 emissions from landfills, contributed 97% of Beijing's GHGs. Considering the problem of missing data and low data quality, the authors suggested that instead of seeking to compile a complete inventory, Chinese cities should first report their GHG emissions from these sources, while improving the data quality for the long run. The authors anticipate that the findings reported in this paper will help to strengthen city-level GHG inventory research in China and throughout the world. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; China; City-level greenhouse gas inventory; Climate change; GHG emissions","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Beijing; China; Current situation; Emission sources; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas inventory; Industrial production; Scientific basis; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021194980

Methods: This research uses a multiple-case-study approach to examine several existing freight apps in the Chinese market. The study was conducted using multiple data collection techniques, including interviews, production observation, firsthand experience, and online-search summaries. Results: Inspired by a full analysis of case studies, a hierarchical conceptual framework was developed to provide an overarching view of how existing apps achieve environmental benefits, which deepens our understanding of the interrelationship between freight Apps utilization and CO2 reduction. Freight apps provide a mechanism that auto-match the consignor’s demand and the carrier’s supply based on mobile Internet. The efficient way to find the right truck and complete the delivery process enhances the decrease of truck’s empty travel distances and improvement of average vehicle loaded, then leading to an improvement of efficiency and a decline in carbon emission in freight industry. And then the identification of returning pick-up and route planning was conducted to further improve apps for CO2 reduction. Conclusions: The influences to freight movement system by apps focused on reconstructing the demand and supply with integration technology, and resulted in a more efficient transaction using matching technology and advanced fleet management with optimization technology. When with inter-urban Full Truck Load, freight apps enable carriers to search for demand for returning a pick-up with decreasing empty running mileages, which then has environmental benefits through reducing CO2 emissions. However, when in urban Less-than-Truck Load, by strengthening the average vehicle utilization on laden trips, another determinant of route planning of delivery &amp; collection reduced CO2 emissions. In order to further promote development of apps, in inter-urban Full Truck Load of long-distance transport, sufficient number of users and suitable matching conditions ensured carriers schedule an order to guarantee the return pick-up at an appointed time or grab several orders to achieve a larger non-empty return trip. In this “always-laden” transport plan, consideration should be given to the carriers’ search and waiting costs before starting the next freight service. Meanwhile, route planning of delivery &amp; collection based on real-time traffic information in Less-than-Truck Load required sharing high-level of data, complicated-adaptable models and the efficient computing power. These valuable aspects would be a great challenge for follow-up development of freight apps in aiding CO2 emission reduction. © 2017, The Author(s).","CO2 reduction; Evaluation framework; Freight app; Further improvement; Road freight transport","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Fleet operations; Pickups; Roads and streets; Strain measurement; Transportation; Truck transportation; Trucks; Urban transportation; Environmental benefits; Evaluation framework; Further improvement; Integration technologies; Long-distance transport; Optimization technology; Real-time traffic information; Road freight transport; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021687381

This paper aims to analyze the spatial distribution of the carbon cycle of the mono-centric cities, based on the von Thünen concentric ring theory, using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) model and an atmospheric diffusion model to assess the carbon sequestration capacity of land cover/use, to estimate carbon emissions, discuss influencing factors that determine changing trends in carbon sequestration capacity and to predict the changing law of the carbon sequestration eco-service spatial pattern based on scenario simulations. The results of this study show: (1) In Guang'an, the spatial distribution of the carbon cycle follows a concentric ring pattern. From the concentric ring pattern center, the first annular zone represents the carbon emissions, which lie at the concentric ring center; the second annular zone represents the carbon sequestration service; and the third annular zone represents stable carbon stock; (2) The structure of the concentric ring has not changed, but the spatial distribution of carbon sequestration and carbon density has changed due to fossil energy consumption and land cover/use change. From 2014 to 2016, the carbon emission zone shrunk, while the carbon sequestration service zone expanded and the carbon density increased-the increase of forest land is the main factor in the increase of carbon density; (3) The current carbon sequestration eco-service in Guang'an is not the best development condition. The planning of urban eco-service spatial patterns and land cover/use should consider the protection of cultivated and ecological areas at the same time. The results of this study can help the government implement spatial planning and regional policy interventions for land cover/use and eco-service. © 2017 by the authors.

The upper-level problem determines the traffic signal settings to minimize the drivers' average travel time, while the lower-level problem aims for achieving the network equilibrium using the settings calculated at the upper level. Genetic algorithm is employed with the integration of microscopic-traffic-simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) to decouple the complex bi-level problem into tractable single-level problems, which are solved sequentially. Case studies on a synthetic traffic network and a real-world traffic subnetwork are conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed model and relevant solution methods.

However, information regarding the incorporation of plant-C by the bacterial community in the rhizosphere is limited, particularly in soybean. Soybean plants were grown in rhizo-boxes containing low- or high-organic C (Corg) Mollisols and labelled with 13CO2 at the flowering stage. After soil DNA was extracted from the rhizosphere, 13C-DNA was separated from 12C-DNA using the stable isotope probing method, followed by pyrosequencing analysis. Between soils, significant differences in the abundance of genera incorporating 13C in the rhizosphere were observed, with Aquincola, Dechloromonas, Massilia, Amycolatopsis, Delftia, Magnetospirillum, Psychrobacter, Ochrobactrum, Pseudoxanthomonas and Niastella showing greater relative abundances in low-Corg soil (p &lt; 0.05) compared to high-Corg soil. However, the opposite trend was observed for Enhydrobacter, Flavisolibacter, Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus. Correspondingly, the number of operational taxonomic units in each genus varied between soils. Soil type greatly affected the flow of plant-C into rhizospheric bacterial community. The plant-C metabolizing bacteria may contribute to the transformation of rhizodeposits in the soil and soil C sequestration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","13CO2 labelling; Bacterial community; Organic carbon; Plant-derived carbon; Rhizo-box; Stable isotope probing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026366203

Extreme precipitation risk assessments are of great significance in China and allow for the response to climate change and mitigation of risks to the population. China is one of the countries most influenced by climate change and has unique national population conditions. The influence of extreme precipitation depends on the degree of exposure and vulnerability of the population. Accurate assessments of the population exposed to rising rainstorm trends are crucial to mapping extreme precipitation risks. Studying the population exposed to rainstorm hazard areas (RSHA) at the microscale is extremely urgent, due to the local characteristics of extreme precipitation events and regional diversity of the population. The spatial distribution of population density was mapped based on the national population census data from China in 1990, 2000 and 2010. RSHA were also identified using precipitation data from 1975–2015 in China, and the rainstorm tendency values were mapped using GIS in this paper. The spatial characteristics of the rainstorm tendencies were then analyzed. Finally, changes in the population in the RSHA are discussed. The results show that the extreme precipitation trends are increasing in southeastern China. From 1990 to 2010, the population in RSHA increased by 110 million, at a rate of 14.6%. The elderly in the region increased by 38 million at a rate of 86.4%. Studying the size of the population exposed to rainstorm hazards at the county scale can provide scientific evidence for developing disaster prevention and mitigation strategies from the bottom up. © 2017 by the authors.

These supply chains are increasingly exposed to the impacts of a changing climate, yet receive little attention relative to the study of the production phase. Too often, business learns from experience if and how their supply chains can withstand and recover from climate shocks with little insight on proactively developing climate resilient supply chains. We use a network-based simulation approach to estimate the resilience of supply chains, particularly to disruption experienced during climate-related extreme events. We consider supply chain examples from three Australian resource industries – fisheries, agriculture and mining – that have experienced climate shocks in recent years. We derive four supply chain indices – evenness, resilience, continuity of supply and climate resilience – to estimate the performance of simple and complex supply chains in each industry. As with ecological systems, we show that complex supply chains with a large number of nodes and links are more resilient to disruption. Critically, all chains, regardless of their complexity, will have diminished resilience as climate disruptions become more frequent. This highlights the importance of considering the broader economic benefits of diversified chains, leading to risk reduction and improved design post-disruption. It also reinforces the importance of a systems approach to risk management in supply chains, particularly in considering adaptation options for addressing direct and indirect impacts on the chain as well as the global challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate adaptation; Climate change; Disruption; Network modelling; Resilience; Supply chain","adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem resilience; extreme event; global change; global climate; global perspective; network analysis; supply chain management; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030872691

Moreover, the manufacturing industry is the biggest contributor to CO2 emissions. Most of the existing studies use the average estimation method to investigate the main drivers of CO2 emissions in this industry. However, the data distribution of economic variables is often not normal distribution, and the tail of the data hidden important information. In order to provide a realistic basis for emission reduction in this industry, this paper applies the quantile regression approach to investigate the driving forces of CO2 emissions under high, medium and low emission levels. The empirical results indicate that the effect of economic growth on CO2 emissions in the upper 90th and 75th–90th quantile provinces are higher than those in the other quantile provinces. The influence of energy intensity in the 25th–50th quantile provinces is lower than those in the other percentile provinces. The impact of urbanization in the upper 90th quantile provinces is the strongest in all the quantile provinces. However, the influence intensity of energy structure in the lower 10th quantile provinces is the highest in all the quantile provinces. Therefore, policymakers should focus on the heterogeneous effects of driving forces on CO2 emissions in different quantiles during the process of CO2 emission reduction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Manufacturing industry; Quantile regression approach","Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Manufacture; Normal distribution; Regression analysis; Urban growth; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emission reduction; Economic variables; Emission reduction; Estimation methods; Heterogeneous effects; Manufacturing industries; Quantile regression; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027529176

This has made carbon reduction a global concern. Previous studies have provided a limited understanding of carbon budgets because they have used top-down data on a single spatial or temporal scale. In this study, urban spatial and statistical data for metropolitan Tainan in southwestern Taiwan are used to explore inside and outside of the CO2 system of the city and estimate the amount of CO2 emissions from road traffic, the use of electricity and gas in buildings, and the amount of CO2 absorbed by green spaces and water bodies within the system. Innovative annual and monthly carbon budget maps composed of 200 × 200-m grids are developed for the city through a geographic information system (GIS). An analysis of the highly detailed maps yields the following findings: First, CO2 emissions are concentrated in over-urbanized areas, where the population density is higher than 5000 people/km2. Buildings account for the majority of carbon dioxide emissions (54%) and produced 11% more carbon dioxide in summer than in winter (owing to air-conditioning usage). Second, road traffic is the main source of CO2 emissions for under-urbanized areas (87%), and emissions from this source exhibit insignificant seasonal variation. On the basis of these findings, the carbon budgets of four different over-urbanized areas are formulated and presented on 50 × 50-m grids. The results suggest that green spaces in these areas absorb limited amounts of carbon dioxide. Therefore, this study assesses the annual and monthly carbon-reduction potential of rooftops equipped with solar panels occupying 30% of their area. The annual carbon-reduction potential for the four areas was 4.5–31.1 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1, and the solar energy replacement rate is higher in winter than in summer. In summary, this study presents carbon budgets in high-resolution grids, quantifies the carbon-reduction potential of rooftops with solar panels, and proposes a reduction strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from urban activities to improve the sustainability of urban areas and their environs and inform urban planning and climate change adaptation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 absorption; CO2 emissions; Geographic information system; Photovoltaics; Solar potential; Urban CO2 system","Air conditioning; Budget control; Climate change; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Information systems; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Urban planning; CO2 absorption; CO2 emissions; Photovoltaics; Solar potential; Urban CO2 system; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028322748

First, the gridding approach was used to generate a standardized process for constructing a thermal stress map of the study area. Second, basic layers, including population density, land-use zoning, building total floor area, and land cover type, were collected. Third, development layers, including the sky view factor and impervious surface ratio, were established. Fourth, mobile and fixed-point meteorological measurements were obtained twice a month in 2013–2014. The measurement results and layer information were integrated to establish the thermal stress estimation equation through multiple regression analysis. Finally, the long-term climate data of Taichung City were imported into the estimation equation to determine the thermal stress risk and thermal stress potential through the application of a physiologically equivalent temperature.

However, this is not always the case in rice paddy soil, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To evaluate how biochar amendment affects N2O production and emissions in paddy soil, an incubation experiment was designed including six treatments: wheat straw-derived biochar (slow pyrolyzed at 400 °C) amendment at rates of 0% (Control), 1% and 4% soil mass (w/w), inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer amendment (with urea), and N fertilizer plus 1% biochar and 4% biochar. The application of 4% biochar significantly increased N2O emissions from N-unfertilized and fertilized soils during the 45-day incubation, by 291% and 256%, respectively, while 1% biochar amendment significantly increased soil N2O emissions when accompanied by N fertilizer addition. On day 14, when the N2O emission peaks occurred, N2O flux was significantly correlated with soil pH in all treatments. Biochar addition also enhanced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA genes, which was significantly related to soil pH. Among all detected N2O-forming and reducing microbial genes, the abundance of AOB amoA genes was most closely related to N2O flux. On biochar addition, the AOB community structure shifted from Nitrosospira-dominated toward Nitrosomonas, and the diversity of AOB was significantly increased. Compared with the control, biochar amendment decreased, albeit not significantly, the abundance of the nitrous oxide reductase encoding gene nosZ, but did not alter the abundance of nitrite reductase encoding genes nirK and nirS. Our study suggests that wheat straw-derived biochar amendment of paddy soils increased soil pH, which in turn increased the abundance and diversity of AOB and N2O emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","amoA genes; Biochar; Nitrous oxide; Rice paddy soil; Soil pH","Ammonia; Bacteria; Encoding (symbols); Gene encoding; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Signal encoding; Straw; Urea; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Bio chars; Biochar amendments; Community structures; Inorganic nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Rice paddy; Soil pH; Soils; agricultural soil; bacterium; charcoal; community structure; fertilizer application; gene; inorganic nitrogen; microbial community; nitrous oxide; paddy field; pH; soil amendment; soil emission; soil microorganism; straw; wheat; Nitrosomonadales; Nitrosomonas; Nitrosospira; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020287907

The climatic and environmental variations during the last deglaciation in Lake Zabuye area as inferred from the characteristics of the n-alkanes can be classified into three periods. During the early part of the last deglaciation (23.1–15.6 ka BP), the climate changed from cold-moist to cold-dry condition, algae, bacteria and aquatic plants was prosperous, proportion of herbaceous plants was higher than the woody plants; during Bølling/Allerød period (15.6–12.5 ka BP), all proxies implied warm climatic conditions, woody plants were gradually prosperous; and the Younger Dryas (12.5–11.8 Ka BP) was characterized by cold and wet climate, with algae and bacteria dropped, submerged and floating plants flourished, proportion of woody plants was higher than the herbaceous plants.

Box 243, Reading, RG6 6BB, United Kingdom","The heliospheric magnetic field is of pivotal importance in solar and space physics. The field is rooted in the Sun's photosphere, where it has been observed for many years. Global maps of the solar magnetic field based on full-disk magnetograms are commonly used as boundary conditions for coronal and solar wind models. Two primary observational constraints on the models are (1) the open field regions in the model should approximately correspond to coronal holes (CHs) observed in emission and (2) the magnitude of the open magnetic flux in the model should match that inferred from in situ spacecraft measurements. In this study, we calculate both magnetohydrodynamic and potential field source surface solutions using 14 different magnetic maps produced from five different types of observatory magnetograms, for the time period surrounding 2010 July. We have found that for all of the model/map combinations, models that have CH areas close to observations underestimate the interplanetary magnetic flux, or, conversely, for models to match the interplanetary flux, the modeled open field regions are larger than CHs observed in EUV emission. In an alternative approach, we estimate the open magnetic flux entirely from solar observations by combining automatically detected CHs for Carrington rotation 2098 with observatory synoptic magnetic maps. This approach also underestimates the interplanetary magnetic flux. Our results imply that either typical observatory maps underestimate the Sun's magnetic flux, or a significant portion of the open magnetic flux is not rooted in regions that are obviously dark in EUV and X-ray emission. © 2017.

In the United States, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for motor vehicles were significantly raised in 2012 for the first time in almost three decades. The standards now call for an average across manufacturers of 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) for new passenger cars by 2025, or 163 grams per mile (gmi) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and of 47 mpg (196gmi) by 2021. The light truck standards, which include minivans and sport utility vehicles, call for fuel economy levels of 31 mpg (287 g/mi) in 2021 and of 40 mpg (222 g/mi) in 2025. Given approximately equal expected splits between car and light truck sales, these estimates imply combined car and light truck fleet averages of ∼40 to 41 mpg (217 to 222 g/mi) in 2021 and 50 mpg (178 g/mi) in 2025. However, because automakers have strategies to reduce GHGs in parallel with fuel economy, the actual in-use fuel economy of the fleet is expected to be somewhat lower. In this review, several automobile technology advances are described and assessed for providing relatively cost-effective solutions to meet CAFE standards for fuel economy and GHG reductions through 2025. The key points this review makes are that (a) loopholes in the current regulations will allow automakers to meet CAFE program goals with relatively minor incremental improvements to current technologies through 2025 and that (b) going beyond the current program, past 2025 to higher fuel economy levels and lower GHG emissions approaching 100 g/mi, is likely to involve heavier use of newer technologies especially including drivetrain electrification. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

Literatures have highlighted the importance of optimization targets, restrictions and logistics design on the performance of bioenergy systems and regional bioenergy planning. This paper optimizes straw power plant layouts (both in terms of location and scale) in Jiangsu Province to minimize the logistics costs while meeting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals. Results show that the logistics mode has important effects on the optimal scale and logistics costs but a minimal influence on the site selection, based on the comparison of two typical logistics modes in the study area, namely, the RPM and the SCM. In the RPM, the optimal logistics cost is 14.38 USD/Mg, which is 49.6% greater than that in the SCM. Moreover, the optimal location and production scale at each site are very sensitive to changes in GHG emissions reduction goals. Changes in GHG emissions reduction goals can significantly affect the logistics costs and straw supply, which may increase the operation risk of straw power generation plants. We suggest that the logistics mode and the GHG emissions reduction goals should be carefully designed when constructing new bioenergy plants, and technological innovation with respect to harvest and compression machinery before transportation should be promoted to improve economic performance and reduce GHG emissions throughout the entire system without changing the locations of existing plants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; GHG emissions reduction; GIS-based optimization; Logistics mode","Cost reduction; Costs; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Geographic information systems; Location; Machinery; Site selection; Bio-energy; Bioenergy managements; GHG emission; Gis-based; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Logistics modes; Power generation plants; Technological innovation; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025433434

We use the LCEA model to examine impacts of a pure carbon tax and a revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from cellulosic ethanol using forest residues as feedstock in Washington State. In a model allowing for input substitution in the cellulosic ethanol feedstock, conversion, and transportation process, we consider energy source substitution (woody biomass for coal in the cellulosic ethanol conversion plant and biodiesel for diesel in feedstock production and feedstock and ethanol transportation) as well as substitution of capital and labor for energy in all stages of the lifecycle. We find that ignoring endogenous input substitution by using standard LCA leads to substantial underestimation of the impact of carbon tax policies on carbon emissions. Both tax policies can substantially reduce carbon emissions by inducing substitution among inputs. The revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy reduces emissions more effectively than the carbon tax policy for carbon tax rates currently in place throughout most of the world. It stimulates substitution of woody biomass for coal and biodiesel for diesel at much lower tax rates when accompanied by corresponding subsidies for reduced emissions from renewable sources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon tax; Carbon-emission reduction; Input substitution; Lifecycle analysis; Revenue-neutral carbon tax; Tax policy","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Cellulosic ethanol; Coal transportation; Emission control; Energy policy; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Taxation; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon taxes; Input substitution; Life cycle analysis; Tax policies; Economic analysis; assessment method; biofuel; carbon emission; economic analysis; emission control; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; pollution tax; subsidy system; substitution; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028695529

We took the China Resources Snow Breweries (CRSB) NG DG project in Sichuan province of China as a base scenario and compared its life cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions performance against five further scenarios. We found the CRSB DG project (all energy input is NG) can reduce GHG emissions by 22%, but increase energy consumption by 12% relative to the scenario, using coal combined with grid electricity as an energy input. The LCA also indicated that the CRSB project can save 24% of energy and reduce GHG emissions by 48% relative to the all-coal scenario. The studied NG-based DG project presents major GHG emissions reduction advantages over the traditional centralized energy system. Moreover, this reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions can be expanded if the extra electricity from the DG project can be supplied to the public grid. The action of combining renewable energy into the NG DG system can also strengthen the dual merit of energy conservation and GHG emissions reduction. The marginal CO2 abatement cost of the studied project is about 51 USD/ton CO2 equivalent, which is relatively low. Policymakers are recommended to support NG DG technology development and application in China and globally to boost NG utilization and control GHG emissions. © 2017 by the authors.

Although government invests a large amount of capital into park management, parks are still underused in many cases. In this study, the association and relative importance of socio-demographic, environmental, and individual factors were investigated with regards to their impact on citizens’ park visitation. Data was collected through cross-sectional door-to-door questionnaires and online databases, and was analyzed using a hierarchical regression model. Results showed that physical exercise (27.4% of collected reports) and rest and relaxation (26.7%) were the two most widespread reasons for park use. When asked about constraints of park visitation, time limitations were reported as being the most constraining factor. However, our quantitative analysis found no significant correlation. Socio-demographic, environmental, and individual variables explained 1%, 20% and 26% (adjusted R2) of the total variance in frequency of park visitation between participants, respectively. A citizen's neighborhood greenspace, housing price, and distance from the nearest park were negatively correlated with park use. Among individual factors, a participant's reported affinity for park visits, time spent in their residential greenspace, and number of children under seven were positively correlated with park visitation, with a decreasingβcoefficient. This research highlights the predominant contribution of attitude over accessibility factors when it comes to park visitation. Furthermore, the data indicates that accessibility factors function differently for frequent, infrequent, and moderate park users and provision with parks within 1000 m of their home is recommended.

Kinmen is an archipelago of several islands of approximately 150 km2 in area located off the southeast coast of mainland China. Kinmen does not have an abundance of natural resources, and therefore, its development is restricted by the ecological environment and reflected in cultural fragility. After the end of military administration in 1992, Kinmen transformed into a famous tourist attraction. The rapid development of tourism has attracted a large number of tourists, but also worsens the long-standing scarcity of freshwater resources. As Kinmen is currently aiming to move toward becoming a low-carbon demonstration island, installation of a water reclamation system with a low carbon consumption would be the best choice for the islands. A wastewater reclamation system that considers local conditions and uses local materials to reduce the carbon footprint was therefore proposed in this study. To reduce the carbon footprint, the system uses local agricultural waste, including sorghum stalks and oyster shells, as filter media to construct a water purification system that can purify domestic wastewater by reclamation. The results demonstrated that the reductions in suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand and NH4-N using this system reached 95.3, 97.0 and 99.3%, respectively, achieving the standards required for tertiary wastewater treatment. In addition, oyster shells after burning absorbed around 50% of the phosphorus in wastewater.

The spatial autocorrelation tests show that there is significant spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity in urban energy efficiency. Although dynamic spatial econometric results show that industrial agglomeration can promote an increase in energy efficiency from a country level, there are significant differences at a regional level.

Finally, based on the research, this paper puts forward concrete suggestions to enhance energy efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic spatial panel; Energy efficiency; Industrial agglomeration","Autocorrelation; Emission control; Industrial emissions; Dynamic spatial; Emissions reduction; Regional levels; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial heterogeneity; Statistical datas; Threshold effect; Western area; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027511566

Because of the closer interregional economic connections that have formed, in this study we focus on the virtual flows of pollutants embodied in interprovincial trade. We compared two methods, embodied emissions in bilateral trade (EEBT) and the multiregional input–output (MRIO) model, to determine emission flows for 2002 and 2007 and found that the results between these two approaches differed significantly, particularly for the year 2007. This indicates that the choice of the accounting method has obvious impacts on subsequent decisions. Further analysis based on the MRIO method, which captures the complete interregional supply chains and is more applicable to consumption-based studies, showed that the embodied SO2 emissions in interprovincial trade accounted for 27.58% of the total SO2 emissions in China in 2002 and 35.25% in 2007. Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Guizhou were the major embodied emission-exporting regions, with sources mainly from the electricity, nonmetal mineral production, chemicals, and metal smelting sectors. The exported emissions mainly ended up in rich provinces, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangdong, due to those provinces' final demands for products of the construction, food production, and transport equipment manufacturing sectors. Furthermore, rich provinces were net importers in interprovincial trade, with a pollution terms of trade value less than one. The results yield important implications for China's air pollution controls: emission reduction tasks should be reasonably distributed among provinces to prevent developed provinces from outsourcing more pollution emissions to less developed provinces through interprovincial trade; regulation of consumption in developed provinces would help to control national pollution; financial and technical support for pollution control should favor the less developed regions. © 2017","China; Embodied emission; Interprovincial trade; MRIO; Multiregional input–output","Air pollution; Commerce; Construction equipment; Emission control; Pollution; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Supply chains; Atmospheric diffusion; China; Embodied emissions; Less-developed regions; MRIO; Pollution emissions; Regional air pollution; Transport equipment; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025470549

However, carbon emission abatement cannot be done while ignoring the impact on economic growth. A delicate balance needs to be achieved between the two to find an appropriate pathway for sustainable development. This paper applies a multi-objective optimization approach to analyze the impact of levying carbon tax on the energy-intensive sectors of Guangdong province in China under the constraint of emission reduction target. This approach allows us to evaluate carbon emission minimization while maximizing GDP. For policy analysis, we construct five scenarios for evaluation and optimal choice. The results of the analysis show that a lower initial carbon tax rate is not necessarily better, and that a carbon tax is an effective means to reduce CO2 emissions while maintaining a certain level of GDP growth. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbon tax; CO2 emission; Industrial sector; Multi-objective optimization","abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; industrial emission; optimization; pollution tax; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023752362

Using this classification system, three typical pollution events were selected for numerical simulations using the WRF-Chem model. The source sensitivity method for anthropogenic emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors was applied to identify the source-receptor relationships for PM2.5 among 9 cities in PRD. For “Western type” case, the PRD region was under control of a high-pressure system with easterly prevailing winds. The PM2.5 concentrations in the western PRD region were higher than those in the eastern region, with emissions from cities in the eastern PRD region having higher contributions. Within the PRD's urban cluster, PM2.5 in Huizhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen was mainly derived from local emissions, whereas the PM2.5 in the other cities was primarily derived from external transport. For “Eastern type” case, the PRD was influenced by Typhoon Soulik with westerly prevailing winds. Emissions from cities in the western PRD region had the highest impacts on the overall PM2.5 concentration. PM2.5 in Jiangmen and Foshan was primarily derived from local emissions. Regarding “Central type” case, the PRD region was under control of a uniform pressure field with low wind speed. PM2.5 concentrations of each city were primarily caused by local emissions. Overall, wind flows played a significant role in the transport and spatial distribution of PM2.5 across the PRD region.

To identify the GHG emissions from waste management in China, the characteristics of MSW and the current and future treatment management strategies, five typical management scenarios were modeled by EaseTech software following the principles of life cycle inventory and analyzed based on the carbon and energy flows. Due to the high organic fraction (50–70%) and moisture content (&gt;50%) of Chinese municipal solid waste (MSW), the net GHG emissions in waste management had a significant difference from the developed countries. It was found that the poor landfill gas (LFG) collection efficiency and low carbon storage resulted landfilling with flaring and landfilling with biogas recovery scenarios were the largest GHG emissions (192 and 117 kgCO2-Eq/t, respectively). In contrast, incineration had the best energy recovery rate (19%), and, by grid emissions substitution, led to a substantial decrease in net GHG emissions (−124 kgCO2-Eq/t). Due to the high energy consumption in operation, the unavoidable leakage of CH4 and N2O in treatment, and the further release of CH4 in disposing of the digested residue or composted product, the scenarios with biological treatment of the organic fractions after sorting, such as composting or anaerobic digestion (AD), did not lead to the outstanding GHG reductions (emissions of 32 and −36 kgCO2-Eq/t, respectively) as expected. © 2017","Carbon flow; Energy flow; Greenhouse gas (GHG); life cycle assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW)","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Waste management; Waste treatment; Carbon flow; Energy flow; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste; biogas; carbon; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon; carbon emission; emission control; energy flow; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; waste management; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; carbon storage; China; composting; energy consumption; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; priority journal; solid waste management; gas; greenhouse effect; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; China; Carbon; China; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020887171

In this paper, we establish a theoretical model to illuminate the potential effects of the scale and agglomeration of pig production on the pollutant treatment rate and propose four theoretical hypotheses. Furthermore, we use survey data collected from Jiaxing city – the largest pig supply base in China's Yangtze River Delta region – and employ both linear and nonlinear models to empirically test the theoretical hypotheses. The results show that the rate of faeces applied to the fields as manure decreases with the scale of pig production, while the rate of other harmless modes of pollutant treatment increases with the scale of production, resulting in a U-shaped relationship between the pollutant treatment rate and the scale of pig production. In addition, the total pollutant treatment rate increases with the agglomeration of pig production. We suggest that effective environmental regulation of pig production should differentiate between the types of pollution emissions generated by pig producers; according to their scale of production, pig producers should be classified as point or nonpoint sources of pollution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agglomeration; Environmental regulation; Nonlinear model; Pollutant treatment; Scale of pig production","agglomeration; agricultural emission; agricultural production; emission control; environmental legislation; feces; legislative implementation; livestock farming; local government; manure; nonlinearity; numerical model; pig; pollutant removal; pollutant source; pollution policy; surveying; China; Jiaxing; Yangtze Delta; Zhejiang; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018770039

However, comprehensive knowledge of the geochemistry of V in coals is lacking. In this study, abundances, distribution and modes of occurrence of V are reviewed by compiling >2900 reported Chinese coal samples. With coal reserves in individual provinces as the weighting factors, V in Chinese coals is estimated to have an average abundance of 35.81 μg/g. Large variation of V concentration is observed in Chinese coals of different regions, coal-forming periods, and maturation ranks. According to the concentration coefficient of V in coals from individual provinces, three regions are divided across Chinese coal deposits. Vanadium in Chinese coals is probably influenced by sediment source and sedimentary environment, supplemented by late-stage hydrothermal fluids. Specifically, hydrothermal fluids have relatively more significant effect on the enrichment of V in local coal seams. Vanadium in coals is commonly associated with aluminosilicate minerals and organic matter, and the modes of V occurrence in coal depend on coal-forming environment and coal rank. The Chinese V emission inventory during coal combustion is estimated to be 4906 mt in 2014, accounting for 50.55 % of global emission.

Different development scenarios were established, including BAU (scenario with business as usual) and API (scenario with additional policy interventions). We simulated annual GHG emissions under different scenarios for the EU, US, China, and India from 2016 to 2060, and evaluated the impacts of emission changes on their mitigation pledges (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, INDCs). Two main conclusions were obtained. (1) In API, EU's emissions fell from 4160 to 2340 MtCO2e/year and would probably achieve its INDC pledge. Though US's emissions fell from 6330 to 4020 MtCO2e/year, it still had a deficit of 370 MtCO2e in 2025. If the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is abandoned, US's emissions would remain above 6000 MtCO2e/year. (2) In BAU, China's emissions peaked in 2044 while India's emissions were already close to the strict INDC target. In API, China and India both achieved a reduction of about 2000 MtCO2e exceeding their INDC targets in 2030. Chinese emissions peaked in 2030, but Indian emissions grew until 2060. This study also indicates that developed countries should play a more important role in future mitigation efforts. © 2017 by the authors.","Energy structure; GHG emission; INDCs; Low-carbon planning","carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; environmental policy; estimation method; European Union; greenhouse gas; China; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029022713

The emission factors were repeatedly measured on a chassis dynamometer bench using Artemis Urban with cold and hot start, Road and Motorway, WLTC and NEDC driving conditions. The influence of driving conditions and approved driving cycles on pollutant emissions was also investigated. The measured emission factors for regulated compounds were compared to the corresponding emission factors of the COPCETE emission model developed by the French Ministry of Ecology. The results indicate that the NEDC cycle, used for type-approval of emissions of regulated compounds, leads to underestimation of CO2 (9–23%) and NOx (1.2 to 2 times) emissions and overestimation of CO and HC (2 to 5 times) in relation to the Artemis cycles, which are real-world simulation driving cycles. The WLTC cycle for the worldwide harmonization of vehicle emissions shows similar HC, NOx and CO emissions with the Artemis average cycle within uncertainty of the measurements. The NOx emissions measured were 1.6 to 8 times greater than the type-approval limits. These high NOx emissions produced by all the diesel vehicles tested under real-world driving conditions could serve as particle precursors and increase secondary organic aerosol formation. They are also indicative of the significant cause for concern regarding urban air quality and the increase in the portion of Euro 5 and 6 diesel vehicles in France's vehicle fleet.

Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that both short-term and long-term exposures to PM2.5 are strongly linked with respiratory diseases. In this study, various types of spatio-temporal data were collected and used to estimate the spatio-temporal variation of PM2.5 exposure in Beijing in 2014. The seasonal and daily variation of the population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) in 2014 was estimated and compared. The results show that the population exposure to ambient air pollution differs significantly in the four seasons, and the exposure levels in winter and spring are notably higher than the other seasons; the exposure level changes greatly from North to South, and each sub-district maintains similarity to neighboring sub-districts. © 2017","GIS; PM2.5; Population exposure; Spatio-temporal variation","Geographic information systems; Ambient air pollution; Epidemiological studies; Long term exposure; Particulate Matter; PM2.5; Population exposure; Spatio-temporal data; Spatio-temporal variation; Air pollution; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; epidemiology; GIS; health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; spatiotemporal analysis; Beijing [China]; China; air pollutant; particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; geographic information system; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033202535

In Wales, recent policy proposals to achieve decarbonisation prescribe greater roles for local and community energy. However, wider citizen engagement and public discourse on comprehensive energy transformations appear somewhat stagnant. The 'stories of Change’ project has sought to catalyse more plural public debates around energy futures. As part of the project, we explored past and present everyday energy relationships with communities in the Valleys of south Wales. At a time of energy transition, and legislative and policy flux, the Valleys afford opportunities to reveal stories about past and present energy experiences and relationships in order to gain enhanced understanding into emerging social meanings of new energy infrastructures and evolving energy landscapes. Here we focus on relationships with ‘old’ energy landscapes; how these and the prevailing socio-economic landscape influence the perceptions and creation of emerging ones; and, how communities are engaged and involved in the making of new energy landscapes.

Organic waste is not only produced from conventional but also urban agricultural practices due recently gained popularity. An alternative to current waste management practices and carbon sequestration opportunity is the production of biochar (thermally converted biomass) from tomato plant residues and use as a soil amendment. To address the real contribution of biochar for greenhouse gas mitigation, it is necessary to assess the whole life cycle from the production of the tomato biomass feedstock to the actual distribution and utilisation of the biochar produced in a regional context. This study is the first step to determine the technical and environmental potential of producing biochar from tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum arawak variety) waste biomass and utilisation as a soil amendment. The study includes the characterisation of tomato plant residue as biochar feedstock (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and metal content); feedstock thermal stability; and the carbon footprint of biochar production under urban agriculture at pilot and small-scale plant, and conventional agriculture at large-scale plant. Tomato plant residue is a potentially suitable biochar feedstock under current European Certification based on its lignin content (19.7%) and low metal concentration. Biomass conversion yields of over 40%, 50% carbon stabilization and low pyrolysis temperature conditions (350–400 °C) would be required for biochar production to sequester carbon under urban pilot scale conditions; while large-scale biochar production from conventional agricultural practices have not the potential to sequestrate carbon because its logistics, which could be improved. Therefore, the diversion of tomato biomass waste residue from incineration or composting to biochar production for use as a soil amendment would environmentally be beneficial, but only if high biochar yields could be produced. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Carbon footprint; Heavy metals; Tomato plant feedstock; Urban agriculture","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Bioconversion; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cellulose; Feedstocks; Fruits; Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Incineration; Lignin; Soils; Waste incineration; Waste management; Agricultural practices; Bio chars; Conventional agricultures; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Pyrolysis temperature; Tomato plants; Urban agricultures; Waste management practices; Life cycle; agricultural practice; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; charcoal; crop production; heavy metal; plant residue; urban agriculture; vegetable; agricultural waste; Article; carbon footprint; differential scanning calorimetry; differential thermal analysis; energy consumption; feasibility study; flow rate; life cycle assessment; methodology; mineralization; plant residue; porosity; priority journal; pyrolysis; thermal conductivity; thermogravimetry; thermostability; tomato; waste management; soil; solid waste; Agriculture; Carbon; Cellulose; Heavy Metals; Hemicelluloses; Lignins; Plants; Lycopersicon esculentum; biochar; charcoal; Carbon Footprint; Charcoal; Lycopersicon esculentum; Soil; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019931145

Many challenges regarding rights, multilayered governance and land tenure remain open in this country where Indigenous Peoples (IPs) occupy 68% of the Ecuadorian Amazon. We focused on the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve to exemplify obstacles and answers found in the last years. In a REDD+ pilot project, six communities of the most widespread ethnicities (Shuar, Kichwa and Colonists) living in the buffer zone of the Yasuní National Park (YNP), were chosen. We used literature research, analysis of international and national agendas, as well as primary data on REDD+ perception obtained through semi-structured household interviews and personal observations. First, we reconstruct the historical development of territorial configuration and present the actual land tenure arrangements. And then, we analyze persistent management conflicts within institutional, planning and normative instruments. Finally we explore legal frameworks with a focus on participation and consultation. Our results show that insecure and overlapping land rights, as well as unclear and contradictory institutional responsibilities are major problems for REDD+ implementation. Despite great advancements that have been made, establishing equitable mechanisms to engage IPs and forest owners and stakeholders across many sectors in REDD+ is required. Especially in Ecuador where oil extraction is a priority and the central government has an exclusive competence over ecosystem services including carbon rights.

However, the transcriptional dynamics that underlie the shift in regulatory programs from nitrogen to carbon limitation is not well studied. In the present study, cells were cultivated at steady state under nitrogen (ammonia)-limited conditions then shifted to carbon (glucose) limitation to monitor changes in transcriptional dynamics. Nitrogen limitation was found to be dominated by sigma 54 (RpoN) and sigma 38 (RpoS), whereas the “housekeeping” sigma factor 70 (RpoD) and sigma 38 regulate cellular status under glucose limitation. During the transition, nitrogen-mediated control was rapidly redeemed and mRNAs that encode active uptake systems, such as ptsG and manXYZ, were quickly amplified. Next, genes encoding facilitators such as lamB were overexpressed, followed by high affinity uptake systems such as mglABC and non-specific porins such as ompF. These regulatory programs are complex and require well-equilibrated and superior control. At the metabolome level, 2-oxoglutarate is the likely component that links carbon- and nitrogen-mediated regulation by interacting with major regulatory elements. In the case of dual glucose and ammonia limitation, sigma 24 (RpoE) appears to play a key role in orchestrating these complex regulatory networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-Oxoglutarate (α-Ketoglutarate); Carbon/nitrogen (double) limitation; Escherichia coli; Gene expression/regulation; Glucose uptake; Sigma 24 (rpoE)","Ammonia; Carbon; Complex networks; Dynamics; Encoding (symbols); Escherichia coli; Gene expression; Glucose; Plants (botany); Proteins; Carbon and nitrogen; Complex regulatory network; Glucose uptake; Ketoglutarate; Nitrogen limitation; Regulatory elements; Sigma 24 (rpoE); Transcriptional control; Nitrogen; 2 oxoglutaric acid; ammonia; glucose; nitrogen; sigma factor; acetic acid derivative; alpha-ketoglutaric acid; DNA directed RNA polymerase; Escherichia coli protein; glucose; nitrogen; RNA polymerase sigma 70; sigma factor; sporulation-specific sigma factors; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bioreactor; controlled study; Escherichia coli; gene overexpression; glucose transport; high performance liquid chromatography; housekeeping gene; lamb gene; limit of detection; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; response time; RNA sequence; steady state; transcription regulation; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Acetates; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Glucose; Ketoglutaric Acids; Nitrogen; Sigma Factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018327220

Consequently, it is very important to quantify and report their Carbon Footprint (CF) for implementing national and international policies/strategies aimed at mitigating and adapting these concerns. The Urban Carbon Footprint (UCF), indeed, has been recognized as the more valuable choice to inform, specifically, decision makers about city environmental sustainability. Several accounting systems and inventory methods have been taken into account to perform UCF, highlighting the complexity of the topic and generating very often confusion among users. In this context, the authors aim to summarize what has been done and what is going on with UCFs, trying to classify them according to some principal dimensions. Thus, they divide UFCs in two main categories namely: “spatial” or “direct”, with a limited amount of data requested, and “economic” or “life cycle based”, more or less data inclusive according to the accounting systems considered. Furthermore, they observe that there is not a “global agreed-upon protocol” yet, neither is there a specific model shared among researchers, even if some steps have been made towards this direction (Relative Carbon Footprint - RCF, Publicly Available Specification – PAS 2070 and Global Protocol for Community scale - GPC). Consequently, it is necessary to complete and standardize, in the short term, the accounting and reporting frameworks, in order to compare different UCFs for adopting shared climate strategies and actions at global level. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Accounting systems; City; GHG emissions; Inventory methods; Urban carbon footprint","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Accounting system; City; Environmental sustainability; GHG emission; International policies; Inventory methods; Principal dimensions; Publicly available specifications; Carbon footprint; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; climate change; decision making; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; numerical model; sustainability; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021094960

Animal welfare (AW) is part of the sustainability criteria of livestock production. A study was carried out in four states of Central Mexico in seven rustic (rPS) and six technified (tPS) production systems using the WQ protocol with the objective of providing an initial approximation of the welfare of animals and to discuss the validity of indicators of AW. The results showed that the animals housed in rustic units presented better results in the Good Health category and with respect to the criterion expression of social behaviour, while the frequency of criteria concerning Positive emotional states was higher in animals in the technified units. In the changing context in which the farms operate, including changing agricultural policies, new environmental and food safety regulations, variability of climatic conditions, and volatility in prices of inputs and outputs, it is not only the attributes referring to productivity and efficiency that become relevant.

Vegetation changes of grasslands are associated with an alteration of litter quality and decomposer communities. How they affect litter decomposition and associated carbon flows at the plant-soil interface, is not well understood. We designed a reciprocal transplant litter experiment by incubating 13C-labeled litter in selected patches. The primary aim of this study was to (1) determine the relative effects of litter quality and soil microbial community on litter decomposition rates; (2) estimate the associated carbon incorporated into different groups of the soil microbial community; and (3) verify if the dominant litter decomposed faster at “home” sites, i.e. home-field advantage (HFA) effect. Our data indicated that the interaction between litter type and decomposition site significantly affected litter decomposition. Cellulose contributed the most C during decomposition, and fungal phospholipid fatty acids incorporated the highest level of 13C from labeled litter. There was a higher decomposition rate of cellulose and more 13C incorporation in fungi, when each type of litter was incubated in its dominated sites. HFA index presented positive values that illustrates that the dominant litter had advantage in mediating decomposition processes. Gram positive (GP) bacteria and actinomycetes, they were found to be closely associated with the C priming of native-SOM. From this perspective of HFA, our results help understanding mechanisms of leaf litter–soil feedbacks in grassland, including the return of carbon (C) to the soil through litter decomposition and fraction in functional microbial groups. Practically, the results also imply that a higher biodiversity of grassland will affect the carbon cycle and formation of soil organic matter in ecosystem. Once such litter-soil feedbacks process is considered, vegetation management in grassland will contribute to carbon cycle, formation of soil organic matter in ecosystem. © 2017","Carbon sequestration; Grassland vegetation; Home-field-advantage; Litter decomposition; Reciprocal transplant experiment; Stable isotope probing","Bacteria; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Cellulose; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Forestry; Phospholipids; Vegetation; Carbon sequestration; Grassland vegetation; Home-field-advantage; Litter decomposition; Stable-isotope probing; Soils; bacterium; biochemical composition; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; cellulose; decomposition; experiment; fatty acid; fungus; grassland; litter; microbial community; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; stable isotope; vegetation cover; Carbon; Chelation; Decay; Forest Litter; Plants; Actinobacteria (class); Fungi; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019866540

A 2-year field experiment was conducted in a winter wheat-summer corn rotation system on dryland farmland on the Loess Plateau in Northwest China with four treatments; zero tillage with straw mulching (zero tillage), rotary tillage with straw incorporation (rotary tillage), chisel plow tillage with straw incorporation (chisel plow), and conventional mouldboard plow tillage without crop straw (conventional tillage). Results showed that zero tillage reduced carbon emissions, mainly through reduction of emissions from tillage practices, and served as a net carbon sink, as did rotary tillage and chisel plow, while conventional tillage served as a net carbon source. Specifically, zero tillage reduced carbon emissions from farm inputs by 168.8 and 75.0 kg C ha−1 yr−1 compared with conventional tillage and rotary tillage (or chisel plow), respectively. The difference in annual rate of carbon sequestration between 2013 and 2015 was 1.21-fold higher with zero tillage than with conventional tillage, suggesting zero tillage released less CO2 and was therefore better able to mitigate against global warming. Chisel plow significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved net return values by 10.7%–63.2% in the 2013-14 cropping year and by 12.8%–93.7% in the 2014–15 cropping year, respectively when compared to other tillage treatments. Zero tillage was the most effective method for reducing carbon inputs and increasing carbon sequestration, and chisel plow was the best option for provision of economic parameters on dryland farmland in this region. Therefore, the application of conservation (zero, rotary and chisel plow) tillage could be a C-smart and effective economic agricultural practice for winter wheat-summer corn ecosystems under rain fed condition. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation tillage; Net carbon flux; Net return; Rainfed field; Reduced tillage; Zero tillage","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Farms; Forestry; Global warming; Landforms; Sediments; Soil conservation; Tools; Conservation tillage; Net carbon flux; Net return; Rainfed; Reduced tillage; Zero tillage; Agricultural machinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994494778

The framework addresses the nature of individual preferences for more sustainable urban infrastructures, and how we can use this knowledge to improve urban form in ways that reduce environmental impacts. Using metropolitan Atlanta as a case study, we developed a survey that focuses on the preferences of Atlanta residents for low-impact development (LID) and transit-oriented development (TOD), with responses collected on the Mechanical Turk crowed-source platform. Using these responses we developed a latent-class residential community choice model for four distinctive classes of respondents that revealed heterogeneous preferences for community amenities. Next, we integrated the results of these individual choices into an agent-based market diffusion model, to predict land-use pattern, and to explore policies that drive greater adoption of more compact development. Finally, we used the results of this data collection and modelling to estimate the carbon emission reduction potentials from more compact development driven by LID and TOD.

Recent studies illustrate a linear relation between coastal distance and scepticism, which is lower in coastal zones than in inland. A possible explanation is that people living inland do not experience (or do not perceive) particular natural hazards as being caused by climate change, or attribute the natural hazards to other causes, apart from climate change. This might influence the relative importance of dealing with direct anthropogenic effects and planning adaptation to climate change. Therefore, the goal of this work was to explore this effect by comparing beliefs on the local effects of climate change in Aveiro region (Portugal), specifically in Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL, located in the inner side of Ria de Aveiro Coastal Lagoon, 10 km distance from the coast) with the nearby coastal zone between Esmoriz and Vagueira settlements. Stakeholders were interviewed and local individuals were surveyed in order to explore causal attributions towards relevant local environmental problems and compare with data available from the coastal zone. Natural hazards concerned flooding in BVL and shoreline retreat in the coastal zone. Results suggest that in BVL both stakeholders and local residents did not attribute local natural hazards to climate change. However, in the coastal zone, local natural hazards were indeed mostly attributed to climate change. This attribution to climate change was further correlated to a higher risk perception of natural hazards in the coastal zone but not in BVL. Thereby, it is important to consider distance from the shoreline in order to promote local processes of adaptation to climate change.","Anthropogenic activities; Aveiro Lagoon; Causal attribution; Local individuals; Risk perception; Stakeholders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041614872

However, the interrelation of SOC and these drivers and their potential connection networks are rarely assessed quantitatively. Using observations of SOC dynamics with detailed soil properties from 90 field trials at 28 sites under different agroecosystems across the Australian cropping regions, we investigated the direct and indirect effects of climate, soil properties, carbon (C) inputs and soil C pools (a total of 17 variables) on SOC change rate (rC, Mg C ha−1 yr−1). Among these variables, we found that the most influential variables on rC were the average C input amount and annual precipitation, and the total SOC stock at the beginning of the trials. Overall, C inputs (including C input amount and pasture frequency in the crop rotation system) accounted for 27% of the relative influence on rC, followed by climate 25% (including precipitation and temperature), soil C pools 24% (including pool size and composition) and soil properties (such as cation exchange capacity, clay content, bulk density) 24%. Path analysis identified a network of intercorrelations of climate, soil properties, C inputs and soil C pools in determining rC. The direct correlation of rC with climate was significantly weakened if removing the effects of soil properties and C pools, and vice versa. These results reveal the relative importance of climate, soil properties, C inputs and C pools and their complex interconnections in regulating SOC dynamics. Ignorance of the impact of changes in soil properties, C pool composition and C input (quantity and quality) on SOC dynamics is likely one of the main sources of uncertainty in SOC predictions from the process-based SOC models. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; measured carbon fractions; physical protection; soil geochemistry; soil organic carbon","agricultural soil; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; soil property; Australia; carbon; soil; Australia; chemistry; climate; soil; temperature; Australia; Carbon; Climate; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021345819

By way of contrast, the configuration of lowest energy in group 5 consists of the dislocation in its easy core and the carbon atom in a fifth nearest neighbor octahedral site. The configuration is attractive, but less than in group 6. We show that this group dependence is consistent with the carbon local environment in the stable stoichiometric carbide structures, namely cubic NaCl-type for group 5 and hexagonal WC-type for group 6: in both cases the carbon atoms are at the center of octahedra and prisms respectively. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","BCC transition metals; DFT calculations; dislocation-solute interaction","Atoms; Calculations; Carbides; Density functional theory; Metals; Prisms; Screws; Transition metals; Tungsten carbide; Ab initio density functional theories (DFT); Bcc transition metal; Body-centered cubic; DFT calculation; Dislocation interaction; First-principles investigations; Interstitial carbons; Solute interaction; Screw dislocations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034596723

This study investigated characteristics of dustfall at two rural sites and four urban sites from dust sources to downwind regions during three dust storms (DS1: March 19–22, DS2: April 24–26, DS3: May 7–10, 2010). Analysis of near-surface instantaneous maximum wind speed and prevailing wind direction revealed the dust storms bursted out from northwestern arid and semiarid regions to eastern China. Microaggregates, angular, subangular, columnar, subrounded, and spherical particles were identified by scanning electron microscope. Dust deposition flux (DDF) during the dust storms was significantly high at sites near sand deserts and sandy land. During DS2, DDF was 25.1, 9.9, 2.3, and 1.5 g m−2 in Jingbian, Shapotou, Lanzhou, and Beijing, respectively. The three dust storms contributed 7.3% of Beijing's annual dustfall in 2010, which suggests anthropogenic dust might contribute the majority of annual dustfall in urban areas. The mass medium diameter of dustfall during DS2 in Shapotou, Jingbian, Lanzhou, and Beijing was 26.1, 9.0, 16.4, and 15.5 μm, respectively. Urban dustfall contained more heavy metals, sulfur and arsenic than rural dustfall. Cadmium contamination was identified in all urban dust particles. Anthropogenic pollutants in combination with mineral dust might lead to complex environmental risk on local, regional, and global scales. China's environmental pollution control should integrate reductions in land desertification and multisource anthropogenic emissions within the context of climate change mitigation. © 2017","Dust deposition flux; Dust storm; Element enrichment; Instantaneous maximum wind speed; Particle size","arid region; deposition velocity; dust storm; enrichment; particle size; rural area; semiarid region; transport process; urban area; wind direction; wind velocity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024478151

Phytochrome B was activated using an array of light diodes emitting light in the red spectral region (RL) and inactivated by an array of light diodes emitting far-red light (FRL). At the end of the night dark period (8 h), activity of the chloroplastic GAP-dehydrogenase complex (the sequence of reactions: 3-PGA → 1,3-PGA → 3-GAP) was 1.0−1.2 μmol of oxidized NADPH/(min g fr wt of the leaf). When the leaves of intact plants were exposed to a maximal dose of RL (20 min at 17.5 kJ/m2), enzyme activity rose by 100–120%. Longer exposure to RL (30 and 40 min) did not cause further activation. Successive exposure to RL and FRL (20 min at 3.0 kJ/m2) completely negated a stimulatory effect of RL. It was shown that as little as 5-min-long exposure to RL increased the rate of 3-GAP formation by 20–25%, and enzyme activity rose linearly when radiation dose was elevated. Determination of the lifetime of RL-activated state by its decrease in plants placed in darkness showed that decay occurred with τ1/2 of 50−60 min when RL was switched off. Thus, a phytochrome B-induced regulation of reducing enzyme complex governing the reductive pentose phosphate cycle was discovered. Judging from the kinetics of attenuation of the activated state, phytochrome B apparently does not affect de novo synthesis of the enzyme. Since the investigated metabolic process consists of two coupled reactions controlled by kinase and dehydrogenase, the place and mechanism of action of the phytochrome system remain unknown. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","far-red light; NADP-GAP dehydrogenase; phytochrome B; red light; Triticum aestivum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027865491

The process requires cooperation between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea, which can be affected by sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRPs). However, the effects of sulfate on hydrocarbon degradation and methane production remain elusive, and the microbial communities involved are not well understood. Results: In this study, a methanogenic hexadecane-degrading enrichment culture was treated with six different concentrations of sulfate ranging from 0.5 to 25 mM. Methane production and maximum specific methane production rate gradually decreased to 44 and 56% with sulfate concentrations up to 25 mM, respectively. There was a significant positive linear correlation between the sulfate reduction/methane production ratio and initial sulfate concentration, which remained constant during the methane production phase. The apparent methanogenesis fractionation factor (αapp) gradually increased during the methane production phase in each treatment, the αapp for the treatments with lower sulfate (0.5-4 mM) eventually plateaued at ∼1.047, but that for the treatment with 10-25 mM sulfate only reached ∼1.029. The relative abundance levels of Smithella and Methanoculleus increased almost in parallel with the increasing sulfate concentrations. Furthermore, the predominant sulfate reducer communities shifted from Desulfobacteraceae in the low-sulfate cultures to Desulfomonile in the high-sulfate cultures. Conclusion: The distribution of hexadecane carbon between methane-producing and sulfate-reducing populations is dependent on the initial sulfate added, and not affected during the methane production period. There was a relative increase in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis activity over time for all sulfate treatments, whereas the total activity was inhibited by sulfate addition. Both Smithella and Methanoculleus, the key alkane degraders and methane producers, can adapt to sulfate stress. Specifically, different SRP populations were stimulated at various sulfate concentrations. These results could help to evaluate interactions between sulfate-reducing and methanogenic populations during anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation in oil reservoirs. © 2017 The Author(s).","Hydrocarbon degradation; Methane production; Microbial interactions; Oil reservoirs; Sulfate reduction","Anaerobic digestion; Biological water treatment; Carbon; Crude oil; Fossil fuels; Hydrocarbons; Methane; Microorganisms; Paraffins; Petroleum chemistry; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Reduction; Hydrocarbon degradation; Methane production; Microbial interactions; Oil reservoirs; Sulfate reduction; Sulfur compounds; biotechnology; crude oil; degradation; fractionation; hydrocarbon reservoir; methane; methanogenesis; microbiology; sulfate-reducing bacterium; Desulfobacteraceae; Desulfomonile; Methanoculleus; Prokaryota; Smithella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028717176

Variables including the climate-related risk factor, the health outcome and location all determine the nature and extent of the impact. The existence of different pathways and endpoints presents a problem for quantifying and comparing impacts. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) provides a common scale, whereby the impact of climate change on both acute and chronic health outcomes can be compared. This study presents a methodology to calculate the impact of climate change on human health at a local scale, using cardiovascular disease (CVD) and meteorological disaster-related injuries (DRIs) in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, as applied case studies. An additional very fine scale assessment of CVD conducted at the neighbourhood level to demonstrate the importance of conducting risk assessments at a local level. The comparative results calculated the impact of climate change in 2050 to be 16.866 DALY/100,000 population for CVD and 0.645 DALY/100,000 for meteorological DRIs. The actual impact of climate change by 2050 on CVD is judged to be higher, although the relative risk was projected to be lower (1.006, compared to 1.263 for meteorological DRIs). The fine scale assessment revealed the variations in the projected impact of climate change on CVD for all administrative zones in Osaka Prefecture. The range of impacts varied from 0 to 114.29 DALY/100,000. The results demonstrate the applicability of using DALY to quantify the impact of climate change on different health outcomes, using a transferable methodology, and provide information that enables evidence-based prioritisation of climate change adaptation strategies at a local scale. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Burden of climate; Cardiovascular disease; Climate change; DALY; Disaster-related injuries; Human health; Japan","cardiovascular disease; climate change; climate effect; disability; disaster; injury; life expectancy; prioritization; public health; quantitative analysis; risk factor; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Osaka [Kinki]; Osaka [Osaka (PRF)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014548107

The approach is based on the previously developed restricted open configuration interaction with singles (ROCIS) method and its parametrized version, based on a ground-state Kohn-Sham determinant (DFT/ROCIS) method. The ROCIS approach has the following features: (1) In the first step approximation, many-particle eigenstates are calculated in which the total spin is retained as a good quantum number. (2) The ground state with total spin S and excited states with spin S′ = S, S ± 1, are obtained. (3) These states have a qualitatively correct multiplet structure. (4) Quasi-degenerate perturbation theory is used to treat the spin-orbit coupling operator variationally at the many-particle level. (5) Transition moments are obtained between the relativistic many-particle states. The method has shown great potential in the field of X-ray spectroscopy, in particular in the field of transition-metal L-edge, which cannot be described correctly with particle-hole theories. In this work, the method is extended to the calculation of resonant VtC RXES [alternatively referred to as 1s-VtC resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS)] spectra. The complete Kramers-Dirac-Heisenerg equation is taken into account. Thus, state interference effects are treated naturally within this protocol. As a first application of this protocol, a computational study on the previously reported VtC RXES plane on a molecular managanese(V) complex is performed. Starting from conventional X-ray absorption spectra (XAS), we present a systematic study that involves calculations and electronic structure analysis of both the XAS and non-resonant and resonant VtC XES spectra. The very good agreement between theory and experiment, observed in all cases, allows us to unravel the complicated intensity mechanism of these spectroscopic techniques as a synergic function of state polarization and interference effects. In general, intense features in the RIXS spectra originate from absorption and emission processes that involve nonorthogonal transition moments. We also present a graphical method to determine the sign of the interference contributions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030564426

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of imidacloprid on growth and activities of microbes in tropical rice soil ecosystem. Four treatments, namely, recommended dose (at 25 g a.i. ha−1, RD), double the recommended dose (at 50 g a.i. ha−1, 2RD), five times the recommended dose (at 125 g a.i. ha−1, 5RD) &amp; ten times the recommended dose (at 250 g a.i. ha−1, 10RD) along with control were imposed under controlled condition. Dissipation half lives of imidacloprid in soil were 19.25, 20.38, 21.65 and 33.00 days for RD, 2RD, 5RD and 10RD, respectively. In general bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi and phosphate solubilising bacteria population were disturbed due to imidacloprid application. Changes in diversity indices within bacterial community confirmed that imidacloprid application significantly affected distribution of bacteria. Total soil microbial biomass carbon content was reduced on imidacloprid application. Except dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activities, all other soil enzymes namely, β-glycosidase, fluorescien diacetate hydrolase, acid phosphatase and urease responded negatively to imidacloprid application.

Results from previous field experiments showed that, when applied to vineyards, biochar amendment increased yield without a negative impact on grape quality, decreasing water stress during droughts and improving soil physical and chemical properties. Despite those positive impacts, the long-term effects of biochar treatment on soil fertility and ecological toxicity have seldom been studied at a real farm scale. We investigated the effects of biochar amendment on vineyard soil subjected to a single and a repeated biochar application focusing on total heavy metal concentration and availability, concentration and persistence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), soil toxicity, and soil microbial community structure over a 5-year period. Our results showed that a longer term biochar application in a vineyard has no impact on soil microorganisms and does not retain toxic compounds (PAH and heavy metals). For the first time in biochar research, we investigate the biochar effect on a perennial crop and correlate the PAH retention with soil microbiota. Our research demonstrates that biochar application in a Mediterranean vineyard does not have a negative impact on soil ecology, reinforcing the perception that biochar is a sustainable option at farm scale, meeting the needs of agronomy and climate change mitigation. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.","Biochar; Eco-toxicity; Heavy metals; Microbial community structure; PAHs; Vineyard","agricultural soil; agronomy; charcoal; climate change; community structure; crop production; ecotoxicology; food quality; heavy metal; microbial community; PAH; persistence; sustainability; toxicity; vineyard; Vitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030324678

The alternatives were designed to examine the efficacy of independent contributions of walking, bicycling, and transit at levels consistent with the U.S. Surgeon General recommendation for physical activity. Using data from travel and health surveys, vital statistics, collision databases, and outputs from regional and statewide travel models, the Integrated Transport and Health Impacts Model estimated the change in the population disease burden, as measured by deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs), due to a shift from a 2010 baseline travel pattern to an alternative. Health pathways modeled were physical activity and road traffic injuries. The preferred scenarios increased statewide active transport from 40.5 to 53.4 min person−1 w−1, which was associated with an annual decrease of 909 deaths and 16,089 DALYs. Sensitivity analyses that accounted for 2040 projected age- and sex-specific population characteristics and cause-specific mortality rates did not appreciably alter the annual change in deaths and DALYs on a population basis. The ambitious, maximal alternatives increased population mean travel duration to 283 min person−1 w−1 for walking, bicycling, or transit and were associated a reduction in deaths and DALYs from 2.5 to 12 times greater than the California preferred scenarios. The alternative with the largest health impact was bicycling 283 min person−1 w−1 which led to 8,543 fewer annual deaths and 194,003 fewer DALYs, despite an increase in bicyclist injuries. With anticipated population growth, no alternative achieved decreases in carbon emissions but bicycling had the greatest potential for slowing their growth. Alternatives that included transit similarly reduced carbon emissions, but with less health benefit. Aggressive expansion of active transport is an efficacious, but underutilized policy option with significant health co-benefits for mitigating greenhouse gases. © 2017 The Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018933457

Structured questionnaires were used in data collection and a total of 120 farmers in 3 zones of Muheza district were included in the study. Above ground biomass was calculated from different tree components (stem and branches) in t ha-1, 29% of stem biomass was taken as biomass of branches. Carbon storage was calculated as 49% of the total tree species biomass. Data from the survey and biological data were analyzed using SPSS and SAS statistical software, respectively. Only 46.7% respondents do allocate land for fodder trees equivalent to 0.05 — 3.4% of their farm land. About 32.5% of them cultivated LL alone and 7% cultivated GS while 11% cultivated both species. Size of the farm land influenced (P&gt;0.05) area allocated for fodder production. Generally, (81.7%) of the farmers were using leaf meal (LM) to feed their dairy cows. About 71% and 5% of the respondents used Leucaena leaf meal (LLM) and Gliricidia leaf meal (GLM), respectively, while 3.3% used both LLM and GLM. The use of LM differed between the target zones and the protein supply potential from LLM was 250g CP/kg DM. Carbon density (CD) of LL was estimated to be 5.06 t onnes C ha-1 at 16169 trees per ha, whereas GS had 10.24 tonnes C ha-1 at 1334 tree density per ha which is equivalent to emissions from 3 and 5 cattle, respectively. Hence one cow requires 0.3 and 0.2 ha or 5390 and 269 trees of LL and GS to be carbon emission neutral. The CD for both species differed between zones. Carbon stock above the ground in the two species were sufficient and therefore planting at 6000 and 1000 trees of LL and GS respectively per cow can save as a mitigation option for offsetting CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

We carried out an ecosystem services (ES) assessment at the Rizoelia National Forest Park, a biodiversity hotspot in Cyprus. For ES assessment we used TESSA v.1.1 and an ES matrix-approach to map the capacity of habitat types in the area. According to TESSA the most important ES provided by the study area are aesthetic benefits, recreation/tourism, biodiversity, global climate regulation, and environmental education. Total Carbon stock was estimated to 14247.327 tonnes and the total number of annual visits was 14471. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of visits among visitation periods but there were statistically significant differences among National Holidays, Weekends and Weekdays. We identified that plantations had the highest capacity for most groups of services particularly where their understory comprises semi-natural habitat types rich in biodiversity. This is the first study in Cyprus which provides a preliminary quantification of ES in a protected area context using widely employed tools.

Yet, amines atmospheric fate and their environmental and human health impacts, after their release by evaporation and solvent degradation from post combustion CO2 capture (PCCC) plants to the surrounding air, remains a key area to address in view of the worldwide installation of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities. It is therefore crucial to test potential industrial applications with respect to plant design parameters influencing the fate of the amine degradation products. In this work, a method is developed to propose ideal PCCC plant parameters with respect to its design and operation. A risk limiting scenario was modelled on the UK's largest CO2 capture pilot plant (CCPilot100+) in Ferrybridge using the air dispersion model ADMS, such that the total nitrosamines and nitramines from the amines realised did not exceed the reported atmospheric safety limits of 0.3 ng/m3 with respect to human health in the local environment. A parametric sensitivity study was performed to determine the plant design parameters that most influenced the fate of the nitrosamines and nitramines. It was found that stack height and diameter, exit flue gas temperature and velocity are parameters of the PCCC plant can influence the total sum of nitrosamine (NS) and nitramine (NA) from +58% to −42% compared to the baseline parameterization. Environmental parameters, such as the site specific background meteorology and the background photochemistry were also inspected. Meteorology, i.e. mainly wind speed and wind flow field, affected the total NS and NA baseline concentrations from +28% to −10%, and background photochemistry from +165% −65%. In conclusion, if a PCCC plant is constructed with advantageous exhaust geometry, environmentally optimised operation conditions, and placed in an area with low background pollution, the risk associated with employing amines for capturing CO2 emissions might be reduced to a minimum. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ADMS; Advection; Amine; Amine emissions; Atmospheric chemistry; Degradation; Dimethylamine; Dispersion; Gas phase; Human health; Meteorology; Methylamine; Monoethanolamine; Nitramine; Nitrosamine; Photochemistry; Photolysis; Risk limiting scenario; Worst case scenario","Advection; Amines; Atmospheric movements; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactions; Coal; Coal combustion; Combustion; Degradation; Delta modulation; Dispersion (waves); Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Health; Health risks; Meteorology; Nitrosamines; Photochemical reactions; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Pilot plants; Product design; Risk perception; Wind; Wind effects; Dimethylamines; Gasphase; Human health; Methylamine; Monoethanolamine; Nitramines; Worst case scenario; Atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); meteorology; photochemistry; photolysis; public health; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032036277

The lack of periodic measurements in different location makes it impossible to plan and act, in order to reduce the air quality high coefficients. After defining the air pollution sources, different actions can be taken to decrease air pollution levels. Therefore, it is a paramount need to implement a sensing platform for monitoring the air quality. In this paper it is shown that a low-cost sensing platform, comprised mainly from electrochemical sensor, can be used for sensing at parts-per-billion level gases relevant to urban air quality and can be modular, by enabling the possibility to integrate other types of gas sensors and communication technologies, to provide data in distance.

Thirty mudstone samples were collected and analyzed using different organic geochemical methods such as, Rock-Eval VI-TOC, bitumens extraction, and GC–MS analysis. Attributes such as, quantity, quality and maturity of the organic matter were utilized to estimate the regional source rock potential. The obtained data indicate that the examined samples have poor to good, dominantly gas-prone source-rock potential, and contain a mixed in origin organic matter. The slight predominance of terrestrial organic material is indicated by the low odd to even predominance values, slight predominance of higher n-alkanes over short-chain n-alkanes, OEP25–33, CPI25–33, ACL25–33, and TAR values. Some availability of marine organic material is evidenced by the predominance of intermediate chain n-alkanes and the low n-C19/n-C31 and n-C24 +/n-C24– ratios. The analyzed sediments are thermally mature, as suggested by the Tmax, PI, OEP 25–33 and CPI25–33 values, the Pr/n-C17, Ph/n-C18, C30-moretane/C30-hopane, Ts/(Ts + Tm) and C32S/(S + R) ratios, as well as by the C30-moretane/C30-hopane versus Tm/Ts plot. A mudstone-rich, siliciclastic source rock is implied by the C29/C30 hopane ratios and by the Ts/(Ts + Tm) versus 23tricyclic/hopane cross-plot.

The study assumes early actions and quantifies the market penetration of low carbon technologies, the emission pathways and the economic costs for an efficient reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such that the temperature limit is not exceeded. We evaluate the potential role of direct air capture (DAC) and its impact on policy costs and energy consumption. DAC is a technology that removes emissions directly from the atmosphere contributing to negative carbon emissions. We find that, with our modelling assumptions, limiting global temperature to 1.5 °C is only possible when using DAC. Our results show that the DAC technology can play an important role in realising deep decarbonisation goals and in the reduction of regional and global mitigation costs with stringent targets. DAC acts a substitute to Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the stringent scenarios. For this analysis, we use the model MERGE-ETL, a technology-rich integrated assessment model with endogenous learning. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon capture; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Temperature; Economic consequences; Energy transitions; Global temperatures; Integrated assessment models; Low-carbon technologies; Market penetration; Mitigation costs; Temperature limits; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; economic analysis; emission control; energy conservation; energy market; fuel consumption; global warming; greenhouse gas; international agreement; mitigation; scenario analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027839992

Despite the efforts made, reducing freight-related congestion and polluting emissions without penalising social and economic activities within cities is still a challenging issue. City logistics measures frequently fail mainly due to a lack of support and commitment from stakeholders. A participatory approach in freight transport planning represents a reasonable and valuable option. This paper describes the innovative governance model developed in the city of Turin in Italy that was based on a proactive and effective stakeholders' cooperation for achieving a resilient urban development. The added value of the paper also relates to the real-life assessment of the impacts the non-mandatory policy-mix implemented, based on a collaborative governance model, have on the environment and service delivery thus providing a realistic measure of the viability and effectiveness of the solution proposed.

Such work had as reference scenario the linear causal chain MCTP (Macroscale Circulation → Temperature → Phenology of crops) that links oceanic and atmospheric circulation to surface air temperature which in its turn determines the earliness of appearance of phenological phases of plants. Results show that in the three segments of the MCTP causal chain are present cycles with the following central period in years (the % of the 12 analyzed time series interested by these cycles are in brackets): 65 (58%), 24 (58%), 20.5 (58%), 13.5 (50%), 11.5 (58%), 7.7 (75%), 5.5 (58%), 4.1 (58%), 3 (50%), 2.4 (67%). A comparison with short term spectral peaks of the four El Niño regions (nino1 + 2, nino3, nino3.4 and nino4) show that 10 of the 12 series are imprinted by periods around 2.3–2.4 yr while 50–58% of the series are imprinted by El Niño periods of 4–4.2, 3.8–3.9, 3–3.1 years. The analysis highlights the links among physical and biological variables of the climate system at scales that range from macro to microscale whose knowledge is crucial to reach a suitable understanding of the ecosystem behavior. The spectral analysis was also applied to a time series of spring – summer precipitation in order to evaluate the presence of peaks common with other 12 selected series with result substantially negative which brings us to rule out the existence of a linear causal chain MCPP (Macroscale Circulation → Precipitation → Phenology). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AMO; ENSO; European temperatures; Grapevine and cherry phenology; NAO; Spectral analysis","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Biology; Chains; Climatology; Nickel; Spectrum analysis; Time series; Atlantic multidecadal oscillations; Atmospheric circulation; El Nino southern oscillation; ENSO; Grapevine and cherry phenology; Multi-scale approaches; North Atlantic oscillations; Surface air temperatures; Time series analysis; air temperature; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; atmospheric circulation; climate cycle; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; North Atlantic Oscillation; phenology; precipitation (climatology); spectral analysis; temperature anomaly; time series analysis; air temperature; Article; atmosphere; climate change; environmental factor; geomorphology; microclimate; phenology; precipitation; spring; summer; surface area; temperature sensitivity; urban area; article; cherry; crop; ecosystem; El Nino; flower development; nonhuman; North Atlantic oscillation; spectroscopy; time series analysis; Vitis; Atlantic Ocean; Europe; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015987284

We present a novel approach that combines pollen-based REVEALS estimates of plant cover with climate, anthropogenic land-cover and dynamic vegetation modelling results. This is used to quantify the relative impacts of land use and climate on Holocene vegetation at a sub-continental scale, i.e. northern and western Europe north of the Alps. We use redundancy analysis and variation partitioning to quantify the percentage of variation in vegetation composition explained by the climate and land-use variables, and Monte Carlo permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of each variable. We further use a similarity index to combine pollen-based REVEALS estimates with climate-driven dynamic vegetation modelling results. The overall results indicate that climate is the major driver of vegetation when the Holocene is considered as a whole and at the sub-continental scale, although land use is important regionally. Four critical phases of land-use effects on vegetation are identified. The first phase (from 7000 to 6500 BP) corresponds to the early impacts on vegetation of farming and Neolithic forest clearance and to the dominance of climate as a driver of vegetation change. During the second phase (from 4500 to 4000 BP), land use becomes a major control of vegetation. Climate is still the principal driver, although its influence decreases gradually. The third phase (from 2000 to 1500 BP) is characterised by the continued role of climate on vegetation as a consequence of late-Holocene climate shifts and specific climate events that influence vegetation as well as land use. The last phase (from 500 to 350 BP) shows an acceleration of vegetation changes, in particular during the last century, caused by new farming practices and forestry in response to population growth and industrialization. This is a unique signature of anthropogenic impact within the Holocene but European vegetation remains climatically sensitive and thus may continue to respond to ongoing climate change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; Europe; Holocene; Human impact; Land use; LPJ-GUESS; Pollen; REVEALS; Vegetation composition","Forestry; Land use; Population statistics; Vegetation; Climate; Europe; Holocenes; Human impact; LPJ-GUESS; Pollen; REVEALS; Vegetation composition; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; climate effect; farming system; forest clearance; forestry; Holocene; industrialization; land use change; Neolithic; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; pollen; population growth; similarity index; vegetation dynamics; Alps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022028998

There are simple models based on transfer function or more complex models based on computational fluid dynamics. The models may be either implemented through basic programming languages or simulated through dedicated packages of internal combustion engine simulation. Owing to the recent interest to reduce the gas emission, dual-fuel engines are increasingly being used as primary propulsion in merchant ships. In this context, a simplified model of marine dual-fuel low-speed diesel engine has been developed. Through the normalisation of specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas data, clear trends approachable by polynomial curves or surfaces were revealed. Thus, by using the proposed model and knowing the characteristics of an engine at its nominal maximum continuous rating, it is possible to predict the engine operation in any design point on the engine layout diagram, even at part load. The maximum deviations regarding the two simulated engines did not exceed −3.4%. Summarising, the developed model is a simple and effective tool for optimising the selection of dual-fuel low-speed diesel engines to be applied in ship propulsion systems. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Naval.","Marine propulsion; Optimisation; Prediction model; Prime mover; Selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054163549

However, a textual analysis of current and recent policies concerning climate change, development and poverty alleviation, and disaster management shows that the economic and adaptive roles of internal migration are often not included in policy framing.

However, little is known about the use of dietary treatments to stimulate rumen microorganisms capable of capturing the [H] available when CH4 is inhibited in vivo. The effects of the phenolic compound phloroglucinol on CH4 production, [H] flows and subsequent responses in rumen fermentation and microbial community composition when methanogenesis is inhibited were investigated in cattle. Eight rumen fistulated Brahman steers were randomly allocated in two groups receiving chloroform as an antimethanogenic compound for 21 days. Following that period one group received chloroform + phloroglucinol for another 16 days, whilst the other group received only chloroform during the same period. The chloroform treatment resulted in a decrease in CH4 production and an increase in H2 expelled with a shift in rumen fermentation toward higher levels of propionate and formate and lower levels of acetate at day 21 of treatment. Bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to Prevotella were promoted whilst Archaea and Synergistetes OTUs were decreased with the chloroform treatment as expected. The shift toward formate coincided with increases in Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium species. The addition of chloroform + phloroglucinol in the rumen resulted in a decrease of H2 expelled (g) per kg of DMI and moles of H2 expelled per mol of CH4 decreased compared with the chloroform only treated animals. A shift toward acetate and a decrease in formate were observed for the chloroform + phloroglucinol-treated animals at day 37. These changes in the rumen fermentation profile were accompanied by a relative increase of OTUs assigned to Coprococcus spp., which could suggest this genus is a significant contributor to the metabolism of this phenolic compound in the rumen. This study demonstrates for the first time in vivo that under methanogenesis inhibition, H2 gas accumulation can be decreased by redirecting [H] toward alternative sinks through the nutritional stimulation of specific microbial groups. This results in the generation of metabolites of value for the host while also helping to maintain a low H2 partial pressure in the methane-inhibited rumen. © 2017 Martinez-Fernandez, Denman, Cheung and McSweeney.","16S sequencing; CH4; H2; Microbial community; Phloroglucinol; Rumen","acetic acid; chloroform; cyclodextrin; decanoic acid; DNA 16S; formic acid; hydrogen; methane; phloroglucinol; propionic acid; valeric acid; animal experiment; animal model; archaeon; Article; body weight; bovine; bullock; Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens; chemical analysis; controlled study; DNA extraction; drug degradation; fermentation; gas chromatography; gas flow; high performance liquid chromatography; high throughput sequencing; hydrogen capture; metabolite; Methanobrevibacter ruminantium; methanogenesis; methanogenic fermentation; microbial community; microbiological phenomena and functions; nonhuman; partial pressure; Prevotella; rumen; Ruminococcus flavefaciens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030631796

In order to evaluate the sources of particulate air pollution and related health risks, a year-round sampling was done at the University of Sao Paulo campus (20ma.g.l.), a green area near an important expressway. The sampling was performed for PM2:5 (≤2:5μm) and PM10 (≤10μm) in 2014 through intensive (everyday sampling in wintertime) and extensive campaigns (once a week for the whole year) with 24 h of sampling. This year was characterized by having lower average precipitation compared to meteorological data, and high-pollution episodes were observed all year round, with a significant increase in pollution level in the intensive campaign, which was performed during wintertime. Different chemical constituents, such as carbonaceous species, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and derivatives, water-soluble ions, and biomass burning tracers were identified in order to evaluate health risks and to apportion sources. The species such as PAHs, inorganic and organic ions, and monosaccharides were determined using chromatographic techniques and carbonaceous species using thermal-optical analysis. Trace elements were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The risks associated with particulate matter exposure based on PAH concentrations were also assessed, along with indexes such as the benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaPE) and lung cancer risk (LCR). High BaPE and LCR were observed in most of the samples, rising to critical values in the wintertime. Also, biomass burning tracers and PAHs were higher in this season, while secondarily formed ions presented low variation throughout the year. Meanwhile, vehicular tracer species were also higher in the intensive campaign, suggesting the influence of lower dispersion conditions in that period. Source apportionment was performed using positive matrix factorization (PMF), which indicated five different factors: Road dust, industrial emissions, vehicu-lar exhaust, biomass burning and secondary processes. The results highlighted the contribution of vehicular emissions and the significant input from biomass combustion in wintertime, suggesting that most of the particulate matter is due to local sources, in addition to the influence of pre-harvest sugarcane burning. © 2017 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chemical composition; chemical pollutant; health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; source apportionment; traffic emission; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032859317

There were three treatment combinations (S+ PP -relay horsegram (HG), S+ PP -ratoon S and S+ PP -sequence HG) accommodating an opportune crop of relay or sequence HG to be tested against checks of sole crops. S and PP strip system in a high rainfall year (2013) yielded 31% higher grain than 2:1 S and PP intercropping, but such advantages were not observed during a deficit rainfall year (2014). Significant PP yield increase during a high rainfall year in a strip system increased both water productivity (10.1 to 16.5 kg/ha/mm) and net returns (Rs 57490 to 71680/year). Similarly, during high rainfall year (2013), a superior diverse index (1.63 over 1.19) and production efficiency (19.6 over 13.5 kg/ha/day) was observed. Both relay/sequence cropped HG performed equally well while ratoon S performed poorly. Therefore, for changing climate, 4:4 strip intercropping of S and PP showed higher productivity and economic returns as compared to 2:1 intercropping system. Opportune cropping through relay or sequence HG can be successfully carried out in semi-arid regions during post monsoon season for climate change adaptation.","Conservation cropping; Crop diversification; Crop intensification; Efficient cropping system; Opportunity cropping; Sorghum+pigeonpea strip cropping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029474860

Since it has a greenhouse effect which is 265 times higher than carbon dioxide, even relatively small amounts can result in a significant carbon footprint. Biological nitrogen (N) removal conventionally occurs with nitrification/denitrification, yet also through advanced processes such as nitritation/denitritation and completely autotrophic N-removal. The microbial pathways leading to the N2O emission include hydroxylamine oxidation and nitrifier denitrification, both activated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria, and heterotrophic denitrification. In this work, a critical review of the existing literature on N2O emissions during BNR is presented focusing on the most contributing parameters. Various factors increasing the N2O emissions either per se or combined are identified: low dissolved oxygen, high nitrite accumulation, low chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen ratio, slow growth of denitrifying bacteria, uncontrolled pH and temperature. However, there is no common pattern in reporting the N2O generation amongst the cited studies, a fact that complicates its evaluation. When simulating N2O emissions, all microbial pathways along with the potential contribution of abiotic N2O production during wastewater treatment at different dissolved oxygen/nitrite levels should be considered. The undeniable validation of the robustness of such models calls for reliable quantification techniques which simultaneously describe dissolved and gaseous N2O dynamics. Thus, the choice of the N-removal process, the optimal selection of operational parameters and the establishment of validated dynamic models combining multiple N2O pathways are essential for studying the emissions mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anammox; BNR; Modeling; N2O emission; Nitrifier denitrification; Nitritation/denitritation","Bacteria; Biochemical oxygen demand; Biological water treatment; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Chemical oxygen demand; Denitrification; Dissolution; Greenhouse effect; Models; Nitration; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Nutrients; Oxygen; Wastewater treatment; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; ANAMMOX; Biological nutrient removal; Heterotrophic denitrification; Hydroxylamine oxidations; Nitrification/denitrification; Nitritation; Validated dynamic models; Dissolved oxygen; carbon; carbon dioxide; dissolved oxygen; hydroxylamine; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; denitrification; emission; modeling; nitrification; nitrous oxide; nutrient dynamics; pollutant removal; sludge; wastewater treatment; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; autotrophy; bacterial growth; carbon footprint; chemical oxygen demand; denitrification; denitrifying bacterium; greenhouse effect; heterotrophy; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; oxidation; pH; quantitative analysis; reliability; Review; sludge treatment; temperature; waste component removal; waste water management; Nitrosomonadales",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018252475

For instance, the legacy of past fire regimes may persist through some species and traits that are found due to past fires. In this study, we tested for relationships between functional traits that are classically presented as the main components of plant ecological strategies and environmental filters related to climate and historical fires among permanent mature forest plots across the range of local and regional environmental gradients that occur in Amazonia. We used percentage surface soil pyrogenic carbon (PyC), a recalcitrant form of carbon that can persist for millennia in soils, as a novel indicator of historical fire in old-growth forests. Five out of the nine functional traits evaluated across all 378 species were correlated with some environmental variables. Although there is more PyC in Amazonian soils than previously reported, the percentage soil PyC indicated no detectable legacy effect of past fires on contemporary functional composition. More species with dry diaspores were found in drier and hotter environments. We also found higher wood density in trees from higher temperature sites. If Amazon forest past burnings were local and without distinguishable attributes of a widespread fire regime, then impacts on biodiversity would have been small and heterogeneous. Alternatively, sufficient time may have passed since the last fire to allow for species replacement. Regardless, as we failed to detect any impact of past fire on present forest functional composition, if our plots are representative then it suggests that mature Amazon forests lack a compositional legacy of past fire. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climatological water deficit; Elevation; Fire; Fruit type; Soil charcoal; Temperature; Wood density","biodiversity; charcoal; elevation; environmental gradient; forest edge; forest fire; fruit; high temperature; old-growth forest; plant; soil carbon; temperature effect; wood; Amazon Basin; Amazonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026502532

Simulations considered include those performed with six RCMs driven by the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis II product for the 1981–2000 period and those driven by four Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for the current 1971–2000 and future 2041–2070 periods (i.e. a total of 11 current-to-future period simulation pairs). A regional frequency analysis approach was used to develop 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-year return values of precipitation extremes from NCEP and AOGCM-driven current and future period simulations that respectively were used to study the performance of RCMs and projected changes for selected return values at regional, grid-cell and local scales. Performance errors due to internal dynamics and physics of RCMs studied for the 1981–2000 period reveal considerable variation in the performance of the RCMs. However, the performance errors were found to be much smaller for RCM ensemble averages than for individual RCMs. Projected changes in future climate to selected regional return values of short-duration (e.g. 15- and 30-min) precipitation extremes and for longer return periods (e.g. 50-year) were found to be mostly larger than those to the longer duration (e.g. 24- and 48-h) extremes and short return periods (e.g. 2-year). Overall, projected changes in precipitation extremes were larger for southeastern regions followed by southern and northern regions and smaller for southwestern and western regions of the study area. The changes to return values were also found to be statistically significant for the majority of the RCM–AOGCM simulation pairs. These projections might be useful as a key input for the future planning of urban drainage infrastructure and development of strategic climate change adaptation measures. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Canadian Prairie Provinces; Climate change; NARCCAP; Precipitation extremes; Regional frequency analysis","climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; computer simulation; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; weather forecasting; Canada; Prairie Provinces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992126372

This paper makes an analysis of the best practices and measures proposed at European level to promote sustainable transport in urban centres, recommendations addressed to citizens and local authorities based on the best practices and successful projects implemented in some European cities. There are emphasized some organizing and planning measures for developing urban transport by adopting green solutions and mobility initiatives, aimed to reduce the air pollution, to use the urban area and the energy resources more efficiently. The paper also presents several case studies of European cities where policies of sustainable transport were implemented successfully. They may be regarded as successful examples for adopting green mobility practices in Romania. © 2017, ICPE Electra Publishing House.

Drawbacks to the environmental background are the pollutant emissions, which are formed as a result of maloperation, suboptimal furnace construction or the biomass fuel composition. The named primary factors can be influenced by several measures, but the achievable emission results are limited. To provide real clean combustion technology with nearly zero pollutant emissions, secondary emission reduction measures are necessary. One of these measures is the application of catalytic flue gas cleaning as integrated or downstream solution. Catalysis is already a state of the art element in many processes and following this, some studies reveal already its potential to reduce CO, VOC as well as particle emissions in small-scale biomass combustion systems. However, a wide application of catalysts in wood combustion units didn't take place so far, because the challenging process conditions demand a proper integration and highly stable and active catalytic materials. For the achievement of well-functioning combustion systems with catalyst solutions a procedure for application-oriented characterization is presented. Initial investigations with commercially available catalysts have shown that the gas hourly space velocity and the oxygen content have the most significant influence on the conversion rate of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. Two samples with different active phases have been compared, one with solely metal oxides and one with metal oxides and noble metals. The one with noble metals showed as expected a higher activity, but also a higher stability. © The authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032590775

Haryono No. 167, Malang City, 65145, Indonesia","Green city initiatives are expected to continue growing as a strategic issue of urban development in Indonesia. This spirit is motivated by several factors that are namely, a rapid urban growth which ignores the ecological functions; followed by floods and landslide disasters; and is also strengthened by global warming issues and climate change. These aforementioned factors encourage cities to become clean and enter the race of the greening movement. With various species of flowers and shrubs planted, the urban housing in Malang City has become more beautiful and cooler. Through photosynthesis in daylight, plants absorb CO2 and release O2. On the other hand, plant respiration, in the night, absorbs O2 and releases CO2. This study aims to understand the relation of vegetation presence to CO2 concentrations in dense urban housing. Through regression analysis, urban canyon ratio and vegetation densities are positioned as independent variables to find out how strong their contribution is to the level of CO2 concentration during the day and nighttime. The research result show that at daytime, urban canyon ratio and vegetation density, collectively, give no significant contribution to CO2 concentration flux. If we eliminate urban canyon ratio from the regression model, vegetation density has a significant effect (partially) on decreasing CO2 concentration in the dense urban housing at day time. However it's not too high compared with the intercept factor (another variable that isn't examined in this research). At nighttime, urban canyon ratio and vegetation density, collectively, give significant contributions to CO2 concentration flux. The urban canyon ratio has the most significant role in the regression model. Meanwhile, vegetation density has weak significance, but it doesn't undermine the regression model confidence. Therefore, we could determine that urban canyon ratio and vegetation, together, bring a significant effect to CO2 concentration in dense urban housing at nighttime. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

Permafrost thaw also stimulates plant growth, which could offset C loss. Using data from 7 years of experimental Air and Soil warming in moist acidic tundra, we show that Soil warming had a much stronger effect on CO2 flux than Air warming. Soil warming caused rapid permafrost thaw and increased ecosystem respiration (Reco), gross primary productivity (GPP), and net summer CO2 storage (NEE). Over 7 years Reco, GPP, and NEE also increased in Control (i.e., ambient plots), but this change could be explained by slow thaw in Control areas. In the initial stages of thaw, Reco, GPP, and NEE increased linearly with thaw across all treatments, despite different rates of thaw. As thaw in Soil warming continued to increase linearly, ground surface subsidence created saturated microsites and suppressed Reco, GPP, and NEE. However Reco and GPP remained high in areas with large Eriophorum vaginatum biomass. In general NEE increased with thaw, but was more strongly correlated with plant biomass than thaw, indicating that higher Reco in deeply thawed areas during summer months was balanced by GPP. Summer CO2 flux across treatments fit a single quadratic relationship that captured the functional response of CO2 flux to thaw, water table depth, and plant biomass. These results demonstrate the importance of indirect thaw effects on CO2 flux: plant growth and water table dynamics. Nonsummer Reco models estimated that the area was an annual CO2 source during all years of observation. Nonsummer CO2 loss in warmer, more deeply thawed soils exceeded the increases in summer GPP, and thawed tundra was a net annual CO2 source. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Arctic; carbon; ecosystem respiration; experimental warming; gross primary productivity; net ecosystem exchange; permafrost; thaw; tundra","carbon dioxide; experimental study; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; observational method; permafrost; primary production; thawing; tundra; warming; Arctic; Eriophorum vaginatum; carbon dioxide; soil; Arctic; carbon cycle; permafrost; soil; tundra; Arctic Regions; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Permafrost; Soil; Tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016743605

This study represents the first national assessment of methane in aquifers used for public supply in the U.S. and, as such, advances the understanding of the occurrence and distribution of methane in groundwater nationally. Methane concentrations >1 and > 10 mg/L occurred in 6.7 and 1.1% of the samples, respectively. Most high concentrations occurred in aquifers in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain regions and upper Midwest. High methane concentrations were most commonly associated with Tertiary and younger aquifer sediments, old groundwater (>60 years), and concentrations of oxygen, nitrate-N, and sulfate <0.5 mg/L. Concentrations of methane were also positively correlated (p < 0.05) with dissolved organic carbon and ammonium. Case studies in Florida, Texas, and Iowa were used to explore how regional context from this data set could aid our understanding of local occurrences of methane in groundwater. Regional data for methane, Br/Cl ratios, sulfate, and other parameters helped identify mixing processes involving end members such as wastewater effluent-impacted groundwater, saline formation water, and pore water in glacial till that contributed methane to groundwater in some cases and supported methane oxidation in others. © 2017","Groundwater; Methane","Aquifers; Carbon; Effluents; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Methanation; Organic carbon; Saline water; Dissolved organic carbon; Geochemical conditions; Gulf coastal plains; Methane concentrations; National assessment; Occurrence and distribution; Public supply wells; Wastewater effluents; Methane; aquifer; concentration (composition); data set; dissolved organic carbon; effluent; groundwater; methane; oxidation; porewater; wastewater; water supply; well; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026727070

Preliminary studies have indicated surface monoethanolamine could influence the greater chemistry of CO2 uptake. MEA is known to be surface active and orients at aqueous surfaces such that its nitrogen lone pair electrons are pointing toward the gas phase. This MEA orientation has the potential to facilitate CO2 surface chemistry; however, a thorough description of the chemistry at play during this important carbon capture reaction is lacking. These studies investigate the surface behavior of MEA during CO2 gas flow, monitoring product formation and species migration. A combination of experimental vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS), surface tensiometry, molecular dynamics simulations, and density functional calculations are used to investigate this complex chemistry. CO2 is shown to react with MEA, perturbing the interface and leading to the presence of carbamic acid in the surface region. However, throughout this chemistry the surface remains largely populated by unreacted MEA. These studies provide insight into this important carbon capture reaction and provide a framework for future work examining interfacial reactions and dynamics.

A lot of studies have shown that hyperphosphatemia, is the main factor in the development of cardiovascular calcification. Recently, the use of sevelamer has emerged as a substitute for calcium carbonate for the reduction of serum phosphate in patients with renal failure. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of sevelamer in reducing serum phosphate in patients with renal failure on hemodialysis with that of calcium carbonate. The study was conducted in the dialysis unit in Al-Diwaniya teaching hospital, Al-Diwaniya province, Iraq. The present case-control study included 48 CKD disease patients on regular hemodialysis. They were divided into 2 groups; the first received calcium carbonate as a PO4 reducing agent while the second group received sevelamer as a PO4 reducing agent and the then patients were followed up for 3 months. The results showed that treatment with calcium carbonate and sevelamer were successful in significantly reducing serum PTH and serum PO4 and also both were successful in raising mean serum calcium significantly; however, sevelamer was more powerful in reducing serum PO4 and in raising serum calcium than calcium carbonate. Nevertheless, the change in serum PTH in both groups was approximately similar with no significant difference in magnitude of reduction. It has been concluded that sevelamer is significantly better than calcium carbonate in reducing serum PO4 in CKD on regular hemodialysis. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation.","Chronic kidney disease; Hemodialysis; Sevelamer","calcium carbonate; parathyroid hormone; phosphate; sevelamer; adult; Article; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery calcification; glomerulus filtration rate; hemodialysis; human; hyperphosphatemia; kidney failure; middle aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039840426

Here, changes in biospheric carbon fluxes with recent climate change and impacts of the major droughts of the past 30 years on continental carbon cycle across NA were studied using a comprehensive mathematical process model, ecosys. In test of these model responses at continental scale, the spatial anomalies in modeled leaf area indices, fully prognostic in the model, from long-term (1980–2010) means during major drought events in 1988 and 2002 agreed well with those in AVHRR NDVI (R2 = 0.84 in 1988, 0.71 in 2002). Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) modeled across NA declined by 92% (0.50 Pg C yr−1) and 90% (0.49 Pg C yr−1) from the long-term mean (+0.54 Pg C yr−1), in 1988 and 2002 respectively. These significant drops in NEP offset 28% of the carbon gains modeled over the last three decades. Although the long-term average modeled terrestrial carbon sink was estimated to offset ∼30% of the fossil fuel emissions of NA, only 0.03% and 3.2% were offset in 1988 and 2002 leaving almost all fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. These major drought events controlled much of the continental-scale interannual variability and mainly occurred in parts of the Great Plains, southwest US and northern Mexico. Although warming in northern ecosystems caused increasing carbon sinks to be modeled as a result of greater gross primary productivity with longer growing seasons, elsewhere in the continent frequent drought events of the past 30 years reduced carbon uptake and hence net carbon sinks of the NA. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon source and sink; Climate change; ecossys; Ecosystem modeling; North America carbon cycle; North America drought","AVHRR; biosphere; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate change; climate effect; drought; ecosystem modeling; emission; fossil fuel; NDVI; net ecosystem production; numerical model; source-sink dynamics; Great Plains; Mexico [North America]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020026726

Mineral deposits formed in four main periods: Oligocene (33–25 Ma), early Miocene (22–19 Ma), middle to late Miocene (14–7 Ma), and Pliocene-Pleistocene (3–1.5 Ma). These metallogenic periods occurred in response to slab-rollback and migration of post-collisional calc-alkaline to shoshonitic magmatism in a back-arc extensional regime from the Rhodopes through the Cyclades, and to arc-related magmatism along the active south Aegean volcanic arc. Invasion of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust occurred due to slab retreat, and were responsible for partial melting of metasomatized lithosphere and lower crustal cumulates. These geodynamic events took place during the collapse of the Hellenic orogen along large detachment faults, which exhumed extensive metamorphic core complexes in mainly two regions, the Rhodopes and the Cyclades. The detachment faults and supra-detachment basins controlled magma emplacement, fluid circulation, and mineralization. The most significant mineralization styles comprise porphyry, epithermal, carbonate-replacement, reduced intrusion-related gold, intrusion-related Mo-W and polymetallic veins. Porphyry and epithermal deposits are commonly associated with extensive hydrothermal alteration halos, whereas in other cases alteration is of restricted development and mainly structurally controlled. Porphyry deposits include Cu-Au-, Cu-Mo-Au-Re, Mo-Re, and Mo-W variants. Epithermal deposits include mostly high- and intermediate-sulfidation (HS and IS) types hosted in volcanic rocks, although sedimentary and metamorphic rock hosted mineralized veins, breccias, and disseminations are also present. The main metal associations are Cu-Au-Ag-Te and Pb-Zn-Au-Ag-Te in HS and IS epithermal deposits, respectively.

We found that soil warming results in a four-phase pattern of soil organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial soil carbon loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of soil carbon loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition.

The results show that the assimilation method which this paper implemented can not only utilize the satellite-retrieved SCF and SD data sufficiently but also avoid the inconsistency of them. Two experiments were designed and performed to quantify the impacts of snow on land surface energy balance using the integrated urban land model.

And there is little research on the structural analysis of the upstream supply chain for Scope 3. However, a comprehensive urban GHG accounting system is the basis for cities to make appropriate mitigation measures. Identifying the main embodied GHG that dominate the emissions in upstream supply chains can help focus attention on the largest emitters and offer insights into where climate mitigation efforts should be directed. Thus, in this study the Economic Input Output – Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) approach was used to evaluate the embodied GHG emissions from Scope 3 and to explore the related GHG emissions structure in the upstream supply chain based on the final demand for the key urban materials. And food, water, steel, cement, and fuel were selected as the representative urban materials based on the characteristic of Xiamen City. Our results demonstrate that the total embodied GHG emissions were 13,201.31 kt CO2e, very close to the direct GHG emissions from end-use sectors inside Xiamen city. Among the embodied GHG emissions, imported steel, fuels, cement, food, and water accounted for 56, 26, 13, 4, and 1% of the emissions, respectively. The main embodied GHG emissions contributors were found in the upstream supply chain and some related policy implications were presented. Compared to other cities, Xiamen had a relatively low per capita embodied GHG emission, which was 5.24 t CO2e lower than eight U.S. cities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","EIO-LCA; Embodied energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Structural analysis; Xiamen","Carbon dioxide; Cements; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Public policy; Structural analysis; Supply chains; Accounting system; Climate mitigations; Economic input-output life cycle assessments; EIO-LCA; Embodied energy; Mitigation measures; Policy implications; Xiamen; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008217222

Still, little is known about black carbon (BC), a short-lived warming agent. Identifying the drivers of urban BC emissions is crucial for targeting cleanup efforts. A consumption-based approach enables all emissions to be allocated along the production chain to the product and place of final consumption, whereas a production approach attributes emissions to the place where goods and services are produced. In this study, we calculate the production-based and consumption-based emissions in 2012 in four Chinese megacities: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing. The results show that capital formation is the largest contributor, accounting for 37%–69% of consumption-based emissions. Approximately 44% of BC emissions related to goods consumed in Chongqing and more than 60% for Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin occur outside of the city boundary. The large gap between consumption and production-based emissions can be attributed to the great difference in embodied emission intensities. Therefore, collaborative efforts to reduce emission intensity can be effective in mitigating climate change for megacities as either producers or consumers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; Decomposition analysis; Input-output analysis; Megacities","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Black carbon; Black carbon emission; Decomposition analysis; Embodied emissions; Emission intensity; Input output analysis; Megacities; Production approach; Particulate emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014451558

Meanwhile, social protection programs have been discussed as strategies not only to address the current socioeconomic issues, but also to deal with vulnerabilities related to the capacity of people to cope with climate change. However, limited information remains available on the impacts of those social protection programs to beneficiaries, precluding further insights over the totality of effects due to program participation. In addition, the role of current environmental shocks and climate change over program functioning is far from being understood. Herein we investigate the perceived impacts, according to institutional actors, of a Brazilian food-based safety net program (Food Acquisition Program - PAA) on participating farmers, and the impacts of an extended drought on program functioning. Projections of changes in climate according to global and regionalized models provided in the literature were also used to discuss possible impacts on crops procured by the PAA. Overall, based on the interviews, PAA was perceived as positive with a diversity of effects at farm, household and community levels, while the extreme drought in 2012 impacted the program through the decreased availability of produce and even disruption of services. Changes in climate in the Northeast region will impact key crops procured by the program with possible consequences over all groups of beneficiaries if business stays as usual, requiring ex-ante adaptation over the various levels of program functioning. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V. and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Brazil; Climate change; Food security; Semi-arid regions; Social protection","climate change; climate effect; developing world; drought; food safety; food security; nature-society relations; questionnaire survey; rural area; semiarid region; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030158759

Restoration plans that incorporate the addition of agricultural drainage water can simultaneously increase the success of achieving a target hydroperiod and reduce discharge of nitrogen to nearby surface water. The potential nitrogen removal effectiveness of two wetland restoration sites with such a restoration plan was evaluated in a two-year mesocosm study. Six large wetland mesocosms (3.5 m long × 0.9 m wide × 0.75 m deep) along with unplanted controls were used in this experiment. Three replicates of two soils that differed in organic matter and pH were planted with soft-stem bulrush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) and allowed to develop in the two growing seasons prior to the study. Simulated drainage water was loaded into the mesocosms over eighteen batch studies across seasons with target nitrate-N levels between 2.5 to 10 mg L−1. Grab samples were collected from the water column and analyzed for nitrate-N, dissolved organic carbon, and chloride, along with other environmental parameters such as pH, water temperature, and soil redox. Seasonally, nitrogen and carbon within the wetland plants and soil were also measured. Multivariate statistical analyses were utilized to determine differences in nitrate-N reductions between treatments. Variables included carbon availability, temperature, antecedent moisture condition, nitrogen loading, and water pH. Contrary to the hypothesis that higher nitrate-N removal rates would be observed in the wetlands with higher organic matter, overall removal rates were higher in the wetland mesocosms containing Deloss soils (WET-Min) (maximum of 726 mg m−2 d−1) than those containing Scuppernong soil (WET-Org) (maximum of 496 mg m−2 d−1) and were dependent on daily NO3-N concentrations and season. Significant differences in NO3-N removal were found between seasons and soil types (α = 0.05), which helped to provide insight to the expected magnitude of nitrogen removal within these systems throughout the year, and potential mechanisms (i.e. denitrification vs. plant uptake) that will govern these removals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dissolved organic carbon; Mesocosms; Nitrate; Wetland restoration","Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Chlorine compounds; Multivariant analysis; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Restoration; Soils; Stream flow; Surface waters; Wastewater disposal; Wetlands; Agricultural drainage water; Coastal plain watersheds; Dissolved organic carbon; Environmental parameter; Mesocosms; Multivariate statistical analysis; Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani; Wetland restoration; Nitrogen removal; chloride; coastal plain; discharge; dissolved organic carbon; drainage water; efficiency measurement; environmental factor; environmental restoration; hydroperiod; mesocosm; multivariate analysis; nitrate; pollutant removal; sedge; water column; wetland; United States; Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021448951

The main systems used are boilers fired by Liquefied Petroleum Gas or Diesel oil, air-source heat pumps and flat plate solar collectors. The results show that the combination of air-source heat pumps with flat plate solar collectors leads to the lowest primary energy consumption. Therefore, improving the sustainability of the tourism sector in Cyprus requires to phase out the usage of boiler systems that are currently in use in almost all four star and five star hotels and promote the use of solar thermal systems in combination with air-source heat pumps. These findings are relevant for island states and other popular tourist destinations sharing similar characteristics with those of Cyprus and provide a framework for national authorities to plan an appropriate energy and environmental upgrade of the hotel stock. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; Carbon dioxide emissions mitigation strategies; Cyprus; Hot-water production; Hotel primary energy consumption; Primary energy mitigation strategies; Tourism","Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Diesel fuels; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas fired boilers; Global warming; Heat pump systems; Hotels; Liquefied petroleum gas; Oil fired boilers; Pumps; Solar collectors; Solar equipment; Stars; Sustainable development; Water; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cyprus; Hot-water production; Mitigation strategy; Primary energy consumption; Tourism; Air source heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020234694

Positron emission tomography has already been successfully used to measure the residual radioactivity from (γ, n) reactions in the patient after the treatment with hadron therapy or highenergy gamma-ray radiotherapy (above ∼20 MV) [1], [2]. When trying to use a similar approach for gamma-rays of lower energies (most commonly 6 to 18 MV) the only source of positrons is prompt pair production in the beam, calling for measurements while the linac is operating and saturating the detector. The problems with saturation were alleviated to a formidable extent by using advanced digital processing techniques to measure energies of incident particles at rates beyond 10 Mcps per each scintillation crystal. The approach suggested by [3] builds on the discovery that there is a strong correlation between the delivered dose and the density of pair production. Our research confirmed the findings, but only as long as homogeneous objects were involved. In an inhomogeneous object, the annihilation density was no longer proportional to the dose, but rather to the density of deposited energy. This means that the intimate knowledge of the material density is required for proper reconstruction of the dose field image from the PET measurement. Additionally, one gets 2-4 mm thick regions at material boundaries where the charge particle equilibrium gets broken and the correlation no longer holds. This is, in principle, possible to account for based on CT data that is always available in such cases, but definitely calls for further work. © 2016 IEEE.","Dose monitoring; Dosimetry; Nuclear imaging; Positron emission tomography; Radiotherapy","Computerized tomography; Dosimetry; Electrons; Medical imaging; Photons; Positron emission tomography; Positrons; Radioactivity; Radiotherapy; Semiconductor detectors; Dose monitoring; Homogeneous objects; Inhomogeneous objects; Material boundaries; Nuclear imaging; Processing technique; Residual radioactivities; Scintillation crystals; Gamma rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041519086

Scholars have long argued that environmental preferences decline during economic downturns as individuals prioritize short-term economic needs over longer-term environmental concerns. Yet, this assumption has rarely been subjected to rigorous empirical scrutiny at the individual level. The presumed link between economic and environmental preferences is revisited, using the first individual-level opinion panel (n = 1043) of US climate attitudes, incorporating both self-reported and objective economic data. In contrast with prior studies that emphasize the role of economic downturns in driving environmental preference shifts, using a stronger identification strategy, there is little evidence that changes in either individual economic fortunes or local economic conditions are associated with decreased belief that climate change is happening or reduced prioritization of climate policy action. Instead, the evidence suggests that climate belief declines are associated with shifting political cues. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of political conflict over environmental policy globally. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; economy–environment tradeoff; public opinion","climate change; economic conditions; environmental economics; environmental policy; political conflict; trade-off; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019028257

With the December 2015 consensus adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement, it is important to accurately quantify anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Methane ebullition, or methane bubbles originating from river or lake sediments, has been shown to account for nearly all methane emissions from tropical hydropower reservoirs to the atmosphere. However, distinct ebullitive methane fluxes have been studied in comparatively few temperate hydropower reservoirs globally. This study measures ebullitive and diffusive methane fluxes from two eastern Washington reservoirs, and synthesizes existing studies of methane ebullition in temperate, boreal, and tropical hydropower reservoirs. Ebullition comprises nearly all methane emissions (>97%) from this study's two eastern Washington hydropower reservoirs to the atmosphere. Summer methane ebullition from these reservoirs was higher than ebullition in six southeastern U.S. hydropower reservoirs, however it was similar to temperate reservoirs in other parts of the world. Our literature synthesis suggests that methane ebullition from temperate hydropower reservoirs can be seasonally elevated compared to tropical climates, however annual emissions are likely to be higher within tropical climates, emphasizing the possible range of methane ebullition fluxes and the need for the further study of temperate reservoirs. Possible future changes to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and UNFCCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories highlights the need for accurate assessment of reservoir emissions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).","Ebullition; Greenhouse gas; Hydropower; Methane; Reservoir; Temperate","Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Methane; Reservoirs (water); Tropics; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Ebullition; Greenhouse gas inventory; Hydro power production; Hydropower; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Temperate; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Gas emissions; methane; water; methane; anthropogenic effect; emission inventory; environmental assessment; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; international agreement; methane; reservoir; temperate environment; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; environmental policy; freshwater environment; gas diffusion; greenhouse gas; human; hydropower; operator; reservoir; temperature; Washington; water quality; analysis; atmosphere; chemistry; climate; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; lake; river; season; United States; Washington [United States]; Atmosphere; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Gases; Lakes; Methane; Power Plants; Rivers; Seasons; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025435122

The treatment of urea with N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) temporarily inhibits urease activity and reduces NH3 volatilization loss under many agro­ecological conditions. However, the amount of straw on the soil in green sugarcane trash blanketing (GCTB) systems affects the success of NBPT in reducing NH3 loss. We hypothesized that an increase in the NBPT concentration in urea above the current level (530 mg NBPT kg−1 urea) in Brazil is necessary to reduce the NH3 volatilization and to improve the efficiency of urea in GCTB systems. We evaluated the NH3 loss from urea treated with NBPT under field conditions in GCTB systems. Six field trials were conducted across the State of São Paulo, the main sugarcane-growing region in Brazil. The treatments were urea, ammonium nitrate, urea treated with NBPT at concentrations of 530, 850, 1500, and 2000 mg kg−1, and a control plot without N fertilizer. The amount of volatized NH3 was assessed through a closed semi-static collector containing two acid-trap foam disks, and analyzed by colorimetry using flow injection analysis. NBPT concentrations above 530 mg kg−1 delayed the time of maximum rate of loss and also reduced cumulative NH3 loss. Ammonia emissions were linearly reduced with increasing NBPT concentrations until 1000 mg kg−1. Any further increase in the NBPT concentration did not result in a substantial reduction of NH3 volatilization. Increasing the NBPT concentration in urea is an effective approach to optimize the adoption of urea-based fertilizers in tropical GCTB systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Green sugarcane trash blanket; N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide; NBPT; Nitrogen; Stabilized fertilizer","ammonia; ammonium; concentration (composition); crop residue; emission control; enzyme activity; foam; inhibitor; optimization; sugar cane; volatilization; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027234148

At −0.6 V versus RHE more than 90 % Faradaic efficiency towards CO was achieved on a pre-oxidized silver foil. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that oxygen species can survive in the bulk of the catalyst during the reaction, quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the surface is metallic under reaction conditions.

This remarkable urban development will probably end in vegetation reduction even though each mega city requires adequate areas of vegetation, which is considered to be crucial and helpful for these cities from a wide variety of perspectives such as air pollution reduction, soil erosion prevention, and eco system as well as environmental protection. One of the optimum methods for monitoring this vital component of each city is multi-temporal satellite images acquisition and using change detection techniques. In this research, the vegetation and urban changes of Mashhad, Iran, were monitored using an object-oriented (marker-based watershed algorithm) post classification comparison (PCC) method. A Bi-temporal multi-spectral Landsat satellite image was used from the study area to detect the changes of urban and vegetation areas and to find a relation between these changes. The results of this research demonstrate that during 1987-2017, Mashhad urban area has increased about 22525 hectares and the vegetation area has decreased approximately 4903 hectares. These statistics substantiate the close relationship between urban development and vegetation reduction. Moreover, the overall accuracies of 85.5% and 91.2% were achieved for the first and the second image classification, respectively.

This study has been conducted at three levels. At the first level, three context-based climatic solutions including shading, natural ventilation, and insulation of external walls and roofs were identified and selected based on bibliographic study. At the second level, a case study reflecting the current typology of common residential buildings in Bushehr city was selected. A combination of the mentioned climatic solutions was used in the baseline case to create a developed model. Based on the space layout of the developed model and some design criteria, a series of proposed models was also created and modeled. The selected case study building was also used to establish a local weather station at a height of 12 m based on the roof, collecting local climate data which were then used for simulation to improve simulation accuracy. Finally, all models were simulated with the use of Design Builder software under natural ventilation conditions during moderate climatic periods of the year while split air-conditioning systems were used during hot and humid periods. The results showed reductions of 16% in energy consumption and 22% in CO2 emissions for the developed model, and reductions of 24-26% in energy consumption and 32-34% in CO2 emissions for the proposed models, as compared with the baseline model. Furthermore, all proposed models achieved lower annual energy consumption when compared with a selection of international sustainable low energy standards and domestic energy performance references for the Middle East region. Further studies are also recommended, and there is potential for combining VCS with other solutions such as on-site renewable energies. © 2017 by the authors.

This study aims to contribute to the development of a decision support tool to prepare water resources managers and planners for climate change adaptation. The Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (The Water Balance Department of the Hydrological Bureau) hydrologic model was used to define the boundary conditions for the reservoir capacity yield model comprising daily reservoir inflow from a representative example watershed with the size of 14,924 km2 into a reservoir with the capacity of 6.80 Gm3. The reservoir capacity yield model was used to simulate variability in climate change-induced differences in reservoir capacity needs and performance (operational probability of failure, resilience, and vulnerability). Owing to the future precipitation reduction and potential evapotranspiration increase during the worst case scenario (−40% precipitation and +30% potential evapotranspiration), substantial reductions in streamflow of between −56% and −58% are anticipated for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Furthermore, model simulations recommend that as a result of future climatic conditions, the reservoir operational probability of failure would generally increase due to declined reservoir inflow. The study developed preparedness plans to combat the consequences of climate change and drought. © 2017, The Author(s).","Alteration measure; Precipitation; Reservoir operation and reliability; Sustainable development; Water resources availability; Weather variability","Arid regions; Climate models; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Failure analysis; Planning; Precipitation (chemical); Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Sustainable development; Water resources; Alteration measure; Arid and semi-arid areas; Arid and semi-arid regions; Climate change adaptation; Potential evapotranspiration; Reservoir operation; Water resources availability; Weather variability; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; drought; precipitation assessment; semiarid region; strategic approach; sustainable development; water availability; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018267087

Various efforts have been initiated to assess the technology and enhance its efficiency during production. In this article, a comprehensive review of foaming warm mix asphalt (WMA) techniques, foaming theory and mechanisms, research and development as well as characterization procedures are presented. This paper also summarized numerous research and paving applications using foaming WMA technologies in Europe, the United States, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand and some other countries. Findings from laboratory tests and field performance are also presented. Based on several field trials, the performance of foaming WMA is comparable to conventional HMA. The United States was found to be the most active country working on research-based and field trial evaluations on WMA besides two European countries: Germany and Norway. In addition to reducing energy consumption, reductions in fuel usage have significantly reduced the stack emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide. This review concludes with some recommendations in terms of diversifying the foaming agent and selection of test parameters in order to have a better precision and repeatability of test results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy demand; Foam quality; Foamed binder; Low emission asphalt; Mixture performance; Service characteristics","Asphalt; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Characterization procedures; Energy demands; Low emission; Mixture performance; Reducing energy consumption; Research and development; Service characteristics; Warm mix asphalt (WMA); Asphalt mixtures",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021686060

Asphaltenes can block pore throats or change the formation wettability and thereby reduce the hydrocarbon mobility. Simulation of asphaltene precipitation during gas injection requires a comprehensive thermodynamic model, which accounts for the complex phase behavior of asphaltenes. In this paper, PC-SAFT EOS is implemented for the first time in a compositional reservoir simulator to model asphaltene precipitation. The additional computational time of PC-SAFT compared to the cubic equations-of-state such as Pen-Robinson (PR EOS) is decreased by improving its root finding algorithm. A deposition and wettability alteration model is then integrated with the thermodynamic model to simulate the dynamics of precipitated asphaltenes. Different gas injection scenarios are modeled to show the effect of gas injection on apshaltene precipitation and deposition. Simulation results show that the profile of the damaged area by asphaltene deposition is governed by the shape of the asphaltene precipitation envelope for the reservoir fluid. The damage caused by asphaltene deposition, through plugging and wettability alteration, was revealed as a decline in productivity index curves. Results indicate that a reservoir fluid can have precipitation risk during gas injection even if it does not exhibit precipitation in the primary recovery life of a field. The computational time of the simulations using PC-SAFT EOS were compared to those using PR EOS for different number of components. Results of these comparisons show the feasibility of using PC-SAFT in compositional simulations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Asphaltene; Deposition; PC-SAFT EOS; Precipitation; Reservoir simulation","Deposition; Equations of state; Gases; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Precipitation (chemical); Thermodynamic properties; Well flooding; Wetting; Asphaltene precipitation; Compositional reservoir simulators; Compositional simulations; Cubic equations of state; PC-SAFT EoS; Reservoir simulation; Root finding algorithms; Wettability alteration; Asphaltenes; algorithm; asphaltene; computer simulation; fluid injection; hydrocarbon reservoir; numerical model; oil field; precipitation (chemistry); wettability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031943080

At first, patterns of urbanization were calculated and then global Moran index has been used in the analysis of spatial pattern changes. The results showed that central and northern regions of the country, particularly Isfahan and Tehran, in all courses have a positive spatial autocorrelation pattern and its intensity has increased in recent times.

This is particularly effective in subvolcanic substrates where intense hydrothermal alteration and/or weathering processes generally form hydrous minerals, such as zeolites able to store and release great amounts of H2O (up to ~25 wt.%) at relative low temperatures. To better understand the role played by thermally induced devolatilization reactions on the radon signal, a new experimental setup has been developed for measuring in real time the radon emission from a zeolitized volcanic tuff. Progressive dehydration phenomena with increasing temperature produce radon emissions two orders of magnitude higher than those measured during rock deformation, microfracturing and failure. In this framework, mineral devolatilization reactions can contribute significantly to produce radon emissions spatially heterogeneous and non-stationary in time, resulting in a transient state dictated by temperature gradients and the carrier effects of subsurface gases. Results from these experiments can be extrapolated to the temporal and spatial scales of magmatic processes, where the ascent of small magma batches from depth causes volatile release due to dehydration phenomena that increase the radon signal from the degassing host rock material. © The Authors 2017.","Heat flow; Hydrothermal systems; Magma chamber processes; Volcanic gases; Volcanic hazards and risks","Clay alteration; Dehydration; Geochemical surveys; Heat transfer; Substrates; Temperature; Thermal gradients; Volcanoes; Weathering; Hydrothermal alterations; Hydrothermal system; Increasing temperatures; Magma chamber; Orders of magnitude; Temporal and spatial scale; Volcanic gas; Volcanic hazards and risks; Radon; geochemical survey; hazard assessment; heat flow; hydrothermal system; magma; radon; risk assessment; temperature gradient; volcanic gas; Calluna vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033410593

By combining the two approaches, it is possible to estimate the relative importance of emitters in different regions. PM2.5 samples were collected in Gothenburg between September 2008 and September 2009. The mean daily PM2.5 level was 6.1 μg m-3 (range 0.79-30.91 μg m-3). Elemental analyses were done using Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectroscopy. Source apportionment was carried out using the US EPA PMF 5.0 software. The sources long-range transport (LRT), LRT-Pb (lead-containing LRT), ship emissions, combustion, marine, and resuspension were identified. Air mass trajectories were estimated using HYSPLIT model (version 4.9). Six transport clusters were identified: South Scandinavia 21%, North Scandinavia 11%, Baltic Sea 8%, Eastern Europe 6%, UK/North Sea/Denmark 25%, and North Atlantic Ocean 30%. LRT was the major contributor to PM2.5 levels across all six transport clusters (48%) followed by ship emissions (20%) and combustion (19%). The transport cluster associated with the highest PM2.5 levels was Eastern Europe followed by South Scandinavia, UK/North Sea/Denmark, and Baltic Sea. After considering the frequency of the transport clusters, the transport clusters associated with the highest PM2.5 levels were UK-NorthS-DK, S-Scandic, and N-Atlantic, while Eastern Europe only contributed 9% towards PM2.5 levels.

For the final state, we use a continuum distorted wave that contains the product of three-Coulomb distortion due to pairwise Coulombic interactions for which it is called the three-Coulomb wave model. In the entrance channel, the Coulomb distortion between the incoming projectile and the target is taken. In this model, the ground state of the polyatomic molecule is described by means of an accurate one-center molecular wave function, which is a linear combination of atomic orbitals. The contributions of DDCSs for different molecular orbitals of the polyatomic molecules to the spectrum of angular distributions at different electron emission energies have also been analyzed. Generally the preference for ionization depends on the binding energy of the active electron in molecular orbital in the ascending order of loosely bound electrons to more tightly bound electrons. At large ejected electron and projectile energy, the lesser bound electrons in the molecules dominate the DDCS at extreme forward emission angles. The present DDCS results are compared with available experimental and the theoretical findings. In case of ammonia molecules, good agreement is observed at all projectile energies, showing that the present model is sufficient to explain all the experimental data for double-differential cross sections. However, some degree of discrepancy is observed at 2 MeV proton impact for small electron emission angles when CH4 molecular target is considered. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Binding energy; Distortion (waves); Electrons; Ground state; Impact ionization; Ionization; Laser produced plasmas; Molecular orbitals; Molecules; Projectiles; Quantum chemistry; Wave functions; Continuum distorted waves; Coulombic interactions; Double differential cross sections; Electron emission energy; Linear combination of atomic orbitals; Loosely bound electrons; Molecular wave functions; Polyatomic molecules; Electron emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029578858

We used a diverse set of observations (AmeriFlux eddy covariance tower observations, biomass estimates from tree-ring data, and leaf area index (LAI) measurements) to compare C fluxes, pools, and LAI data with those predicted by a land surface model (LSM), the Community Land Model (CLM4.5). We ran CLM4.5 for nine temperate (including evergreen and deciduous) forests in North America between 1980 and 2013 using four different C allocation schemes: dynamic C allocation scheme (named ""D-CLM4.5"") with one dynamic allometric parameter, which allocates C to the stem and leaves to vary in time as a function of annual net primary production (NPP); ii. an alternative dynamic C allocation scheme (named ""DLitton""), where, similar to (i), C allocation is a dynamic function of annual NPP, but unlike (i) includes two dynamic allometric parameters involving allocation to leaves, stem, and coarse roots; iii.-iv. a fixed C allocation scheme with two variants, one representative of observations in evergreen (named ""F Evergreen"") and the other of observations in deciduous forests (named ""F-Deciduous""). D-CLM4.5 generally overestimated gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration, and underestimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE). In D-CLM4.5, initial aboveground biomass in 1980 was largely overestimated (between 10 527 and 12 897 g Cm-2) for deciduous forests, whereas aboveground biomass accumulation through time (between 1980 and 2011) was highly underestimated (between 1222 and 7557 gCm-2) for both evergreen and deciduous sites due to a lower stem turnover rate in the sites than the one used in the model. D-CLM4.5 overestimated LAI in both evergreen and deciduous sites because the leaf C-LAI relationship in the model did not match the observed leaf C- LAI relationship at our sites. Although the four C allocation schemes gave similar results for aggregated C fluxes, they translated to important differences in long-term aboveground biomass accumulation and aboveground NPP. For deciduous forests, D-Litton gave more realistic Cstem - Cleaf ratios and strongly reduced the overestimation of initial aboveground biomass and aboveground NPP for deciduous forests by D-CLM4.5. We identified key structural and parameterization deficits that need refinement to improve the accuracy of LSMs in the near future. These include changing how C is allocated in fixed and dynamic schemes based on data from current forest syntheses and different parameterization of allocation schemes for different forest types.Our results highlight the utility of using measurements of aboveground biomass to evaluate and constrain the C allocation scheme in LSMs, and suggest that stem turnover is overestimated by CLM4.5 for these AmeriFlux sites. Understanding the controls of turnover will be critical to improving long-term C processes in LSMs. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aboveground biomass; biomass; biomass allocation; carbon flux; climate modeling; eddy covariance; land surface; leaf area index; net ecosystem exchange; net primary production; parameterization; temperate forest; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Atlantic Coast [United States]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029945440

Although both such effects have been documented within plant species' native ranges, how the balance of these forces influences local adaptation in invasive plant populations is less clear, in part because introduced species often have lower genetic variation initially but also tend to have good dispersal abilities. To evaluate the extent of gene flow and adaptation to local climate in invasive populations of Solidago canadensis, and the implications of this for range expansion, we compared population differentiation at microsatellite and chloroplast loci for populations across Switzerland and assessed the effect of environmental transfer distance using common gardens. We found that while patterns of differentiation at neutral genetic markers suggested that populations are connected through extensive pollen and seed movement, common-garden plants nonetheless exhibited modest adaptation to local climate conditions. Growth rate and flower production declined with climatic distance from a plant's home site, with clones from colder home sites performing better at or above the range limit. Such adaptation in invasive species is likely to promote further spread, particularly under climate change, as the genotypes positioned near the range edge may be best able to take advantage of lengthening growing seasons to expand the range. © 2017 Moran et al.

Due to a lack of direction and clarity at the policy level and deep political divides, the evolution of the international climate regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) had failed to catch up with the changes occurring in the real economy. The momentum created ahead of COP21 in 2015 and resulting Paris Agreement has changed this, creating a new paradigm of international climate policy, politics and cooperation that is, if implemented, capable of generating the momentum needed to accelerate the pace of change and drive transformation. This new paradigm that emerged from the Paris Agreement, demonstrates the role of the United Nations in giving voice to smaller countries to create effective positive powerful coalitions and the need to invite the outside world into the process through greater participation of cities, business, investors and other non-state actors. We outline the main policy and political shifts that the Paris Agreement represents, and explain why this new paradigm of international climate policy, politics and cooperation is key to accelerating the pace of change and keeping the world well below 2°C, and optimally 1.5°C.

Electrification offers a medium to long term solution, but there remains a need to significantly reduce internal combustion engine emissions in the short and medium term, and potentially in the long term for long range inter city transportation. Late injection low temperature combustion (LTC) has the potential to achieve ultra-low emissions levels in a compression ignition engine by increasing the lean pre-mixed burn fraction. However, significant quantities of diluent are normally required to achieve the required delay in ignition and pre-mixing to achieve LTC. This results in high boost requirements, increased pumping work and the complexity of the air handling system and potentially adversely impacting fuel economy. In this paper, results from a single cylinder light duty research engine are presented using a novel ramped combustion chamber focused at mid to high engine loads. The ramped combustion chamber improves mixing and enables more retarded injection timings than those possible on conventional bowl designs. This combustion strategy has enabled LTC conditions to be achieved at lower dilution rates, typically 20-30% at loads up to 15bar IMEP. CFD analysis of the air-fuel interaction indicates the ramped bowl effectively deflects fuel away from the squish region enabling very late injection timings. One dimensional analysis of the engine system was used to investigate the potential of late exhaust valve opening in improving work recovery, resulting in improved fuel consumption over the baseline LTC valve timings.

These two groups reflect distinct aquiferous structures and feeding strategies. In the NW Mediterranean coralligenous community, HMA and LMA sponges are often packed in dense, multispecies assemblages that cover many pinnacles and overhangs. We investigated the metabolism of HMA and LMA species that cohabitate the coralligenous community by sampling in situ the inhaled and exhaled water. Sponges consumed plankton, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and ammonium in relation to their abundance in ambient water. The plankton retention efficiency was high for all species. DOC was the main source of C for the sponge species, accounting for ∼ 90% of the examined sources. Nitrogen fluxes markedly differed between the two groups: plankton was the main source of nitrogen for LMAs that excreted dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and ammonium. The nitrogenous waste products of LMAs were found to be the major source of nitrogen (up to 97%) for HMAs that efficiently removed DON and ammonium and excreted nitrate. The different capacity of both sponge strategies to use dissolved resources suggests a partial trophic niche separation related to HMA-LMA dichotomy as a mechanism facilitating their dense co-existence in the community. Our findings suggest that a mixed assemblage of sponges (and their associated microbes) is able to utilize the suspended particulate and dissolved material more efficiently than a single species population and may contribute to the understanding of the phenomena of the stability and diversity of dense sponge assemblages in oligotrophic habitats. © 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"abundance; ammonium; bacterium; biomass; carbon cycle; coexistence; community composition; community structure; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic nitrogen; metabolism; nitrogen cycle; sponge; trophic level; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019128461

Transmission electron microscopy also revealed the (3 + 1)D incommensurately modulated character of AgxEu3+(2-x)/3□(1-2x)/3WO4 (x = 0.286, 0.2) phases.

The excitation spectra of AgxEu3+(2-x)/3□(1-2x)/3WO4 (x = 0.5, 0.286, 0.2) phosphors show the strongest absorption at 395 nm, which matches well with the commercially available n-UV-emitting GaN-based LED chip. The excitation spectra of the Eu2/3□1/3WO4 and Gd0.367Eu0.30□1/3WO4 phases exhibit the highest contribution of the charge transfer band at 250 nm and thus the most efficient energy transfer mechanism between the host and the luminescent ion as compared to direct excitation.

Concentration dependence of the 5D0 → 7F2 emission for AgxEu(2-x)/3□(1-2x)/3WO4 samples differs from the same dependence for the earlier studied NaxEu3+(2-x)/3□(1-2x)/3MoO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) phases. The intensity of the 5D0 → 7F2 emission is reduced almost 7 times with decreasing x from 0.5 to 0, but it practically does not change in the range from x = 0.286 to x = 0.200.

The potential of polycentric governance for promoting both climate mitigation and adaptation is well established. Yet, dominant conceptualizations of polycentric governance pay scant attention to how power dynamics affect the structure and the outcomes of climate action. We review emerging evidence on power within polycentric and distributed governance across the climate, forestry, marine, coastal, urban, and water sectors, and relate them to established positions on power within research on federalism, decentralization, international relations, and networked governance. We develop a typology of design, pragmatic, and framing power that focuses on how and in whose interests power is mobilized to achieve outcomes. We propose that the conceptual model helps to explain power dynamics across different sectors and across both climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Also, in order to apply environmental indicators for agricultural decision making purposes, the environmental burden of different residue management practices were compared. Primary data were collected from 150 rapeseed farms from the Iranian Mazandaran province. The system considers a cradle-to-farm gate boundary, and the functional unit was regarded as being one Mg of rapeseed production. The LCA results indicate that the global warming potential amounts to 1181.6 kg CO2eq Mg−1. Also, the acidification and eutrophication potentials were found to be 23.3 kg SO2eq Mg−1 and 18 kg PO43eq Mg−1, respectively. The results also reveal that environmental emissions of crop production were significantly affected by residue management practices. Specifically, rapeseed residue removal from the field is the most environmentally-friendly practice. This is followed by a scenario involving residue incorporation in the soil. The practice of burning such residue entails the highest environmental emissions. In conclusion, reducing the consumption of chemical fertilisers, especially nitrogen based ones, is important for decreasing the environmental footprints in the area. Furthermore, avoiding crop residue burning and developing rapeseed-bean rotation are favourable management strategies for establishing more environmentally-friendly rapeseed production systems in the region. © 2017","Canola; Environmental performance; LCA; Rapeseed; Residue; Straw","Agricultural wastes; Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Global warming; Life cycle; Oilseeds; Straw; Canola; Environmental performance; Environmentally-friendly practices; Eutrophication potentials; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Rapeseed; Residue; Environmental management; acidification; agricultural management; agricultural practice; crop residue; cultivation; decision making; environmental indicator; eutrophication; functional role; leafy vegetable; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; straw; Iran; Mazandaran; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018993089

Quantifying the contribution of fossil fuel and biomass combustion to BC and OC concentrations is critical for developing and validating effective air quality control measures and climate change mitigation policy. We used radiocarbon (14C) to measure fossil and contemporary biomass contributions to BC and OC at three locations in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, during 2012–2014, including during winter inversion events. Aerosol filters were analyzed with the Swiss_4S thermal-optical protocol to isolate BC. We measured fraction modern (fM) of BC and total carbon in PM2.5 with accelerator mass spectrometry and derived the fM of OC using isotope mass balance. Combined with 14C information of end-member composition, our data set of 31 14C aerosol measurements provided a baseline of the fossil and contemporary biomass components of carbonaceous aerosol. We show that fossil fuels were the dominant source of carbonaceous aerosol during winter, contributing 88% (80–98%) of BC and 58% (48–69%) of OC. While the concentration of both BC and OC increased during inversion events, the relative source contributions did not change. The sources of BC also did not vary throughout the year, while OC had a considerably higher contemporary biomass component in summer at 62% (49–76%) and was more variable. Our results suggest that in order to reduce PM2.5 levels in Salt Lake City to meet national standards, a more stringent policy targeting mobile fossil fuel sources may be necessary. ©2017.

We measured monthly, growing-season fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O at a large thermokarst feature in alpine tundra on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Thermokarst formation disrupted plant growth and soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a growing-season carbon sink to a weak source but decreasing feature level CH4 and N2O flux. Temperature-corrected ecosystem respiration from decomposing permafrost soil was 2.7 to 9.5-fold higher than in similar features from Arctic and Boreal regions, suggesting that warmer and dryer conditions on the northern QTP could accelerate carbon decomposition following permafrost collapse. N2O flux was similar to the highest values reported for Arctic ecosystems and was 60% higher from exposed mineral soil on the feature floor, confirming Arctic observations of coupled nitrification and denitrification in collapsed soils. Q10 values for respiration were typically over 4, suggesting high-temperature sensitivity of thawed carbon. Taken together, these results suggest that QTP permafrost carbon in alpine tundra is highly vulnerable to mineralization following thaw, and that N2O production could be an important noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. Permafrost collapse altered soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a carbon sink to carbon source but decreasing CH4 and N2O flux. Little to no vegetation recovery after stabilization suggests potentially large net carbon losses. High N2O flux compared to Arctic and Boreal systems suggests noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

The aim of this work was to study the feasibility of exogenous H2 addition for an in situ biogas upgrading through biological conversion of the biogas CO2 into CH4. Moreover, this study employed systematic study with isotope analysis for providing comprehensive evidence on the underlying pathways of CH4 production and upstream processes. Batch reactors were inoculated with digestate originating from a full-scale biogas plant and fed once with maize leaf substrate. Periodic addition of H2 into the headspace resulted in a completely consumption of CO2 and a concomitant increase in CH4 content up to 89%. The microbial community and isotope analysis shows an enrichment of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium and the key role of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for biogas upgrading to higher CH4 content. Excess H2 was also supplied to evaluate its effect on overall process performance. The results show that excess H2 addition resulted in accumulation of H2, depletion of CO2 and inhibition of the degradation of acetate and other volatile fatty acids (VFA). A systematic isotope analysis revealed that excess H2 supply led to an increase in dissolved H2 to the level that thermodynamically inhibit the degradation of VFA and stimulate homo-acetogens for production of acetate from CO2 and H2. The inhibition was a temporary effect and acetate degradation resumed when the excess H2 was removed as well as in the presence of stoichiometric amount of H2 and CO2. This inhibition mechanism underlines the importance of carefully regulating the H2 addition rate and gas retention time to the CO2 production rate, H2-uptake rate and growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in order to achieve higher CH4 content without the accumulation of acetate and other VFA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 reduction; H2 addition; Homo-acetogenesis; In situ biogas upgrading; Power to gas; Stable isotope","Batch reactors; Biogas; Carbon; Fatty acids; Isotopes; Methanogens; Volatile fatty acids; Biogas upgrading; Biological reductions; H2 addition; Homo-acetogenesis; Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Microbial communities; Stable isotopes; Carbon dioxide; acetic acid; biogas; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; methane; volatile fatty acid; biofuel; biogas; carbon dioxide; feasibility study; hydrogen; methane; stable isotope; addition reaction; Article; biodegradation; biotransformation; controlled study; feasibility study; inhibition kinetics; isotope analysis; maize; Methanobacterium; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; plant leaf; priority journal; stoichiometry; thermodynamics; bioreactor; Euryarchaeota; Methanobacterium; Zea mays; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Euryarchaeota; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020727870

We present a thorough investigation of the cool and hot temperature components in four recurring active region jets observed on July 10, 2015 using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), X-ray Telescope (XRT), and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) instruments. Methods. A differential emission measure (DEM) analysis was performed on areas in the jet spire and footpoint regions by combining the IRIS spectra and the AIA observations. This procedure better constrains the low temperature DEM values by adding IRIS spectral lines. Plasma parameters, such as Doppler velocities, electron densities, nonthermal velocities and a filling factor were also derived from the IRIS spectra. Results. In the DEM analysis, significant cool emission was found in the spire and the footpoint regions. The hot emission was peaked at log T [K] = 5.6-5.9 and 6.5 respectively. The DEM curves show the presence of hot plasma (T = 3 MK) in the footpoint region. We confirmed this result by estimating the Fe XVIII emission from the AIA 94 Å channel which was formed at an effective temperature of log T [K] = 6.5. The average XRT temperatures were also found to be in agreement with log T [K] = 6.5. The emission measure (EM) was found to be three orders of magnitude higher in the AIA-IRIS DEM compared with that obtained using only AIA. The O IV (1399/1401 Å) electron densities were found to be 2.0×1010 cm-3 in the spire and 7.6 × 1010 cm-3 in the footpoint. Different threads along the spire show different plane-of-sky velocities both in the lower corona and transition region. Doppler velocities of 32 km s-1 (blueshifted) and 13 km s-1 (redshifted) were obtained in the spire and footpoint, respectively from the Si IV 1402.77 Å spectral line. Nonthermal velocities of 69 and 53 km s-1 were recorded in the spire and footpoint region, respectively. We obtained a filling factor of 0.1 in the spire at log T [K] = 5. Conclusions. The recurrent jet observations confirmed the presence of significant cool emission co-spatial with the coronal emission. © ESO, 2017.","Sun: atmosphere; Sun: corona; Sun: transition region; Sun: UV radiation","Atmospheric temperature; Carrier concentration; Electron density measurement; Spectroscopy; Temperature; Thermal logging; Velocity; Differential emission measures; Effective temperature; Imaging spectrograph; Sun : corona; Sun: atmosphere; Sun:transition region; Sun:UV radiation; Three orders of magnitude; Fighter aircraft",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029812130

We combine a transient perturbed physics ensemble with a set of initialised forecasts to deduce regional process errors present in the standard HadCM3 model, which cause the model to drift in the early stages of the forecast. First, it is shown that the transient drifts in the perturbed physics ensembles can be used to recover quantitatively the parameters that were perturbed. The parameters which exert most influence on the drifts vary regionally, but upper ocean mixing and atmospheric convective processes are particularly important on the 1-month timescale. Drifts in the initialised forecasts are then used to recover the ‘equivalent parameter perturbations’, which allow identification of the physical processes that may be at fault in the HadCM3 representation of the real world. Most parameters show positive and negative adjustments in different regions, indicating that standard HadCM3 values represent a global compromise. The method is verified by correcting an unusually widespread positive bias in the strength of wind-driven ocean mixing, with forecast drifts reduced in a large number of areas as a result. This method could therefore be used to improve the skill of initialised climate model forecasts by reducing model biases through regional adjustments to physical processes, either by tuning or targeted parametrisation refinement. Further, such regionally tuned models might also significantly outperform standard climate models, with global parameter configurations, in longer-term climate studies. © 2016, The Author(s).","Climate model optimisation; HadCM3; Model drift; Perturbed physics","atmospheric convection; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; error analysis; mixing; optimization; parameterization; quantitative analysis; timescale; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992422459

They are acclaimed as promising instruments for coping with climate risk. However, research on their impacts has mainly focused on economic considerations. Studies on broader social and ecological consequences are sparse and have produced ambiguous and inconclusive results. We address this knowledge deficit by (a) advocating for a holistic view of social-ecological systems and vulnerability when considering insurance impacts; (b) offering a systematic overview highlighting the potential beneficial and adverse effects of ‘climate insurance’ in agriculture, particularly where programs target intensifying agricultural production; and (c) suggesting preliminary principles for avoiding maladaptive outcomes, including specific recommendations for designing appropriate impact studies and insurance programs. Our synopsis brings together scientific knowledge generated in both developing and developed countries, demonstrating that agricultural insurance programs shape land-use decisions and may generate serious economic, social, and ecological consequences. If insurance is to be an appropriate tool for mitigating the impacts of climate change, it needs to be carefully developed with specific local social-ecological contexts and existing risk coping strategies in mind. Otherwise, it is liable to create long-term maladaptive outcomes and undermine the ability of these systems to reduce vulnerability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agroecology; Climate change adaptation; Index insurance; Resilience; Smallholder agriculture; Vulnerability","agricultural production; agroecology; agrometeorology; climate change; developing world; insurance system; smallholder; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026434289

It was developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada to deliver operational real-time forecasts of biomass-burning pollutants, in particular fine particulate matter (PM2.5), over North America. Such forecasts provide guidance for early air quality alerts that could reduce air pollution exposure and protect human health. A multi-year (2013-2016) analysis of FireWork forecasts over a five-month period (May to September) was conducted. This work used an archive of FireWork outputs to quantify wildfire contributions to total PM2.5 surface concentrations across North America. Different concentration thresholds (0.2 to 28 μg/m3) and averaging periods (24 h to five months) were considered. Analysis suggested that, on average over the fire season, 76% of Canadians and 69% of Americans were affected by seasonal wildfire-related PM2.5 concentrations above 0.2 μg/m3.

Despite considerable research on species responses to changing climate, we still lack understanding of the role of specific climatic factors, and their interactions, for species responses. We also lack understanding of the relative importance of plasticity vs. adaptation in determining the observed responses. As a model, we use a dominant clonal grass, Festuca rubra, originating from a natural climatic grid of 12 localities in western Norway that allows factorial combinations of temperature (mean growing season temperatures ranging from 6·5 to 10·5 °C) and precipitation (annual precipitation ranging from 600 to 2700 mm). We grew clones from all populations in four growth chambers representing the four climatic extremes in the climate grid (warm/cold × wet/dry). Genetic differentiation and direction and magnitude of plastic responses vary systematically among populations throughout the climatic grid. Growth-related plant traits are highly plastic and their degree of plasticity depends on their origin. In contrast, the traits reflecting species' foraging strategy are not plastic but vary with the climate of origin. Levels of plasticity of growth-related traits and genetically differentiated foraging traits thus might constrain local populations' ability to cope with novel climates. Synthesis. Shifts in temperature and precipitation, at the scale and direction expected for the region in the next century, are likely to dramatically affect plant performance. This study illustrates how the interplay between genetic differentiation and plasticity in response to both temperature and precipitation will affect the specific responses of species to climate change. Such complex responses will affect how climate-change impacts scale up to the community and ecosystem levels. Future studies thus need to specifically consider regionally relevant climate-change projections, and also explore the role of genetic differentiation and plasticity and how this varies within local floras. Our study also demonstrates that even widespread species with seemingly broad climatic niches may strongly differ in their population performance and plasticity. Climate-change studies should therefore not be limited to rare and restricted species. © 2017 The Authors.

These markers can then be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) in fruit crops such as apple. The GWAS approach involves both phenotyping of a large population of mostly unrelated individuals for the traits of interest, and genotyping at high marker density. In the EU-FP7 project FruitBreedomics, almost 1,200 European diploid dessert apple accessions (old and/or local cultivars) from six germplasm collections were genotyped with the Affymetrix Axiom-Apple480K array (487,000 SNPs). Phenotypic data on a large number of traits have been gathered during the project. Here we focus on flowering period and harvesting date. Knowledge of the genetic control of these traits is necessary to develop cultivars that can face the challenges imposed by global climate change and to target cultivar development as a function of a prolonged vegetation period in the production regions. Different models were tested, including control for effects of population structure and relatedness between cultivars. The full model, controlling for both structure and relatedness, was shown to be the most appropriate to avoid spurious marker-trait associations. When analyzing data over all collections, one significant marker-trait association was obtained for each trait, on chromosomes 9 and 3, for flowering period and harvesting date, respectively. Thereby, genomic locations previously identified in bi-parental populations could now be confirmed for a genetically diverse germplasm.","Germplasm collections; Malus × domestica; Marker-assisted selection",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031715217

In order to better model changes within climate systems, it is important to study lake ice processes. Although the availability of records for lake ice through ground measurements has declined in recent years, the increased use of remote sensing provides an alternative to this. Using a preclassified snow and ice remote sensing product with a 500-m resolution, based on images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/MOD10A1), and the use of measured and reanalysis temperature data, this study evaluated lake ice phenology dates in connection to recent trends in temperature and 0 °C isotherms within Ontario and Manitoba between 2001 and 2014. Temperature trends indicated both regional warming and cooling, with significant cooling observed in Southern Ontario (p <.05) and significant warming in Southern Manitoba (p <.1) during the fall. Spatial analysis of the trends in the lake ice data showed significant clustering of significant trends in ice on dates (p <.01). When analysing the trends in ice phenology in connection to the trends in temperature, it was found that 70% of lakes experienced a change in the ice on date with the expected change in temperature and 85% of lakes for ice off date. When shifting ice on and ice off dates are investigated in relation to 0 °C isotherms, it was seen that 80% of ice on dates and 100% of ice off dates shifted in sync with the isotherm dates. This demonstrates that the ice phenology of lakes in Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, is responding to short-term variability in temperature. The MODIS product could be used to investigate ice phenology on a large scale and contribute towards expanding existing records of ice phenology. Establishing long-term ice records could be a valuable asset for other research ranging from water balance studies to the response of lake biota under changing climate.

The proposed control strategy is developed on the same model evaluated for the standard Urban driving cycles at medium and higher operating conditions in the fuel economy perspective. It has the potential to deal better with the engine throttling effect and to enhance its thermal efficiency that will result in significant improvement in performance, fuel economy and emissions reduction. The controllability analysis of the EMVEM model in viewpoint of control design is carried out with respect to the alternative control input.

Media coverage of air pollution issues plays an important role in influencing public opinion and increasing citizen demand for action on clean air policy. Hence, this study was designed to assess news coverage of air pollution in India and its implications for policy advancement. Methods Articles published online between 1 January 2014 and 31 October 2015 that discussed air pollution in India were systematically content analysed. From 6435 articles in the national media and 271 articles in the international media, a random selection of 500 articles (400 from national and 100 from international media) were analysed and coded by two independent coders, after high inter-rater reliability (kappa statistic above 0.8) was established. Results There was an increase in the number of news stories on air pollution in India in the national media over the study period; 317 (63%) stories described the risk to health from air pollution as moderately to extremely severe, and 393 (79%) stories described the situation as needing urgent action. Limited information was provided on the kinds of illnesses that can result from exposure. Less than 30% of stories in either media specifically mentioned the common illnesses resulting from air pollution. Very few articles in either media mentioned the population groups most at risk from air pollution, such as children or older people. Vehicles were presented most often as the cause of air pollution in India (in over 50% of articles in both national and international media). Some of the most important sources of air pollution were mentioned less often: 6% of national and 18% of international media articles mentioned unclean sources of household energy; 3% of national and 9% of international media articles mentioned agricultural field burning. Finally, the majority of articles (405; 81%) did not mention any specific institution or organization - such as the government or industry groups - as the primary responsible stakeholder, thus leaving ambiguous the organizations whose leadership was necessary to mitigate air pollution. Conclusion Gaps exist in the current media discourse on air pollution, suggesting the need for strengthening engagement with the media as a means of creating citizen engagement and enabling policy action. Through greater elaboration of the health burdens and evidence-based policy actions, the media can play a critical role in galvanizing India's action on air quality. These data may suggest opportunities for media advocacy and greater public and policy engagement to address issues around air quality in India.",,"air pollution; health care policy; human; India; Internet; mass medium; risk; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollution; Health Policy; Humans; India; Internet; Mass Media; Risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046988569

Paitan Lake is located in the northern part of Luzon Central Plain, 88 km northeast of Pinatubo Volcano. It's a crater lake with a surface area of 0.8 km2. Its drainage basin has an area of 38.5 km2 and has an outflow-river with a width of only a few meters. These cores consisted of two units: (1) an upper alternating bed of mud and peaty layers, from depths 0–6 m; and (2) a lower dark gray to gray mud bed, obtained from depths 6–28 m. Eight tephras were recognized, on the split surface of the cores. Radiocarbon ages of seven plant fragments, from 1.50 to 13.41 m depths, and twelve organic sediments, from 4.72 to 28.00 m depths were measured by the AMS facilities of KIGAM, Nagoya University and Institute of Accelerator Analysis Ltd.

However, in India, climate change has become a serious concern for ensuring nutritional security for the growing population. Small ruminants, especially pastoral farming, serve a major livelihood option and are embedded deep in the culture of resource-poor small and marginal farmers of arid and semiarid western India. The breeds of these arid and semiarid region are well adapted to the local climatic condition and have amalgamated themselves to very harsh climatic factors in the region. The local native animals of this region have their own adaptive mechanism of altering physiological, neuroendocrine, biochemical, cellular, and molecular process to encounter the stress; still, they need to endure stressful conditions due to high temperature, low feed, and water scarcity. All these constraints expose the sheep production into heat stress, nutritional stress, water stress, walking stress, and their combinations. All the stress factors affecting sheep production directly and indirectly and ultimately lead to compromised performance, lower efficiency, and increased mortality and affect the immune system. Giving the poor farmer's economic security, under changing climatic scenario, sheep production has to be sustainable by combating the detrimental effect of different mitigation strategies. In the present chapter, the mitigation strategies have been discussed which include genetic improvement, breeding management, grazing management, nutritional management, utilization of unconventional feed resources, antioxidant supplementation, water management, shelter management, and disease management. Basically, all these strategies are based on a physical modification of the environment, genetic modification, and improved nutritional management. To get optimum production under changing climatic scenario, holistic approach is needed as per the environmental conditions and available resources. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043819684

Here, we present sea level rise (SLR) projections for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) storylines and different year-2100 radiative forcing targets (FTs). Future SLR is estimated with a comprehensive SLR emulator that accounts for Antarctic rapid discharge from hydrofracturing and ice cliff instability. Across all baseline scenario realizations (no dedicated climate mitigation), we find 2100 median SLR relative to 1986-2005 of 89 cm (likely range: 57-130 cm) for SSP1, 105 cm (73-150 cm) for SSP2, 105 cm (75-147 cm) for SSP3, 93 cm (63-133 cm) for SSP4, and 132 cm (95-189 cm) for SSP5. The 2100 sea level responses for combined SSP-FT scenarios are dominated by the mitigation targets and yield median estimates of 52 cm (34-75 cm) for FT 2.6 Wm-2, 62 cm (40-96 cm) for FT 3.4 Wm-2, 75 cm (47-113 cm) for FT 4.5 Wm-2, and 91 cm (61-132 cm) for FT 6.0 Wm-2. Average 2081-2100 annual SLR rates are 5 mm yr-1 and 19 mm yr-1 for FT 2.6 Wm-2 and the baseline scenarios, respectively. Our model setup allows linking scenario-specific emission and socioeconomic indicators to projected SLR. We find that 2100 median SSP SLR projections could be limited to around 50 cm if 2050 cumulative CO2 emissions since pre-industrial stay below 850 GtC, with a global coal phase-out nearly completed by that time. For SSP mitigation scenarios, a 2050 carbon price of 100 US$2005 tCO2 -1 would correspond to a median 2100 SLR of around 65 cm. Our results confirm that rapid and early emission reductions are essential for limiting 2100 SLR. © 2017 The Author(s).

Findings have indicated that an arts-rich education can assist limited English speakers, many of them considered to be at-risk students, to achieve at higher levels. This article examines a number of districts with growing Hispanic populations that have implemented standards-based mariachi programs and found success in engaging Spanish speaking English learners, their parents, and the Hispanic community at large in the process. Some of these districts had considerable issues needing to be resolved but innovative solutions have led to student success. One district that serves as a model to be replicated is chronicled in detail due to how its creative program implementation subsequently informed policy. School climate data is also provided by another district, which broke down its reporting according to subgroup. Although the data do not measure only those who were enrolled solely in mariachi courses, the major findings are significant in that they indicate how music coursework impacts Latino students specifically.

A central goal is to establish the performance of state-of-the-art boundary-layer schemes for weather and climate models for this cloud regime, using large-eddy simulations of the same scenes as a reference. A novelty is that the comparison covers four different cases instead of one, in order to broaden the covered parameter space. Three cases are situated in the North-Eastern Pacific, while one reflects conditions in the North-Eastern Atlantic. A set of variables is considered that reflects key aspects of the transition process, making use of simple metrics to establish the model performance. Using this method, some longstanding problems in low-level cloud representation are identified. Considerable spread exists among models concerning the cloud amount, its vertical structure, and the associated impact on radiative transfer. The sign and amplitude of these biases differ somewhat per case, depending on how far the transition has progressed. After cloud breakup the ensemble median exhibits the well-known “too few too bright” problem. The boundary-layer deepening rate and its state of decoupling are both underestimated, while the representation of the thin capping cloud layer appears complicated by a lack of vertical resolution. Encouragingly, some models are successful in representing the full set of variables, in particular, the vertical structure and diurnal cycle of the cloud layer in transition. An intriguing result is that the median of the model ensemble performs best, inspiring a new approach in subgrid parameterization. © 2017.

Alpha diversity indices have been frequently used to examine the relationships between biodiversity and environmental factors. However, studies concerning the relationships between beta diversity and environmental factors are few despite the fact that beta diversity gives more information about ecosystem stability against internal and external threatening factors. The present study was carried out to examine beta plant diversity and climatic factors in Kuyucak Mountain District of the Mediterranean region. Methodology: Bioclimatic data was obtained from www.wordclimdata.org for the district. Bioclimatic variables having cell size 752x752 m were storied in the GIS. Four sample plots were taken in each selected cell by controlling from GIS. Coverage values of plant species were recorded in the sample plots. After field survey, beta plant diversities of the cells were calculated by using Whittaker Beta Index (ßw). Next, regression analysis was applied to show the relationship between beta diversity and bioclim variables.

We examined if the law had an impact on the relationship between physicians in the Israeli health system and the pharmaceutical industry. Methods: We conducted 42 in-depth semi-structured interviews with representatives of relevant stakeholders regarding the effects and extent of the law and the interviewees' attitudes about regulating the relationship between physicians and PCs. In addition, we analyzed reports on payments from PCs to various components of the health system. Results: The majority of interviewees agreed that transparency is important to the relationship between PCs and physicians and none of them opposed the disclosure of payments. Most interviewees reported to have witnessed a change in the regulatory climate of the relationship between PCs and physicians, prompted mostly by self-regulatory measures of the pharmaceutical industry. The most significant change in this relationship appeared to be the enactment of contractual relations between PCs and physicians. There was a pervasive feeling that self-regulation is more effective than state regulation. The impact of the law on the behavior of individual physicians was claimed to be limited at best. Suggested causes were lack of awareness of the law, particularly among physicians; ambiguous definition of ""payments"" and loopholes in the law that attract other forms of remuneration to physicians and lack of enforcement of the law. According to reports published by the Ministry of Health, Pharma Israel, and the Israeli Medical association, although there had been some disclosure of payments by both donors and beneficiaries, there were inconsistencies between the total payments disclosed by PCs and those disclosed by their beneficiaries. Conclusions: There is a broad agreement that transparency is important to the PCs-physicians relationship. In addition, it seems that there was a change in the regulatory climate of that relationship; however, the feeling among the stakeholders is that self-regulation is more effective than state regulation. Therefore, efforts should focus on enforcement of the law and deterrence of its violations, possibly by investigating discrepancies between disclosed payment by donors and beneficiaries. The law should be amended to close loopholes. Furthermore, there should be periodic follow up of relevant databases, and relevant stakeholders should be interviewed in order to seek feedback and identify problems in implementation. © 2017 The Author(s).","Legislation; Payments; Physician-pharmaceutical companies' relationship; Stakeholders; Transparency","Article; autoregulation; awareness; drug industry; health care; human; Israeli; law; law enforcement; medical personnel; medical society; physician; priority journal; professional practice; semi structured interview; training; conflict of interest; drug industry; Israel; legislation and jurisprudence; medical ethics; physician; procedures; qualitative research; remuneration; standards; trends; Conflict of Interest; Drug Industry; Ethics, Medical; Humans; Israel; Physicians; Qualitative Research; Remuneration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029827802

Here we report on the archaeal communities, particularly those involved in methane metabolization, in sediments of a newly discovered cold seep (named 'Haima') on the northwest slope of the South China Sea. Archaeal diversity, abundance and distribution were investigated in two piston cores collected from a seep area (QDN-14B) and a non-seep control site (QDN-31B). Geochemical investigation of the QDN-14B core identified an estimated sulfate-methane transition zone (Estimated SMTZ) at 300-400 cm below sea floor (cmbsf), where a high abundance of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) occurred, as revealed by analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the gene (mcrA) encoding the a-subunit of the key enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase. ANME-2a/b was predominant in the upper and middle layers of the estimated SMTZ, whereas ANME-1b outcompeted ANME-2 in the sulfate-depleted bottom layers of the estimated SMTZ and the methanogenic zone. Fine-scale phylogenetic analysis further divided the ANME-1b group into three subgroups with different distribution patterns: ANME-1bI, ANME-1bII and ANME-1bIII. Multivariate analyses indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon and sulfate may be important factors controlling the composition of the methane-metabolizing community. Our study on ANME niche separation and interactions with other archaeal groups improves our understanding of the metabolic diversity and flexibility of ANME, and the findings further suggest that ANME subgroups may have evolved diversified/specified metabolic capabilities other than syntrophic anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled with sulfate reduction in marine sediments. © FEMS 2017.","ANME; Cold seep; Diversity; Habitat segregation; Methanogens; South China Sea","cold seep; deep-sea organism; enzyme activity; geochemistry; habitat structure; marine sediment; metabolism; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; phylogenetics; prokaryote; species diversity; transition zone; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Archaea; methane; methyl coenzyme M reductase; oxidoreductase; RNA 16S; sea water; sulfate; China; classification; ecosystem; genetics; metabolism; Methanosarcinales; microbiology; phylogeny; sea; sediment; China; Ecosystem; Geologic Sediments; Methane; Methanosarcinales; Oceans and Seas; Oxidoreductases; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040022023

They have a diversified power demand, for example, peak powers of 292-kW driving, 178 kW regenerating, and 7-kW idle power. The high peak power demand determines the system prime mover (internal combustion engine) rating, which is highly over-rated for the crane average energy requirements. Such a variation in peak to idle power demand favors a hybrid power solution which, given appropriate design, can yield significant gains in fuel or energy usage and, importantly, reductions in local emissions, thus improving air-quality. In this study, a hybrid energy source for an RTG crane is presented. The hybrid energy source comprises of a lithium battery and a down-sized diesel-generator connected to the dc link through an active front end unit. While other systems have been previously proposed, the system presented here utilizes a smaller diesel-generator, thus reducing plant and fuel consumption. In addition, the battery connects directly to the dc link reducing system power electronics while improving battery response and efficiency. Experimental results from a full-size evaluation system are presented showing a 57% reduction of fuel consumption compared to a conventional RTG crane system. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Diesel-generator; hybrid energy source; lithium battery; rubber tyred gantry (RTG) crane","Air quality; Cranes; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Fuels; Internal combustion engines; Lithium; Rubber; Active front ends; Appropriate designs; Container terminal; Diesel generators; Hybrid energy sources; Reducing systems; Rubber tyred gantries; Transport equipment; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019497600

We analyzed all rainwater samples for pH, electrical conductivity, and concentration of SO4 2−, NO3 −, Cl−, F, NH4 +, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, and K+. The pH of the 43 analyzed rainfall events ranged from 3.39–6.37, with a volume-weighted mean (VWM) of 4.74; 72% of the precipitation events qualified as acid rainfall (those where the rain pH was &lt;5.6), indicating that acid rain pollution was severe in Lin’an area. Although the ionic concentrations in the Lin’an rainwater were lower than those found in most urban areas in China and in rural areas in India, they were still higher than those in Waliguan (a global atmospheric background station in northwestern China) and in Newark, NJ, USA. We found that SO4 2− and NO3 − were the major anions in the precipitation, accounting for an average of 88% of the total inorganic anions. The SO4 2− concentration was between 3.8–303.9 μeq L−1 with a VWM value of 49.8 μeq L−1, while the NO3 − concentration was between 3.0–206.5 μeq L−1 with a VWM value of 32.6 μeq L−1. The ratios of SO4 2− to NO3 − ranged from 0.71 to 2.56 with an average of 1.53, indicating that SO4 2− was the most significant anion causing rainfall acidification in Lin’an area. This is similar to observations made in 2008. Compared to observations in Lin’an area in 2008, the contribution of SO4 2− to rainwater acidity had decreased due to sharp reduction in SO2 emissions, while the contribution of NO3 − had increased due to a rapid growth in the use of motor vehicles in eastern China. We observed that the alkaline component NH4 + made the largest contribution toward neutralizing rainwater acidity. The neutralization factor (NF) for NH4 + was between 0.26 and 1.03 with an average of 0.63, and the NF for Ca2+ was between 0.09 and 1.21 with an average of 0.30. The ratio of Ca2+ to NH4 + was between 0.15 and 4.70 with an average of 0.48, lower than that observed in Chinese urban areas and close to that observed in non-urban Chinese sites. These results indicated that Ca2+ was still a major factor in buffering rainwater acidity in most urban areas in China, while NH4 + seemed to be the most important basic ion for neutralizing rainwater acidity in non-urban areas. In the Lin’an area, the Cl− and K+ in rainwater were mostly of marine origin; however, SO4 2−, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were generated mainly from the earth’s crust and anthropogenic emissions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Acid rain; Background site; Chemical characteristics; Eastern China; Neutralization factor","acid neutralization; acid rain; acidity; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; background level; chemical analysis; environmental factor; rainfall; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020172526

Its optimization is a main aim of the Sustainable Urban Logistic Plans. Currently, the CO2 analysis of such plans is mostly based on a Tank-To-Wheel approach, which does not consider fuel production and distribution, thus not providing a comprehensive evaluation of its carbon effects. In this paper, we propose an alternative two-step approach: after quantifying CO2 emissions through a Well-To-Wheel methodology, which assesses the entire energy pathway of the fuel, we valuate them economically, using a meta-analysis of 700 studies. We test this model to assess the carbon potentialities of a new Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) in the city of Lucca, Italy. Our results indicate a potential yearly saving of up to 190 tCO2 (which corresponds to about €10,000 of social cost savings). These benefits are mostly obtained through third funds, which make the investment financially sustainable for the municipality. With adequate adaptations, the model can be used in other urban areas to assess the carbon potentiality of different transport measures. Furthermore, an integration of the long-distance freight movement can provide the total CO2 contribution of freight transport. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Lucca; Urban consolidation centre; Urban freight transport; Well-to-wheel analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017379689

Many approaches have been used to predict responses of species and communities to new environmental challenges, including species distribution modelling, glasshouse and growth cabinet experiments, and small-scale field manipulations, all of which have both advantages and limitations. Here, we review the use of a powerful, direct method to predict how species and communities will respond to the changing climate: the field transplant experiment. We discuss how transplant experiments can elucidate the factors that limit species distributions; disentangle the role of genetic change vs. phenotypic plasticity in species’ responses; and improve understanding of the role of species interactions in driving community change. Several generalisations about potential species’ responses to climate change are emerging from these studies, including the critical role of specific life stages in response to warming trends, the role of natural enemies and new hosts in limiting or promoting adaptive capacity, and the role of niche saturation in conferring community stability at a functional guild level.

Legacies of human activities have received little attention as a contributing factor. We examine the extent to which traditional human activities (hunting, herding, fire, wood extraction, and agriculture) have had lasting effects on arctic woody plant communities and therefore might continue to affect biome-wide responses to climate change. Evidence suggests that legacies are likely to be evident across meters to hundreds of kilometers and for decades, centuries, and millennia. The evidence, however, is currently sparse, and we highlight the potential to develop systematic assessments through a circumarctic collaboratory consisting of a network of interdisciplinary field sites, standardized protocols, participatory research, and new approaches. We suggest that human activities should be brought into consideration to increase our understanding of arctic vegetation dynamics in general and to assess woody plant responses to climate change in particular. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

Using a simple analytical model, I first demonstrate that, when combined with a cap-and-trade program, expansions in renewable generation have the potential to cause an undesirable outcome—they can increase emissions of unregulated pollutants. To explore whether this unintended increase in unregulated pollution could occur in practice, I look back at a NOX cap-and-trade program that was in place in the eastern United States from 2009 through 2014—the EPA’s Clean Air Interstate Rule. Using hourly generation and emissions data, I estimate how unregulated emissions of CO2 and SO2 would have been affected by adding new wind turbines and solar panels in the presence of a binding cap on NOX. I show that, once the interaction with the NOX cap is taken into consideration, renewable capacity additions would have offset much less CO2 than was previously thought. Moreover, I find that the renewable additions would have increased SO2 emissions. © 2017 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

Concrete currently incorporates many recycled industrial byproducts such as fly ash and blast furnace slag, which helps reduce the quantity of landfilled materials while reducing CO2. The large volume of drinking water treatment waste (DWTW) generated by all metropolitan cities has motivated many to investigate possible beneficial utilization. Despite the high purity of DWTW, high moisture content and the associated high energy required to dry the material into a readily usable form have prevented beneficial usage from moving forward in any significant capacity. This research evaluates the use of landfilled material in the as-received, moist condition as a cement replacement powder with internal curing properties. The results show that for a high cementitious mix, where internal curing would be recommended to achieve maximum hydration, up to 10 % replacement with DWTW provides equivalent strength and heat of hydration without negatively impacting setting time.

Indonesia is an important participant in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change programme on REDD+. The programme is funded through financial contributions from developed to developing countries, which can eventually be part of a country's nationally determined contribution to reducing emissions, either domestically, or via international emissions trading. Our study finds that there are a number of formal charges, fees and taxes that apply on forest-related activities in Indonesia, which are stipulated within regulations promulgated by various government departments. A range of informal subnational charges also apply to forest-related activities, which has often provided a monetary incentive for local government, especially forest-rich districts, to exploit their timber resources. However, this has been proven as a disincentive for REDD+ implementation in Indonesia. We also find that there is a need for improved financial governance in future fiscal policy reform, which should include the removal of perverse incentives for forest conversion, the equitable and accountable distribution of financial incentives, the prevention of corruption and fraud, and the strengthening of economic benefits for smallholders. We recommend that in implementing the REDD+, the Government of Indonesia should consider providing incentives for the nonexploitation of forests by businesses engaged in the provision of environmental services as well as carbon transactions. This could take the form of private investments, private-public partnerships or civil society engagement in forestry and land use change, and may include incentives such as payment for ecosystem services and for forest ecosystem restoration. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Climate change; Fiscal incentives and disincentives; Indonesia; REDD+",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042459735

To optimise the engine operation a corelation between the substitute ratio of the diesel fuel with LPG and the adjustments for the investigated regimens must be made in order to limit the maximum pressure and smoke level, knock and rough engine functioning, fuel consumption and the level of the pollutant emissions. The test bed situated in the Thermotechnics, Engines, Thermal Equipments and Refrigeration Instalations Department was adapted to be fuelled with liquefied petroleum gas. A conventional LPG fuelling instalation was adopted, consisting of a LPG tank, a vaporiser, conections between the tank and the vaporiser and a valve to adjust the gaseous fuel flow. Using the diesel-gas methode, in the intake manifold of the engine is injected LPG in gaseous aggregation state and the airr-LPG homogeneous mixture is ignited from the flame appeared in the diesel fuel sprays. To maintain the engine power at the same level like in the standard case of fuelling only with diesel fuel, for each investigated operate regimen the diesel fuel dose was reduced, being energetically substituted with LPG. The engine used for experimental investigations is a turbocharged truck diesel engine with a 10.34 dm3 displacement.

Although research has focused on the resistance of tree populations and communities to these novel precipitation regimes, resilience of forests is also contingent on recovery following drought, which remains poorly understood, especially in aseasonal tropical forests. We used rainfall exclusion shelters to manipulate the interannual frequency of drought for diverse seedling communities in a tropical forest and assessed resistance, recovery and resilience of seedling growth and mortality relative to everwet conditions. We found seedlings exposed to recurrent periods of drought altered their growth rates throughout the year relative to seedlings in everwet conditions. During drought periods, seedlings grew slower than seedlings in everwet conditions (i.e., resistance phase) while compensating with faster growth after drought (i.e., recovery phase). However, the response to frequent drought was species dependent as some species grew significantly slower with frequent drought relative to everwet conditions while others grew faster with frequent drought due to overcompensating growth during the recovery phase. In contrast, mortality was unrelated to rainfall conditions and instead correlated with differences in light. Intra-annual plasticity of growth and increased annual growth of some species led to an overall maintenance of growth rates of tropical seedling communities in response to more frequent drought. These results suggest these communities can potentially adapt to predicted climate change scenarios and that plasticity in the growth of species, and not solely changes in mortality rates among species, may contribute to shifts in community composition under drought. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; drought frequency; forest dynamics; phenological shifts; plant–climate interactions; recovery; resistance","climate change; community composition; drought; forest dynamics; growth rate; mortality; phenology; seedling; tropical forest; adaptation; climate change; drought; ecosystem; plant; seedling; tree; tropic climate; Adaptation, Physiological; Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Plants; Seedlings; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014705419

Here, we used transposon sequencing combining hyper-saturated transposon mutagenesis with high-throughput sequencing to define the essential methylotrophy genome of Methylobacterium extorquens PA1, a model methylotroph. To distinguish genomic regions required for growth only on methanol from general required genes, we contrasted growth on methanol with growth on succinate, a non-methylotrophic reference substrate. About 500,000 insertions were mapped for each condition, resulting in a median insertion distance of five base pairs. We identified 147 genes and 76 genes as specific for growth on methanol and succinate, respectively, and a set of 590 genes as required under both growth conditions. For the integration of metabolic functions, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model and performed in silico essentiality analysis. In total, the approach uncovered 95 genes not previously described as crucial for methylotrophy, including genes involved in respiration, carbon metabolism, transport, and regulation. Strikingly, regardless of the absence of the Calvin cycle in the methylotroph, the screen led to the identification of the gene for phosphoribulokinase as essential during growth on methanol, but not during growth on succinate. Genetic experiments in addition to metabolomics and proteomics revealed that phosphoribulokinase serves a key regulatory function.

However, though FCEVs produce zero tailpipe emissions they could, depending on the methods used to generate and distribute hydrogen, be more or less environmentally friendly than EVs or other alternatives. In this study, the authors review state-of-the-art FC technologies and identify the less polluting options. The environmental impact of FCEVs, pure battery EVs and internal combustion engine cars are then modelled, compared and forecast to 2050 under various scenarios.

Copper (Cu) was examined as a co-catalyst, and the results showed that it was effective for the production of CO under a flow of CO 2 and UV irradiation in water. As confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, 13 CO was produced in the presence of 13 CO 2 , thus demonstrating that CO was generated upon photoreduction of CO 2 . Simultaneous formation of O 2 suggested that water acted as a reductant in the photocatalysis process. Moreover, Cu supported on STO(NC)-MPS showed higher selectivity toward CO 2 reduction when compared with Cu-supported composite prepared from mesoporous silica and SrTiO 3 that was synthesized by conventional solid state reaction. Thus, the current findings highlight the characteristics and advantages of SrTiO 3 nanocubes and their nanocomposites with mesoporous silica as photocatalysts for CO 2 photoreduction. © 2017 The Ceramic Society of Japan and the Korean Ceramic Society","Artificial photosynthesis; Carbon dioxide; Photocatalyst; Solar energy","Artificial photosynthesis; Copper compounds; Gas chromatography; Irradiation; Mass spectrometry; Mesoporous materials; Nanocomposites; Photocatalysts; Silica; Solar energy; Solid state reactions; Strontium titanates; Titanium compounds; CO2 reduction; Mesoporous Silica; Photo-reduction; Photocatalysis process; Photocatalytic reduction; Production of CO; Simultaneous formation; UV irradiation; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028956231

However, PCC based on chemical absorption incurs serious energy penalty due to the use of energy for solvent regeneration. Reducing the energy/exergy use in this process can reduce energy penalties. It is also important to increase the efficiency of the CO2 capture system. This study focuses on: steady state simulation of a closed-loop PCC plant integrated with supercritical coal-fired power plant (SCPP); conventional and advanced exergy analyses of the PCC; and case studies on strategies to reduce exergy destruction in the system components. The conventional exergy analysis evaluates the amount and location of exergy destruction within the whole system. The advanced exergetic analysis estimates the sources of the exergy destruction in individual component or the whole system and the potential for reducing it. The results show that the energy consumption and the efficiency of the PCC process can be improved by recovering the avoidable exergy destroyed in the system components. This is important because for every 1% reduction in the energy required for capture, costs can be lowered to between 0.7–1%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced exergy analysis; Chemical absorption; Conventional exergy analysis; Post-combustion CO2 capture; Steady state simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027358718

Modern conservation management strategies (e.g., reductions in livestock stocking rates and adoption of new riparian grazing standards) have been implemented to better balance riparian conservation and livestock production objectives on publicly managed lands. We examined potential relationships between long-term changes in plant community, livestock grazing pressure and environmental conditions at two spatial scales in meadows grazed under conservation management strategies. Changes in plant community were not associated with either livestock stocking rate or precipitation at the grazing allotment (i.e., administrative) scale. Alternatively, both grazing pressure and precipitation had significant, albeit modest, associations with changes in plant community at the meadow (i.e., ecological site) scale. These results suggest that reductions in stocking rate have improved the balance between riparian conservation and livestock production goals. However, associations between elevation, site wetness, precipitation, and changes in plant community suggest that changing climate conditions (e.g., reduced snowpack and changes in timing of snowmelt) could trigger shifts in plant communities, potentially impacting both conservation and agricultural services (e.g., livestock and forage production). Therefore, adaptive, site-specific management strategies are required to meet grazing pressure limits and safeguard ecosystem services within individual meadows, especially under more variable climate conditions. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climate change; Livestock grazing; Long-term; Plant community monitoring; Public lands; Riparian meadows; United States Forest Service","Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Land use; Reduction; Livestock grazing; Long-term; Plant communities; Public lands; Riparian meadows; United States Forest service; Agriculture; climate change; climate conditions; conservation management; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; grazing management; grazing pressure; livestock farming; long-term change; meadow; plant community; riparian vegetation; spatial analysis; climate change; forage; forest; grazing management; livestock; monitoring; nonhuman; plant community; precipitation; United States; animal; animal husbandry; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; grassland; growth, development and aging; herbivory; livestock; procedures; United States; United States; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Grassland; Herbivory; Livestock; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020137033

Here, by using a copper rotating disc electrode, we find that the major hydrogen evolution pathway competing with CO2 reduction is water reduction, even in a relatively acidic electrolyte (pH 2.5). The mass-transport-limited reduction of protons takes place at potentials for which there is no significant competition with CO2 reduction. This selective inhibitory effect of CO2 on water reduction, as well as the difference in onset potential even after correction for local pH changes, highlights the importance of differentiating between water reduction and proton reduction pathways for hydrogen evolution. In-situ FTIR spectroscopy indicates that the adsorbed CO formed during CO2 reduction is the primary intermediate responsible for inhibiting the water reduction process, which may be one of the main mechanisms by which copper maintains a high faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction in neutral media. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Copper; Efficiency; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogen; Pollution control; Acidic electrolytes; Aqueous electrolyte; Carbon dioxide reduction; Faradaic efficiencies; Hydrogen evolution; Inhibitory effect; Reduction of protons; Rotating disc electrode; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029672948

This highlighted important factors that may be associated with the highest areal incidence of lung cancer. Personal exposure of rural residents to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their nitro-derivatives (NPAHs) through inhalation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was investigated in addition to stationary air sampling in an urban area. The personal exposure of the subjects to PM2.5 ranged from 44.4 to 316 μg/m3, and the concentrations of PAHs (4.2–224 ng/m3) and NPAHs (120–1449 pg/m3) were higher than those at the urban site, indicating that personal exposure was affected by microenvironments through individual activities. The smoking behaviors of the rural residents barely affected their exposure to PAHs and NPAHs compared to other sources. The most important factor concerning the exposure of rural populations to PAHs was cooking activity, especially the use of charcoal open fires. The emission sources for rural residents and urban air were evaluated using diagnostic ratios, 1-nitropyrene/pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene/benzo[ghi]perylene. Their analyses showed a significant contribution to emission from residents’ personal activities in addition to the atmospheric environment. Furthermore, the personal inhalation cancer risks for all rural subjects exceeded the USEPA guideline value, suggesting that the residents have a potentially increased cancer risk. The use of open fires showed the highest cancer risk. A reduction in exposure to air pollutants for the residents could potentially be achieved by using clean fuel such as liquid petroleum gas or electricity for daily cooking. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Indoor air; Nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Personal exposure; PM2.5; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Charcoal; Diseases; Exposure controls; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Indoor air pollution; Particles (particulate matter); Risk assessment; Rural areas; Urban growth; Atmospheric environment; Cancer risk assessments; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Indoor air; Nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Personal exposures; PM2.5; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; 1 nitropyrene; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[ghi]perylene; charcoal; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; pyrene; nitro derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; cancer; concentration (composition); fuel consumption; indoor air; PAH; particulate matter; pollution exposure; risk assessment; rural area; air sampling; Article; cancer incidence; cancer risk; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cooking; daily life activity; disease association; environmental exposure; fire; high risk population; human; lung cancer; microenvironment; particulate matter; population exposure; risk assessment; rural area; smoking; Thailand; urban area; adult; air pollutant; analysis; chemically induced; environmental monitoring; exposure; indoor air pollution; neoplasm; procedures; rural population; Lampang; Northern Region [Thailand]; Thailand; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Cooking; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Neoplasms; Nitro Compounds; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Risk Assessment; Rural Population; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029774691

An important remaining uncertainty concerns the role of very short-lived substances (VSLSs) which, owing to their relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (less than 6 months), are not regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Recent studies have found an unexplained increase in the global tropospheric abundance of one VSLS, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), which has increased by around 60% over the past decade. Here we report dramatic enhancements of several chlorine-containing VSLSs (Cl-VSLSs), including CH2Cl2 and CH2ClCH2Cl (1,2-dichloroethane), observed in surface and upper-tropospheric air in East and South East Asia. Surface observations were, on occasion, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported in the marine boundary layer, whilst upper-tropospheric data were up to 3 times higher than expected. In addition, we provide further evidence of an atmospheric transport mechanism whereby substantial amounts of industrial pollution from East Asia, including these chlorinated VSLSs, can rapidly, and regularly, be transported to tropical regions of the western Pacific and subsequently uplifted to the tropical upper troposphere. This latter region is a major provider of air entering the stratosphere, and so this mechanism, in conjunction with increasing emissions of Cl-VSLSs from East Asia, could potentially slow the expected recovery of stratospheric ozone. © 2017 Author(s).",,"atmospheric transport; emission control; industrial emission; Montreal Protocol; ozone; ozone depletion; stratosphere; troposphere; Far East; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031321136

This being due to limited resources, among others, this paper aims to propose a simple and low-cost approach to assess the viability of human activities under climate change. Design/methodology/approach: Many human activities are feasible only within a narrow range of climatic conditions. Comparing such “climate corridors” with future climate projections provides an intuitive yet quantitative means for assessing needs for, and the viability of, adaptation activities under climate change. Findings: The approach was tested within development projects in Pakistan, Peru and Tajikistan. The approach was shown to work well for forestry and agriculture, indicating positive/negative prospects for wheat in two districts in Pakistan, temperature constraints for maize in Peru and widening elevation ranges for walnut trees in Tajikistan. Practical implications: Climate corridor analyses feed into the preparation of Local Adaptation Plans of Action in Pakistan. Originality/value: The simplicity and robustness of climate corridor analysis allow for efficient analysis and communication of climate change impacts. It works when data availability is limited, but it can as well accommodate a wide range of complexities. It has proven to be an effective vehicle for mainstreaming climate change into adaptation planning. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation planning; Climate change adaptation; Climate change communication; Climate corridors; Climate projections; Crop requirements","action plan; adaptive management; climate change; deciduous tree; forestry; human activity; maize; planning method; project assessment; strategic approach; Pakistan; Peru; Tajikistan; Juglans; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030312361

In order to reduce its CO2 emissions, the clinker replacement by ground granulated blast-furnace slag and fly ash is becoming increasingly common. Both additions are well-studied when the hardening conditions of cementitious materials are optimum. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to study the short-term effects of exposure, to both laboratory simulated and real in situ Mediterranean climate environments, on the microstructure and durability-related properties of mortars made using commercial slag and fly ash cements, as well as ordinary Portland cement. The real in situ condition consisted of placing the samples at approximately 100 m away from the Mediterranean Sea. The microstructure was analysed using mercury intrusion porosimetry. The effective porosity, the capillary suction coefficient and the non-steady state chloride migration coefficient were also studied. In view of the results obtained, the non-optimum laboratory simulated Mediterranean environment was a good approach to the real in situ one. Finally, mortars prepared using sustainable cements with slag and fly ash exposed to both Mediterranean climate environments, showed adequate service properties in the short-term (90 days), similar to or even better than those in mortars made with ordinary Portland cement. © 2017 by the authors.","Durability; Fly ash; Ground granulated blast-furnace slag; Mediterranean climate environment; Non-optimum laboratory condition; Ordinary Portland cement; Real condition exposure; Relative humidity; Sustainability; Temperature","Atmospheric humidity; Blast furnaces; Chlorine compounds; Climatology; Durability; Fly ash; Mercury (metal); Microstructure; Mortar; Portland cement; Slag cement; Slags; Sustainable development; Temperature; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Laboratory conditions; Mediterranean climates; Ordinary Portland cement; Real condition exposure; Cements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033380754

Box 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya","Climate-smart approaches have gained momentum in tropical, agricultural development. However, to date, few studies have examined whole-farm greenhouse gas (GHG) balances in smallholder crop-livestock systems. This study aimed to quantify GHG balances at farm-scale, identify GHG hotspots and assess mitigation options in coffee-dairy farms undergoing agricultural intensification in Central Kenya. In recent decades, decreasing farm size has forced the shift from extensive practices to zero-grazing systems and higher nitrogen (N) inputs. We hypothesised that different farm strategies and intensification levels determine the farm's GHG balance. A farm typology was constructed through principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering from 125 farms surveyed. Four farm types were identified ranging relatively from small to large farms, low to high livestock intensities, and low to high N input rates. Whole-farm GHG balances were estimated using an adapted version of the Cool Farm Tool (CFT). Farms were found to be net sources of GHG, averaging from 4.5 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1 in less intensive farms to 12.5 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1 in high intensive farms. Within the farm GHG hotspots identified, methane (CH4) from enteric fermentation processes accounted for 26–39% of total farm GHG emissions; nitrous oxide (N2O) and CH4 from manure management systems (MMS) for 26–38%; soil background and fertilizer induced N2O emissions for 24–29%; off-farm production of feeds and agrochemicals for 10–22%; and crop residue management (CRM) for the remaining 1–3%. Within the mitigation practices assessed, zero-grazing stalls already lowered the livestock maintenance energy requirements, reducing enteric fermentation emissions. Stall-feeding, however, brings the necessity-opportunity to manage the manure and our results showed that MMS can be a determining factor in the GHG balance. Increasing the frequency of manure collection from stalls in favour of solid storage systems can reduce N2O emissions by up to 75%. Furthermore, dry manure storage reduced the CH4 emissions of liquid slurry systems by more than 70%. Further benefits in terms of carbon (C) sequestration were identified along farm types from manure and crop residues applications in soils (with averages of −1.3 to −2.3 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1) and biomass growth in agroforestry systems (−1.2 to −2 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1). Together, soils and woody biomass offset 25–36% of farm emissions. We conclude that reduced farm size and increased livestock density lead to higher emissions per unit area, though this increase is smoothed by larger negative fluxes in soils (by higher C inputs) and woody biomass (by higher tree densities) until a steady state is reached. Average yield-scaled emissions, or product carbon footprints (CFs), resulted in 1.08 kg CO2 eq kg coffee berry−1, 0.64 kg CO2 eq kg maize−1 and 1.05 kg CO2 eq kg milk−1 on average. CFs did not always differ between farm types and intensification levels, meaning that increases in productivity were not higher than increases in GHG fluxes from intensification. This may be due to: 1) increases in productivity are the result of more processes other than N inputs; and/or 2) emissions from N inputs are overestimated by EFs and GHG calculators. Smallholders may benefit in the near future from climate initiatives and further field characterisation, models calibration and monitoring are required to overcome critical levels of uncertainty and provide more accurate estimations of GHG balances at farm-scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry; C sequestration; Carbon footprint; Climate-smart; Coffee; Dairy; Sustainable intensification; Whole-farm GHG balance; Zero-grazing","agricultural development; agricultural intensification; agricultural management; agrochemical; agroforestry; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; coffee; crop residue; dairy farming; farm size; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; growth rate; livestock farming; mixed farming; nitrous oxide; principal component analysis; uncertainty analysis; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026545500

Intense bleaching has caused dramatic coral mortality in many tropical regions in recent decades, but less obvious chronic effects of temperature and other stressors can be equally threatening to the long-term persistence of diverse coral-dominated reef systems. Coral reefs persist if coral recovery rates equal or exceed average rates of mortality. While mortality from acute destructive events is often obvious and easy to measure, estimating recovery rates and investigating the factors that influence them requires long-term commitment. Coastal development is increasing in many regions, and sea surface temperatures are also rising. The resulting chronic stresses have predictable, adverse effects on coral recovery, but the lack of consistent long-term data sets has prevented measurement of how much coral recovery rates are actually changing. Using long-term monitoring data from 47 reefs spread over 10 degrees of latitude on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), we used a modified Gompertz equation to estimate coral recovery rates following disturbance. We compared coral recovery rates in two periods: 7 years before and 7 years after an acute and widespread heat stress event on the GBR in 2002. From 2003 to 2009, there were few acute disturbances in the region, allowing us to attribute the observed shortfall in coral recovery rates to residual effects of acute heat stress plus other chronic stressors. Compared with the period before 2002, the recovery of fast-growing Acroporidae and of “Other” slower growing hard corals slowed after 2002, doubling the time taken for modest levels of recovery. If this persists, recovery times will be increasing at a time when acute disturbances are predicted to become more frequent and intense. Our study supports the need for management actions to protect reefs from locally generated stresses, as well as urgent global action to mitigate climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","chronic stress; coral disease; coral recovery; coral reefs; recovery","climate change; coral bleaching; coral reef; mortality; temperature effect; warming; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland; Acroporidae; Anthozoa; animal; Anthozoa; Australia; climate change; coral reef; growth, development and aging; sea; temperature; Animals; Anthozoa; Australia; Climate Change; Coral Reefs; Oceans and Seas; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019058414

As such, it is critical to anticipate ecosystem responses to hydrologic restoration activities from the perspective of the soil component. The broad goal of this work was to investigate the resulting effects of various hydrologic restoration scenarios on soil processes of phosphorus and carbon accretion by modeling soil edaphic processes using the Everglades Landscape Model. The results of modeling effort suggest that full implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan provides the greatest spatial reduction of phosphorus (P) enrichment throughout the system. The existing condition baseline (ECB) scenario, which represents the current hydrologic and nutrient impaired condition, produced the highest observed rates of soil carbon accretion; however, this scenario is successful in accretion of soil carbon due to elevated P conditions, not restored hydrology. Management implications of restoration with respect to soil elucidated from this work include: (1) prioritization of habitat quality and ecosystem function (via P reduction) over carbon sequestration potential and (2) need to reduce P inputs before restoring hydrologic connectivity and historic flows. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration","carbon; decompartmentalization; Everglades; hydrology; phosphorus; restoration; soil accretion","accretion; ecosystem management; hydrology; phosphorus; restoration ecology; soil carbon; soil conservation; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017423855

The effect of salinity on methane oxidation is especially severe in river estuaries and adjacent coastal waters, which are important sources of methane emission and, at the same time, are usually characterized by pronounced salinity gradients. Using methane oxidation rates determined by a radiotracer technique as a measure of methanotrophic activity, we tested the effect of immediate and gradual salinity changes on pure cultures of methanotrophic bacteria, and natural freshwater (Elbe River) and natural marine (North Sea) methanotrophic populations. According to our results, Methylomonas sp. and Methylosinus trichosporium are resistant to an increase in salinity, whereas Methylovulum sp. and Methylobacter luteus are sensitive to such an increase. Natural methanotrophic populations from freshwater are more resistant to an increase in salinity than those from marine water are to a decrease in salinity.

However, few studies acknowledge population growth as a variable affecting outcomes. Neither the uncertainty around population projections nor the scope for interventions to moderate growth is discussed. Instead, a deterministic approach is taken, assuming that population growth is governed by economic and educational advances. This chapter reviews the treatment of population in climate change scenarios and the prospects for proactive interventions to influence outcomes. Sensitivity analyses have demonstrated population to be a dominant determinant of emissions. The assumption that population growth is determined by economic and educational settings is not well supported in historical evidence. Indeed, economic advance has rarely been sustained where fertility remained above three children per woman. In contrast, population-focused voluntary family planning programmes have achieved rapid fertility decline, even in very poor communities, and enabled more rapid economic advance. Policy-based projections of global population are presented, based on the historical course of nations that implemented effective voluntary family planning programmes. If remaining high-fertility nations adopted such programmes, global population could yet peak below 9 billion. Current trends make it more likely to exceed 13 billion people by 2100 unless regional population pressures cause catastrophic mortality rates from conflict and famine. Global support for family planning could reduce population by 15% by 2050 and 45% by 2100 compared with the current trend. Co-benefits include gender equity, child health and nutrition, economic advancement, environmental protection and conflict avoidance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Economic development; Family planning; Greenhouse gas emissions; Population growth; Shared socioeconomic pathways",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042416629

Consequently, local production disruptions, for instance caused by extreme weather events, are likely to induce indirect losses along supply chains with potentially global repercussions. These complex loss dynamics represent a challenge for comprehensive disaster risk assessments. Here, we introduce the numerical agent-based model acclimate designed to analyze the cascading of economic losses in the global supply network. Using national sectors as agents, we apply the model to study the global propagation of losses induced by stylized disasters. We find that indirect losses can become comparable in size to direct ones, but can be efficiently mitigated by warehousing and idle capacities. Consequently, a comprehensive risk assessment cannot focus solely on first-tier suppliers, but has to take the whole supply chain into account. To render the supply network climate-proof, national adaptation policies have to be complemented by international adaptation efforts. In that regard, our model can be employed to assess reasonable leverage points and to identify dynamic bottlenecks inaccessible to static analyses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Disaster impact analysis; Dynamic input-output model; Economic network; Higher-order effects; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032025424

Less than a year after its adoption, the Paris Agreement has entered into force. The Paris Agreement is now, and will stay, a reality. Now more than ever, with an unprecedented mobilization all over the world to implement and enhance climate actions, advances in science are needed to inform the negotiations and guide political choices to raise climate ambition. This article proposes several areas where scientific communities could help to implement the Paris Agreement and promote low carbon, climate-resilient economies and societies. In doing so, it focuses on the role of science in several key areas. Firstly, the article explores the relationship between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the new climate regime, with a focus on the 1.5°C special report and future global stocktakes. The article then considers how science can contribute to the preparation of long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies, before focusing on the role of science in advancing on adaptation issues. Now more than ever, scientific advances and inputs are needed to strengthen the upward revision of ambition, and inform sound concrete actions. Policy relevance The climate change negotiations have always been informed by science; the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 benefitted from the fifth assessment report of the IPCC released a few months before COP21. The new era of global climate policy after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement will require stronger interactions between scientists and policy makers. This ‘perspectives’ article proposes, from the point of view of the former French Presidency of COP21, areas where links and interactions could be strengthened to help implement the Paris Agreement, and to place science at the centre of the transformation towards low emission and resilient societies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","1.5°C; adaptation; global stocktake; IPCC; low-carbon society; Paris Agreement","adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; global climate; greenhouse gas; policy implementation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026516942

In this study, the authors pursue a novel approach by using discriminant analysis to enhance the distinction between past and future climates from state-of-the-art climate model simulations. The method is based on multivariate fingerprints that are defined in the space of several prominent climate indices representing the thermal, dynamical, and hygric aspects of climate change. Attribution is carried out by means of a Bayesian classification approach. The leading discriminant function accounts for more than 99% of total discriminability, with temperature variables, extratropical precipitation, and extratropical circulation modes mainly contributing to the discriminant power. The misclassification probability between probability density functions of past and future climates is substantially reduced by the discriminant analysis: from >50% to <15%. Since the mid-1980s, the observed anomalies of the considered climate indices are more or less consistently attributed to a climate under strong radiative forcing, projected for the first half of the twenty-first century. The authors also assess the sensitivity of their results to different emissions scenarios from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multimodel ensembles, seasons, prior probabilities for the early twenty-first-century climate, estimates of the observational error, low-pass filters, variable compositions, group numbers, and reference data. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Anthropogenic effects; Bayesian methods; Climate change","Atmospheric radiation; Bayesian networks; Climate models; Discriminant analysis; Low pass filters; Probability; Probability density function; Anthropogenic climate changes; Anthropogenic effects; Bayesian classification approach; Bayesian methods; Climate model simulations; Detection and attributions; Extratropical circulation; Misclassification probability; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate variation; CMIP; discriminant analysis; multivariate analysis; probability density function",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028980035

Hence, a new comprehensive approach for air pollution monitoring and assessment was introduced in this research. It comprises of three main sections: optimizing the existing air pollutant monitoring network, locating new stations to complete the coverage of the existing network, and finally, generating an air pollution map. In the first section, Shannon information index was used to find less informative stations to be candidate for removal. Then, a methodology was proposed to determine the areas which are not sufficiently covered by the current network. These areas are candidates for establishing new monitoring stations. The current air pollution monitoring network of Tehran was used as a case study, where the air pollution issue has been worsened due to the huge population, considerable commuters’ absorption and topographic barriers. In this regard, O3, NO, NO2, NOx, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 were considered as the main pollutants of Tehran. Optimization step concluded that all the 16 active monitoring stations should be preserved. Analysis showed that about 35% of the Tehran's area is not properly covered by monitoring stations and about 30% of the area needs additional stations. The winter period in Tehran always faces the most severe air pollution in the year. Hence, to produce the air pollution map of Tehran, three-month of winter measurements of the mentioned pollutants, repeated for five years in the same period, were selected and extended to the entire area using the kriging method. Experts specified the contribution of each pollutant in overall air pollution. Experts’ rankings aggregated by a fuzzy-overlay process. Resulted maps characterized the study area with crucial air pollution situation. According to the maps, more than 45% of the city area faced high pollution in the study period, while only less than 10% of the area showed low pollution. This situation confirms the need for effective plans to mitigate the severity of the problem. In addition, an effort made to investigate the rationality of the acquired air pollution map respect to the urban, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Tehran, which also confirmed the results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution map; Air pollution monitoring network; Dempster-Shafer theory; Fuzzy overlay; Shannon information index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027516825

However, the short term (≤5 years) effects of tillage system and organic mulch on crop yield, SOC and N dynamics are often complex and inconsistent. Moreover, the effects of tillage system and levels of organic mulch on stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) are not documented, particularly in the western Himalayan region. Thus a field experiment was conducted with eight treatment combinations comprising two tillage practices (zero and conventional) and four levels of pine-needle mulch (no-mulch, 5 t ha−1, 10 t ha−1 and 15 t ha−1). The conventional tillage registered about 22 and 32% higher dry leaf yield compared with zero tillage practice in 2012 and 2013, respectively; however, remained statistically at par (P ≥ 0.05) with zero tillage in 2014. The stevioside, Reb-A, and total steviol glycosides accumulations in leaf were not affected by the tillage system. The significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher available K was recorded with zero tilled soil. The effects of mulch were more pronounced, and the maximum leaf yield was recorded with the mulching at 15 t ha−1 but remained at par (P ≥ 0.05) with the application of 10 t ha−1. Moreover, available soil N and SOC were also higher with the mulching at 10 and 15 t ha−1, respectively. Hence, the zero tillage is not effective for increasing crop productivity in short term; nevertheless, higher yield, SOC, and soil nitrogen can be achieved by the application of optimum level of organic mulch. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Organic mulch; Soil organic carbon; Stevia rebaudiana; Steviol glycosides; Zero tillage","Agricultural machinery; Crops; Glycosides; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Soils; Sugar substitutes; Sugars; Organic mulch; Soil organic carbon; Stevia rebaudiana; Steviol glycosides; Zero tillage; Agriculture; agricultural production; biochemical composition; biomass; coniferous tree; crop yield; experimental study; growth rate; herb; mulching; organic carbon; soil carbon; zero tillage; Himalayas; Stevia rebaudiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018496975

It requires the inclusion of all phases of the building life cycle in a single optimization problem. The present study demonstrates a life cycle simulation-based optimization approach, by including the operational carbon footprint (OCF) and embodied carbon footprint (ECF) of a building. Particularly, finding and analyzing the difference between life cycle (OCF + ECF) optimized design and operational (only OCF) performance-based optimized design is the primary goal of the current study. The life cycle optimization method is applied to a townhouse in Finland to determine carbon-cost optimal designs. Different options of building envelope insulation thicknesses, window types, heating systems, heat recovery units, and PV area are explored as design variables. It has been found that the heating system is a dominant design variable, which results in clearly separated pareto fronts for each system. Generally, a majority of the design variables' optimal values, obtained from OCF + ECF optimization, suggest thinner insulation for the building envelope and a larger PV area, compared to the optimal solutions from OCF optimization. In a carbon optimal solution, the share of ECF is 39% of the life cycle carbon footprint, whereas in a cost optimal solution, the share of ECF is 28% of the life cycle carbon footprint. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Carbon footprint; Embodied carbon; Life cycle cost; Life cycle optimization","Architectural design; Buildings; Costs; Heating equipment; Life cycle; Optimal systems; Optimization; Solar buildings; Waste heat; Building life cycle; Cost-optimal solutions; Embodied carbons; Life cycle simulations; Lifecycle costs; Optimization method; Optimization problems; Residential building; Carbon footprint; architectural design; building; carbon footprint; cost analysis; life cycle analysis; optimization; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030449851

Here, we report the first combined C- and N-isotopic data for diamonds from the Monastery and Jagersfontein kimberlites that sample the deep asthenosphere and transition zone beneath the Kaapvaal Craton, in the mid Cretaceous, to investigate the nature of mantle fluids at these depths and the constraints they provide on the deep volatile cycle. Both diamond suites exhibit very light δ13C values (down to − 26‰) and heavy δ15N (up to + 10.3‰), with nitrogen abundances generally below 70 at. ppm but varying up to very high concentrations (2520 at. ppm) in rare cases. Combined, these signatures are consistent with derivation from subducted crustal materials. Both suites exhibit variable nitrogen aggregation states from 25 to 100% B defects. Internal growth structures, revealed in cathodoluminescence (CL) images, vary from faintly layered, through distinct cores to concentric growth patterns with intermittent evidence for dissolution and regular octahedral growth layers in places. Modelling the internal co-variations in δ13C-δ15N-N revealed that diamonds grew from diverse C-H-O-N fluids involving both oxidised and reduced carbon species. The diversity of the modelled diamond-forming fluids highlights the complexity of the volatile sources and the likely heterogeneity of the deep asthenosphere and transition zone. We propose that the Monastery and Jagersfontein diamonds form in subducted slabs, where carbon is converted into either oxidised or reduced species during fluid-aided dissolution of subducted carbon before being re-precipitated as diamond. The common occurrence of recycled C and N isotopic signatures in super-deep diamonds world-wide indicates that a significant amount of carbon and nitrogen is recycled back to the deep asthenosphere and transition zone via subducting slabs, and that the transition zone may be dominated by recycled C and N. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon and nitrogen; Monastery and Jagersfontein diamonds; Oxidised and reduced fluids; Subduction; Transition zone; Ultra-deep diamonds","Dissolution; Isotopes; Minerals; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Recycling; Water recycling; Carbon and nitrogen; Cathodoluminescence images; Growth structures; Isotopic signatures; Nitrogen aggregations; Subduction; Transition zones; Ultra deeps; Diamonds; asthenosphere; carbon isotope; diamond; fluid; geochemistry; kimberlite; nitrogen isotope; subduction; transition zone; Free State; Jagersfontein; Kaapvaal Craton; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026637417

In the present study, an attempt has been made taking insights from our recent geological, geochemical, petrophysical and geophysical findings from specially drilled deep boreholes, to understand the lithospheric thermal evolution of the highly complex western India, which forms the core region of the Deccan large igneous province. This region was severely affected by the Deccan volcanic eruptions 65 Ma ago, which resulted in a totally degenerated, reworked and exhumed mafic crust, which presently contains several Tertiary basins with proven hydrocarbon reserves. Our detailed case study from the disastrous 1993 Killari earthquake (Mw 6.3) region, apart from some other geotectonically important localities like seismically active 2001 Bhuj and 1967 Koyna earthquake regions together with Tertiary Cambay graben, indicate that the western part of India, is perhaps one of the warmest segments of the earth. It is characterized by an average high mantle heat flow and Moho temperatures of about 43 mW/m2 (range: 31-65 mW/m2) and 660°C (range: 540-860°C) respectively. Estimated thickness of the lithosphere beneath these areas varies from as low as about 45 km to 100 km. Consequently, melting conditions in certain segments are expected at extremely shallow depths due to asthenospheric swell, like northern part of Cambay basin and Bhuj seismic zone beneath which only about half of original crystalline crust now remains due to sub-crustal melting and massive exhumation of deeper crustal layers. Sustained thermal heating and rise of isotherms appear to have resulted in substantial enhancement of hydrocarbon generation and maturation processes in Tertiary sediments. The present study highlights the need of an integrated geological, geochemical and geophysical study, if reasonably accurate deep crustal thermal regime is to be investigated. © 2017, Geological Society of India.",,"complexity; crustal structure; Deccan Traps; heat flow; large igneous province; lithosphere; Moho; seismic zone; thermal evolution; thermal regime; Deccan; India; Calluna vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029647424

This yields to cooling loads in average higher by 13% for urban than rural buildings.

We compare its performance calculated with hourly urban weather data (2002–2008) with the performance of the same building using a rural dataset instead. Milan's Urban Heat Island reduces the heating loads by 12% and 16%, for the non-insulated and insulated building, respectively, while the cooling loads are increased by 41% and 39%. The urban building also shows dehumidification loads 74–78% lower than the rural building. Moreover, during the 2003 heat wave, the indoor air temperature is computed to be 1.5 °C–2.2 °C higher in a non-conditioned urban building than in the rural one. This increases the wakefulness, occupants’ vulnerability to overheating, and impacts the overall hygrothermal performance.

Deficit or excessive irrigation could create either crop health-related problems or water over-consumption, respectively. The latter could lead to groundwater depletion and deterioration of its quality through deep percolation of agrichemical residuals. In this context, and under the current conditions where Cyprus is facing effects of possible climate changes, the purpose of this study seeks to estimate the needed crop water requirements of the past (1995-2004) and the corresponding ones of the present (2005-2015) in order to test if there were any significant changes regarding the crop water requirements of the most water-intensive trees in Cyprus. The Mediterranean region has been identified as the region that will suffer the most from variations of climate. Thus the paper refers to effects of these variations on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) using remotely-sensed data from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI employing a sound methodology used worldwide, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). Though the general feeling is that of changes on climate will consequently affect ETc, our results indicate that there is no significant effect of climate variation on crop evapotranspiration, despite the fact that some climatic factors have changed. Applying Student's t-test, the mean values for the most water-intensive trees in Cyprus of the 1994-2004 decade have shown no statistical difference from the mean values of 2005-2015 for all the cases, concluding that the climate change taking place in the past decades in Cyprus have either not affected the crop evapotranspiration or the crops have managed to adapt to the new environmental conditions through time. © 2017 by the authors.","Algorithms; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation management; SEBAL",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045965053

UIRTs focus on improving the recycling efficiencies of reclaimed water and biogas produced and to enforce the linkage among all environmental infrastructures associated with water, waste, and energy in an urban block. To implement the micro-climate analyses, data such as land use, topography, building height and materials, and weather conditions were collected, and the results estimated based on fluid simulations of cold wind and temperature variation pathways. There were three programs used in the urban regeneration project in J city: river restoration, traditional market revitalization, and a primary school eco-school. The height of cold wind from the ground level was significantly elevated, and the maximum wind velocity differential between before and after increased by 0.12 m/s due to the expansion of the waterfront space and grassland through the three programs. Overall, a temperature at the ground level dropped by 1.6 °C. Based on these results, the three programs improved the urban environment at ground level, and might ultimately be capable of diminishing the urban heat island effect and mitigating the energy consumption of urban areas. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Micro-climate; Temperature; Urban infrastructure regeneration technology; Wind flow","climate conditions; economic regeneration; infrastructural development; microclimate; river management; technological development; temperature effect; urban area; wind velocity; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022017058

But when we turn to practical electrochemical devices, we turn to carbon. To move energy devices and electro(bio)analytical measurements to a new performance curve requires improved electron-transfer rates at carbon. We approach this challenge with electroless deposition of disordered, nanoscopic anhydrous ruthenium oxide at pyrolytic carbon prepared by thermal decomposition of benzene (RuOx@CVD-C). We assessed traditionally fast, chloride-assisted ([Fe(CN)6]3-/4-) and notoriously slow ([Fe(H2O)6]3+/2+) electron-transfer redox probes at CVD-C and RuOx@CVD-C electrodes and calculated standard heterogeneous rate constants as a function of heat treatment to crystallize the disordered RuOx domains to their rutile form. For the fast electron-transfer probe, [Fe(CN)6]3-/4-, the rate increases by 34× over CVD-C once the RuOx is calcined to form crystalline rutile RuO2. For the classically outer-sphere [Fe(H2O)6]3+/2+, electron-transfer rates increase by an even greater degree over CVD-C (55×). The standard heterogeneous rate constant for each probe approaches that observed at Pt but does so using only minimal loadings of RuOx. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical vapor deposition; Decomposition; Electrodes; Electron transitions; Oxide minerals; Platinum; Probes; Pyrolysis; Rate constants; Ruthenium; Electrochemical devices; Electron transfer; Electron transfer kinetics; Electron transfer rates; Fast electron transfer; Heterogeneous rate constant; Performance curve; Pyrolytic carbon; Electrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029672515

From 1980 to 2015 ozone has been monitored in eight air basins in Southern California. The temporal evolution of the largest measured concentrations, i.e., those that define the ozone design value (ODV) upon which the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) is based, is described very well by an exponential decrease on top of a positive offset. We identify this offset as the ODV due to the U.S. background ozone (i.e., the concentration that would be present if U.S. anthropogenic precursor emissions were reduced to zero) and is estimated to be 62.0 ± 1.9 ppb in six of the basins. California's emission control efforts have reduced the anthropogenic ozone enhancements by a factor of ~5 since 1980. However, assuming that the current rate of exponential decrease is maintained and that U.S. background ODV remains constant, projections of the past decrease suggest that ~35 years of additional emission control efforts will be required to reach the new NAAQS of 70 ppb in the Los Angeles area. The growing predominance of U.S. background ozone contributions has shifted the maximum ozone concentrations in all air basins from later to earlier in the summer. Comparisons indicate that currently accepted model estimates of U.S. background ozone concentrations in Southern California are somewhat underestimated; thus, reducing ozone in this region to the 2015 NAAQS may be more difficult than currently expected. ©2017.

The current paper presents a detailed palynostratigraphy of the Middle – Upper Triassic succession in four exploration wells (7120/12-2, 7228/2-1s, 7-1a and 9-1s) drilled in the Hammerfest and Nordkapp basins. Eleven informal palynological zones are described from the stratigraphic interval spanning the Kobbe, Snadd and Fruholmen formations, which constitute regionally significant hydrocarbon source and reservoir rock facies. The results of this study contribute to a higher resolution palynostratigraphy for the Middle to Upper Triassic strata of the southern Barents Sea (SBS), and an improved correlation with the stratigraphy of the Svalbard Archipelago. Palynofacies data for the succession, presented here for the first time, indicates depositional environments ranging from fluvio-deltaic to offshore marine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hammerfest Basin; Kapp Toscana Group; Middle – Upper Triassic; Nordkapp Basin; Palynofacies; Palynology; Sassendalen Group; Svalbard","Hydrocarbons; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Stratigraphy; Hammerfest; Kapp Toscana Group; Nordkapp Basin; Palynofacies; Palynology; Sassendalen Group; Svalbard; Upper Triassic; Deposition; Anisian; biostratigraphy; depositional environment; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; hydrocarbon resource; palynology; Rhaetian; sediment thickness; stratigraphic correlation; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Hammerfest Basin; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020311912

The frequency of these events is projected to increase in the foreseeable future, with developing countries being the worst sufferers. Dealing with this appears to be an additional burden on the resources of such countries, a large part of which is already devoted to providing better living standards for its inhabitants. Does this imply that developmental interventions should be discontinued? Is there a link between these programs and adaptation to environmental shocks? In an effort to answer such questions, the paper examines the impact of the developmental schemes on the livelihood of the households in Western Odisha, India and investigates whether they augment post disaster coping and adaptation as well. The results indicate that overall the programs have made an impact concerning their intended goals but the diffusion of benefits across beneficiary groups is heterogeneous. Additionally, the programs have contributed in post disaster coping, but only in the regions where either they performed well or their penetration was extensive. Activities promoting livelihood diversification, food security, and poverty reduction also tacitly facilitate improvements in the resilience of the individuals and communities thereby enhancing their capacity to deal with climatic risks. Policy implication advocates the continuation of developmental interventions. However, realigning their framework to incorporate actions intended toward disaster risk reduction and management would result in more inclusive impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","adaptation; climatic aberration; disaster coping; impact evaluation; India","adaptive management; climate effect; coping strategy; disaster management; rural area; India; Odisha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019032356

The interaction of dye with both of the ionic liquids occurred electrostatically as well as hydrophobically. In the case of ST, initially absorbance decreases up to a certain concentration without any shift of λmax, and then it increases with red shift of λmax. Absorption spectra of CR gave red-shifted wavelength with addition of [BMIM][OS], but at a higher concentration of surface active ionic liquid (SAIL), no shifting was observed. Again, blue-shifted λmax was found in lower range of [DMIM][Cl]; but at higher concentration, it was further red-shifted. Emission intensity increases in both dye-SAIL systems; for ST in both SAIL media, blue-shifted spectra were observed, but there was no shift of emission maxima in case of CR in those media.

It is observed that the carbon doped HEMT structure shows better electrical characteristics, with a maximum drain current density Id of 1.3 A/mm, a transconductance Gm of 500 mS/mm and a maximum oscillation frequency fmax of 234 GHz while using a gate length of 220 nm. The low trapping effects together with high frequency performance and excellent electron confinement under high bias enabled to achieve a state-of-the-art combination at 18 GHz of output power density (Pout &gt; 6 W/mm) and power added efficiency (PAE) close to 40% at Vds as high as 30V. At 40 GHz, a PAE above 35% is still observed in spite of the rather large gate length. A key feature is the low gate leakage current of only few tenths of μA/mm that remains stable after many load-pull sweeps at various frequency in the case of carbon doped HEMT, which is attributed to a significant reduction of the self-heating as compared to the DHFET. © 2017 IEEE.","double heterostructure field effect transistor (DHFET); GaN; high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs); output power density and power added efficiency (PAE)","Drain current; Efficiency; Electron mobility; Field effect transistors; Gallium compounds; Gallium nitride; Junction gate field effect transistors; Leakage currents; Semiconducting aluminum compounds; Solid state devices; Transistors; Double heterostructures; Electrical characteristic; Gan high electron mobility transistors; High electron mobility transistor (HEMTs); High frequency performance; Maximum drain current; Maximum oscillation frequency; Power-added efficiency; High electron mobility transistors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033433108

In this study three cement plants firing different kinds and percentages of alternative fuel were studied. A specially developed camera setup was used to monitor the flames in the three cement kilns and assess the effect of alternative fuels on the flame. It was found that cofiring with solid recovered fuel (SRF) would delay the ignition point by about 2 m and lower the intensity and temperature of the kiln flame compared to a fossil fuel flame. This is related to a larger particle size and moisture content of the alternative fuels, which lowers the conversion rate compared to fossil fuels. The consequences can be a lower kiln temperature and cement quality. The longer conversion time may also lead to the possibility of localized reducing conditions in the cement kiln, which can have a negative impact on the clinker quality and process stability. The burner design may alleviate some of the issues encountered with SRF cofiring. At one of the test plants the burner was changed from a design with an annular channel for axial air to a jet design. This proved to be beneficial for an early ignition and improved dispersion of the fuel and led to an increase in cement quality and higher use of SRF. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution control; Brickmaking; Cement industry; Cements; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Kilns; Particle size; Annular channels; Conversion rates; Conversion time; Ignition points; Larger particle sizes; Process stability; Reducing conditions; Solid recovered fuels; Alternative fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032854917

(2) The proportion of area planted in rice and maize showed a significant upward trend. The trend of rice was the most pronounced, the trend of wheat significantly decreased. (3) Abrupt changes in temperature occurred in the 1980s; abrupt changes in wheat were concentrated at the end of the 1990s. (4) The relationship between temperature and planting structure was stronger than that of precipitation, and the relationship between minimum temperature and planting structure was stronger than that of maximum temperature.

Our analysis shows that the performance of these Chinese policies strongly depends on the principles and indicators used in the evaluation. When climate-specific cost indicators are considered, the mixed policy performs best in terms of cost reduction. When cost-efficiency indicators are used, a single policy performs better to some extent. From the perspective of evaluating the contribution to emissions reduction, the development of non-fossil-fuel-based energy technologies offers the greatest opportunity for reducing emissions in a mixed-policy scenario.

In order to achieve light weight, reduced emissions and ensure conductor safety, advanced high strength steels (AHSS) are able to fulfill these requirements. Dual phase steels (DP) are well suited for light weighing car body constructions. The gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process is focused in literature as an alternative choice for joining AHSS steels; this study is held to disclose the exhibited microstructural constituents. In addition, quantitative determinations of the volume % of phases in the various weld regions were made. The relative amounts of lower bainite (LB), upper bainite (UB), and polygonal ferrite (PF) in the heat affected zone (HAZ) were determined by image analysis from optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that GTAW promoted the development of significant amounts of LB in the HAZ (50.89 %). In contrast atomic force microscopy (AFM) leads to quantify the different phases by the morphology, height and roughness, it was found that martensite (M) dropped down to 7.5% in the intercritical zone (IZ) although PF increases to 92.5% compared with the base metal (BM).","AFM; AHSS; DP steels; GTAW; SEM","Atomic force microscopy; Automotive industry; Bainite; Electric arc welding; Electric welding; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Heat affected zone; Scanning electron microscopy; Welding; Advanced high strength steel; AHSS; DP-steel; Gas tungsten arc welding process; GTAW; Manufacturability; Polygonal ferrites; Quantitative determinations; High strength steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031289441

This is particularly remarkable to improve predictions about the impact of climate change on vegetation. Here, we used a trait-based approach to analyse the sensitivity to climatic variability over 9 years of 19 Mediterranean shrubland communities located in southwest Spain. We evaluated the role of functional diversity (FD) and soil environment as drivers of community stability (assessed as changes in plant cover, species diversity and composition). The studied shrubland communities were strongly sensitive to inter-annual variability in climate. First, colder and drier conditions caused remarkable decreases in total plant cover but increased FD, likely because the reduction of plant cover after harsh climatic conditions promoted the expansion of functionally dissimilar species in the new open microsites; although communities returned to their initial values of plant cover after nine years, changes in FD and structure persisted over time. Second, drier and colder conditions favoured the predominance of shrubs with a conservative resource-use strategy (i.e. with higher dry matter content in leaves, stems and roots), bigger seeds and a more efficient use of water. The most functionally diverse communities were the most stable over time in terms of species diversity, likely because a higher number of functionally dissimilar species allowed compensatory dynamics among them. Communities inhabiting more acidic and resource-limited environments were less variable over time, probably because they were mainly constituted by slow-growth, stress-tolerant species that are potentially better adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Synthesis. This study highlights the utility of a trait-based approach to evaluate how plant communities respond to climatic variability. We could infer that the increased frequency of extreme climatic events predicted by climatic models will alter the functional structure of shrubland communities, with potential repercussions for ecosystem functioning. Our results also provide new insights into the role of FD and soil environment as buffers of the climate impact on woody communities, as well as potentially useful information to be applied in ecologically based management and restoration strategies. © 2017 The Authors.

We used ecological niche models calibrated based on occurrences of the species complex from across its known geographic range. Anticipated distributional changes varied by region, from stability to expansion or decline. Overall, models indicated no significant north–south expansion beyond present boundaries. However, some areas suitable both at present and in the future (e.g., Pacific coast of Ecuador and Peru) may offer opportunities for distributional expansion. Our models anticipated potential range expansion in southern Brazil and Argentina, but were variably successful in anticipating specific cases. The most significant climate-related change anticipated in the species’ range was with regard to range continuity in the Amazon Basin, which is likely to increase in coming decades. Rather than making detailed forecasts of actual locations where Lu. longipalpis will appear in coming years, our models make interesting and potentially important predictions of broader-scale distributional tendencies that can inform heath policy and mitigation efforts. © 2017 Australian Society for Parasitology","Climate change; Geographic distribution; Leishmaniasis; Sand fly","climate change; climate conditions; fly; geographical distribution; modeling; niche; prediction; range expansion; Amazon Basin; Argentina; Article; Brazil; climate change; coastal waters; controlled study; ecology; Ecuador; geographic distribution; health care policy; Lutzomyia longipalpis; mathematical model; nonhuman; Peru; prediction; animal; animal dispersal; biological model; physiology; Psychodidae; Amazon Basin; Argentina; Brazil; Lutzomyia longipalpis; Phlebotominae; Psychodidae; Animal Distribution; Animals; Climate Change; Models, Biological; Psychodidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025126743

The study was carried out over a 2-year period and examined ambient (25 °C), mesophilic (35 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) operations. Four operating conditions that spanned these temperature regimes and a range of loading conditions (0.5–2.5 kg VS/m3 d) were assessed. The AnMBR consistently had greater volatile solids reduction (VSr) and increased methane yields (0.19–0.34 Nm3/kg VS fed) when compared to the AD. The VSr in the AnMBR was maintained at high values (49–64%) at an HRT of 7 days. An energy balance showed improved net energy production was realized using AnMBR over AD due to the higher methane yield (38% increase on average) and higher VSLR employed. The quality of the produced biosolids was assessed and it was found that the TS in the waste stream from the AnMBR were 2–3.4 times more concentrated than those of the AD because of the extended SRTs. The nutrient contents (N and P) of the digested sludges fell within the ranges typically reported. The results of this study extend previous work and are considered applicable to full-scale applications. Further the results suggest the potential benefit of a positive energy balance towards a sustainable practice when treating mixed municipal sludge using AnMBR at ambient and mesophilic operating conditions. © 2017","Anaerobic digestion; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Energy balance; Municipal sludge; Temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025834833

Typically, both infiltration and soil organic matter increase over time with CsT practices. We compared the impact of a commonly used CsT practice, strip tillage (ST), to conventional tillage (CT) management on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics and leaching and examined associations to soil N availability and microbial biomass. A winter cover crop was used in both tillage treatments. The study was conducted over a five-year period during rotational cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) production in the Atlantic Coastal Plain region in Georgia, United States. Fertilizer and poultry litter were applied ahead of the cotton crops. Sets of PVC cylinders were filled with soil from each of six plots, three in ST and three in CT, and maintained in situ in their respective plots for 16 intervals of about 90 days. After retrieval, the soil in each cylinder was analyzed for inorganic N (ammonium and nitrates [NH4 + and NO3-]), total N, total carbon (C), and microbial biomass. Leached NO3-N was captured on anion exchange resin-filled bags attached to the bottom of each cylinder. After the five-year study period, the ST and CT soil C content increased by 22% and 23%, respectively. Total soil N content increased 27% with ST compared to 22% with CT. Temporal patterns in NO3-N leaching were not different between CT and ST treatments, and a high amount of NO3-N leaching was observed after the application of poultry litter. The cumulative amount of NO3-N leached from soils throughout the five-year study was 141 and 122 kg N ha-1 (126 and 109 lb N ac-1) with CT and ST practices, respectively. Results suggest that leaching from the top 15 cm (6 in) of soil may be an important pathway of N loss from both CT and ST cropping systems in the region. Regardless of tillage, soil microbial biomass N was equal to or higher than the total inorganic N, but still represented a small percentage (up to 9%) of the total soil N. Overall, microbial biomass N was higher in ST compared to CT. Minimizing NO3-N in the soil from reaching ground and surface waters while increasing crop productivity represents a major challenge. The use of ST in conjunction with winter cover crops may improve plant N availability by more than 27 kg ha-1 y-1 (24 lb ac-1 yr-1) in the sandy landscapes of the southeastern Coastal Plain region through microbial cycling of organic N while reducing subsurface NO3-N losses. © 2017 Soil and Water Conservation Society.","Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP); Crop residue; Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Enhancement network (GRACEnet); Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network; Microbial biomass; Strip tillage","agroecology; conservation tillage; cover crop; crop residue; environmental assessment; infiltration; ion exchange; leaching; microbial activity; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; organic matter; project assessment; research work; soil erosion; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; Atlantic Coastal Plain; Georgia; United States; Arachis hypogaea; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033397671

One of the possible pre-earthquake effects could be the appearance of some climatological anomalies in the epicentral region, weeks/months before the major earthquakes. In this paper, the period of 2 months preceding the Amatrice–Norcia (Central Italy) earthquake sequence, that started on 24 August 2016 with an M6 earthquake and a few months later produced other two major shocks (i.e. an M5.9 on 26 October and then an M6.5 on 30 October), was analyzed in terms of skin temperature, total column water vapour and total column of ozone, compared with the past 37-year trend. The novelty of the method stands in the way the complete time series is reduced, where also the possible effect of global warming is properly removed. The simultaneous analysis showed the presence of persistent contemporary anomalies in all of the analysed parameters. To validate the technique, a confutation/confirmation analysis was undertaken where these parameters were successfully analyzed in the same months but considering a seismically “calm” year, when significant seismicity was not present. We also extended the analysis to all available years to construct a confusion matrix comparing the occurrence of climatological data anomalies with real seismicity. This work confirms the potentiality of multi parameters in anticipating the occurrence of large earthquakes in Central Italy, thus reinforcing the idea of considering such behaviour an effective tool for an integrated system of future earthquake prediction. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","LAIC; Seismic precursors; strong and intermediate earthquakes; thermal precursory anomaly","Forecasting; Geophysics; Global warming; Ionosphere; Produced Water; Climatological data; Earthquake prediction; Earthquake sequences; LAIC; Seismic precursors; Simultaneous analysis; thermal precursory anomaly; Total column water vapours; Earthquakes; climatology; earthquake epicenter; earthquake precursor; seismicity; strong motion; temperature anomaly; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031728368

These processes were most often initiated by local elected officials and/or high-level staff members, and then carried out in collaboration with local third-sector organisations and other community stakeholders. In the USA, collaboration was strongest at the policy level and in the direction-setting phase, with the distinguishing feature that citizen advisory boards or stakeholder working groups often took a more active role in shaping local plans and policies. The English localities had some of those same types of collaborations, but were more likely to also employ action collaboration, in the implementation phase, in which third-sector organisations coordinated with the locality to directly provide clean energy services. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate mitigation; collaborative planning; community planning; Energy","alternative energy; climate change; energy conservation; energy efficiency; implementation process; land use planning; local planning; policy making; stakeholder; England; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958045959

However, C and N removal via soil gaseous pathways can influence local budgets of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contribute to climate change. Over a year, we quantified soil effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a Mediterranean riparian forest in order to understand the role of these ecosystems on catchment GHG emissions. In addition, we evaluated the main soil microbial processes that produce GHG (mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification) and how changes in soil properties can modify the GHG production over time and space. Riparian soils emitted larger amounts of CO2 (1.2-10g Cm-2 d-1) than N2O (0.001-0.2 mgN m-2 d-1) to the atmosphere attributed to high respiration and low denitrification rates. Both CO2 and N2O emissions showed a marked (but antagonistic) spatial gradient as a result of variations in soil water content across the riparian zone. Deep groundwater tables fueled large soil CO2 effluxes near the hillslope, while N2O emissions were higher in the wet zones adjacent to the stream channel. However, both CO2 and N2O emissions peaked after spring rewetting events, when optimal conditions of soil water content, temperature, and N availability favor microbial respiration, nitrification, and denitrification. Overall, our results highlight the role of water availability on riparian soil biogeochemistry and GHG emissions and suggest that climate change alterations in hydrologic regimes can affect the microbial processes that produce GHG as well as the contribution of these systems to regional and global biogeochemical cycles. © Author(s) 2017.",,"biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; catchment; climate change; denitrification; forest soil; greenhouse gas; Mediterranean soil; nitrous oxide; riparian forest; riparian zone; soil water; spatiotemporal analysis; water availability; water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029951942

A change in the overall quantity of vehicle emissions in a region is generally associated with lower concentrations of vehicle related air pollutants and therefore a reduction in public health risks from exposure to vehicle emissions. A major limitation of this common approach is that aggregate emission inventories provide no information about localized impacts. While some areas experience air quality improvements, air quality can become worse in others. Such aggregate analyses are ill suited for addressing contemporary transportation planning questions such as identifying vehicle emission exposure hotspots, quantifying health risks, and evaluating environmental justice concerns. In this paper we describe a computationally efficient analysis framework for evaluating a regional transportation plan with spatially detailed estimates of vehicle emission exposures and related health outcomes. We then apply our framework in a case study of fine particulate matter exposure in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area and the changes expected to occur through the year 2040 under the region's long range transportation plan. We find that exposure and health risks decline from current levels by 2020 but then begin to slowly increase in some areas by 2040. We also find that low income and minority populations have the greatest health risks, confirming environmental justice concerns that have been noted in other regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Health, environmental justice; Particulate matter; Transportation planning; Vehicle emissions exposure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019613183

The effect of grassland diversity on methane yield has received some attention, but we do not know how community assembly may affect methane yield from grassland biomass. However, methane yields determine the potential economic value of a bioenergy substrate. Hence, a better understanding of how plant community assembly affects methane yield would be important. We measured biomass production and methane yield in the second year of a grassland field experiment which manipulated the order of arrival of different plant functional groups (forbs, grasses or legumes sown first and all sown simultaneously) and sown diversity (9 vs. 21 species). The order of arrival of the plant functional groups significantly determined the relative dominance of each group which in turn mainly explained the variance in aboveground biomass production. Differences in area-specific methane yields were driven by differences in biomass production and which plant functional groups dominated a plot. When grasses were sown first, legumes and grasses codominated a plot and the highest area-specific methane yield was obtained. Overall, the results indicate that altering the order of arrival affected the community functional and species composition (and hence methane yields) much more than sown diversity. Our study shows that a combined use of positive biodiversity effects and guided plant community assembly may be able to optimize methane yields under field conditions. This may allow a guided, sustainable, and lucrative use of grassland biomass for biogas production in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

Reports range from 0 to 67% soil NO emission reductions postbiochar amendment. We use regional air quality and health cost models to assess how these soil NO reductions could influence U.S. air quality and health costs. We find that at 67% soil NO reduction, widespread application of biochar to fertilized agricultural soils could reduce O3 by up to 2.4 ppb and PM2.5 by up to 0.15 μg/m3 in some regions. Modeled biochar-mediated health benefits are up to $4.3 million/county in 2011, with impacts focused in the Midwest and Southwest.

The combination of these threats have led to losses of native biota, altered hydrological and ecosystem processes, and reduced ecosystem services. These threats pose complex problems to often underfunded management entities. We developed a watershed decision support tool (WDST) for the windward coast of Hawai‘i Island aimed at prioritizing catchments for invasive species removal and native forest protection from non-native species invasions. Using the Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) system, we integrated spatial data from four sources: (i) native and invasive species coverage; (ii) modeled water yield; (iii) treatment cost and efficacy; and (iv) native species conservation value. We used a distributed hydrology model (DHSVM) to estimate catchment-level (∼90 ha) water yield under six climate and non-native species invasion scenarios to identify where (1) invasive species removal and (2) protection from invasion would have the greatest benefit to increasing or maintaining native biodiversity and hydrologic functioning. The hydrology model predicted a 30% decline (386 Gl yr−1) in total water yield under a drier future climate (20% reduction in rainfall), with an additional 2% reduction when catchments were fully invaded by non-native species. Increased temperatures had a small compensatory effect on water yield. The WDST identified 6.3% of the study area as high priority for invasive species removal, based on characteristics of large hydrological response to the removal treatment (concentrated in high rainfall areas), high quality road or trail access, and high conservation value. High protection priority from invasive species (5.9% by area) occurred in higher elevation catchments, near the upper range of strawberry guava (the main invasive species), where water yield was most sensitive to invasion. Climate change scenarios had little influence on the spatial distribution of priority scores despite large changes in overall water yield. In contrast, priority scores were sensitive to very high variation in treatment costs, which were influenced largely by travel times to catchments via road and trail networks. This last finding suggests that future management feasibility will hinge on improvements to road and trail networks, or development of alternative management strategies that reduce travel costs and time. © 2017","Climate change; Climate change, Hawai‘i; Decision support; Ecosystem management; Hydrology modeling; Invasive species","Biodiversity; Catchments; Climate models; Complex networks; Conservation; Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Highway administration; Hydrology; Information management; Rain; Roads and streets; Runoff; Transportation; Watersheds; Alternative management; Climate change scenarios; Decision support tools; Decision supports; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem Management Decision Support; Hydrology modeling; Invasive species; Climate change; biodiversity; biological invasion; catchment; climate change; decision support system; dicotyledon; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; forested catchment; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; invasive species; island biogeography; prioritization; spatial distribution; species conservation; water yield; watershed; Hawaii [United States]; United States; Psidium cattleianum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020873895

Simulations reveal that a relatively strong reduction in PM2.5 levels can be achieved by decreasing agricultural emissions, notably of ammonia (NH3) released from fertilizer use and animal husbandry. The absolute impact on PM2.5 reduction is strongest in East Asia, even for small emission decreases. Conversely, over Europe and North America, aerosol formation is not immediately limited by the availability of ammonia. Nevertheless, reduction of NH3 can also substantially decrease PM2.5 concentrations over the latter regions, especially when emissions are abated systematically. Our results document how reduction of agricultural emissions decreases aerosol pH due to the depletion of aerosol ammonium, which affects particle liquid phase and heterogeneous chemistry. Further, it is shown that a 50% reduction of agricultural emissions could prevent the mortality attributable to air pollution by ∼250000 people yr-1 worldwide, amounting to reductions of 30, 19, 8 and 3% over North America, Europe, East and South Asia, respectively.

In this study we developed and applied a statistical algorithm, based on the maximum likelihood estimate approach, to determine how the changes of three large-scale weather patterns associated with increasing temperatures in winter and sea-ice retreat in the Arctic impact the transport of BC to the Arctic and its deposition. We found that two atmospheric patterns together determine a decreasing winter deposition trend of BC between 1980 and 2015 in the eastern Arctic while they increase BC deposition in the western Arctic. The increasing BC trend is mainly due to a pattern characterized by a high-pressure anomaly near Scandinavia favouring the transport in the lower troposphere of BC from Europe and North Atlantic directly into to the Arctic. Another pattern with a high-pressure anomaly over the Arctic and low-pressure anomaly over the North Atlantic Ocean has a smaller impact on BC deposition but determines an increasing BC atmospheric load over the entire Arctic Ocean with increasing BC concentrations in the upper troposphere. The results show that changes in atmospheric circulation due to polar atmospheric warming and reduced winter sea ice significantly impacted BC transport and deposition. The anthropogenic emission reductions applied in the last decades were, therefore, crucial to counterbalance the most likely trend of increasing BC pollution in the Arctic, ©Authors 2017.",,"atmospheric circulation; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; black carbon; climate forcing; sea ice; trend analysis; warming; winter; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030787297

The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) enjoys a vanguard position in the development and realisation of green transport concepts within Europe.

The purpose of this study is twofold. First, given that EPR spectra are highly sensitive to the motions and order of the spin probes doped within lyotropic aggregates, simulation of EPR line shapes from the results of MD modelling provides an ultimate test bed for the force fields currently employed to model such systems. Second, the EPR line shapes are simulated using the motional parameters extracted from MD trajectories using the Model-Free (MF) approach. Thus a combined MD-EPR methodology allowed us to test directly the validity of the application of the MF approach to systems with multi-component molecular motions. All-atom MD simulations using the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) have been performed on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) liquid crystals. The resulting MD trajectories were used to predict and interpret the EPR spectra of pre-micellar, micellar, rod and lamellar aggregates. The predicted EPR spectra demonstrate good agreement with most of experimental line shapes thus confirming the validity of both the force fields employed and the MF approach for the studied systems. At the same time simulation results confirm that GAFF tends to overestimate the packing and the order of the carbonyl chains of the surfactant molecules. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

As a climate mitigation strategy, CO2 capture from flue gases of industrial processes - much like that of the power sector - has not experienced wide adoption given its high associated costs. However, some industrial processes with relatively high CO2 flue concentration may be viable candidates to cost-competitively supply CO2 for utilization purposes (e.g., polymer manufacturing, etc.). This work develops a methodology that determines the levelized cost ($/tCO2) of separating, compressing, and transporting carbon dioxide. A top-down model determines the cost of separating and compressing CO2 across 18 industrial processes. Further, the study calculates the cost of transporting CO2 via pipeline and tanker truck to appropriately paired sinks using a bottom-up cost model and geo-referencing approach. The results show that truck transportation is generally the low-cost alternative given the relatively small volumes (ca. 100 kt CO2/a).

The degree to which this diversity difference reflects the ages of the floras or their rates of evolutionary diversification has not been quantified. Measures of species diversity that do not incorporate the ages of lineages disregard the evolutionary distinctiveness of species. In contrast, phylogenetic diversity integrates both the number of species and their history of evolutionary diversification. Here we compared species diversity and phylogenetic diversity in a large number of flowering plant (angiosperm) floras distributed across EAS and ENA, two regions with similar contemporary environments and broadly shared floristic history. After accounting for climate and sample area, we found both species diversity and phylogenetic diversity to be significantly higher in EAS than in ENA. When we controlled the number of species statistically, we found that phylogenetic diversity remained substantially higher in EAS than in ENA, although it tended to converge at high latitude. This pattern held independently for herbs, shrubs, and trees. The anomaly in species and phylogenetic diversity likely resulted from differences in regional processes, related in part to high climatic and topographic heterogeneity, and a strong monsoon climate, in EAS. The broad connection between tropical and temperate floras in southern Asia also might have played a role in creating the phylogenetic diversity anomaly.","Flowering plants; Growth forms; Historical contingency; Phylogenetic diversity; Region effect","angiosperm; Article; Asia; climate; environment; flora; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; herb; latitude; nonhuman; North America; phylogeny; priority journal; species diversity; species richness; tree; angiosperm; demography; genetic variation; genetics; physiology; Asia; Demography; Genetic Variation; Magnoliopsida; North America; Phylogeny",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032199591

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and state transportation authorities have implemented many safety countermeasures to reduce forward collision in construction zones. However, due to the complexity of traffic in construction zones (or called work zones), traditional countermeasures often fail to prevent crashes. As such, smart warning systems could be very helpful in notifying drivers about upcoming conditions within a construction zone. In this study, a smartphone-based environment-friendly warning system was designed and its effectiveness on safety and emissions were investigated in the advance warning area of a construction zone. Four different warning messages were prepared (visual, sound, male voice and female voice) to alert drivers. Driving simulator tests with eighteen participants, driving through a construction zone for ninety rounds, were conducted to investigate the impact of smart-phone based warnings on performance measures, including headway distance, headway time, speed, deceleration, and emissions. Statistical results show that, with the help of voice (either female or male) warnings on forward collisions, acceleration rate and speed were significantly lower; and headway time and distance were significantly longer. The sound and voice warnings are beneficial to the reduction in total vehicle emissions. Moreover, participants found the notification system being user friendly and helped to avoid rear-end crashes in construction zones. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Advance warning area; Construction zone; Forward collision; Rear end crash; Safety emissions; Smart phone","Alarm systems; Highway accidents; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Advance warning area; Environment friendly; Forward collision; Forward collision warnings; National highway traffic safety administrations; Notification systems; Rear-end crashes; Safety countermeasures; Safety factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024880913

The magnitude of the slurry viscosity has been suggested as a primary means of determining the risk and severity of flow blockage, but there is a dearth of data available to calibrate predictive models of hydrate-in-oil slurry viscosity. This work deploys a controlled-stress, high-pressure rheometer to characterize the rheological properties of methane hydrate-in-crude oil slurries, which were generated in situ from water-in-oil emulsions. A vane blade rotor was found to maintain sufficient methane saturation in the oil phase during the hydrate growth period to allow near full conversion of the water. Dynamic measurements with the rheometer were able to separate the contributions to the viscosity change as the emulsion converted to a hydrate slurry due to (i) formation of the solid particles and (ii) reduction of the methane content in the oil continuous phase. For 5–30 vol% watercut systems, the slurry viscosity increased between 20 and 60 times during hydrate growth, whereas, under equivalent conditions for a 20% watercut emulsion, the viscosity increase due to the desaturation of methane from the oil phase was less than a factor of two. The steady-state hydrate-in-oil slurry demonstrated shear thinning behavior at both 1 and 5° C.

This study uses a network approach to calculate CO2 emissions of purchased electricity in Chinese provinces. The CO2 emission factors of purchased electricity range from 265 g/kWh in Sichuan to 947 g/kWh in Inner Mongolia. We find that emission factors of purchased electricity in many provinces are quite different from the emission factors of electricity generation. This indicates the importance of the network approach in accurately reflecting embodied emissions. We also observe substantial variations of emissions factors of purchased electricity within subnational grids: the provincial emission factors deviate from the corresponding subnational-grid averages from -58% to 44%. This implies that using subnational-grid averages as required by Chinese government agencies can be quite inaccurate for reporting indirect CO2 emissions of enterprises' purchased electricity. The network approach can improve the accuracy of the quantification of embodied emissions in purchased electricity and emission flows embodied in electricity transmission. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Environmental technology; Sales; Chinese Government; Electricity generation; Electricity transmission; Electricity-consumption; Embodied emissions; Emissions factors; Environmental science; Substantial variations; Electric power transmission networks; carbon emission; electricity generation; electricity supply; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; governance approach; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate; combustion; electric power plant; electricity; government; hydropower; Inner Mongolia; China; Nei Monggol; Sichuan; carbon dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; China; Electricity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029692679

From these deposits we present a new stable isotopic record of paleoenvironmental conditions over portions of the past ~ 11.5 Ma. U-Pb dates from the carbonates, both surface and subsurface, demonstrate that springs have discharged at this location over much of the last 11.5 Ma, attesting to the exceptional geomorphic stability of the central Atacama. Many of the sampled vein systems line vertical fissures, and formed within the aquifer before groundwater discharged at the surface. Carbonates in such circumstances should not undergo off-gassing and kinetic fractionation prior to formation, simplifying the interpretation of their isotopic composition. Oxygen isotopic compositions of carbonates are generally high (&gt;− 5‰VPDB), and using paleospring water temperatures of 3–13 °C reconstructed from clumped isotopes, point to strongly (up to 50%) evaporated water isotope values, like those associated with the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert today. Carbon isotopic compositions are also high (≥+3‰ PDB), reflecting a recharge area essentially devoid of plants and dominated by volcanic CO2, as is the case today. Our isotopic results are very similar to those from the Calama Basin to the north, suggesting that the western face of the Andes between 21 and 25°S has been highly evaporative and nearly plantless when these springs discharged over the last 11.5 Ma. The spring carbonates at Barrancas Blancas strongly resemble those found at Devils Hole and Furnace Creek in Death Valley, USA, and as such warrant further exploration as potential archives of climate change. © 2017","Andes; Atacama Desert; Devils Hole; Fluid inclusions; Stable isotopes; Travertine; U-Pb dating","Aquifers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Climate change; Deposits; Geochronology; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Landforms; Lead; Limestone; Andes; Atacama Desert; Devils Hole; Fluid inclusion; Stable isotopes; Travertine; U-Pb dating; Isotopes; fluid inclusion; isotopic composition; Neogene; oxygen isotope; paleoenvironment; sediment chemistry; stable isotope; travertine; uranium-lead dating; Andes; Atacama Desert; California; Chile; Death Valley; Devils Hole; Furnace Creek; Nevada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020234751

Understanding how to build livelihood resilience to these effects is a pressing need. Agroforestry is one potential solution. Although many people intuitively link agroforestry with livelihood resilience to floods and drought, little comprehensive empirical evidence exists. Here, we strive to answer the call for more empirical evidence by drawing on field work in Isiolo County, Kenya to ask the research question: How does agroforestry help smallholder farmers build livelihood resilience to floods and drought? We used a mixed-methods approach that included 20 qualitative case study households and 338 quantitative household surveys. Our major findings are: (1) practicing agroforestry can influence perceptions of floods and drought, (2) specific environmental and livelihood benefits of agroforestry contribute to livelihood resilience, and (3) agroforestry directly and indirectly builds livelihood resilience to floods and drought. Identifying potential climate change adaptation strategies is crucial for smallholder farmers. Our research indicates that agroforestry is one promising option. © 2017 by the author(s).","Agroforestry; Climate change; Drought; Flood; Kenya; Resilience; Sustainable livelihoods","agroforestry; climate change; drought; flood; livelihood; semiarid region; smallholder; sustainability; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030543147

The additional information generated by unconventional sampling and/or sensors can be used by decision makers for setting strategies of reduction of the impact of specific sources, when these last ones are responsible of an unsustainable incidence in contributing to the local air pollution. A few case studies were selected and have been analysed to discuss about the advantages in integrating the conventional monitoring tools with other ones that are innovative (not alternative) but not official yet. The selected case studies belong to two categories: A) the first one concerns the identification of the role of a single source in contributing to the local air pollution, b) the second one concerns the assessment of the role of a sector in the local presence of air pollutants.

In this paper we showed how ab initio Valence Bond (VB) calculations based on the set of Kekulé structures of a given polycyclic conjugated molecule can be used to obtain more accurate π-electron contents of rings (VB-EC) as the true computed weights of the Kekulé structures are used, instead of postulating that all Kekulé structures have equal weights as in the EC formula. In the case of benzenoid hydrocarbons, the values of VB-EC and EC are very close. The main difference is found for linear polyacenes, for which, contrary to the EC, the VB-EC values predict that the inner rings are more aromatic than the terminal rings. The original EC method has also the disadvantage that it cannot be applied to heterocyclic conjugated molecules. It was shown that the VB-EC method can be used to assess the local aromaticity in aza derivatives of naphthalene. The calculated VB-EC values were compared with several other aromaticity indices, namely: energy effect (ef), harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) index, six center delocalization index (SCI) and nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS). The best correlation was found between the VB-EC and SCI, implying that these two indices carry similar information on the local aromaticity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aromaticity; Kekulé structures; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Valence-Bond Theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011968938

A mixture of triethylamine and water was used as the switchable-hydrophilicity solvent. The pH was regulated using carbon dioxide; hence the ratio of the ionized and non-ionized form of triethylamine could control the optimum conditions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was utilized as an ion-pairing agent. The ion-associate complex formed between the cationic paraquat and sodium dodecyl sulfate was extracted into triethylamine. The separation of the two phases was carried out by the addition of sodium hydroxide, which changed the ionization state of triethylamine. The effects of some important parameters on the extraction recovery were investigated. Under the optimum conditions (500 μL of the extraction solvent, 1 mg sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2.0 mL of 10 mol/L sodium hydroxide, and pH 4), the limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 0.2 and 0.5 μg/L, respectively, with preconcentration factor of 74.

Although vehicular emissions have long been considered one of the major sources of ultrafine particles in urban areas, the contribution of other major urban sources is not yet fully understood. This paper aims to determine and quantify the contribution of local ground traffic, nucleated particle (NP) formation and distant non-traffic (e.g. airport, oil refineries, and seaport) sources to the total ambient particle number concentration (PNC) in a busy, inner-city area in Brisbane, Australia using Bayesian statistical modelling and other exploratory tools. The Bayesian model was trained on the PNC data on days where NP formations were known to have not occurred, hourly traffic counts, solar radiation data, and smooth daily trend. The model was applied to apportion and quantify the contribution of NP formations and local traffic and non-traffic sources to UFPs. The data analysis incorporated long-term measured time-series of total PNC (D ≥ 6 nm), particle number size distributions (PSD, D = 8 to 400 nm), PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, meteorological parameters and traffic counts at a stationary monitoring site. The developed Bayesian model showed reliable predictive performances in quantifying the contribution of NP formation events to UFPs (up to 4 × 104 particles cm− 3), with a significant day to day variability. The model identified potential NP formation and no-formations days based on PNC data and quantified the sources contribution to UFPs. Exploratory statistical analyses show that total mean PNC during the middle of the day was up to 32% higher than during peak morning and evening traffic periods, which were associated with NP formation events. The majority of UFPs measured during the peak traffic and NP formation periods were between 30–100 nm and smaller than 30 nm, respectively. To date, this is the first application of Bayesian model to apportion different sources contribution to UFPs, and therefore the importance of this study is not only in its modelling outcomes but in demonstrating the applicability and advantages of this statistical approach to air pollution studies. © 2017","Ambient ultrafine particles; Bayesian statistical model; Non-traffic sources; Nucleated particle formation; Urban area","Bayesian networks; Particle size analysis; Statistical methods; Time series analysis; Bayesian statistical model; Nucleated particles; Traffic sources; Ultrafine particle; Urban areas; Airport vehicular traffic; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; concentration (composition); particle size; particulate matter; size distribution; traffic emission; urban area; Australia; Brisbane; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018278045

This study is based on a primary dataset collected from 500 farmers through a field survey from the seven districts of the Himalayan region of northern Pakistan: Ghizer, Gilgit, Diamer, Astore, Skardu, Ghance, and Hunza-Nagar. A multivariate probit was employed to estimate the determinants of choice of adaptation strategies by farmers and a propensity score matching approach was used to estimate the impact of coping strategies on wellbeing. The most common climate-risk management strategies adopted at farm level include an adjustment in the sowing time, adoption of resistant varieties, tree plantation, non-farm participation as well as crop-livestock interaction. The impact of all these risk-management strategies was estimated individually as well as jointly. The empirical results indicated that farmers with higher levels of education and secured land rights mostly adopt more climate-risk mitigating strategies. The overall PSM results show that household income levels are high (in the range of PKR 1658–2610 per month), indicating that those households adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher income levels. The ATT results for the wheat yield are in the range of 42–65 kg per hectare, indicating that farmers adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher wheat yields. The ATT results for poverty are negative and significant, indicating that households adopting climate-risk management strategies have lower poverty levels (in the range of 2–4%). Increasing public awareness and supporting households in risk-mitigating strategies in the Himalayan region could be a crucial policy measure in reducing vulnerability to climate change, thereby increasing wellbeing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Himalayas; Pakistan; Poverty; Propensity score matching",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020100022

We used a long-term data set of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), collected from one of the most polluted sites in Finland during the past 23 years to study the effects of metal pollution on body condition of breeding females. Our results show that body mass started to decline already some days before hatching, indicating a preparation of females to forthcoming chick feeding period. We did not find long-term temporal trends in female body condition index (BCI) in spite of considerably reduced metal emissions during the study period. However, females had higher BCI in polluted than in unpolluted areas during the incubation period. For both incubation and nestling periods the body condition was lower for later breeders, though the condition index decreased slightly faster in relation to hatching date in polluted areas, which may be due to more drastic decrease in nutrition rich food abundance. Temperature and clutch size were positively associated with BCI during the incubation period, but not in the nestling period. Overall, our data suggest that environmental pollution modifies important life-history traits, potentially via indirect effects of higher environmental variability and changed phenology in polluted environment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Body condition; Body mass; Ficedula hypoleuca; Metal pollution; Pied flycatcher",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015628581

Plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated over the hybrid nanosystem of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and graphene quantum dots (GQD) by citrate reduction method. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) induced enhancement of Raman G and 2D band intensity is encountered on excitation of the Plasmonic hybrid at 514.5 nm, which is near to the 532 nm absorption band of Au NPs. Time-resolved photoluminescence and XPS studies show charge transfer interaction between GQD-GCN and Au NPs. Plasmonic hybrid exhibits an enhanced PC activity over the other catalysts in the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light illumination. Plasmonic photocatalyst displays more than 6 fold enhancement in the photodecomposition rate of MB over GQD and nearly 2 fold improvement over GCN and GQD-GCN. GQD-GCN absorbs mostly in the near visible region and can be photoexcited by visible light of wavelength (λ) < 460 nm. Plasmon activation in Au NPs decorated GQD-GCN could exploit the entire UV-visible light for photocatalysis. Furthermore, plasmonic Au act as antennas for accumulation and enhancement of localized electromagnetic field at the interface with GQD-GCN, and thereby promotes photogeneration of large numbers of carriers on GQD-GCN. The carriers are separated by charge transfer migration from hybrid to Au NPs. Finally, the carriers on the plasmonic Au nanostructures initiate MB degradation under visible light. Our results have shown that plasmon decoration is a suitable strategy to design a carbon based hybrid photocatalyst for solar energy conversion. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","colloid; luminescence; optical","Aromatic compounds; Carbon nitride; Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Colloids; Electromagnetic fields; Energy conversion; Gold; Graphene; Luminescence; Nanocrystals; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Nitrides; Plasmons; Semiconductor quantum dots; Solar energy; Surface plasmon resonance; Charge transfer interaction; Citrate reduction methods; Graphitic carbon nitrides; optical; Photocatalytic performance; Photodegradation of methylene blue; Plasmonic photocatalysts; Time-resolved photoluminescence; Light",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029538746

District heating as an efficient solution for heat supply and distribution can play a major part in meeting these targets. One key issue concerning district heating is the integration of renewables. The current study focuses on solar assisted district heating systems. Centralised and distributed solar collectors in an existing district heating system are investigated. The effects of reducing supply temperature are studied in two scenarios. Outdoor dependent supply temperature level (115-80 °C) and low supply temperature level (65 °C) are considered. Both distributed and centralised systems are defined with same investment costs, but different capacities due to differences in unit costs (€/kW). The aim is to study cost-efficient solutions for integrating solar heating an existing district heating system. Heat demand consisting of space heating and domestic hot water consumption, solar collectors and district heating network itself are all modelled by dedicated models in order to provide realistic input for a techno-economic analysis. Investigation is based on a case study of a local district heating system in Finland with an annual heat consumption of 1.2 GWh and a heat demand density of 0.74 MWh/m. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","4GDH; Low temperature district heating; Renewable heat supply; Solar assisted district heating","Costs; District heating; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Solar collectors; Temperature; 4GDH; District heating networks; District heating system; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Integration of renewables; Low temperatures; Renewable heat; Solar assisted district heating; Solar heating; cost analysis; emission; emission control; energy resource; European Union; greenhouse gas; heating; low temperature; renewable resource; solar power; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017564271

However, the large-scale impact of such strategies has not been quantified. Using new models and data sets representing 637 Chinese cities, we find that such cross-sectoral strategies - enabled by compact urban design and circular economy policies - contribute an additional 15%-36% to national CO2 mitigation, compared to conventional single-sector strategies. As a co-benefit, ∼25,500 to ∼7,500 deaths annually are avoided from air pollution reduction. The benefits are highly variable across cities, ranging from &lt;1%-37% for CO2 emission reduction and &lt;1%-47% for avoided premature deaths. These results, using multi-scale, multi-sector physical systems modelling, identify cities with high carbon and health co-benefit potential and show that urban-industrial symbiosis is a significant carbon mitigation strategy, achievable with a combination of existing and advanced technologies in diverse city types. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In this study, we assessed on-field environmental impacts related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) by modeling representative agro-ecological conditions prevalent in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. We used the biophysical model Cycles to simulate management scenarios for maize-soybean cropping systems that included winter rye (Secale cereale L.). The model was used to quantify changes in N losses via nitrate leaching (NO3), emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3), changes in soil organic carbon, and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per megajoule (CO2eq MJ− 1). Including winter rye in the rotation reduced NO3 leaching over a winter fallow control (77% on average), even when the winter rye was fertilized and regardless of whether stover, winter rye, or both cellulosic feedstocks were harvested. Applying fertilizer to winter rye did however increase NO3 leaching as well as NH3 and N2O emissions. Model results consistently showed fertilizing the winter rye improved both biomass yield and soil C levels compared to unfertilized winter rye, regardless of location, soil, fertilizer type or stover harvest. While it is difficult to simultaneously reduce agricultural nitrogen losses, produce renewable energy and increase soil carbon, results can guide management of these trade-offs while tapping into an abundant energy resource and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2017","Carbon nitrogen cycling; Cellulosic bioenergy; CO2eq emissions; Double cropping systems; Environmental impact; Water quality","agricultural emission; bioenergy; carbon cycle; carbon emission; cellulose; crop rotation; environmental impact; farming system; fertilizer application; grass; greenhouse gas; leaching; maize; nitrogen cycle; organic carbon; soil carbon; soybean; trade-off; water quality; Chesapeake Bay; Mid-Atlantic States; United States; United States; Glycine max; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020247049

These materials were processed via silicon melt infiltration of wood-derived carbon scaffolds. In this approach, heat flux was measured through the thickness when one side of the specimen was heated with a 10.6-µm CO2 laser. A thin mullite layer was applied to the heated surface to ensure absorption and minimize reflection losses, as well as to ensure a consistent emissivity to facilitate radiative loss corrections. The influence of the mullite layer was accounted for in the thermal conductivity calculations. The effect of microstructure and composition (inherited from the wood carbonaceous performs) on measured conductivity was evaluated. To establish a baseline for comparison, a dense, commercially available sintered SiC ceramic was also evaluated. It was observed that at a given temperature, thermal conductivity falls between that of single-crystal silicon and fine-grained polycrystalline SiC and can be rationalized in terms of the SiC volume fraction in biomorphic SiC/Si material. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ceramic materials; Heat flux; Mullite; Polycrystalline materials; Scaffolds; Silicate minerals; Silicon; Silicon carbide; Silicon wafers; Single crystals; Derived carbons; Heat flux method; Heated surfaces; High temperature; Polycrystalline SiC; SiC volume fractions; Single crystal silicon; Two-phase materials; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019960380

Values-based approaches to climate change adaptation examine how risks to place attachments are distributed within and among communities, with a view to informing equitable adaptation policies. In this nascent body of research, divergent theoretical frameworks and empirical approaches to measuring social values are evolving. While some studies explore the things people value about their everyday lives generally—the lived values approach, others locate specific social and cultural values in geographic space—the landscape values mapping approach. This study aims to compare the explanatory value of these two approaches for understanding the social risks of sea-level rise, and appraise whether either or both approaches are likely to meet local adaptation planning needs. It does this by examining the potential social impacts of sea-level rise in Kingston Beach, Australia, informed by a mail-out survey of the community. The lived values approach identified that the natural environment, scenery, relaxed lifestyle and safety are highly important to local residents, while the landscape values mapping approach revealed that Kingston Main Beach is the most highly valued of eight coastal landscape units. Incorporating the landscape values mapping into the lived values cluster analysis revealed that while Kingston Main Beach is highly important for its recreational value to some members of the community, for others manmade features such as community halls or sports ovals may be of higher importance because they facilitate social interactions. There is potential to further integrate these two approaches to better inform adaptation policy about how lived and landscape values are distributed among communities, where they are located in space and whether they change over time. A deeper understanding of such assigned values can lead to improved engagement with coastal residents to inform adaptation policy now and into the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal inundation; Local communities; Place values; Policy; Public participation GIS; Vulnerability","adult; Article; climate change; cluster analysis; coastal waters; community; environmental impact; explanatory variable; female; full time employment; human; landscape; local adaptation; male; middle aged; pensioner; physical activity; priority journal; public policy; recreation; residential area; sea level rise; seashore; semi structured interview; social interaction; social participation; social psychology; Tasmania; team sport; work-life balance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021719021

H2 emission is found in most of them (14 out of 15), mostly associated with rings at their equatorial regions and with their bipolar lobes. These detections add to the high occurrence of H2 emission among bipolar PNe reported in previous works, resulting from the large reservoir of molecular material in these sources and the suitable excitation conditions for H2 emission. The correlation between detailed bipolar morphology and H2 luminosity is also confirmed: bipolar PNe with broad equatorial rings (R-BPNe) have almost no continuum emission, are H2 brighter and have larger H2/Br γ line ratio than bipolar PNe with pinched equatorial waists (W-BPNe). The origin of this dichotomy is unclear. The larger size and age of R-BPNe are consistent with shock excitation of H2, whereas ultraviolet pumping is most likely the excitationmechanism in the smaller and younger W-BPNe, which would explain their lower H2 luminosity. Although both types of bipolar PNe seem to proceed from the same progenitor population, this does not imply that R-BPNe descend fromW-BPNe. Otherwise, we note that some of the H2-weak bipolar PNe harbor post-common envelope binary systems and symbiotic stars. Finally, we suggest that the long-living H2 emission from R-BPNe arises from a discrete distribution of compact knots embedded within the ionized gas at the equatorial region. © 2017 The Authors.","Infrared: ISM; ISM: lines and bands; ISM: molecules; Planetary nebulae: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037146711

This work is based on properties of whole oils such as API gravity, sulfur, vanadium and nickel concentrations, and gas chromatography fingerprints. The framework is completed by inclusion of biomarker parameters derived from GCMS and GCMSMS analysis. Oils from the basins of the Middle Magdalena Valley, Upper Magdalena Valley, Sinú - San Jacinto, Putumayo-Caguan, Lower Magdalena Valley and Catatumbo were assessed. Conclusions were drawn regarding possible sources of origin, oil families, degree of thermal evolution, biodegradation, mixing and refreshing, and inferences regarding exploration implications. The oils from the Middle Magdalena Valley and Upper Magdalena Valley (intermontane basins) and Putumayo (foreland basin), except those from the Caguan area, are oils with similar characteristics. In these three cases the oils are probably coming from source rocks intervals deposited in a marine Cretaceous platform, with variable carbonate/siliciclastic features. In these basins there are no oils derived from Tertiary source rocks. In Sinú-San Jacinto and Lower Magdalena Valley basins the main proportions of oils comes from very proximal environments, probably deltaic type, of Tertiary age with a minor proportion of oils coming from Cretaceous source rocks of marine anoxic environment (the only marine Cretaceous oils discovered so far in the Sinú-San Jacinto and Lower Magdalena Valley basins). The oils from Eastern Foothills of the Eastern Cordillera, look to be derived mainly from proximal Cretaceous source rocks with some mixing of oils derived from Tertiary strata. In the Catatumbo basin there are oils derived mainly from Cretaceous source rocks and some from Tertiary source rocks. Regarding the processes after entrapment, in all of the basins, the biodegradation effects were observed in varying degrees. These processes are dominant toward more quiescent regions, beyond the areas with more tectonic activity, far from the foothills of the Eastern Cordillera.

The coating of carbon (C) on boron (B) powders was achieved by direct pyrolysis of naphthalene at 120 °C and then the C-coated B powders were mixed well with appropriate amount of Mg by solid state reaction method. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that there is a noticeable shift in (100) and (110) Bragg reflections towards higher angles, while no shift was observed in (002) reflections for MgB2 doped with carbon. As compared to un-doped MgB2, a systematic enhancement in Jc(H) properties with increasing carbon doping level was observed for naphthalene-derived C-doped MgB2 samples. The substantial enhancement in Jc is most likely due to the incorporation of C into MgB2 lattice and the reduction in crystallite size, as evidenced by the increase in the FWHM values for doped samples. © 2017, Korea Institute of Applied Superconductivity and Cryogenics.

However, only a small share of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under the Kyoto Protocol and only 30% of public climate finance is invested in urban areas. One of the main reasons is that most urban climate change mitigation projects rather provide development than climate benefits, so the question is whether alternative mechanisms can mobilize urban mitigation projects. In this paper, we analyze a set of three case studies — representative urban waste and transportation projects in Indonesia, Kenya, Sri Lanka — to compare the market and economic value of climate and development co-benefits. For the projects, we monetize the co-benefits accruing to the local community. We find that under current market conditions, climate benefits have little effect on projects’ financial viability, and can be effectively ignored. By contrast, we find, the monetization of development co-benefits significantly improves financial viability, based on calculated net present values and internal rates of return. Our results highlight the importance of local, national and international financing and policies that monetize such development co-benefits. © 2017 The Authors","Cities; Climate mitigation policies; Co-benefits; Financial modelling; Low carbon investment","Climate change; Commerce; Developing countries; Economics; Emission control; Finance; Investments; Transportation; Cities; Clean Development Mechanism; Climate mitigations; Co benefits; Locus of attentions; Low carbon; Mitigation projects; Transportation projects; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021051345

Static and dynamic panel estimation was used in these studies. Based on static panel estimation, from fixed effects model estimation, we found that real GDP per capita (LNGD P) have a negative relationship with CO2 emission and thus validate Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in the long run. Other variables such as energy consumption (LNENY), trade openness (LNTO) and growth of urban population (LNPOP) have a positive relationship with CO2 emissions. The highest contributor to CO2 emissions is LNPOP, followed by LNENY and LNTO. As for dynamic panel estimation, we choose Pooled Mean group estimation over Mean group estimation after performing Hausman test. Based on this estimation, the outcome of LNGDP is also supporting EKC hypothesis given that LNGDP has a negative relationship with CO2 emissions. LNENY, on the other hand, has a positive correlation with CO2 emission. This indicates that over time, higher LNENY especially in the newly industries countries give a rise to more CO2 emissions and thus decrease the environmental quality. To respond to global climate change, it is crucial for Asia Pacific countries to develop innovative technology for energy use and practise the clean development mechanism to reduce air pollution. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

This study presents a comparative measurement campaign carried out with on-site and ground-based remote sensing measurement approaches conducted by six measuring teams at a Swedish biowaste treatment plant. The measured emissions showed high variations, amongst others caused by different periods of measurement performance in connection with varying operational states of the plant. The overall methane emissions measured by ground-based remote sensing varied from 5 to 25 kg h−1 (corresponding to a methane loss of 0.6–3.0% of upgraded methane produced), depending on operating conditions and the measurement method applied. Overall methane emissions measured by the on-site measuring approaches varied between 5 and 17 kg h−1 (corresponding to a methane loss of 0.6 and 2.1%) from team to team, depending on the number of measured emission points, operational state during the measurements and the measurement method applied. Taking the operational conditions into account, the deviation between different approaches and teams could be explained, in that the two largest methane-emitting sources, contributing about 90% of the entire site's emissions, were found to be the open digestate storage tank and a pressure release valve on the compressor station. © 2017","Biogas; Biowaste; Diffuse emissions; Leak detection; Remote sensing; Tracer dispersion","Biogas; Leak detection; Methane; Bio-waste; Comparative measurements; Compressor stations; Diffuse emission; Emission measurement; Ground-based remote sensing; Operational conditions; Tracer dispersion; Remote sensing; biogas; methane; biofuel; biogas; comparative study; detection method; diffusion; emission inventory; ground-based measurement; leakage; methane; remote sensing; tracer; waste treatment; water treatment plant; Article; compressor; concentration (parameters); controlled study; intermethod comparison; measurement; pressure release valve; priority journal; remote sensing; storage; Sweden; waste management; bioreactor; environmental monitoring; Sweden; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Environmental Monitoring; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020823125

However, weather conditions in the SO restrict mainly in situ observations of plankton communities to spring and summer, preventing the description of biological successions at an annual scale. Here, we use shipboard observations collected in the Indian sector of the SO to develop a multivariate relationship between physical and bio-optical data, and, the composition and carbon content of the plankton community. Then we apply this multivariate relationship to five biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats deployed within the same bio-geographical zone as the ship-board observations to describe spatial and seasonal changes in plankton assemblage. The floats reveal a high contribution of bacteria below the mixed layer, an overall low abundance of picoplankton and a seasonal succession from nano- to microplankton during the spring bloom. Both naturally iron-fertilized waters downstream of the Crozet and Kerguelen Plateaus show elevated phytoplankton biomass in spring and summer but they differ by a nano- or microplankton dominance at Crozet and Kerguelen, respectively. The estimated plankton group successions appear consistent with independent estimations of particle diameter based on the optical signals. Furthermore, the comparison of the plankton community composition in the surface layer with the presence of large mesopelagic particles diagnosed by spikes of optical signals provides insight into the nature and temporal changes of ecological vectors that drive particle export. This study emphasizes the power of BGC-Argo floats for investigating important biogeochemical processes at high temporal and spatial resolution. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

In all, 20 bulls were fed with maize or grass silage as roughage, and with concentrate with or without 300 g FA per animal and day during the whole fattening period. After slaughtering, the organs were weighed and blood serum was analysed for glucose, β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) and non-esterified fatty acid concentration. The ruminal fluid was analysed for short-chain fatty acids, ammonia-N and the microbial community via single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The rumen wall was examined histopathologically and results were graded as 'no visible lesions', 'few inflammatory infiltrates', 'some inflammatory infiltrates' or 'several inflammatory infiltrates'. In addition, the dimensions of the rumen villi were measured. The FA supplementation decreased the serum BHB concentration and the butyric acid concentration in the ruminal fluid. The microbial community in the ruminal fluid was not influenced by FA. An interaction between FA and silage type was observed for the inflammation centres counted in the villous area of rumen papillae. This interaction was also observed in the length and surface of the rumen villi. Rumen villi results show that the influence of FA depends on the roughage used in the diet. © 2017 The Animal Consortium.","fumaric acid; growing bulls; organ weights; ruminal parameters; silage","3 hydroxybutyric acid; fumaric acid; fumaric acid derivative; methane; volatile fatty acid; analysis; animal; bovine; chemistry; diet; dietary fiber; food grain; growth, development and aging; maize; male; metabolism; organ size; pH; physiology; Poaceae; rumen; silage; veterinary; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Dietary Fiber; Edible Grain; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Fumarates; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Methane; Organ Size; Poaceae; Rumen; Silage; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017409768

While catalysts have been developed for the pertinent half-reaction of CO2 reduction to C2 molecules, an integrated system for this purpose has never been designed and built. In this work, we demonstrate an energetically efficient formation of ethylene directly from CO2 and water (H2O) using solar energy at room temperature and pressure. A two-electrode cell (electrolyzer) was designed, and cell parameters such as electrolyte and voltage were optimized. Oxide-derived copper (Cu) and iridium oxide (IrOx) were used as electrocatalysts respectively in the cathode and anode. Coupling this electrolyzer with silicon solar panels under laboratory 1 sun illumination (100 mW/cm2), we show that CO2 could be facilely reduced to ethylene with a faradaic efficiency of 31.9%, partial current density of 6.5 mA/cm2, and a solar-to-ethylene energy efficiency of 1.5%. When liquid fuels such as ethanol and n-propanol were included, the total solar-to-fuel efficiency was 2.9%. These outstanding figures-of-merits are the state-of-the-art. We also introduced insoluble chelating agents in the electrolyte to capture contaminants such as dissolved iridium ions, and thus significantly improved the longevity of the electrolyzer. Compared to previously reported solar-to-fuel setups which were only tested under simulated sunlight, our system, when coupled with a rechargeable battery, could run and produce ethylene continuously using only intermittent natural sunlight. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Artificial photosynthesis; Carbon dioxide; Electrocatalysis; Ethylene; Solar energy","Chelation; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Energy efficiency; Ethanol fuels; Ethylene; Fuels; Iridium; Photosynthesis; Solar energy; Artificial photosynthesis; Chemical feedstocks; Continuous production; Ethylene energy efficiencies; Faradaic efficiencies; Large-scale deployment; Temperature and pressures; Two electrode cells; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030450607

In recent years, there has been a substantial interest in the variation of sunshine duration due to the dramatic global climate change. Hence, there is a need to better understand the variation of sunshine duration in order to cope with climate change. This study aimed to analyze the variation of sunshine duration in Haihe River basin, China, and its relationship with temperature, wind speed and low-level cloudiness. The annual, seasonal and monthly changes of sunshine duration were analyzed based on the data collected from 33 meteorological stations over the Haihe River basin during 1966-2015. It is evident that the annual, seasonal and monthly sunshine duration shows a decreasing trend over time. In addition, the annual sunshine duration is lower with a higher climate tendency rate in the southern and eastern coastal regions than that in the northwestern regions. It is negatively correlated with temperature (r = -0.50) and low-level cloudiness (r = -0.29), but positively with wind speed (r = 0.61). Wind speed may be one of the important causes of the decrease of sunshine duration in the Haihe River basin during 1966-2015. These changes may have significant implications for the hydrological cycle in the area. © 2017 by the authors.

While introducing ornamental plants can enhance the biodiversity of green spaces it risks environmental impacts such as increasing emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that are harmful to air quality and human health. The present study, taking Qingdao City as a case study, evaluated the plant diversity and BVOC emissions of urban green spaces and tried to find out a solution to increase biodiversity while reducing BVOC emissions. Results showed that: (1) the species diversity and phylogenetic diversity of trees in urban green spaces were 22% and 16% lower than rural forest of this region; (2) urban areas had higher BVOC emission intensity (2.6 g C m−2 yr−1) than their rural surroundings (2.1 g C m−2 yr−1); (3) introducing the selected 11 tree species will increase 15% and 11% of species diversity and phylogenetic diversity, respectively; and (4) the BVOC emissions from green spaces will more than triple by 2050, but a moderate introduction of the selected low-emitting trees species could reduce 34% of these emissions. The scheme of introducing low-emitting ornamental species leads to a win–win situation and also has implications for the sustainable green space management of other cities. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Ecosystem services; Isoprene; Ozone; Urban greening; Urban planning","biodiversity; ecosystem service; environmental impact; greenspace; isoprene; ornamental species; ozone; phylogenetics; rural area; species diversity; tree; urban area; urban planning; volatile organic compound; China; Qingdao; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029537593

It discusses common definitions, provides quantitative estimates, and presents the evidence for key arguments in favour of subsidy reform. The main drivers and barriers for reform are also discussed, including the role of (low) oil prices and political economy challenges. Commitments to subsidy reform by the international community are reviewed, as well as the progress at the country level. Although fossil fuel subsidy reform indeed plays a critical role in climate policy, experience shows that the rationale for such reforms is determined in a complex environment of political economy challenges, macro-economic, fiscal and social factors, as well as external drivers such as energy prices. The article synthesizes the key principles for designing effective reforms and emphasizes that subsidy reforms cannot only yield fiscal relief, but should also contribute to long-term sustainable development objectives. Areas for future research are also identified. Policy relevance There is an increasingly strong international consensus that fossil fuel subsidies are detrimental in terms of economic, social and environmental sustainability. Organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency consider fossil fuel subsidy reform a critical measure for achieving any ambitious emissions mitigation target. The reason is that these subsidies not only incentivize overconsumption of carbon-intensive energy, but directly undermine any effort to impose a price on carbon (e.g. through carbon taxes). While subsidy reform is crucial from a climate change perspective, the wide range of externalities associated with fuel subsidies also underscores the fact that reform is a vital contribution to sustainable development objectives more generally. This article emphasizes that fossil fuel subsidy reform can make a substantial contribution to climate policy, but also discusses how strongly environmental objectives are intertwined with fiscal, macro-economic, political and social factors. Although the momentum for subsidy reform is building, reforms are often designed to deliver fiscal rather than environmental benefits. © 2016 The Author(s).

In SFG, a broadband mid-infrared (IR) pulse is combined with a narrowband visible pulse, generating a pulse at the sum frequency, which contains a spectrum that, due to the principles of nonlinear optics, originates solely from the electrified interface. Our SFG spectrometer can obtain one hundred or more spectra during a routine cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement. We used SFG to study a model for a Li-ion battery anode and a low-overpotential CO2 reduction reactor based on a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL). SFG spectra from these complex systems were difficult to interpret, in part due to the organic electrolytes that have a forest of infrared vibrational transitions. Here we discuss a rubric for experimental measurement and interpretation with such systems. We describe the electrified interface, or double layer, as consisting of the electrode surface, a region of adsorbed molecules and an outer diffuse electric double layer. We combined resonant SFG, where the IR pulses were tuned to vibrational transitions of adsorbates, with nonresonant SFG where the IR pulses were tuned away from all vibrational transitions. The former provides information about chemistry on the electrode surface and the latter about the potential-dependent response of the double layer. We show how this rubric can be used to understand solid-electrolyte interphase formation on a model for the Li-ion electrode, and how low-overpotential CO2 reduction on Ag is controlled by potential-driven structural transitions of the RTIL electrolyte. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide reduction; Ionic liquid; Lithium-ion battery; Nonlinear laser spectroscopy; Sum-frequency generation; Vibrational spectroscopy","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Interferometry; Ionic liquids; Ions; Laser spectroscopy; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Nonlinear optics; Pollution control; Reduction; Solid electrolytes; Spectrometers; Vibrational spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide reduction; Electrochemical interface; Electrochemical systems; Nonlinear laser spectroscopy; Room temperature ionic liquids; Solid electrolyte interphase; Sum frequency generation; Vibrational sum-frequency generations; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009231371

The multinomial logistic regression is used to quantify the link between HD and soft data. The soft data is converted by the logistic regression classifier into as many probability fields as there are categories. The local category proportions are used and compared to the average category probabilities within the patch. The conditioning to HD is obtained using alternative training images and by imposing large relative weights to HD. The conditioning to soft data is obtained by measuring the probability–proportion patch distance. Both 2D and 3D cases are considered. Synthetic cases show that a stationary TI can generate non-stationary realizations reproducing the HD, keeping the texture indicated by the TI and following the trends identified in probability maps obtained from soft data.

Location: Forests across southern South America, extending from tropical forests in southern Brazil, to the temperate forests of southern Chile and Argentina. Methods: We compiled a database of 742 forest tree community inventories spread over six countries and 12 biomes, or major vegetation types. In total, these inventories covered 3075 species of shrubs and trees. We combined this dataset with a temporally calibrated phylogeny that included all species. For each community, we evaluated multiple measures of evolutionary diversity, including phylogenetic diversity sensu stricto (PD), which is the sum of the branch lengths of a phylogeny that includes all species in a community, and its equivalent standardized for variation in species richness (ses.PD), which we refer to as lineage diversity. Results: We found that biome affiliation is the most important determinant of the evolutionary diversity of woody plant communities, with climate also showing a significant influence. Communities in wet evergreen tropical forest have the highest species richness and the highest PD, but the lowest lineage diversity, while temperate forests in southern South America show the lowest species richness and PD, but the highest lineage diversity. Main conclusions: Our results contradict the idea that temperate floras represent recently derived, evolutionarily poor subsets of tropical floras. Rather, the high lineage diversity we find in the temperate forest communities supports the ‘austral conservatism hypothesis’, which states that the flora of southern South america has evolved independently from the Neotropical Domain over tens of millions of years. Our identification of the evolutionary distinctness and richness of this flora suggests that it deserves as much conservation attention as the more species-rich tropical forests of South America and that southern South American forests should not be lumped into the Neotropical Floristic Province. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","austral conservatism hypothesis; biome; latitudinal gradients; lineage diversity; phylogenetic diversity; species richness; temperate forest; tropical conservatism hypothesis; tropical forest","biome; data set; database; geographical variation; latitudinal gradient; phylogeny; plant community; shrub; species richness; temperate forest; tropical forest; vegetation type; woody plant; Argentina; Brazil; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021195646

Thermal emission from dust in the disk is detected at 6.8 and 9.1 mm, whereas the 1.36 cm measured flux is dominated by ionized gas emission. We combine these data with previous observations at shorter sub-mm and mm wavelengths to test the predictions of dust evolution models in gas-rich disks after adapting their parameters to the case of 2M0444. These models show that the radial drift mechanism affecting solids in a gaseous environment has to be either completely made inefficient, or significantly slowed down by very strong gas pressure bumps in order to explain the presence of mm/cm-sized grains in the outer regions of the 2M0444 disk. We also discuss the possible mechanisms for the origin of the ionized gas emission detected at 1.36 cm. The inferred radio luminosity for this emission is in line with the relation between radio and bolometric luminosity valid for for more massive and luminous young stellar objects, and extrapolated down to the very low luminosity of the 2M0444 brown dwarf. © 2017.

Factors restricting the prevalence of modern microbialites have been linked predominantly with reduced marine calcium carbonate levels and metazoan disruption. Some living microbialites only manage to persist together with an abundant metazoan community because of, among other factors, the regulatory pressure of fish predators on the grazing macrofauna. In peritidal pools formed by layered microbialites (termed 'stromatolites') along the South African coastline, fishes occur regularly, yet the dynamics of their interactions with co-occurring metazoans or other habitat features are unknown. We therefore aimed to link multivariate fish abundance to correlates of potential food resources and physico-chemical variability, using a generalised linear modelling approach. The fish community comprised both a resident species (the gobiid Coryogalops sordidus) and a number of transient fishes, most notably Myxus capensis (Mugilidae) and Rhabdosargus holubi (Sparidae) that dominated the fish biomass in the pools yet displayed sporadic or seasonal fluctuations. Generally, fish abundance was largely related to physical forces primarily associated with spatial salinity gradients of pools as well as swell conditions, with resource variability offering some, but minimal overall, contribution. These insights suggest limited top-down predatory control by fishes on macrofauna, but rather that this environment invokes the recruitment of typical marine estuarine-dependent fish species. However, abundance and growth patterns of recruits suggest that these pools are unfavourable nurseries for juvenile development and export, likely because of their limited size, reduced feeding opportunities and spatial extent, unlike typical estuaries. © Inter-Research 2017.","Ichthyofauna; Juveniles; Living microbialite; Nursery; Predator; Recruitment cues; Tidal pools","abundance; biomass; calcium carbonate; dominance; ecological modeling; ichthyofauna; metazoan; microbialite; nursery ground; perciform; predator; stromatolite; tidal channel; Gobiidae; Metazoa; Mugilidae; Myxus capensis; Pisces; Rhabdosargus holubi; Sparidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030537045

While the effects of drought and plant community composition on individual carbon (C) related processes are well understood, their effect on multiple C-related processes simultaneously— multifunctionality—is poorly known. We studied the effect of drought on four C-related processes (net and gross CO2 exchange, methane fluxes, and dissolved organic carbon content) in a plant removal experiment. Plant functional type (PFT) removal (graminoids, herbs, Polytrichum spp., incl. combinations) negatively affected multifunctionality; most markedly when all PFTs were removed. Our results corroborate a negative drought effect on C-related multifunctionality. Drought reduced multifunctionality, and this reduction was again largest when all PFTs were removed. Our data further indicate that much of these negative drought effects were carried over and maintained from the initial removal treatment. These results suggest that while a high diversity in plant functional types is associated to high C-related multifunctionality, plant community assembly does not drive the ability of peatlands to withstand the negative impacts of drought on multifunctionality. Hence, to safeguard the carbon cycling function in intact peatlands, the effects of climate change on the functional composition of the peatland plant community needs to be minimized. © 2017 The Authors.","Carbon cycling; Ecosystem functions; Global change; Multiple functions; Plant functional types; Wetlands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032357799

First, the precursors were carbonized via either pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization, with the purpose of evaluating the influence of the carbonization process on the AC properties. Pyrolysis chars (pyrochars) were thermally more stable than hydrothermal carbonization chars (hydrochars); thus, more AC was yielded from pyrochars (AC yield calculated from the char amount). The difference between ACs from hydrochars and pyrochars was small regarding the AC yield calculated from the initial amount of biomass or lignin. Additionally, no considerable differences in terms of total surface area and surface chemistry were found between both ACs. To understand this, the mechanism of the activation was explained as a local alkali-catalyzed gasification. In the case of hydrochar, carbonization reactions occurred simultaneously to the gasification because of their lower thermal stability. Thus, the carbon content and yields of hydrochar ACs were similar to pyrochar ACs, but their microporous surface areas were lower, likely due to condensation of volatile matter. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Activated Carbon; Carbonization; Hydrothermal; Lignin; Pyrolysis","Activated carbon; Biomass; Carbonization; Chemical activation; Gasification; Lignin; Pyrolysis; Surface chemistry; Thermochemistry; Carbon content; Carbonization process; Catalyzed gasification; Hydrothermal; Hydrothermal carbonization; Micro-porous surfaces; Total surface area; Volatile matters; Wood; Carbon; Carbonization; Lignins; Pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028925274

The aim of the current study was to elucidate how long-term exposure to increased air humidity impacts night-time gaseous and liquid phase conductance and gas exchange in cut shoots of hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. × P. tremuloides Michx.) sampled from the free air humidity manipulation experimental site and measured at constant air relative humidity (RH) level in a growth chamber. Neither the early-night leaf conductance (gn1) nor canopy conductance (gc) differed (P &gt; 0.05) between the humidification (H) and control (C) treatments. However, there was a significant (P &lt; 0.01) difference in predawn leaf conductance (gn5) and shoot hydraulic conductance (K5) between the treatments, with the shoots from the H treatment opening their stomata more efficiently before dawn. Both the early-night dark respiration (R1) and height increment of stump sprouts were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) in the control than in the H treatment. Although the relationship between gn5 and predawn dark respiration (R5) was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) in the H treatment, the gn5 did not depend on R5 in the C treatment. Our findings suggest that endogenous increase in predawn water flux associates with decreased growth rate of hybrid aspen grown at elevated RH. Thus, regional changes in air humidity may potentially impact night-time water relations in fast-growing tree species like hybrid aspen. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Canopy conductance; Free air humidity manipulation; Night-time gas exchange; Night-time leaf conductance; Predawn stomatal opening; Vapour pressure difference between leaf and atmosphere",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978085694

Identification of water deficit tolerant potato genotypes is an adaptation strategy to mitigate the climatic changes that are occurring in the Cundiboyacense region in Colombia. Previous studies have evaluated potato plants under water stress conditions using physiological analyses. However, these methodologies require considerable amounts of time and plant material to perform these measurements. This study evaluated and compared the physiological and spectral traits between two genotypes, Diacol Capiro and Perla Negra under two drought levels (10 and 15 days without irrigation from flowering). Reflectance information was used to calculate indexes which were associated with the physiological behavior in plants. The results showed that spectral information was correlated (ρ &lt; 0.0001) with physiological variables such as foliar area (FA), total water content (H2Ot), relative growth rate of potato tubers (RGTtub), leaf area ratio (LAR), and foliar area index (AFI). In general, there was a higher concentration of chlorophyll under drought treatments. In addition, Perla Negra under water deficit treatments did not show significant differences in its physiological variables. Therefore, it could be considered a drought tolerant genotype because its physiological performance was not affected under water stress conditions. However, yield was affected in both genotypes after being subject to 15 days of drought. The results suggested that reflectance indexes are a useful and affordable approach for potato phenotyping to select parent and segregant populations in breeding programs. © 2017 Romero, Alarcón, Valbuena and Galeano.","Correlation; Drought tolerance; Potato breeding; Reflectance indexes; Stomatal conductance; Yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030844826

For obliquity exceeding 55°, the weakest insolation occurs at the equator. Stable partial snow and ice cover on such a planet would be in the form of a belt about the equator rather than polar caps. An analytical model of planetary climate is used to investigate the stability of ice caps and ice belts over the widest possible range of parameters. The model is a non-dimensional diffusive Energy Balance Model, representing insolation, heat transport, and ice-albedo feedback on a spherical planet. A complete analytical solution for any obliquity is given and validated against numerical solutions of a seasonal model in the ""deep-water"" regime of weak seasonal ice line migration. Multiple equilibria and unstable transitions between climate states (ice-free, Snowball, or ice cap/belt) are found over wide swaths of parameter space, including a ""Large Ice-Belt Instability"" and ""Small Ice-Belt Instability"" at high obliquity. The Snowball catastrophe is avoided at weak radiative forcing in two different scenarios: weak albedo feedback and inefficient heat transport (favoring stable partial ice cover), or efficient transport at high obliquity (favoring ice-free conditions). From speculative assumptions about distributions of planetary parameters, three-fourths to four-fifths of all planets with stable partial ice cover should be in the form of Earth-like polar caps. © 2017.

Moreover, public buildings, in particular schools, should be buildings with elevated comfort levels because student and teachers spend much time in these rooms. The wellness and productive capacity of students and teachers are primarily affected by the comfort inside and air quality of school rooms. Regarding energy use, school buildings waste much energy because most buildings were constructed before the 1991 and energy saving measures were only implemented in a few schools. This paper analyses the energy performance of eight different schools located in Matera city, southern Italy. The aim of this research is to analyse energy requirement utilizing dynamic analyses with a time step of one hour (using Energy-Plus method). Next, the values of the dynamic analyses were compared to the effective energy consumption. Using the results of this comparison, we validated the numerical model, and then, we analysed different energy auditing actions for these buildings. We included the energy auditing works in three categories: energy restoration of the envelope, of the plant and of both. For each of these categories, we calculated the energy savings. Ultimately, we analysed the environmental benefits of the three different categories in terms of CO2 reduction. This research confirmed that the dynamic method is the best method to achieve a good energy analysis of these complex buildings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Comfort indoor; Dynamic method; Energy auditing; Energy performance buildings; Mediterranean climate; School buildings","Air quality; Buildings; Climatology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; School buildings; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Comfort indoor; Dynamic method; Energy auditing; Energy performance; Mediterranean climates; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025107513

The relative importance of these mechanisms in the Southern Ocean is uncertain, as year-round observations in this area have been limited. We use a novel physical-biogeochemical state estimate of the Southern Ocean to construct a closed DIC budget of the top 650 m and investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the different components of the carbon system. The dominant mechanisms of variability in upper ocean DIC depend on location and time and space scales considered. Advective transport is the most influential mechanism and governs the local DIC budget across the 10 day–5 year timescales analyzed. Diffusive effects are nearly negligible. The large-scale transport structure is primarily set by upwelling and downwelling, though both the lateral ageostrophic and geostrophic transports are significant. In the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the carbon budget components are also influenced by the presence of topography and biological hot spots. In the subtropics, evaporation and air-sea CO2 flux primarily balances the sink due to biological production and advective transport. Finally, in the subpolar region sea ice processes, which change the seawater volume and thus the DIC concentration, compensate the large impact of the advective transport and modulate the timing of biological activity and air-sea CO2 flux. © 2017.

Here, for an emitter placed inside a hyperbolic metamaterial slab of finite thickness comprised of an array of gold nanorods, we experimentally demonstrate an enhancement of the fluorescence coupled to the waveguided plasmon-polariton modes of the metamaterial. We show that fluorescence properties in such a finite-size metamaterial design behave differently from commonly studied infinite metamaterials or when the emitters are placed near the metamaterial interface. The emitters inside the metamaterial waveguide exhibit an almost 50-fold reduction of their lifetime, whereas a much smaller reduction (a factor of 2-3) is observed for emitters placed on top of the metamaterial. While in both cases the emission from the metamaterial can be radiated in the far field (up to 18% of the total emitted intensity, depending on the emitter position with respect to the nanorods), the coupling to waveguided modes of the metamaterial slab provides an efficient means to shape the emission spectrum for each polarization.

The historical dynamics surrounding land tenure transitions suggest a strategy for reform. Colonial regimes stripped indigenous peoples of most rights to land. Newly independent states restored these rights for some smallholders through land reforms. Later, neo-liberal regimes made secure titles more expensive, and, in so doing, made insecure land tenure more pervasive. Spots of secure land tenure did emerge when indigenous groups, with outside support, resisted efforts by powerful outsiders to expropriate indigenous homelands. Because insecure land tenure persists in most forested rural areas, a focus on afforestation in deforested areas, where earlier episodes of reform secured smallholder land tenure, offers a promising direction for future PES and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) efforts. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

Excessive residue removal may reduce soil organic carbon (SOC) and other soil properties. Cover crop (CC) could be a strategy to ameliorate negative effects of residue removal, but this has not been widely discussed. We synthesized studies on the impacts of CC addition following crop residue removal on SOC and related properties, discussed opportunities and challenges of using CC after residue removal, and highlighted research needs. We first briefly reviewed the separate effects of residue removal and CC before reviewing their combined effects. Our review found that ≥50% residue removal reduced SOC stocks by 0.87 Mg ha–1 yr–1 and &lt;50% removal by 0.31 Mg ha–1 yr–1. However, CC increased SOC by 0.49 Mg ha–1 yr–1, suggesting that CC could offset at least part of the SOC lost with removal. Studies evaluating CC effects on soil properties after residue removal are few and short term (&lt;6 yr) but appeared to show limited potential of CC to offset residue removal effects. However, some studies indicated trends for increased SOC, suggesting CC may offset removal effects in the long term. While opportunities exist to integrate residue removal with CC use, challenges including low CC biomass and reduction in crop yield in water-limited regions must be addressed. Further research on interactive effects of CC and residue removal is needed across different cropping systems and climates. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029354787

We measured tree growth and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) based on stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) to investigate impacts of density reduction across a range of progressively finer spatial scales: site, stand, hillslope position and neighbourhood. In particular, we focused on the influence of treatments beyond the boundaries of treated stands to include impacts on downslope and neighbouring stands across sites varying in soil moisture. Trees at the wet site responded with increased growth when compared with trees at the dry site. Additionally, trees in treated stands at the dry site responded with increased iWUE while trees at the wet site showed no difference in iWUE compared to untreated stands. We hypothesized that water is not the primary limiting factor for growth at our sites, but that density reduction released other resources, such as growing space or nutrients to drive the growth response. At progressively finer spatial scales we found that tree responses were not driven by hillslope location (i.e. downslope of treatment) but to changes in local neighbourhood tree density. Synthesis. This study demonstrated that water can be viewed as an agent to investigate cross-scale interactions as it links processes operating at coarse to finer spatial scales and vice versa. Consequently, management prescriptions such as density reductions to increase resistance and resilience of trees to climate change, specifically to drought, need to consider cross-scale interactions as specific magnitude and mechanisms of growth responses can only be predicted when multiple scales are taken into account. © 2017 The Authors.

However, the physical mechanisms behind this winter climate sensitivity and the influence of catchment type on the varve formation are not fully investigated. Here, we present a winter climate record inferred from the clastic laminae of three lakes located on the region of fine-grained tills in Eastern Finland spanning from AD 1890 to 1990. The minerogenic varve data are compared with instrumental meteorological and hydrological time series in order to investigate the physical link between winter and spring climate and minerogenic matter accumulation. Our analyses reveal that the climate-catchment mechanisms operating in the region of fine-grained tills differ crucially from previously described climate catchment interactions on sand moraine-dominated catchments in Finland, where the maximum river discharge in spring controls the clastic lamina formation. However, in contrast to earlier boreal varve records from Central Finland, the clastic lamina formation in the studied region correlates negatively with spring temperatures and winter precipitation. This could be an artefact of varying catchment dynamics but also related to the regional climate. The lakes surrounded by catchments characterized by fine-grained tills are more sensitive to cold and dry winters. The differences in the sensitivity of varve characteristics to climate, highlights the importance of understanding the catchment dynamics in detail in order to better understand climatic forcing. © 2017 Geologiska öreningen.","boreal climate; catchment dynamics; Clastic-biogenic varves; climate forcing; fine-grained tills; lake sediments; Northern Europe","artifact; catchment; climate forcing; climate signal; lacustrine deposit; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; reconstruction; river discharge; till; time series; varve; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032371282

Three different climatic regions, that show significant distinction from each other, were selected for the sample application of the approach in order to refer different climates. Cost-optimal calculations were performed for more than 1300 scenarios. Integration of occupant behaviour into this calculation procedure was demonstrated with sensitivity analyses; the present application of the approach was focused on the use of window openings by occupants. Results reveal that cost-effective energy saving potential is higher than 70% in high-rise apartments. Moreover, occupant behaviour related to window openings is able to raise this rate above 80%.

The level of CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing persistently over the last few decades due to rising dependence on fossil fuels for energy production. India is facing a potential energy crisis. India has large coal reserves and coal is currently the linchpin of the Indian power sector, making Indian coal-derived emissions a focus of global attention. Further, India's journey from a challenging energy security situation to the 'Make in India' initiative is expected to drive energy needs exponentially. Thus, in the context of a rapidly changing climate, it has become imperative to quantify the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from emerging coal-based energy plants in India. The present work attempts not only to do this, with the intention of highlighting India's commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, but also to redefine India's future emissions. We draw attention to India's attempt to transform the coal technology used in coal-based thermal power plants. We have tried to adopt a holistic approach to quantify the past (2010), present (2015) and future (2025) emission trends for important GHGs like CO2 and other critical air pollutants from rapidly penetrating low-emission advanced coal technology. Our estimation shows that CO2 emissions will increase from 1065 Tg yr-1 (2015) to 2634 Tg yr-1 (2025), which is approximately 147% of the current value. This rapid increase is largely attributed to rising energy demand due to industrial development, followed by demand from the domestic and agricultural sectors. The present trend of CO2 emissions is sure to propel India to become world's second largest emitter of GHGs in 2025, dislodging the United States. We have also estimated the emission of other pollutants like NOx, SO2, black carbon, organic carbon, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), volatile organic compounds and CO. Our findings seem to suggest that India will able to cut CO2 emission from the traditionally dominant thermal power sector by at least 19% in 2025. Present attempts at emission reduction, along with the government's massive initiatives towards building renewable energy infrastructure, could be well aligned to India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution submission to COP21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. With such a rapid expansion of energy production it can be assumed that cost-effective and uninterrupted power (i.e. 24/7) can be provided to all citizens of the country well before 2025. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate agent; coal technology; energy security; GHGs; pollutants; thermal power","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy security; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Potential energy; Proven reserves; Thermoelectric power plants; Volatile organic compounds; Coal technologies; Coal-based thermal power plants; GHGs; Indian power sectors; Industrial development; pollutants; Thermal power; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; chemical pollutant; coal; emission control; energy budget; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon reserve; industrial development; power plant; thermal power; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; volatile organic compound; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033677890

In states like New South Wales (NSW), the absence of an integrated approach to considering and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a critical law and policy gap that needs to be addressed. This chapter focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and sets out how planning and development control systems can be part of the solution for achieving emissions reduction targets. It highlights two major structural barriers to taking effective action to reduce emissions in NSW, Australia's most populous state. The first is the lack of legislated or binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, supported by regulatory infrastructure or agency responsibility for reducing emissions. The second is the lack of integration between the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the land-use planning system. This chapter focuses on the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) because most greenhouse gas emissions from NSW are authorised by planning and development approvals (explicitly or otherwise). It considers six key stages of the NSW planning system that are relevant to greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Within each of these key stages, the chapter illustrates how greenhouse gas emissions are currently dealt with and how the law can be improved to help reduce emissions. Overall, the aim of this chapter is to make clear that planning and development agencies and decision-makers need stronger laws and guidance on achieving emissions control. It concludes with 14 recommendations to address this problem. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Development Controls; Emissions Reduction; Environmental Impact Assessment; Greenhouse Gas; Land-Use Planning; Mining; Mitigation; New South Wales, Australia (NSW); Planning Laws; Strategic Planning",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042404416

The degree and causes of vulnerability to flood risk vary by society, geographical region and over time. The rural people of India are highly vulnerable to flood hazards due to high dependence on natural resources for livelihood and poor socio-economic situations. The information regarding the degree of vulnerability of these people is limited. In order to formulate improved adaption policies and effective programmes to reduce vulnerability, it is crucial to quantify the vulnerability of rural households affected by floods at a regional level. Our study provides insight into the vulnerability of rural households affected by floods in India. We use primary data of 220 flood-prone rural households of Odisha state in India for analysis. The vulnerability is analysed using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index and the Socio-economic Vulnerability Index. Our results show that these households are vulnerable to flood in more than one dimension. Sociodemographic characteristics such as a low literacy rate, a high dependency ratio and a weak housing structure increase these residents’ vulnerability. Access to social networks and social institutions plays a significant role in uplifting poor rural households. Our study concludes that the vulnerability of a household is governed by both non-climatic factors and the incidence of floods. The findings of our study may be considered in developing policies and programmes that will reduce the flood risk. The recommendations we suggested in this study can be applied in other south Asian counties with similar socio-economic profiles. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adaptive capacity; Assessment; Exposure; Sensitivity","adaptive management; flooding; hazard assessment; livelihood; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; vulnerability; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019102037

Given that wireless communication systems rely on radiofrequency waves, the electromagnetic (EM) emissions from these systems are increasingly becoming a concern, especially in terms of adverse health effects. In order to address these concerns, we propose a novel resource allocation scheme for minimizing the EM emission of users in the uplink of multicell orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, while ensuring the quality of service. Our scheme is based on the assumption that long-term channel state information of all the users in the network is available. A new multicell user grouping that uses the received interference powers of the users of different sectors is proposed. Furthermore, we propose two power allocation algorithms to minimize EM emission. The first power allocation algorithm performs multicell iterative optimization to obtain the transmit powers of each user in the system. On the other hand, our second power allocation algorithm uses the average channel gains of the users of different sectors to obtain an approximation of the transmit power of each user without multicell iterative optimization. As a result, this approach has a reduced complexity when compared to our first power allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that our scheme reduces EM emission by up to 70% when compared to a single-cell EM emission aware scheme and by over 3 to 4 orders of magnitude when compared to spectral efficiency maximization schemes. © 2017 IEEE.","Electromagnetic (EM) emission; multicell; OFDM; power allocation; subcarrier allocation","Approximation algorithms; Channel state information; Iterative methods; Multimedia services; Optimization; Quality of service; Wireless telecommunication systems; Multicell; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems; Power allocation algorithms; Power allocations; Resource allocation schemes; Spectral efficiency maximizations; Sub-carrier allocation; Wireless communication system; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029943732

Some alternatives have been proposed to solve this problem such as the use of biofuels and the carbon capture approach. On the one hand, the biomass can capture the CO2 emissions during its growth; while the emissions generated during the production of fuels can be captured through industries based on forest plantations. For that reason, a system able to integrate the production of fuels through refineries and biorefineries with the use of forest plantations to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions can be an attractive solution to the environmental sustainability issues. However, a holistic solution needs actions from many players as the government, society, biomass producer, etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a mathematical model for the optimal planning of an integrated system for the production of fuels and biofuels considering the interaction with eco-industries able to capture emissions from biorefineries and refineries and receive a monetary benefit. Furthermore, the present approach is formulated as a multi-stakeholder scheme in order to consider the benefits and affectations in each one of the entities of the involved supply chains, and determining how the interactions between the different stakeholders take place. This way, the present methodology takes into account the profit of biorefineries, refineries and forest plantations, as well as the emissions and generated jobs of each one of the entities. Additionally, it is considered the price of the petroleum and the possibility to use oil from external producers affecting directly the internal demand and consumption. Also, the methodology contemplates features such as the project life time, the availability of resources, the amount and type of products that should be produced and the allocation and capacity of the refineries, biorefineries and forest plantations The mathematical approach was applied to a nationwide case study for Mexico, considering the creation of new jobs, overall emissions and net profit as main objectives, nevertheless other features were evaluated as the competence of the biomass to food, the use of water and the employment in rural regions. The results are shown in several Pareto curves, which are useful to take decisions about the planning of the system and how the interactions between the stakeholders take place. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon capturing; Multi-stakeholder; Optimal planning",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041620074

Estimating the size and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss due to land use and land cover change has been difficult but is a critical step in understanding whether SOC sequestration can be an effective climate mitigation strategy. In this study, a machine learning-based model was fitted using a global compilation of SOC data and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) land use data in combination with climatic, landform and lithology covariates. Model results compared favorably with a global compilation of paired plot studies. Projection of this model onto a world without agriculture indicated a global carbon debt due to agriculture of 133 Pg C for the top 2 m of soil, with the rate of loss increasing dramatically in the past 200 years. The HYDE classes “grazing” and “cropland” contributed nearly equally to the loss of SOC. There were higher percent SOC losses on cropland but since more than twice as much land is grazed, slightly higher total losses were found from grazing land. Important spatial patterns of SOC loss were found: Hotspots of SOC loss coincided with some major cropping regions as well as semiarid grazing regions, while other major agricultural zones showed small losses and even net gains in SOC. This analysis has demonstrated that there are identifiable regions which can be targeted for SOC restoration efforts. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

The Clean Air Act (CAA) was created to reduce ecological problems by cutting emissions of sulfur and nitrogen. Reduced emissions and rainfall concentrations of acidic ions have been observed since the enactment of the CAA, but soils continue to receive some acid inputs. Many soils sensitive to acid deposition are found to have low pH, a loss of base cations, and a shift in the mineral phase controlling the activity of Al3+ and/or SO42−. If inputs continue, soil may be depleted of base cations and saturated with Al and could cause low forest productivity. Soil samples and soil solutions from pan lysimeters were taken on ridge-tops in the Daniel Boone National Forest to evaluate potential impacts of acid deposition recently and in the future. Sample results were compared to historical data from identical locations. Physicochemical characteristics of the soils revealed that sites were very low in base saturation and pH and high in exchangeable acidity, illustrating change since previously sampled. Soil solution data indicated that sites periodically received high acid inputs leading to saturation of Al in soils and the formation of Al-hydroxy-sulfate minerals. Given these conditions, long-term changes in soil chemistry from acid deposition are acknowledged. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Acid deposition; Aluminum; Forest health; Mineral solubility; Soil solution chemistry","Air pollution; Aluminum; Aluminum coatings; Aluminum compounds; Atmospheric chemistry; Deposition; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Meteorological problems; Positive ions; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Sulfate minerals; Acid deposition; Atmospheric depositions; Environmental problems; Forest health; Mineral solubility; Physicochemical characteristics; Rainfall concentration; Soil solution chemistry; Soil pollution; aluminum; mineral; acid deposition; aluminum; atmospheric deposition; forest health; forest soil; physicochemical property; soil chemistry; solubility; acid deposition; Article; environmental impact; forest; pH; physical chemistry; soil acidity; soil chemistry; soil pollution; United States; Daniel Boone National Forest; Kentucky; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030150475

Both patterns of historical (approximately 4000 B.C. - 2000 A.D.) and recent (1990-2005) deforestation were explored and compared. The study uses location analysis, combining spatially explicit global databases of deforestation with variables hypothesized to relate to deforestation (e.g. rural livestock density, cost-distance). The results show that historical and recent deforestation show similar patterns when plotted against the selected variables suggesting the relations to be empirical. The strongest relations were between deforestation and rural population density, cost-distance and crop suitability respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that agricultural expansion was the largest direct cause of deforestation historically and it continues to be the largest direct cause today. While crop suitability showed a strong correlation with deforestation, pasture suitability showed no correlation. The study accordingly compares contemporary deforestation in the tropical domain against economic development (approximated by a combination of GDP value and growth rate) which resulted in a reproduction of the deforestation pattern predicted by the forest transition curve. In view of the apparent empirical relation, the variables which relate to deforestation in this study are expected to have predictive power to identify locations of likely future deforestation. To illustrate the application value of this analysis, the deforestation risk in African protected forest was assessed. This assessment revealed that protected areas are found on locations with below average pressure and the pressures vary greatly in the different regions. The findings underline the importance of considering national circumstances to understand the government's efforts to manage its forests sustainably and contribute to international mitigation by reducing forest-related emissions.","correlation; deforestation; global analysis; historical trend analysis; socio-economic drivers","agricultural extension; correlation; deforestation; economic development; forest management; spatial analysis; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029957073

Domestic causes have been extensively documented, while occupational exposures have been reported less frequently. We analyse occupational carbon monoxide poisonings from the available data of the carbon monoxide poisoning surveillance network for Paris and its region, and identify predictive factors of severity for occupational poisoning in order to identify priority prevention actions. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all events of acute accidental carbon monoxide exposures which occurred in the Paris region, at the work place, and notified to the surveillance network from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2011. Results: Over the 7-year study period, 362 exposed workers were identified, representing 8.15% of all cases of carbon monoxide exposures.The largest number of events occurred in the building sector and most commonly affected occupations were craft and related trades workers.The most common sources of exposure were internal combustion engine equipment that was involved in almost half of cases. Minor severity was observed in 86% of cases, and 13% were moderate or more. We identify that the use of internal combustion engine equipment was significantly associated with increased severity. Conclusions: Occupational carbon monoxide poisoning is reported less frequently than domestic poisoning and has different and more numerous causes. It can be potentially severe, especially when it is caused by internal combustion engine equipment. Information about risks, compliance with instructions and cleaning rules, and establishment of collective and individual protective equipment would significantly reduce the frequency and severity of carbon monoxide poisoning. © The Author 2017.","Carbon monoxide; Occupational health; Poisoning","Carbon monoxide; Catalyst poisoning; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Industrial hygiene; Internal combustion engines; Monitoring; Building sectors; Carbon monoxide exposures; Carbon monoxide poisoning; Occupational exposure; Occupational health; Predictive factors; Protective equipment; Surveillance networks; Accidents; acute disease; adult; aged; carbon monoxide intoxication; chemically induced; female; France; human; male; middle aged; occupation; occupational disease; occupational exposure; retrospective study; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Occupations; Paris; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051205656

The objective of this work was to better understand the mechanisms of physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress of five Iranian melon landraces “Samsuri”, “Kashan”, “Khatouni”, “Suski-e-Sabz”, and “Ghobadlu” from different geographical origins, and “Galia” F1 cultivar. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions and irrigated with half-strength Hoagland solution containing 0, 30, 60, or 90 mM NaCl for 60 days. Increase in the external salt concentration was accompanied by an obvious depression in leaf relative water content, membrane stability index, chlorophyll a and b and carotenoid contents, stomata and trichome density, leaf area, specific leaf area, biomass, leaf and stem K+ concentrations as well as leaf and stem K+/Na+ ratios in all landraces studied. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, proline and soluble carbohydrate contents, activity of antioxidant enzymes as well as leaf and stem Na+ and Cl− concentrations, all increased significantly with increasing stress over all plants. Moreover, carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C), determined on leaf organic matter, was found to be associated with evaluated traits. For example, a highly positive correlation between Δ13C and both biomass production and salt tolerance index was notable when all saline treatments were averaged (r = 0.998 and 0.998, respectively). Also, scatter plot and clustering analysis showed that “Suski-e-Sabz” and “Ghobadlu” were placed close to “Galia” F1, a salt tolerant cultivar, indicating that their similar behavior under salinity. Overall, the present results indicated a significant genetic variability for most of the traits studied, suggesting that “Suski-e-Sabz” and “Ghobadlu” could be introduced as the superior landraces and the most promising tolerant parents in the future melon breeding programs due to their suitable performance, in terms of responses to salt stress as compared with other landraces. Also, Δ13C can be used as a powerful criterion in melon breeding programs aimed at selection of salt tolerant landraces. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Carbon isotope discrimination; Clustering analysis; Melon; Principal component analysis; Salinity; Superior landraces","carotenoid; biosynthesis; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; metabolism; muskmelon; osmotic pressure; plant stoma; salinity; trichome; Carotenoids; Cucumis melo; Genotype; Osmotic Pressure; Plant Stomata; Salinity; Trichomes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029473910

Marine sediments offer a vast archive of past climate. Various indirect methods called proxies are used to infer principal climate parameters like temperature, salinity, productivity, monsoon intensity, ocean circulation, seawater pH, and others, from the marine sediments. The relationship between a climate parameter and marine paleoclimate proxy may vary from region to region. Additionally, the marine proxies are often affected by more than one climate parameter, thus making it difficult to assess the change in any particular parameter from a single proxy. Diagenetic alteration can also significantly affect the parameter-proxy relationship. A growing emphasis now is on quantifying changes in key climatic parameters in the past. Proxies for quantitative estimation of seawater temperature, runoff, sea-level and pH are now fairly well established. Similar robust quantitative proxies for dissolved oxygen concentration and productivity are, however, still being developed. Additionally, the uncertainty associated with quantitative estimation of past climate has to be reduced. Therefore, continuous efforts are being made to develop novel paleoclimate proxies and to evaluate existing proxies in different regions of the world oceans. © 2017",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020476519

Samples were collected from a high altitude hill station, Darjeeling (27.01°N, 88.15°E, 2200 masl) during June 2012 to May 2013. Temporal variation, meteorological influence, source apportionment and ozone formation potential etc were studied for acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, acetone, butanaldehyde, propanaldehyde, benzaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, valeraldehyde, isovaleraldehyde, hexanaldehyde, p-tolualdehyde and o-tolualdehyde. High concentration of Acetone (81.6 ± 63.5 µg m–3) was observed which could be due to the higher photochemical production from its precursor volatile organic compounds emitted from tea plants and tea processing units. The concentration of acetaldehyde (20.7 ± 47.6 µg m–3) and formaldehyde (11.6 ± 16.3 µg m–3) were found to be comparable with metro cities of India and world. The average annual concentration of total carbonyl compounds was 174.2 ± 184.6 µg m–3 with maximum during postmonsoon (456.9 ± 199.5 µg m–3) and minimum during winter season (72.2 ± 42.9 µg m–3). Meteorological parameters like temperature and surface reaching solar radiative flux played the major roles for the seasonal variation of the carbonyl concentration over the hill station. The average ratio of formaldehyde to acetaldehyde over Darjeeling was found to be 1.64 ± 1.43 well representing a typical urban atmosphere at this part of Himalaya.

However, the relative contribution of carbonaceous particles derived from plants and biomass has been increasing. Accordingly, compositional analysis of carbonaceous particles has become increasingly important to determine the sources and types of particles produced. To reveal the sources of the organic particles contained in particulate matter with diameters of ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and the processes involved in their generation, we analyzed molecular marker compounds (2-methyltetrols, cis-pinonic acid, and levoglucosan) derived from the plants and biomass in the PM2.5 collected during daytime- and nighttime-sampling periods in summer (July and August) and autumn (November) in Kazo, which is in the northern area of Saitama prefecture, Japan. We also measured 14C carbonaceous concentrations in the same PM2.5 samples. The concentrations of 2-methyltetrols were higher in the summer than in the autumn. Because the deciduous period overlaps with this decrease in the levels of 2-methyltetrols, we considered the emission source to broad-leaved trees. In contrast, the emission source of the cispinonic acid precursor was considered to be conifers, because its concentration remained almost constant throughout the year. The concentration of levoglucosan was considerably increased in the autumn due to frequent biomass open burning. The ratio of plantderived carbon to total carbon, obtained by measuring of 14C, in summer PM2.5 sample was higher in the nighttime, and could be influenced by anthropogenic sources during the daytime.","Biomass burning; Carbon isotopic analysis; Fossil fuels; Molecular marker; Secondary formation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030154483

Cardiac sarcoidosis is an under-recognized entity that has a heterogeneous presentation and may occur independently or with any severity of systemic disease. Diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis remains problematic with endomyocardial biopsies associated with a high risk of complications. Several diagnostic algorithms are currently available that rely on histopathology or clinical and radiological measures. The dominant mode of diagnostic imaging to date for cardiac sarcoidosis has been cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement. Case presentations: We report the cases of two adult patients: case 1, a 50-year-old white man who presented with severe congestive cardiac failure; and case 2, a 37-year-old white woman who presented with complete heart block. Both patients had a background of untreated pulmonary sarcoidosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging did not show evidence of sarcoidosis in either patient and both proceeded to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans that were highly suggestive of cardiac sarcoidosis. Both patients were systemically immunosuppressed with orally administered prednisone and methotrexate and had subsequent improvement by clinical and nuclear medicine imaging measures. Conclusions: Current consensus guidelines recommend all patients with sarcoidosis undergo screening for occult cardiac disease, with thorough history and examination, electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echocardiogram. If any abnormalities are detected, advanced cardiac imaging should follow. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging identifies the majority of cardiac sarcoidosis, early disease may not be detected. These cases demonstrate 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography is warranted following an indeterminate or normal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging if clinical suspicion remains high. Unidentified and untreated cardiac sarcoidosis risks significant morbidity and mortality, but early detection can facilitate disease-modifying immunosuppression and cardiac-specific interventions. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cardiac sarcoidosis; CMR; FDG-PET","acetylsalicylic acid; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; antibiotic agent; bisoprolol; C reactive protein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; furosemide; gadolinium; ivabradine; magnesium aspartate; metformin; methotrexate; metoprolol; prednisone; ramipril; rosuvastatin; sotalol; spironolactone; troponin; warfarin; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; Article; atrial fibrillation; cardiac sarcoidosis; cardiomegaly; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardioversion; case report; cerebral artery disease; clinical article; community acquired pneumonia; complete heart block; congestive cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure; early diagnosis; electrocardiogram; endobronchial ultrasonography; female; fibrinolytic therapy; granulomatous inflammation; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle failure; heart ventricle bigeminy; heart ventricle extrasystole; heart ventricle tachycardia; histopathology; human; human tissue; hypercholesterolemia; immunosuppressive treatment; low drug dose; lung biopsy; lung edema; lung sarcoidosis; lymphadenopathy; male; medical history; middle aged; myocarditis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; orthostatic hypotension; pacemaker implantation; pericardial effusion; pleura effusion; positron emission tomography; priority journal; quadrantanopia; spinal cord disease; thorax radiography; transient ischemic attack; transthoracic echocardiography; virus myocarditis; visual impairment; cardiomyopathy; diagnostic imaging; heart; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; procedures; sarcoidosis; Adult; Cardiomyopathies; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Heart; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Sarcoidosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031785443

The GCP dataset integrates results from top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry), inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven approaches. The annual global methane emissions from top-down studies, which by construction match the observed methane growth rate within their uncertainties, all show an increase in total methane emissions over the period 2000-2012, but this increase is not linear over the 13 years. Despite differences between individual studies, the mean emission anomaly of the top-down ensemble shows no significant trend in total methane emissions over the period 2000-2006, during the plateau of atmospheric methane mole fractions, and also over the period 2008-2012, during the renewed atmospheric methane increase. However, the top-down ensemble mean produces an emission shift between 2006 and 2008, leading to 22 [16-32]Tg CH4yr-1 higher methane emissions over the period 2008-2012 compared to 2002-2006. This emission increase mostly originated from the tropics, with a smaller contribution from mid-latitudes and no significant change from boreal regions. The regional contributions remain uncertain in top-down studies. Tropical South America and South and East Asia seem to contribute the most to the emission increase in the tropics. However, these two regions have only limited atmospheric measurements and remain therefore poorly constrained. The sectorial partitioning of this emission increase between the periods 2002-2006 and 2008-2012 differs from one atmospheric inversion study to another. However, all top-down studies suggest smaller changes in fossil fuel emissions (from oil, gas, and coal industries) compared to the mean of the bottom-up inventories included in this study. This difference is partly driven by a smaller emission change in China from the top-down studies compared to the estimate in the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.2) inventory, which should be revised to smaller values in a near future. We apply isotopic signatures to the emission changes estimated for individual studies based on five emission sectors and find that for six individual top-down studies (out of eight) the average isotopic signature of the emission changes is not consistent with the observed change in atmospheric 13CH4. However, the partitioning in emission change derived from the ensemble mean is consistent with this isotopic constraint. At the global scale, the top-down ensemble mean suggests that the dominant contribution to the resumed atmospheric CH4 growth after 2006 comes from microbial sources (more from agriculture and waste sectors than from natural wetlands), with an uncertain but smaller contribution from fossil CH4 emissions. In addition, a decrease in biomass burning emissions (in agreement with the biomass burning emission databases) makes the balance of sources consistent with atmospheric 13CH4 observations. In most of the top-down studies included here, OH concentrations are considered constant over the years (seasonal variations but without any inter-annual variability). As a result, the methane loss (in particular through OH oxidation) varies mainly through the change in methane concentrations and not its oxidants. For these reasons, changes in the methane loss could not be properly investigated in this study, although it may play a significant role in the recent atmospheric methane changes as briefly discussed at the end of the paper. © Author(s) 2017.",,"annual variation; anthropogenic source; biomass burning; bottom-up approach; decadal variation; emission inventory; methane; top-down approach; Far East; South America; South Asia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025087394

Fishers are front-line observers of changes occurring both on the coast and in the sea and are among the first people to be affected by these changes. In this study, we perform a meta-analysis of observations and adaptations to climate change by subsistence-oriented coastal fishers extracted from a global review of peer-reviewed and grey literature. Fishers' observations compiled from across the globe indicate increased temperatures and changes in weather patterns, as well as coastal erosion, sea level rise and shifts in species range and behaviours.

Microclimate models as ENVI-met allow to calculate effects of green roofs and their contribution to climate change adaptation. Most models are based on generalized assumptions concerning evapotranspiration, albedo, heat flux and u-value of green roofs. Building physics software as ArchiPHYSIK lacks of available data concerning green roofs. This paper provides a detailed description of seven different green roof systems (differing in thicknesses, materials and construction layers) and their insulating performance over a period of 15 months. This shall allow researchers to choose more specific data for their work and improve the accuracy of green roof simulations and energy efficiency calculations. The results show clearly, that green roofs, as “living dynamic systems” respond differently on climatic framework conditions. The calculated u-values range from 0.944 W/m2 K – measured for a 12 cm thick one layer green roof – to 0.299 W/m2 K of a 30 cm thick two layer green roof. The tested green roofs have been selected to be able to analyze the influence of different materials, construction types and thicknesses on insulation performance. Apart from construction thickness, water capacity of growing layer and drainage material, their pore volume and the application of drainage boards have been identified as relevant factors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building greenery; Building physics; Green roofs; Heat flux; U-value","Climate change; Climate models; Drainage; Energy efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Heat flux; Insulation; Building physics; Climate change adaptation; Efficiency calculations; Framework conditions; Green roof; Insulating performance; Insulation performance; U values; Roofs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026728785

The aim of this study is to identify the climate change impact on water availability, precipitation-free periods and irrigation demand of onion crops cultivated in a German model region. Focus is on crop-specific climatic water balance, considering soil characteristics and temperature-driven plant growth. Simulated climate parameters vary between four climate models.

Around the globe many countries are looking to use their ocean space, especially their coastal marine areas, for the extraction of renewable energy from the wind, waves and tides. This large scale use of renewable energy will help global reductions in CO2 release and ultimately reduce the risk of ecological damage due to sever climate change. However the cumulative effect of large scale developments and the range of methods to extract energy from the oceans will cause local changes in physical mixing properties and the effects will be felt locally throughout the trophic chain. How can we assess the ecological costs and benefits of these contrasting pressures on our marine systems such that our choices in where we allow the placement of large scale energy extraction is ultimately ecological beneficial? In this work we suggest that the use of statistical joint models; spatially explicit models that simultaneous explore the distributions of mobile predator and prey species such as pelagic fish and seabird and marine mammal species are a most useful tool in the calculation of the degree of overlap in these species now and in future predictions with climate change, energy extraction and both climate change and energy extraction.

Many factors, including drought, climate change, reduced water allocations, and land-use changes could worsen salinity conditions there, and in other agricultural lands in the state. Mapping soil salinity at regional and state levels is essential for identifying drivers and trends in agricultural soil salinity, and for developing mitigation strategies, but traditional soil sampling for salinity does not allow for accurate large-scale mapping. We tested remote-sensing modeling to map root zone soil salinity for farmland in the WSJV. According to our map, 0.78 million acres are salt affected (i.e., ECe > 4 dS/m), which represents 45% of the mapped farmland; 30% of that acreage is strongly or extremely saline. Independent validations of the remote-sensing estimations indicated acceptable to excellent correspondences, except in areas of low salinity and high soil heterogeneity.

Beam attenuation replaces buildup region, reduces skin-sparing effect and causes target volume under dosage. In this study, we aimed to evaluate beam attenuation and variation of build-up region in 550 TxT radiotherapy couch. Materials and Methods: In this study, we utilized cylindrical PMMA Farmer chamber, DOSE-1 electrometer and set PMMA phantom in isocenter of gantry and the Farmer chamber on the phantom. Afterwards, the gantry rotated 10°, and attenuation was assessed. To measure build-up region, we used Markus chamber, Solid water phantom and DOSE-1 electrometer. Doing so, we set Solid water phantom on isocenter of gantry and placed Markus chamber in it, then we quantified the build-up region at 0° and 180° gantry angels and compared the obtained values. Results: Notable attenuation and build-up region variation were observed in 550 TxT treatment table. The maximum rate of attenuation was 5.95% for 6 MV photon beam, at 5×5 cm2 field size and 130° gantry angle, while the maximum variation was 7 mm for 6 MV photon beam at 10×10 cm2 field size. Conclusion: Fiber carbon caused beam attenuation and variation in the build-up region. Therefore, the application of fiber carbon is recommended for planning radiotherapy to prevent skin side effects and to decrease the risk of cancer recurrence. © 2017, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

This approach is based on the state that food-web isotopic signatures are seen in the human bones and teeth and such signatures can change parallely with a variety of biogeochemical processes. By measuring δ13C and δ15N isotopic values of subadult tissues of different ages, the level of breast milk ingestion at particular ages and the components of the complementary foods can be assessed. Strontium and oxygen isotopic analyses have been used for determining the geographic origins and reconstructing the way of life of past populations as these isotopes can map the isotopic outline of the area from where the person acquired water and food during initial lifetime. The isotopic values of strontium and oxygen values are considered specific to geographical areas and serve as reliable chemical signatures of migration history of past human populations (local or non-local to the site). Previous isotopic studies show that the subsistence patterns of the past human populations underwent extensive changes from nomadic to complete agricultural dependence strategies. The carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of local fauna of any archaeological site can be used to elucidate the prominence of freshwater resources in the diet of the past human populations found near the site. More extensive research covering isotopic descriptions of various prehistoric, historic and modern populations is needed to explore the role of stable isotope analysis for provenancing human skeletal remains and assessing human migration patterns/routes, geographic origins, paleodiet and subsistence practices of past populations. © 2017 Anthropological Review.","Bones and teeth; Different isotopes; Forensic anthropology; Life-histories; Provenance of skeletal remains; Stable isotope analysis",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030571308

The bounds testing approach to cointegration is used to examine the long-run relationship between the variables in the presence of structural breaks. The causal relationship between the variables is investigated by applying the VECM Granger causality test and accommodating structural breaks. The results confirm the presence of cointegration between the variables. Moreover, the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions is not only inverted-U shaped but also N-shaped in the presence of structural breaks and biomass. Biomass energy consumption lowers CO2 emissions. Exports, imports and trade openness are also environment-friendly.

Cities contribute 85% of the total CO2 emissions in China and thus are considered as the key areas for implementing policies designed for climate change adaption and CO2 emission mitigation. However, the emission inventory construction of Chinese cities has not been well researched, mainly owing to the lack of systematic statistics and poor data quality. Focusing on this research gap, we developed a set of methods for constructing CO2 emissions inventories for Chinese cities based on energy balance table. The newly constructed emission inventory is compiled in terms of the definition provided by the IPCC territorial emission accounting approach and covers 47 socioeconomic sectors, 17 fossil fuels and 9 primary industry products, which is corresponding with the national and provincial inventory. In the study, we applied the methods to compile CO2 emissions inventories for 24 common Chinese cities and examined uncertainties of the inventories. Understanding the emissions sources in Chinese cities is the basis for many climate policy and goal research in the future. © 2017 The Authors","Chinese cities; CO2 emissions inventory; Energy balance table","Climate change; Energy balance; Chinese cities; Climate policy; CO2 emissions; Data quality; Emission inventories; Emissions inventory; Energy consumer; Industry products; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020941511

However, little is known about the effects of afforestation on sequestrations of total and labile soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions in semi-arid sandy lands. In the present study, we examined the effects of Caragana microphylla Lam. plantations with different ages (12- and 25-year-old) on sequestrations of total SOC as well as labile SOC fractions such as light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). The analyzed samples were taken from soil depths of 0–5 and 5–15 cm under two shrub-related scenarios: under shrubs and between shrubs with moving sand dunes as control sites in the Horqin Sandy Land of northern China. The results showed that the concentrations and storages of total SOC at soil depths of 0–5 and 5–15 cm were higher in 12- and 25-year-old C. microphylla plantations than in moving sand dunes (i.e., control sites), with the highest value observed under shrubs in 25-year-old C. microphylla plantations. Furthermore, the concentrations and storages of LFOC and MBC showed similar patterns with those of total SOC at the same soil depth. The 12-year-old C. microphylla plantations had higher percentages of LFOC concentration to SOC concentration and MBC concentration to SOC concentration than the 25-year-old C. microphylla plantations and moving sand dunes at both soil depths. A significant positive correlation existed among SOC, LFOC, and MBC, implying that restoring the total and labile SOC fractions is possible by afforestation with C. microphylla shrubs in the Horqin Sandy Land. At soil depth of 0–15 cm, the accumulation rate of total SOC under shrubs was higher in young C. microphylla plantations (18.53 g C/(m2•a); 0–12 years) than in old C. microphylla plantations (16.24 g C/(m2•a); 12–25 years), and the accumulation rates of LFOC and MBC under shrubs and between shrubs were also higher in young C. microphylla plantations than in old C. microphylla plantations. It can be concluded that the establishment of C. microphylla in the Horqin Sandy Land may be a good mitigation strategy for SOC sequestration in the surface soils. © 2017, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Caragana microphylla plantation; carbon accumulation rate; Horqin Sandy Land; light fraction organic carbon; microbial biomass carbon; soil organic carbon","accumulation rate; afforestation; angiosperm; carbon sequestration; organic carbon; plantation; soil depth; soil organic matter; China; Horqin Desert; Caragana microphylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028950504

The elemental distribution of sulfur (S) corresponded well to the Mo distribution, and both Mo and S elements distributed evenly in the Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels. Results indicated that [Mo3S13]2- nanoclusters inherently exposed a high number of active edge sites, which greatly improved the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The new peak at 168.8 eV corresponded to the characteristic S-O binding in the S 2p region of Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs, indicating that the [Mo3S13]2- clusters were bond onto the rGO-CNTs aerogels through S-O binding. The strong support of rGO-CNTs aerogels suppressed the aggregation of [Mo3S13]2- nanoclusters, exposing more active surface and electrons diffusions on the surface of Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels. Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels laden with 20 mg of [Mo3S13]2- exhibited close hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance as compared with that of [Mo3S13-120]@rGO-CNTs aerogels laden with 120 mg of [Mo3S13]2- nanoclusters. This indicated the extremely high HER performance of [Mo3S13]2- even at low mass. As a result, Mo3S13@rGO-CNTs aerogels enabled remarkable electrochemical performances showing a low overpotential (0.179 V at 10 mA cm-2) with a small Tafel slope, reduced transfer resistance, and excellent stability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Aerogels; Carbon nanotubes; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Reduced graphene oxide; [Mo3S13]2- clusters","Aerogels; Bins; Electrocatalysis; Graphene; Hydrogen; Nanoclusters; Nanotubes; Slope stability; Yarn; Electrocatalytic; Electrochemical performance; Elemental distribution; Hydrogen evolution; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Reduced graphene oxides; Transfer resistance; [Mo3S13]^2- clusters; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030482135

Composting of solid waste, especially organic waste, can be one of the solutions to tackle the issue of handling solid waste. The present study is focused on agitated piles composting of flower waste (FW). Five combinations of FW with dry leaves (DL) and cow dung (CD) were prepared to conduct the study. Significant changes were observed due to the addition of bulking agent. The bulking material helps to reduce the production of leachate and also to maintain the aerobic condition within the piles. The reduction of total organic carbon was 21% in FW composting which increased by 36.48% during the composting of FW on addition of DL and CD. On the 120th day of composting, the pH of pile five (70 kg FW + 20 kg CD + 15 kg DL) was 7.33, electrical conductivity 2.77 mS/cm, total organic carbon 26.9%, total nitrogen 2.2%, and C:N ratio was 12. Appropriate proportion of waste mixture played an important role in providing favorable conditions for the microbial transformation of flower waste to stabilized compost. Finally, FW with the combination of CD and DL was found to be successful during pile composting. © 2017 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.","Agitated pile; Composting; Dry leaves; Flower waste; Total organic carbon","Carbon; Composting; Municipal solid waste; Organic carbon; Piles; Solid wastes; Aerobic condition; Dry leaves; Electrical conductivity; Favorable conditions; Flower wastes; Microbial transformation; Municipal authorities; Total Organic Carbon; Waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030161464

This paper evaluates Livewell Yarra, an urban living lab in Melbourne, Australia, that brought together academic researchers and community actors to engage in experiments for low-carbon living. This paper evaluates transition team experiments in governance of the lab itself and community experiments in carbon reduction that took place in people's homes and small group settings known as decarb groups. This paper's primary research question is: what are the direct impacts of urban living lab experiments from the participants' perspective? The research methods utilised include action research, asset-based community development, participatory co-design and most significant change research. This paper evaluates experiments in low-carbon living through data collected via stories of change from participant interviews. The results indicate that experiments in urban living labs create opportunities for social learning and empowerment, but also raise issues of leadership and ownership of transition governance. The findings suggest that Livewell Yarra could have benefited from clearer agenda setting and continuous monitoring to feedback results. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions that utilise the operational processes of transition management to support experiments in urban living labs. © 2017 by the authors.","Action research; Sustainability transitions; Transition management; Urban experiments; Urban living lab; Urban sustainability","empowerment; experiment; governance approach; laboratory method; leadership; learning; monitoring; ownership; questionnaire survey; research work; social impact; stakeholder; sustainability; urban society; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029791870

The carbon sink function of crops plays an important role in mitigating climate changes. This paper collected and analyzed the carbon cost data of staple crops in China, estimated the carbon sink and carbon source effects of farmlands, and quantitatively evaluated the carbon inputs and outputs of crop production systems. The results showed that the carbon footprints of crops in six typical agriculture regions were quite different, and the major crops production showed as carbon sinks in general. The carbon sequestration of different crops in the same region were significantly different, as well as the same crop in different regions. China's farmland ecosystem showed carbon sequestration effect: the total annual net carbon sink of three major crops, rice, wheat, and corn, was about 165.76 TgC, of which rice was the highest, accounting for 48.71%. This study also proposed the key ways for energy conservation and emission reduction of crop production in every region, and suggested the technology direction for improving carbon sink function.

Local governments form the backbone of climate-related public health preparedness. Yet local health agencies are often inadequately prepared and poorly integrated into climate change assessments and plans. We reviewed the climate health profiles of 16 states and two cities participating in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative (CRSCI) that aims to build local capacity to assess and respond to the health impacts of climate change. Following recommendations from a recent expert panel strategic review, we present illustrations of emerging promising practice and future directions. We found that CRSCI has strengthened climate preparedness and response in local public health agencies by identifying critical climate-health impacts and vulnerable populations, and has helped integrate health more fully into broader climate planning. Promising practice was found in all three recommendation areas identified by the expert panel (leveraging partnerships, refining assessment methodologies and enhancing communications), particularly with regard to health impacts of extreme heat. Vast needs remain, however, suggesting the need to disseminate CRSCI experience to non-grantees. In conclusion, the CRSCI program approach and selected activities illustrate a way forward toward robust, targeted local preparedness and response that may serve as a useful example for public health departments in the United States and internationally, particularly at a time of uncertain commitment to climate change agreements at the national level. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The framework contains three components: (1) stochastic service life models predicting the deterioration of structural components and repair timing; (2) stochastic lifecycle impact assessment (LCIA) models that estimate the sustainability impacts from construction and maintenance activities; and (3) a lifecycle optimization model (LCO) automating the repair and limit-state selection process to minimize the sustainability impact. In this study, the LCO model is constructed by using a dynamic programming method along with Monte Carlo simulation. A case study is presented in which the authors compute the probability that a maintenance scheme allowing more degradation will meet the CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) emission reduction target of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by 2050. By integrating lifecycle optimization with sustainability design, the proposed framework removes the arbitrary nature of repair and limit-state selection. It also provides a formal method to evaluate and compare different maintenance designs of reinforced-concrete transportation infrastructure toward a higher degree of sustainable development. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Infrastructure; Maintenance; Optimization; Probabilistic design; Sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Concretes; Dynamic programming; Emission control; Formal methods; Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Maintenance; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Reinforced concrete; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Transportation; Dynamic programming methods; Emission reduction targets; Infrastructure; Lifecycle impact assessment; Maintenance optimization; Probabilistic design; Transportation infrastructures; United nations intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Repair; design; life cycle analysis; maintenance; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; probability; reinforced concrete; sustainability; transportation infrastructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018995298

Methods Seventy-seven children diagnosed with MMD by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were treated between January 2011 and December 2014 in our center. Their clinical features, imaging, and operative reports were analyzed. Results Four patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, whereas 73 presented with ischemic symptoms. Revascularization procedures were performed unilaterally on 11 left hemispheres and 9 right hemispheres, and 57 had bilateral surgeries. The average length of surgery was 143 ± 24 minutes, with 28 ± 9 mL of blood loss. The mean period of follow-up was 28.43 ± 15.31 months. Cerebral blood flow increased 3 months after the operations in the previously affected regions. Collateralization from the deep temporal artery, superficial temporal artery, and the middle meningeal artery was found by DSA or MRA. In cases where single-photon emission computed tomography was obtained, it demonstrated better perfusion postoperatively. The ischemic symptoms were relieved in 118 (88.06%) hemispheres, and remained stable in 5 (3.73%) hemispheres. There were 12 radiographic cerebral infarctions (8.96%) within 1 month postoperatively.

In order to address these problems, the concept of ""smart parking"" is put forward. To make a parking lot ""smart"", we argue that three basic features, namely Vehicle Identification, Parking Space Detection and Indoor Localization are are critical and should be the infrastructure. Herein, we present LightPark, a Visible Light Communication (VLC) solution to realize the vision of ""smart parking"". Building on top of the visible light backscatter communication primitive, LightPark is able to leverage the lighting infrastructure to perform scalable visible light communication and networking with the batter-free tag devices instrumented on the vehicles and parking spaces to manage the critical information such as identification and real-time location of vehicles, and status of parking spaces in a centralized and low-cost manner. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Backscatter; Indoor localization; Parking space detection; Smart parking; Visible light communication","Backscattering; Indoor positioning systems; Light; Mobile computing; Parking; Solid wastes; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Visible light communication; Communication primitives; Indoor localization; Parking space detections; Real-time location; Smart parking; Vehicle identification; Vehicle ownership; Visible light communications (VLC); Vehicle to vehicle communications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034114982

The elemental composition, number density, and size fractions of particles on leaf surfaces of 14 urban green from Xizhimen overpass and the Olympic Forest Park in Beijing, China were examined by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry. Particles that accumulated on leaves were comprised mainly of C, O, Si, Ca, Fe, and Pb. The number density of particles was 50,961.5 mm−2, and 52.9% and 25% of the particles were submicron (&lt;1 μm) and fine (&lt;2.5 μm), respectively. The densities and size fractions of the particles deposited on the adaxial and abaxial side of leaves were significantly different, and 24% of the particles were deposited on the abaxial side of leaves. The densities of the particles in four size fractions differed significantly among the species at the two sampling sites. Salix matsudana, Euonymus japonicus, Magnolia denudate, Sophora japonica, Amygdalus persica, and Salix babylonica efficiently captured all particle sizes on their leaf surfaces.

The DOM that originates from topsoil leaching and vegetation degradation is brought to the lakes by surface flow and is subjected to coagulation and degradation by heterotrophic bacteria, which are well-established processes in the majority of boreal aquatic settings. The behavior of colloids and organic complexes of trace metals during this process is virtually unknown. In this work, we studied the interaction of two model heterotrophic bacteria, soil Pseudomonas aureofaciens and aquatic Pseudomonas reactans, with peat and Sphagnum moss leachates from the permafrost region under controlled laboratory conditions in nutrient-free media. The moss leachate was the better substrate for bacterial survival, with P. reactans exhibiting an order of magnitude higher live cell number compared with P. aureofaciens. In eight-day experiments, we analyzed organic carbon and ∼40 major and trace elements (TEs) during heterotrophic bacteria growth. The total net decrease in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was similar for both bacteria and ranged from 30 mg gwet −1 to ≤10 mg gwet −1 during 8 days for the moss and peat leachate, respectively. Despite significant evolutions of pH, DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and cell number, most major (Mg, K, and Ca) and TEs remained nearly constant (within ±30% of the control). Only Fe, Al, P, Zn, Mn, Co, and Ba and to a much lesser extent Cd, Pb, Rare Earth Elements (REEs), U, Ti, and Zr were affected (p &lt; 0.05) by the presence of bacteria relative to the control and exhibited slight to moderate decreases during the experiment. Adsorption onto bacterial surfaces produced fast initial removal of Al, Mn, and Ba and to a lesser degree Cd, Pb, REEs, and U. Intracellular metabolic assimilation mostly affected P, Zn, and Co and progressively decreased their concentrations. Finally, coagulation as individual Fe/Al hydroxides due to DOM removal or pH change could also affect elements that were precipitated with organomineral colloids (Ti and Zr). The degrees of major and TE susceptibility to bacterial activity based on concentration changes during the experiment in both substrates ranged over three orders of magnitude from mg L−1 to µg L−1 and followed the order DOC &gt;&gt; P &gt;&gt; Ba &gt; Zn ≥ Fe ≥ Al &gt; Mn &gt; Cu ≥ Sr &gt; Zr ≥ Ti &gt; Ni ≥ Co &gt; REEs ≥ U &gt; Hf∼Th, which reflected the abundance of the elements in the two substrates. Generally, the soil exopolysaccharide producing bacterium P. aureofaciens in the peat leachate had the greatest impact of the four combinations investigated in this study (two bacteria with two substrates). Under ongoing environmental changes in the boreal zone, the autochthonous processes of bacterioplankton activity are able to decrease the concentrations of a very limited number of TEs, including mainly Fe and several macro- (P) and micro- (Zn, Mn, and Ba) nutrients. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adsorption; moss; organic carbon; peat; permafrost; trace elements; uptake","adsorption; bacterioplankton; bacterium; biodegradation; leachate; microbial activity; moss; organic carbon; peat; permafrost; trace metal; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bryophyta; Pseudomonas chlororaphis; Pseudomonas reactans; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016052454

It is unclear how shoreline wave run-up and erosion patterns along these low elevation islands will respond to projected sea-level rise (SLR) and changes in wave climate over the next century, hindering communities' preparation for the future. To elucidate how these processes may respond to climate change, extreme boreal winter and summer wave conditions under future sea-level rise (SLR) and wave climate scenarios were simulated at two atolls, Wake and Midway, using a shallow-water hydrodynamic model. Nearshore wave conditions were used to compute the potential longshore sediment flux along island shorelines via the CERC empirical formula and wave-driven erosion was calculated as the divergence of the longshore drift; run-up and the locations where the run-up exceed the berm elevation were also determined. SLR is projected to predominantly drive future island morphological change and flooding. Seaward shorelines (i.e., ocean fronted shorelines directly facing incident wave energy) were projected to experience greater erosion and flooding with SLR and in hypothetical scenarios where changes to deep water wave directions were altered, as informed by previous climate change forced Pacific wave modeling efforts. These changes caused nearshore waves to become more shore-normal, increasing wave attack along previously protected shorelines. With SLR, leeward shorelines (i.e., an ocean facing shoreline but sheltered from incident wave energy) became more accretive on windward islands and marginally more erosive along leeward islands. These shorelines became more accretionary and subject to more flooding with nearshore waves becoming more shore-normal. Lagoon shorelines demonstrated the greatest SLR-driven increase in erosion and run-up. They exhibited the greatest relative change with increasing wave heights where both erosion and run-up magnitudes increased. Wider reef flat-fronted seaward shorelines became more accretive as all oceanographic forcing parameters increased in magnitude and exhibited large run-up increases following increasing wave heights. Island end shorelines became subject to increased flooding, erosion at Wake, and accretion at Midway with SLR. Under future conditions, windward and leeward islands are projected to become thinner as ocean facing and lagoonal shorelines erode, with leeward islands becoming more elongate. Island shorelines will change dramatically over the next century as SLR and altered wave climates drive new erosional regimes. It is vital to the sustainability of island communities that the relative magnitudes of these effects are addressed when planning for projected future climates. © 2017","Atoll islands; Coastal hazards; Run-up; Sea-level rise; Shoreline erosion; Waves","atoll; climate change; coastal erosion; coastal morphology; hydrodynamics; sea level change; shoreline change; wave climate; Hawaiian Islands; Midway Islands; Wake Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026878328

Turning point (TP), which represents carbon emission turns from increasing to decreasing tendency with the economic growth, has become a major focus of political and academic concern. However, previous studies on TP were contextualized only in individual countries or regions but barely from a global perspective, which are insufficient for solving the carbon emission as a global issue. Therefore, this study aims to provide a global picture of the carbon emissions by identifying the TPs of 164 countries and five panel groups (i.e. global, high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income and low-income levels) in the world and the patterns of them. The results show that 123 individual countries and all the five panel groups accept the carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) hypothesis. Then, the TPs of them are identified. In particular, three close correlations are identified throughout the study: (1) the proportion of the CKC hypothesis and income level, i.e., the higher income level, the larger proportion of countries meeting the CKC hypothesis; (2) the TPs and income level, i.e., the higher income level, the higher TP; and (3) the turning years and income level, i.e., the higher income level, the shorter turning years. The identified TPs in this study provide valuable references for not only individual countries but also countries at different income levels to tailor their strategies and policies to finally achieve global carbon emission reduction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission reduction; CKC hypothesis; Global warming; Panel data; Time-series data; Turning points (TPs)","Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Carbon emission reductions; CKC hypothesis; Panel data; Time-series data; Turning points; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024103064

Under the spotlight of EU’s climate and energy policies, wood is a key contributor to the renewable energy targets. The aim of our paper is to review and discuss how forests and wood can sustainably and efficiently contribute to such intensified goals. EU’s existing legal frameworks for legal timber harvesting (EUTR), renewable energy use (EU-RED) and waste treatment give valuable principles for EU’s Member States and market sectors. Nevertheless, an efficient wood cascade should first be part of widespread certification, directly at the first intake of harvested logs. One extra issue–guaranteeing efficient use of forest fibers–could be included, to maintain optimum fiber cascading. This prevents a first intake of high-quality wood for energy (pellet mills) or paper production (pulp mills). Second, extra support can be considered for harvested high-quality trees, for example, via the use of wood in buildings and wood for construction. Third, more attention is needed on an European level for innovation at the end of life, like using post-consumer wood waste for wood-based panels or wood pellets, pulp waste for new bioeconomy products and improved efficiency processes for recycling and incineration. © 2016, © European Union 2016.

Carbon (C) stocks and accretion were assessed and modeled in various C components (large trees, small trees, dead wood, litter, roots, soil, and total C) of fallow and CAF systems along a 50-year chronosequence. Several functions were empirically fitted to a time series of C stocks. Large tree, soil, and total C stocks were best described by a logistic growth function while that for small trees by a rational quadratic function. The best-fitted functions explained 72–96 % of C stock accumulation over time. Two metrics describing C stock accretion were derived from these functions: the point of maximum C growth and the C growth coefficient (GC). The rate of maximum growth of total C stock was reached after 12–13 years in both fallow and CAF, with maximum GCs of 6.9 and 6.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively. Over the 50-year period, the GCs of total C stocks varied between 0.2 and 6.9 Mg C ha−1 year−1, with quick accumulation within the first decade that then slowed until it levelled off after 45 years. Over a period of about 30 years, both systems sequestered a total of ~200 Mg C ha−1. This indicates that cocoa agroforests, a main source of income for local populations, can also provide significant climate change mitigation services. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon component; Carbon growth coefficient; Carbon stock; Cocoa agroforest; Fallow system; Shifting agriculture","Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027838206

Previous global studies of the air-quality-related health effects of future climate change used single atmospheric models. However, in related studies, mortality results differ among models. Here we use an ensemble of global chemistry-climate models to show that premature mortality from changes in air pollution attributable to climate change, under the high greenhouse gas scenario RCP8.5 (ref.), is probably positive. We estimate 3,340 (-30,300 to 47,100) ozone-related deaths in 2030, relative to 2000 climate, and 43,600 (-195,000 to 237,000) in 2100 (14% of the increase in global ozone-related mortality). For PM2.5, we estimate 55,600 (-34,300 to 164,000) deaths in 2030 and 215,000 (-76,100 to 595,000) in 2100 (countering by 16% the global decrease in PM2.5-related mortality). Premature mortality attributable to climate change is estimated to be positive in all regions except Africa, and is greatest in India and East Asia. Most individual models yield increased mortality from climate change, but some yield decreases, suggesting caution in interpreting results from a single model.

The cool-humid NE aspect of these slopes represents the majority of beech forests under current climate, the warmer and drier SW aspect represents beech forests under future climate conditions. The field studies were supplemented by investigations under controlled conditions. Scope: The research program aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of plant-soil-microbe water, carbon and nitrogen feedbacks in a changing climate and a holistic view of the sensitivity of beech to climate change. Conclusions: The results of comparative and experimental studies underpin the high vulnerability of adult beech and its natural regeneration on calcareous soil to both direct climate change effects on plant physiology and indirect effects mediated by soil biogeochemical cycles. Mechanisms contributing to this vulnerability at the ecosystem and organismic level indicate a high significance of competitive interactions of beech with other vegetation components and soil microbial communities.

Given that many crops grown under rainfed conditions support the livelihoods of low-income farmers, it is important to highlight the vulnerability of rainfed areas to climate change in order to anticipate potential risks to food security. In this paper, we focus on India, where ~ 50% of rice is grown under rainfed conditions, and we employ statistical models (climate envelope models (CEMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs)) to map changes in climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation at a regional level (~ 18 × 18 km cell resolution) under projected future (2050) climate change (IPCC RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, using three GCMs: BCC-CSM1.1, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and HadGEM2-ES). We quantify the occurrence of rice (whether or not rainfed rice is commonly grown, using CEMs) and rice extent (area under cultivation, using BRTs) during the summer monsoon in relation to four climate variables that affect rice growth and yield namely ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration (PER), maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), and total rainfall during harvesting. Our models described the occurrence and extent of rice very well (CEMs for occurrence, ensemble AUC = 0.92; BRTs for extent, Pearson's r = 0.87). PER was the most important predictor of rainfed rice occurrence, and it was positively related to rainfed rice area, but all four climate variables were important for determining the extent of rice cultivation. Our models project that 15%–40% of current rainfed rice growing areas will be at risk (i.e. decline in climate suitability or become completely unsuitable). However, our models project considerable variation across India in the impact of future climate change: eastern and northern India are the locations most at risk, but parts of central and western India may benefit from increased precipitation. Hence our CEM and BRT models agree on the locations most at risk, but there is less consensus about the degree of risk at these locations. Our results help to identify locations where livelihoods of low-income farmers and regional food security may be threatened in the next few decades by climate changes. The use of more drought-resilient rice varieties and better irrigation infrastructure in these regions may help to reduce these impacts and reduce the vulnerability of farmers dependent on rainfed cropping. © 2017 The Authors","biomod2; Boosted regression trees; Climate envelope model; India; Rainfed rice","agrometeorology; climate change; evapotranspiration; food security; infrastructure planning; irrigation system; monsoon; rainfed agriculture; regression analysis; vulnerability; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020273391

Their high global warming potential, and contribution to local carbon and sulfur budgets has drawn significant scientific attention. Importantly, microbes can use gaseous alkanes and oxidize them to CO2, thus acting as effective biofilters. A relative decrease of these gases with a concomitant 13C enrichment of propane and n-butane in interstitial waters vs. the source suggests microbial anaerobic oxidation. The reported uncoupling of sulfate-reduction (SR) from anaerobic methane oxidation supports their microbial consumption. To date, strain BuS5 isolated from the sediments of Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California, is the only pure culture that can anaerobically degrade propane and n-butane. This organism belongs to a metabolically diverse cluster within the Deltaproteobacteria called Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus. Other phylotypes involved in gaseous alkane degradation were identified based on stable-isotope labeling and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. A novel syntrophic association of the archaeal genus, Candidatus Syntrophoarchaeum, and a thermophilic SR bacterium, HotSeep-1 was recently discovered from the Guaymas basin, Gulf of California that can anaerobically oxidize n-butane. Strikingly, metagenomic data and the draft genomes of ca. Syntrophoarchaeum suggest that this organism uses a novel mechanism for n-butane oxidation, distinct from the well-established fumarate addition mechanism. These recent findings indicate that a lot remains to be understood about our understanding of anaerobic SCA degradation. This mini-review summarizes our current understanding of microbial anaerobic SCA degradation, and provides an outlook for future research. © 2017 Singh, Guzman and Bose.","Anaerobic oxidation; Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus; Gulf of Mexico; Short-chain alkanes; Sulfate reduction","alkane; butane; ethane; propane; anaerobic metabolism; bioenergy; carbon source; Deltaproteobacteria; energy resource; fluorescence in situ hybridization; isotope labeling; marine environment; marine species; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial degradation; nonhuman; reduction (chemistry); Short Survey; thermophilic bacterium",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032181295

Unaccountable dump sites or even some landfills do not include methane collecting systems, in developing countries, like India. In this condition, the greenhouse gas escapes to the atmosphere. The methane emissions from landfills in India are ranked second next only to coal mining accounting total emission to be the third largest contributor to global warming in India. The estimation of emissions from landfills plays a vital role in evaluating the measures for reducing these greenhouse gases. So the emission of greenhouse gases from solid waste was discussed in brief highlighting its contribution to climate change. The importance has been placed on the real scenario of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) practiced in Indian cities and its improvement which will reduce its effects on environment and climate. Finally, concludes that the problem of solid waste needs some integrated approaches which should be both city based as well as community-based. © 2017 - Kalpana Corporation.","Indian scenario and integrated solid waste managements systems (ISWM); Landfill; Methane emission; Open dumps",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069766869

The model was simulated during the burning season between January 1 and April 30, 2014. The 95th percentile values of 24-h average concentration of total PAHs at 117 specified ground level receptors were calculated. The spatial distribution of predicted concentration is also illustrated. The modeled results indicated that the open burning of maize residues contributed to high PAH concentration in particularly at the receptors located near the burned areas. The cancer risk of carcinogenic PAHs was evaluated using the calculation of benzo(a)pyrene equivalent (BaPeq). The results show that the calculated BaPeq values on daily basis ranged from 0.1 to 18.6 ng m−3. These concentrations exceeded the Chinese’s standard of 2.5 ng m−3 at 26 among 117 receptors. It was estimated that about 20% of the population living in Chiang Rai was exposed to PAHs at this level. This finding suggests that the open burning of maize residues could significantly contribute to high cancer risk to local population. It is expected that the outcome of this study can support the setting up an appropriate mitigation strategy for reducing their emissions and health impacts on population in the affected areas. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agricultural waste burning; CALPUFF; Dispersion modeling; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Risk assessment; Thailand","atmospheric dynamics; biomass burning; burning; cancer; concentration (composition); crop residue; dispersion; health risk; PAH; pollution exposure; risk assessment; spatial distribution; Chiang Rai; Northern Region [Thailand]; Thailand; Neptunia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017443520

However, few such studies assess the role of species interactions, particularly under alternative environmental scenarios, despite interactions being key to ecosystem functioning. Here we address five questions of central importance to ecosystem multifunctionality using a terrestrial animal system. (1) Does the contribution of individual species differ for different ecosystem functions? (2) Do inter-species interactions affect the delivery of single functions and multiple functions? (3) Does the community composition that maximizes individual functions also maximize multifunctionality? (4) Is the functional role of individual species, and the effect of interspecific interactions, modified by changing environmental conditions? (5) How do these roles and interactions change under varying scenarios where ecosystem services are weighted to reflect different societal preferences? We manipulated species' relative abundance in dung beetle communities and measured 16 functions contributing to dung decomposition, plant productivity, nutrient recycling, reduction of greenhouse gases, and microbial activity. Using the multivariate diversity-interactions framework, we assessed how changes in species identity, composition, and interspecific interactions affected these functions in combination with an environmental driver (increased precipitation). This allowed us to identify key species and interactions across multiple functions. We then developed a desirability function approach to examine how individual species and species mixtures contribute to a desired state of overall ecosystem functioning. Species contributed unequally to individual functions, and to multifunctionality, and individual functions were maximized by different community compositions. Moreover, the species and interactions important for maintaining overall multifunctionality depended on the weight given to individual functions. Optimal multifunctionality was context-dependent, and sensitive to the valuation of services. This combination of methodological approaches allowed us to resolve the interactions and indirect effects among species that drive ecosystem functioning, revealing how multiple aspects of biodiversity can simultaneously drive ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the importance of a multifunctionality perspective for a complete assessment of species' functional contributions. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","biodiversity; complementarity; desirability function approach; dominance; dung beetle; ecosystem function; ecosystem services; environmental perturbation; extinction scenarios; multifunctionality; multivariate diversity-interaction model; species interactions","animal; beetle; biodiversity; ecosystem; feces; female; plant; Animals; Biodiversity; Coleoptera; Ecosystem; Feces; Female; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038888884

We develop a mathematical model of a silicon furnace. A continuum approach is taken, and we derive from first principles the equations governing the time evolution of chemical concentrations, gas partial pressures, velocity, and temperature within a one-dimensional vertical section of a furnace. Numerical simulations are obtained for this model and are shown to compare favorably with experimental results obtained using silicon pilot furnaces. A rising interface is shown to exist at the base of the charge, with motion caused by the heating of the pilot furnace. We find that more reactive carbon reduces the silicon monoxide losses, while reducing the carbon content in the raw material mixture causes greater solid and liquid material to build-up in the charge region, indicative of crust formation (which can be detrimental to the silicon production process). We also comment on how the various findings could be relevant for industrial operations. © 2017, The Author(s).",,"Charcoal; Furnaces; Metallurgical coke; Metallurgical furnaces; Silicon; Chemical concentrations; Electrical conductors; Gas partial pressure; Heat and mass transfer models; Industrial operations; Raw material mixtures; Silicon production process; Submerged arc furnace; Mass transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026894518

They are highly sensitive to climate change, and environmental transformations in these ecosystems are expected. The Sine Saloum estuary is a case of a system affected by global climate change where reduced precipitation and temperature increase have resulted in an inversion of the salinity gradient. Within the estuary, the composition and structure of the larval fish community related to environmental parameters were investigated using neuston and ring trawl nets. Larval fishes were sampled at 16 stations distributed along a salinity and distance-to-the-sea gradient during four field campaigns (November 2013, February, June, and August 2014) covering an annual cycle. This is the first study documenting the spatial and temporal assemblages of fish larvae in an inverse estuary. The total of 41 taxa representing 24 families and 34 genus identified in this study was lower than that of other tropical estuaries. Clupeidae spp. was the dominant taxon, accounting for 28.9% of the total number of fish larvae caught, followed by Gerreidae spp. (21.1%), Hyporamphus picarti (18.8%), Diplodus bellottii (8.9%), Hypleurochilus langi (4.8%), Mugilidae spp. (4.4%), and Gobiidae sp.1 (3.5%). A total of 20 taxa were recorded within the upper estuary region, whereas 29 and 37 taxa were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively. While larval fish were captured at all sites and during all seasons, abundances and richness decreased with increasing salinity. Larval fish assemblages also showed a clear vertical structure corresponding to three distinct water strata. Salinity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were the variables that best explained the spatial and temporal differences in larval fish assemblages. It is difficult to forecast the future situation for this system but so far, compared to other mangrove estuarine systems, we have observed the loss of freshwater species in favour of species of marine origin. The information provided in the present study is a contribution to the knowledge of tropical biodiversity and modifications of the ichthyoplankton communities in the context of climate change and future green fund action. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Community structure; Fish larvae; High salinity; Inverse estuary; Sine Saloum; West Africa","Clupeidae; Diplodus bellottii; Gerreidae; Gobiidae; Hypleurochilus; Mugilidae; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027445903

The transportation and toxicity of zinc nanomaterial within the wastewater treatment processes is not well known. In this study, the zinc nanomaterial and its fate were characterized in an activated sludge treatment process. The tests performed included batch studies to evaluate abiotic and biotic removal, toxicity studies to evaluate inhibition to coliform and nitrifying bacteria, and bioreactor studies to evaluate impact on operating parameters. Stock solutions of zinc nanomaterial varied in size from 50 to 500 nm, but when added to an activated sludge solution, the nanoparticles agglomerated to larger sizes such that more than 60% of the zinc nanomaterial settled out of solution. However, when ionic zinc was added to activated sludge, more than 60% of the ionic zinc remained in suspension. It is likely that the ionic strength of the wastewater influenced the aggregation of the nanomaterial. Differences in the extent of removal between ionic and nano zinc species indicate that the mechanisms governing their removal are different. Toxicity analysis showed that zinc nanomaterial did not inhibit growth of coliform and ammonia oxidizing bacteria. However, ionic zinc inhibited the growth of both the coliform and ammonia oxidizing bacteria. Bioreactors were set up using activated sludge that was collected from a local treatment plant operating only in carbon oxidation mode. The treatment plant was operated at an SRT of 1.2 days and an MLSS of 650 mg/L. Several key parameters (COD, MLSS, pH) in the bioreactors were monitored through a 7-day incubation period, but showed no significant changes due to the addition of nano or ionic zinc. It is possible that the toxicity of zinc nanomaterial was not observed in these experiments because the nanomaterial agglomerated and settled out of solution.","Agglomeration; Batch bioreactor; Toxicity; Wastewater; Zinc oxide nanomaterial","Activated sludge process; Agglomeration; Ammonia; Bacteria; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Carbon; Chemical oxygen demand; Coliform bacteria; Ionic strength; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Nitrification; Toxicity; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Zinc; Zinc oxide; Activated-sludge treatment process; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Batch bioreactors; Municipal wastewaters; Nitrifying bacteria; Operating parameters; Wastewater treatment process; Zinc oxide nanomaterials; Chemicals removal (water treatment); zinc oxide nanoparticle; metal nanoparticle; waste water; water pollutant; zinc oxide; activated sludge; aggregation; bacterium; bioreactor; experimental study; inorganic compound; nanoparticle; oxidation; toxicity; wastewater; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; batch reactor; chemical oxygen demand; coliform bacterium; controlled study; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; heavy metal removal; ionic strength; nitrifying bacterium; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; suspended particulate matter; toxicity; waste water; zeta potential; bacterium; chemistry; city; classification; drug effects; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; Nitrosomonadales; Bacteria; Cities; Metal Nanoparticles; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zinc Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028765674

Wheat, barley, oats, rye, triticale, rice, and others are rich in calories, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. These cereals supply 20% of the calories consumed by people worldwide and are therefore a primary source of energy for humans and play a vital role in global food and nutrition security. Global production of small grains increased linearly from 1960 to 2005, and then began to decline. Further decline in production is projected to continue through 2050 while global demand for these grains is projected to increase by 1% per annum. Currently, wheat, barley, and oat production exceeds consumption in developed countries, while in developing countries the consumption rate is higher than production. An increasing demand for meat and livestock products is likely to compound the demand for cereals in developing countries. Current production levels and trends will not be sufficient to fulfill the projected global demand generated by increased populations. For wheat, global production will need to be increased by 60% to fulfill the estimated demand in 2050. Until recently, global wheat production increased mostly in response to development of improved cultivars and farming practices and technologies. Production is now limited by biotic and abiotic constraints, including diseases, nematodes, insect pests, weeds, and climate. Among these constraints, plant-parasitic nematodes alone are estimated to reduce production of all world crops by 10%. Cereal cyst nematodes (CCNs) are among the most important nematode pests that limit production of small grain cereals. Heavily invaded young plants are stunted and their lower leaves are often chlorotic, forming pale green patches in the field. Mature plants are also stunted, have a reduced number of tillers, and the roots are shallow and have a “bushy-knotted” appearance. CCNs comprise a number of closely-related species and are found in most regions where cereals are produced. © 2017 The American Phytopathological Society.",,"animal; food grain; parasitology; physiology; plant disease; Poaceae; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; Tylenchoidea; Animals; Edible Grain; Plant Diseases; Poaceae; Tylenchoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029676958

Many regions with large CO2 point sources coincide with historical oil and gas fields. This is especially apparent in the Midwestern United States, where over one million oil and gas wells are present dating back to the late 1800s. To investigate wellbore integrity factors in this region, the condition of oil and gas wells in Michigan and Ohio was summarized based on well status, depth, construction, age, and plugging specifications. To better understand the impact of well integrity on a local scale, six test study areas were also analyzed. These hypothetical test study areas were based on subsurface area necessary for an industrial scale CO2 storage application. Detailed records were used to categorize well conditions, and corrective actions necessary to repair the wells were then assigned. The results of the test study area analysis provide a real representation of the level of effort necessary to prepare sites for CO2 storage. Actions may involve relatively low-effort tasks to examine wellheads or more extensive well re-entry and plugging. The analysis indicated that many areas may have hundreds of wells, but no wells penetrating the deeper CO2 storage zones.

We compared predictions from species and phenotype distribution models under future climate scenarios for Andropogon gerardii, a widely distributed, dominant grass found throughout the central United States. Phenotype data on aboveground biomass, height, leaf width, and chlorophyll content were obtained from 33 populations spanning a ~1000 km gradient that encompassed the majority of the species’ environmental range. Species and phenotype distribution models were trained using current climate conditions and projected to future climate scenarios. We used permutation procedures to infer the most important variable for each model. The species-level response to climate was most sensitive to maximum temperature of the hottest month, but phenotypic variables were most sensitive to mean annual precipitation. The phenotype distribution models predict that A. gerardii could be largely functionally eliminated from where this species currently dominates, with biomass and height declining by up to ~60% and leaf width by ~20%. By the 2070s, the core area of highest suitability for A. gerardii is projected to shift up to ~700 km northeastward. Further, short-statured phenotypes found in the present-day short grass prairies on the western periphery of the species’ range will become favored in the current core ~800 km eastward of their current location. Combined, species and phenotype models predict this currently dominant prairie grass will decline in prevalence and stature. Thus, sourcing plant material for grassland restoration and forage should consider changes in the phenotype that will be favored under future climate conditions. Phenotype distribution models account for the role of intraspecific variation in determining responses to anticipated climate change and thereby complement predictions from species distributions models in guiding climate adaptation strategies. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biomass; climate change; intraspecific variation; local adaptation; phenotype distribution model; phenotypic variation; precipitation; species distribution model","aboveground biomass; climate change; grass; intraspecific variation; phenotype; prairie; precipitation (climatology); spatial distribution; United States; Andropogon gerardii; Andropogon; climate change; grassland; Poaceae; prevalence; Andropogon; Climate Change; Grassland; Poaceae; Prevalence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017157695

These are drawn from the three core strands of a much wider body of work undertaken within the Stories of Change project. This took stories as a central motif and organising device to refresh public and political conversations about energy and decarbonisation. Our hypothesis was that stories could offer a popular and engaging route into thinking about the past and present of humanity's lives with energy and a lively way of imagining possible futures. We also wanted to test the degree to which stories could offer a shared intellectual space that might support both interdisciplinary and co-productive working for a core team that includes social science, humanities, media, computing and design researchers as well as creative and community partners.

Meeting these targets is a challenge that calls for innovative research to improve the use of renewable energy sources, new technologies, and holistic tools and methodologies. Such research should integrate the dynamics and main drivers of energy supply and demand in buildings to support new policies, plans and actions towards lowering the built environment burdens. This paper brings together ten research topics concerning the energy and environmental performance of buildings, which can support a shift towards a more sustainable built environment. Background information and state of the art literature on the covered research topics is briefly summarized, gaps are identified and guidelines for future research are provided. The selected topics cover different stages along the lifetime of buildings (from design and operation, to retrofitting and end-of-life), different scale approaches (from building elements/components, to the building, district and urban scales), and different methods to assess the energy and environmental performance of buildings (life-cycle assessment, generative design methods and retrofitting tools). Other topics are discussed such as: nearly zero-energy buildings, the control of domestic energy resources in smart grid scenarios, the need to include end-users' behaviors in the dynamics of energy demand, the advantages of improving thermal storage by using phase change materials, the importance of reducing heating and cooling energy demand (maintaining indoor thermal comfort), and the optimization of heating and cooling fluids, and their system control. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Design and retrofitting; End-users behaviors; Energy efficiency; Environmental performance; Thermal performance","Architectural design; Buildings; Climate change; Ecodesign; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Life cycle; Phase change materials; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Smart power grids; Sustainable development; Building elements/components; End users; Environmental performance; Generative design methods; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Reduce energy consumption; Thermal Performance; Use of renewable energies; Zero energy buildings",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019107550

The use of SABs in potential carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation efforts has been proposed with commercial seaweed production in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam, and is at a nascent stage in Australia and New Zealand. We attempted to consider the total annual potential of SABs to drawdown and fix anthropogenic CO2. In the last decade, seaweed production has increased tremendously in the Asian-Pacific region. In 2014, the total annual production of Asian-Pacific SABs surpassed 2.61 × 106 t dw. Total carbon accumulated annually was more than 0.78 × 106 t y−1, equivalent to over 2.87 × 106 t CO2 y−1. By increasing the area available for SABs, biomass production, carbon accumulation, and CO2 drawdown can be enhanced. The conversion of biomass to biofuel can reduce the use of fossil fuels and provide additional mitigation of CO2 emissions. Contributions of seaweeds as carbon donors to other ecosystems could be significant in global carbon sequestration. The ongoing development of SABs would not only ensure that Asian-Pacific countries will remain leaders in the global seaweed industry but may also provide an added dimension of helping to mitigate the problem of excessive CO2 emissions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Asian Pacific region; Blue carbon; Carbon donor; CO2 mitigation; Macroalgae; Seaweed aquaculture bed (SAB)",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001955843

Furthermore, the vulcanizate also exhibited high thermal conductivity (0.45 W/m K), which is 2.0-fold higher than that of SBR. The improvement in properties could be attributed to the synergetic effect of PCNT and RGO in PCNT@RGO hybrid, strong interfacial between PCNT@RGO and SBR matrix, the large constrained regions and continuous filler networks.

Materials and Methods Retrospective large case series on 128 CO2 laser excisions for HG-VaIN in 106 women treated at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Oncologic Referral Center, Aviano, Italy. These procedures were performed under local anesthesia with a 20-W continuous laser beam focused to a 0.2-mm spot size. Complications were defined as ""minor"" when limited to vagina, and ""major"" when surrounding organs were injured or the vaginal vault was opened. To identify possible factors associated with surgical complications, we performed a univariate analysis with the t test for continuous variables and χ2 or Fisher exact test for qualitative variables as appropriate. Results The overall rate of complication was 7.8% (10/128); nine of them were vaginal bleeding, and only one (0.8%) was a major complication with vaginal vault perforation. A greater number of previous destructive treatments and of two or more previous laser vaginal excisional treatments was present in patients with complications compared with ones without complications (10% vs 3.9 %, p =.92, and 30% vs 15.2%, p =.44, respectively), although these differences were not statistically significant. A total of 10.5% (6/57) of occult vaginal cancer was detected in women with initial diagnosis of VaIN3 (HG-VaIN) on biopsy. Conclusions Carbon dioxide laser excision for HG-VaIN seems to be a safe approach with low rate of complications, probably because of the better accuracy achieved by CO2 laser resections, and permits diagnosis of occult invasive disease. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","laser CO2; laser excisional treatment; occult cancer; surgical complications; vaginal cancer; vaginal excision; VaIN","adult; aged; Article; cancer grading; colposcopy; excision; female; follow up; human; human tissue; Italy; laser surgery; length of stay; local anesthesia; major clinical study; occult cancer; operation duration; patient safety; postoperative complication; retrospective study; risk factor; tumor biopsy; tumor invasion; vagina bleeding; vagina cancer; vagina disease; vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia; vaginal vault perforation; adolescent; adverse device effect; carcinoma in situ; endometrium ablation; gas laser; low level laser therapy; middle aged; procedures; therapeutic use; vagina tumor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma in Situ; Endometrial Ablation Techniques; Female; Humans; Italy; Laser Therapy; Lasers, Gas; Middle Aged; Vaginal Neoplasms; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040792144

To support the formulation of policies and strategies to decarbonise the UK housing stock, a large number of increasingly sophisticated Housing Stock Energy Models (HSEMs) have been developed throughout the past 25 years. After describing the sources of data and the spatio-temporal granularity with which these data are available to represent this stock, as well as the physical and social phenomena that are modelled and the range of strategies employed to do so, this paper evaluates the 29 HSEMs that have been developed and deployed in the UK. In this we consider the models’ predictive accuracy, predictive sensitivity to design parameters, versatility, computational efficiency, the reproducibility of predictions and software usability as well as the models’ transparency (how open they are) and modularity. We also discuss their comprehensiveness. From this evaluation, we conclude that current HSEMs are lacking in transparency and modularity, they are limited in their scope and employ simplistic models that limit their utility; in particular, relating to the modelling of heat flow and in the modelling of household behaviours relating to investment decisions and energy using practices. There is a need for an open-source and modular dynamic housing stock energy modelling platform that addresses current limitations, can be readily updated as new (e.g. housing survey) calibration data is released and be readily extended by the modelling community at large: improving upon the utilisation of scarce developmental resources. This would represent a considerable step forward in the formulation of housing stock decarbonisation policy that is informed by sound evidence. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy modelling; Modularity; Policy support; Residential buildings","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Computational efficiency; Energy management; Global warming; Heating; Investments; Open source software; Transparency; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy modelling; Investment decisions; Modularity; Policy support; Predictive accuracy; Residential building; Software usabilities; Housing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021058261

We describe here the main challenges and policy issues and provide policy recommendations for scaling up sustainable bioenergy approaches globally. The 2016 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs defined under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP21) will not reach global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission targets of 2 °C. Sustainable biomass production can make a significant contribution. Substantive evidence exists that many bioenergy cropping systems can bring multiple benefits and off-set environmental problems associated with fossil fuels usage as well as intensive food production and urbanization. We provide evidence that there are many approaches to land use for bioenergy expansion that do not lead to competition for food or other needs. We should focus on how to manage these approaches on a synergistic basis and how to reduce tradeoffs at landscape scales. Priorities include successful synergies between bioenergy and food security (integrated resource management designed to improve both food security and access to bioenergy), investments in technology, rural extension, and innovations that build capacity and infrastructure, promotion of stable prices to incentivize local production and use of double cropping and flex crops (plants grown for both food and non-food markets) that provide food and energy as well as other services. The sustainable production of biomass requires appropriate policies to secure long-term support to improve crop productivity and also to ensure environmental as well as economic and social benefits of bioenergy cropping systems. Continuous support for cropping, infrastructure, agricultural management and related policies is needed to foster positive synergies between food crops and bioenergy production. In comparison to fossil fuels, biofuels have many positive environmental benefits. Potential negative effects caused by land-use change and agriculture intensification can be mitigated by agroecological zoning, best management practices, the use of eco-hydrology and biodiversity-friendly concepts at field, watershed and landscape scales. Global climate and environmental changes related to the use of fossil fuels and inequitable development make it unethical not to pursue more equitable energy development that includes bioenergy. To achieve sustainable development, competitiveness and costs of bioenergy production need to be addressed in a manner that considers not only economic gains but also development of local knowledge and social and environmental benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Climate Change; Energy security; Environmental security; Food security; Landscapes; Sustainable development",,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016075327

An agroecosystem model (AgroIBIS-VSF) that is capable of simulating variably saturated water flow was driven with hourly weather observations in southern Wisconsin over 27 yr for various RLD distributions across a continuum of groundwater depth. The results indicated that the strength of the relationship between groundwater depth and water use in the critical water table depth zone is controlled by the root structure and root water uptake (RWU) strategy. In this zone, transpiration is progressively more sensitive to the groundwater level as roots become shallower. The impact of drought on corn (Zea mays L.) lessens and corn becomes less reliant on compensated RWU capabilities as roots extend deeper. Simulations indicated that the use of the compensated RWU approach results in NPP increases of 38.1 (3.81%), 30.8 (2.74%), and 6.4 (0.55%) g C m−2 yr−1 during the driest years (i.e., when growing season precipitation is below the 30th percentile of the long-term observations) for shallow, intermediate, and deep RLDs, respectively. Moreover, shallow groundwater supported RWU, and corn with a shallow RLD benefited the most from shallow groundwater, with an increase in annual transpiration of 230 mm. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating compensatory RWU and selecting an appropriate and representative RLD for contrasting vegetation types in ecosystem models to simulate a more realistic plant response to variable climate and groundwater depth conditions. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Climate models; Ecosystems; Flow of water; Forestry; Grain (agricultural product); Groundwater; Transpiration; Agro-ecosystem modeling; Annual transpiration; Ground water depths; Long term observations; Net primary productivity; Root length density; Shallow groundwater; Weather observations; Groundwater resources; density; ecosystem modeling; groundwater; maize; net primary production; precipitation (climatology); root; shallow water; spatial distribution; transpiration; water content; water depth; water flow; water level; water table; water use; United States; Wisconsin; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030869263

The oceanographical features included in the analysis were obtained from the literature or inferred from schemes of climatic oceanography. The most frequent oceanographic feature associated with a particular CPA is constant advection of a particular water mass, followed by local water mass transformation, seasonal ice zones, flaw polynyas, and external sources of nutrients. Particularly important are major frontal zones, and coastal phenomena such as coastal/offshore waters transition zones, massifs of fast ice and specific regimes of semi-isolated fjords and bays. Each Arctic sea in the study area or its large part (in the Barents Sea) is characterized by a distinct combination of oceanographical features associated with the respective CPAs. Although most oceanographical features were not involved in the process of developing the CPA network directly, the resulting CPAs are shown to have a solid oceanographical background. While this oceanographical background needs further understanding, it provides the possibility to refine the MPA boundaries and plan future studies. Furthermore it allows evaluation of potential resistance and resilience of CPAs to climate change by focusing on relevant oceanographical processes and the adaptive potential of biota on an area by area basis.

The electrical properties of Ti/p-InP metal/semiconductor (MS) and Ti/OG/p-InP MIS junctions have been analyzed based on current–voltage (I–V) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics. The MIS junction exhibited higher rectifying behavior than the MS junction. The higher barrier height (BH) of the MIS junction compared with the MS junction indicates effective modification by the OG layer. Also, the BH, ideality factor, shunt resistance, and series resistance were extracted based on the I–V characteristic, Cheung’s and Norde’s methods, and the ΨS–V plot. The BH evaluated by Cheung’s and Norde’s methods and the ΨS–V plot was shown to be similar, confirming the reliability and validity of the methods applied. The extracted interface state density (NSS) of the MIS junction was less than for the MS junction, revealing that the OG organic layer reduced the NSS value. Analysis demonstrated that, in the lower bias region, the reverse current conduction mechanism was dominated by Poole–Frenkel emission for both the MS and MIS junction. Meanwhile, in the higher bias region, Schottky emission governed the reverse current conduction mechanism. The results suggest that such OG layers have potential for use in high-quality electronic devices. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","current transport properties; electrical characteristics; interface state density; MIS junction; Orange G organic interlayer; p-type InP","Bias voltage; Capacitance; Citrus fruits; Electric resistance; Current transport properties; Electrical characteristic; Electron beam evaporation; Interface state density; Organic interlayers; Rectifying behaviors; Reliability and validity; Spin coating process; Interface states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021174233

The impact of abiotic stress on crop production has emerged as a major research priority during the past decade. Several forecasts for the coming decades project increase in atmospheric CO2 and temperature and changes in precipitation, resulting in more frequent droughts and floods, cold and heat waves and other extreme events. The key aspect of sustainable development in agriculture involves resource conservation-based strategies, cropping system-based strategies and exploitation of genetic resources. Soil degradation should be prevented by practices and techniques, such as no-till sowing of crops, drip irrigation, crop rotation and leaving land fallow. Suitable farming systems that have potential to increase food production and promote soil conservation for each agroecological zones should be identified. Holistic land management and soil health restoration are also one of the key aspects of suitable development towards managing food security. In addition, maintenance of soil life and soil quality through practices such as organic fertilizer supplementation and judicious use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides should be a priority. Judicious management of water on a watershed basis should be undertaken to make maximum use of available water. Biotechnological improvement of crops and evolution of crop varieties suitable for climate change also form the key for sustainable development. Tapping of genetic resources to identify varieties and new crops that can adapt and cope with climate risk also forms a key approach in sustainable development to tackle the problem of food security. Adaptation to climate change requires long-term investments in strategic research and new policy initiatives that put climate change adaptation in planning. A comprehensive understanding of abiotic stress, especially the mechanism and tolerance aspects for adaptation strategies, across the full range of warming scenarios and regions is essential for preparing for climate change. Therefore, a judicious mixture of basic and applied research outlooks has been presented on developments in management of abiotic stresses in dryland agriculture. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043801650

Box 5003, 1432 Ås, Norway","Areas dominated by bracken, Pteridium aquilinum, occur on every continent except Antarctica. These fern thickets appear to retard forest recovery and thus reduce forest diversity and carbon values. We examined how bracken inhibits forest recovery in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. We established 40 50 × 5-m transects across the forest-bracken interface. On average, we recorded 596 ± 64 large trees (stems ha−1 ± 1 SE), 1440 ± 159 saplings, 33580 ± 8860 large seedlings and 31003 ± 8854 small seedlings in the forest and 45 ± 16 large trees, 114 ± 28 saplings, 7015 ± 2268 large seedlings and 6317 ± 2240 small seedlings in bracken. All bracken clearings had been affected by fire. The density of bracken was 4.9 ± 0.3 fronds m−2. Our results suggest that distance limitation, lack of perches, damage by vertebrates and suppression by climbers all offer potential explanations of impeded regeneration in bracken. The sparser woody vegetation that occurred in bracken typically had smaller-seeded and thicker-barked tree species than the nearby forest and also included more pioneers and fewer animal dispersed species. Interestingly we detected a negative relationship between proximity to bracken plants and woody regeneration within the forest. Several key explanatory variables including canopy cover, litter depth, distance to forest and bracken density are correlated and hard to separate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Afro-tropical forest; Arrested succession; Bwindi; Competition; Forest-bracken edge; Invasive species; Pteridium aquilinum; Regeneration","Animals; Competition; Recovery; Arrested succession; Bwindi; Forest-bracken edge; Invasive species; Pteridium aquilinum; Regeneration; Tropical forest; Reforestation; Afrotropic Ecozone; clearcutting; competition (ecology); fern; fire; forest; invasive species; regeneration; succession; transect; upland region; vertebrate; woody plant; Biodiversity; Forests; Plantations; Seedlings; Antarctica; Bwindi Impenetrable National Park; Uganda; Animalia; Filicophyta; Pteridium aquilinum; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026762155

This study assessed the feasibility of using biogas to fuel buses in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. The use of biogas for transportation delivers more financial value-adding compared to using biogas for electricity-R235/GJ for transport fuel and R111/GJ for electricity. The cultivation of land and use of energy crops as feedstock for biogas production will require at least seven hectares per bus; which will place additional demands on the city's scarce land resources and create potential conflicts with food production. Biodegradable wastes are alternative feedstock for biogas production that avoids these impacts, while diverting organic waste from landfill. Using size-location modelling, we identified the optimal locations for two large (&gt;2000Nm3/h) biogas facilities that use the organic fraction of municipal solid waste as feedstock to produce upgraded biogas (bio-methane) that can fuel up to six-hundred city buses.

Carbon that is stored in the ecosystem is accumulated in the deposited sediment as well as in the living, above and below ground biomass, with a different rate of carbon sequestration and storage between the species. The objective of this research was to investigate carbon storage in the living plants and in the sediment among species of different size in tropical waters. The samples were collected from Phuket province, Thailand, in the high density monospecific patches of different size species (Enhalus acoroides as a big, Thalassia hemprhicii as a medium and Halophila ovalis as a small size species). Total carbon and carbon stored in above and below ground, was significantly different between the species (p<0.05), with the highest values in below ground parts of E. acoroides and T. hemprichii 238.10±85.07 and 134±21.55 g Dw m-2, respectively. Average organic carbon in the sediment was significantly different (p<0.05) as well, with E. acoroides having highest organic carbon content in the deeper layers of the sediment 1.14±0.25 % Corg, while the other two species had higher organic carbon in the top and medium layers of sediment. The results of this preliminary research propose that big size species have higher carbon content than smaller species, which reflects in higher sequestration rates of carbon from the ocean, thus reducing the ocean carbon budget. Moreover, it provides necessary information on size of the species which is the key for the future carbon storage studies in the region.","Above ground; Below ground; Organic carbon; Seagrass; Sediment","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; coastal sediment; organic carbon; seagrass; seagrass meadow; Andamans; Andamans and Nicobars; Phuket [Southern Region]; Southern Region; Thailand; Enhalus acoroides; Halophila ovalis; Thalassia; Thalassia hemprichii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038427853

We studied foliar isoprenoid emissions, phenology, growth and survival rates on Quercus pubescens (QP) and Quercus ilex (QI) saplings growing in competition with herbaceous species under three temperature treatments (ambient, +1.5, +3 °C) combined with two precipitation treatments (normal, −30 % precipitation). Elevated temperature treatments significantly enhanced isoprenoid emissions of both species (~70 %). Most of this enhancement could be attributed to increases in the foliar emission capacities. Reduced precipitation tended to decrease isoprenoid emissions (~20 %), but this effect was variable depending on plant species, measurement period and interaction with temperature treatments. In QP, measured early summer, most of the emission variability was associated with that of photosynthesis while in QI, measured mid-summer, emissions and photosynthesis were rather uncoupled probably due to changes in resource allocation and persistent impairment of the primary metabolism caused by stress. Elevated temperature reduced sapling survival rates of both species (~20 %) but increased longevity of QP leaves (~18 %). Leaf biomasses at plant and community level were not affected by treatments but were strongly reduced by the presence of herbaceous competitors. The results underline the complexity of potential plant responses to climate change to be considered for predicting the future evolution of isoprenoid emission in the Mediterranean region. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Climate change; Global warming; Isoprene; Monoterpene; Water stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991108152

However, detailed geochemical proxy data are required to test these hypotheses. Here we present records of Li/Ca, Mg/Ca, Cd/Ca, U/Ca, δ18O, δ13C, and shell weight in planktonic foraminifera from marine sediments spanning the OMT in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Li/Ca values increase by 1 μmol/mol across this interval. We interpret this to indicate an ~20% increase in silicate weathering rates, which would have lowered atmospheric CO2, potentially forcing the Antarctic glaciation ~ 23 Ma. δ13C of thermocline dwelling planktonic foraminifera track the global increase in seawater δ13C across the OMT and during the Mi-1 event, hence supporting a hypothesized global increase in organic carbon burial rates. High δ13C previously measured in epipelagic planktonic foraminifera and high Cd/Ca ratios during Mi-1 are interpreted to represent locally enhanced primary productivity, stimulated by increased nutrients supply to surface waters. The fingerprint of high export production and associated organic carbon burial at this site is found in reduced bottom water oxygenation (inferred from high foraminiferal U/Ca) and enhanced respiratory dissolution of carbonates, characterized by reduced foraminiferal shell weight. Replication of our results elsewhere would strengthen the case that weathering-induced CO2 sequestration preconditioned climate for Antarctic ice sheet growth across the OMT, and increased burial of organic carbon acted as a feedback that intensified cooling at this time. ©2017.

Phosphorus (P) addition has been proposed to reduce the effects of N enrichment on N leaching and acidification, since P limitation can reduce biomass production and consequent sequestration of reactive N. However, biodiversity is often reduced in more productive ecosystems and P limitation may protect against this effect. Responses to P availability in instances of high N deposition are poorly understood. This study investigated the ecosystem response to alleviation of P limitation, using a long-term nutrient addition experiment (1996–2012) three years after ceasing N inputs and 15 years after a single P application. Substantial differences were observed in the structure and composition of vegetation species and above-ground vegetation biomass. Vegetation height was greater in the N + P addition treatments (+ 38% cf. control), with increased cryptogam cover (+ 47%), whereas N addition increased graminoid species cover (+ 68%). Vegetation diversity was significantly reduced by the addition of P (− 21%), indicating that P limitation is likely to be an important mechanism that limits biodiversity loss in upland habitats exposed to chronic N deposition. Significant differences in soil C and N contents were also observed between treatments. Relative to control, the addition of N increased soil C (+ 11%) and N (+ 11%) pool sizes, whereas the addition of N and P reduced soil C (− 12%) and N (− 13%) pool sizes. This demonstrated the importance of P availability for upland ecosystem processes, and highlights the long-term effects of P addition on vegetation species composition and C storage. Thus, the addition of P cannot be endorsed as a method for reducing impacts of N deposition.

Vegetation can be lost through a combination of human and natural processes, leading to areas of exposed bare peat frequently accompanied by loss of surface moisture due to drainage or gullying. Waters draining such degraded peatlands are likely to have increased levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other nutrients, which can adversely impact the global climate, drinking water supplies and freshwater ecology. Consequently peatland revegetation efforts have become widespread. This paper presents results from a four-year study conducted to monitor the water quality impacts of a bare peat revegetation approach, which used landscape scale application of lime and fertiliser to encourage a grass nurse crop. This study considers an area of severely degraded blanket peat in the UK uplands, with large areas of bare peat prior to revegetation and provides the largest field dataset to date on the effects of this method on catchment run-off waters. Despite concerns that liming could increase DOC concentrations, the revegetation method is not shown to have this effect over the time period, and interestingly results in short term periods of suppression. The mechanism for this novel and unexpected finding merits further investigation and results in reduced DOC concentration, by up to 14 mg/l or 50% of control values, combined with periods of reduced colour carbon ratios. The data show that other nutrients were largely unaffected although rates of phosphate (PO43−) export were above recommended levels in the first year of application, suggesting initial phosphorus (P) application rates may require adjustment. Further investigation is required to consider the longer term effects of this restoration method as the vegetation matures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","DOC; Peatlands; Restoration","Catchments; Fertilizers; Image reconstruction; Lime; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Peat; Potable water; Restoration; Runoff; Soil conservation; Vegetation; Water quality; Water supply; Wetlands; Application rates; Dissolved organic carbon; DOC concentrations; Peat land; Peatland vegetation; Restoration methods; Surface moistures; Water quality impact; Revegetation; bare soil; catchment; dissolved organic carbon; drainage water; environmental restoration; fertilizer application; lime; peat; peatland; revegetation; runoff; upland region; water quality; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029491076

The assumption of cost-optimal operation may impose the necessity for bi-level problems. This paper presents a methodology to formulate and solve multi-objective bi-level optimization problems where upper-level decision makers decide on design and policy, while plant operation is defined at the lower level. It can be used to assess energy consumption or emission reduction potential corresponding to cost-optimal operation. The methodology applies conceptual decomposition to the outer design- and inner operation-optimization problems. The first is solved with the scatter search method and the second using mixed integer linear programming. Scatter search is a metaheuristic method convenient to integrate problem-specific heuristics into the process and systematically take advantage of the designer's knowledge. The fuzzy approach considers multiple design objectives and helps formulate heuristic rules based on the decision criteria satisfaction rates. The case study illustrates the design of a trigeneration system for an urban settlement. The design objectives are: total costs, primary energy and greenhouse gases emission. Cost-optimal operation is presumed. The optimal plant design and operation are realistic and mostly consistent with the literature. Compared to the cost-optimal solution, other objectives might lead to reduced primary energy consumption for 7.21% or lower emission for 91.85% with 43.35% and 83.1% larger costs.

The results of studies of material, chemical and mineralogical compositions of waste coal from Abashevskaya processing plant (Novokuznetsk) are presented. It was established that the chemical composition of waste coal refers to aluminosilicate raw materials with a high content of alumina and coloring oxides, the residual carbon content in the wastes is 12-25 %. According to the granulometric composition the waste coal is basically a sandy-dusty fraction with a small amount of clay particles (1-3 %). Additional grinding of coal waste and the introduction of a clay additive in an amount of up to 30 % are recommended. The results of the study of the mineral composition of waste coal are presented. Clay minerals are represented in the descending order by hydromuscovite, montmorillonite and kaolinite, minerals-impurities consist of quartz, feldspar fine-dispersed carbonates. The results of the investigation of ceramic-technological properties of waste coal, which belong to the group of moderately plastic low-melting raw materials, are given.

Soil degradation plays an important role in this context while dealing with, for example, the productive capacity of our soil resources or carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. However, little has been done to assess the pristine soil conditions despite the fact that these provide the basis to put changes into context. Various methodologies have been developed to assess the global distribution of current soil conditions. We used the S-World methodology that was developed to generate global soil property maps for environmental modelling studies. Up till now, the S-World methodology assessed current soil conditions by disaggregating the Harmonized World Soil Database using detailed information on climate, topography, land cover, and land use. This study used the S-World methodology to derive global soil conditions under natural vegetation. A large number of natural areas around the globe were identified for which land cover, expressed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, could be successfully correlated to environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and topography. Using this relation in regression kriging, the vegetation index under natural conditions was derived for the entire globe. Subsequently, the S-World methodology was used to calculate the soil properties under natural land cover and absence of human land use. Soil property maps for natural and current conditions were compared and showed large local differences. The results indicate that there are major changes due to land cover and land use change and that these changes are concentrated on the globe. The results are the basis for future assessments on, for example, land degradation, food security, or the sustainable development goals. © 2017 The Authors.

Along the Mediterranean coastline, increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall have been hypothesised to trigger habitat shifts from perennial grasses to annual succulents in fragile saltmarsh ecosystems, such as those fringing the North Adriatic coastline. We used manipulative field experiments to investigate the effects of increased temperature, decreased precipitation and increased inundation period associated with rising sea levels on the dominant species in the lower marsh, the perennial grass Spartina spp. and the annual succulent Salicornia veneta. At ambient inundation, the combined effects of increased temperature and decreased precipitation enhanced soil temperature and decreased soil moisture, resulting in an increased number of plants, height and live biomass of S. veneta, as well as greater dead biomass of Spartina spp. compared with current conditions. Increased inundation reduced the soil redox potential, and resulted in losses of both Spartina spp. and S. veneta, but these negative effects were much more pronounced for S. veneta. An inundation tolerance test confirmed that S. veneta is significantly more vulnerable to rapid increases in inundation than Spartina spp. We conclude that at current inundation, the increasing drought conditions in the North Adriatic Sea are favouring the spread of the annual succulent S. veneta. The increasing spread of these succulents could reduce the future capability of the system to respond to projected increasing sea levels, as S. veneta is highly vulnerable to increased inundation. Synthesis. Our results highlight the complex interactions between different components of changing climate. Management strategies for saltmarshes in the Mediterranean and other microtidal locations facing similar changes in climate should focus on maintaining the freshwater and coastal channels free from blockages to ameliorate the effects of episodic drought/heatwave conditions and increasing the sediment supply and preventing coastal squeeze to enhance the resilience of the system to the continuous threat of sea level rise. © 2017 The Authors.

Additionally, voltaic-based batteries are prohibitively expensive for storing the amount of electricity even for a small village. Actually it is a lot cheaper and cleaner to store electricity in water. This study explores how to do that. It features a unique pragmatic research ideology that included a literature review, comparative field research, data collection from the site, along with parametric statistical techniques. Relevant best-practices were cited from the literature and from comparative field research projects. A novel concept was the use of a land fault between lakes in a large park preserve.

By 2050, the total annual emissions for the fifty-two cities will reduce by 407 MMTCO2e (million metric tons), compared with their base period (ranging from 1990 to 2013) emissions, which is equivalent to making the entire state of California, the sixth largest world economy, nearly carbon neutral. Case studies reveal that between 2000 and 2014, California and Sweden grew their Gross Domestic Products (GDPs) by nearly 30% while their CO2e emissions declined by 5% and 24% respectively. Such reductions employ a multitude of action plans, which we place in the context of the Ten Solutions for Carbon Neutrality and Climate Stability published by the University of California. The technologies deployed by the living laboratories include: improving end-use efficiencies; conversion to renewably generated electricity; solving intermittency of solar and wind power with batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen; developing micro-grids for distributed power generation; expanding use of electric vehicles; recycling reform; capturing agricultural/landfill emissions for conversion to gas; and food waste reduction.

As a result, there is an urgent need to accelerate efforts to reduce GHG emissions. In industry, the majority of the current methods of reducing GHG emissions depend on technical enhancements of the facility and equipment. These methods focus on local optimization for carbon emission reduction in enterprises and may require additional time, money and effort for satisfactory implementation. Unlike technical approaches that focus on the equipment, this paper proposes an approach that combines carbon footprint analysis and production planning. The carbon footprint of the entire company's operational process can be analyzed systematically using this approach. Subsequently, carbon emissions can be reduced significantly through production planning and optimization. To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a pharmaceutical enterprise is employed as an example. A production planning model is constructed based on the energy consumption analysis of different units and equipment. Using this model, the carbon emissions of the enterprise can be analyzed, and the corresponding production plan can be developed. To determine the optimal solution, a hybrid discrete particle swarm algorithm is developed and tested based on real data collected from the pharmaceutical enterprise. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed novel approach is effective and carbon emissions of the enterprise can be reduced by an average of 6.77%, or a reduction in CO2 emissions of 610.2 tons per year. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Cleaner production; Energy consumption; Particle swarm algorithm; Production planning","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Equipment; Gas emissions; Optimization; Planning; Pollution control; Production control; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Cleaner production; Energy consumption analysis; Impact on the environment; Particle swarm algorithm; Pharmaceutical enterprise; Production Planning; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024118919

A lack of information on what exactly characterises a HNV farm is a major impediment to the application of policy supports for the conservation of HNVfs. For the first time in Ireland, the diversity of HNV farms and the characteristics that distinguish the different types from one another is described. The typology methodology employed incorporates farm-scale land cover and management data based on a national sample of HNV farms. We identified six HNVf types and describe them here; five correspond to existing broad EU HNVf types and another ‘Aggregate HNVf’, which has not been previously described. There is a clear diversity of HNVf in Ireland and this can be captured and described in a broad typology that includes selected farm structural characteristics, management variables and basic habitat attributes. Similar farm types occurred across geographically disparate parts of Ireland, indicating the need for policy supports that target each of the HNVf types rather than address specific geographic locations. The identification of ‘Aggregate HNVf’ highlights the need for HNVf to be considered at multiple scales and not at farm-scale only. This typology can facilitate better understanding of HNVf at farm-scale for policymakers and farm advisors and thereby aid the development of national policies and measures that better target, support and conserve HNV farmland. The approach developed in this study could be adapted and applied in other European countries or regions to describe the diversity of HNVf from areas with known high HNVf potential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","EU policy; Farmland habitats; Landscape conservation; Rural development","agricultural land; biodiversity; conservation management; European Union; habitat management; landscape planning; policy making; rural development; typology; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021152743

Local emission and regional transport both contribute to PM pollution. Determining the contributions of local emissions vs. regional transport to PM concentrations is crucial in making effective PM control policies. This paper reviews the recent research on the contributions of regional transport to PM pollution in four regions in China, i.e., the northern China, eastern China, southern China, and the western China, respectively. The major findings include (1) HYSPLIT is the most popular methods in studies in all regions and often is used in combination with the CA, PSCF, and CWT techniques to investigate the transport pathways and source origins; (2) during the relatively polluted period, transport contributes over 50% of the PM concentrations in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Chengdu. Regional transport is important for PM pollution in major cities of China; and (3) regional transport exhibits clear seasonal variations and long term trends. The findings have important implication for emission control programs in these regions. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","China; Particulate matter; Pathways; Regional transport; Source areas; Trajectory",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041396427

Variations of seasonal precipitation have important influnces on its landscape patterns and agricultural activities. Based on the monthly and annual precipitation data from 1956 to 2006, the multi-time scales characteristics of seasonal and annual variations of precipitation in the past 50a in the Yuanmou County had been analyzed using Meyer wavelet analysis in this paper. The periodic oscillation of precipitation variation and the points of abrupt change at different time scales along the time series are discovered and the main periods of every serial are confirmed. It was showed that the periodic oscillation of 8-12a and 4-6a for the seasonal and annual precipitation variation are obvious. The time-frequency local change characteristic of Meyer wavelet analysis can demonstrate the fine structures of precipitation and the method provides a new way in analyzing climate multi-time scales characteristics and forecasting short-term climate. The localization characteristics of time -frequency for wavelet analysis can demonstrate the detailed structures of rainfall. The wavelet analysis can be an alternative approach to analyze climate multi-time scales characteristics and forecast short-term climate variations. The research on the regularity of seasonal precipitation variation in the dry-hot valley region has a great guidance meaning to the agriculture production and resilience in flood prevention. © 2017, India Meteorological Department.

In the present work, three ferrocene-modified pyrene-based probes 2–4 were synthesized to act as turn-on fluorescent sensors for Cu2 +. The measurements of fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime reveal that ferrocenyl unit can efficiently reduce the fluorescence emission of pyrene moiety. Steady-state fluorescence measurements find that the three ferrocene-modified fluorophores exhibit selective turn-on responses to Cu2 +. Moreover, this turn-on effect to Cu2 + is highly influenced by the type of the counter ion. It is found that the presence of Cl− or NO3− could realize the turn-on response to Cu2 +, whereas, the presence of SO42 − or Ac− could not induce any fluorescence enhancement to Cu2 +. Control experiments with ferrocene-free pyrene-based probe 1 reveal that the ferrocenyl unit plays the key role in the turn-on response to Cu2 +. The possible mechanism for the turn-on responses is attributed to the oxidation behavior of Cu2 + to the ferrocene unit, which is confirmed by the control experiments with sodium ascorbate. Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that Cu2 + can influence the redox behaviors of ferrocenyl derivatives, which is also highly dependent on the anion of the copper salts. The influence of anion on the turn-on responses to Cu2 + was further used for anion detection and fluorescent logic gate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anion; Copper salts; Ferrocene; Fluorescent sensor; Pyrene","Copper; Cyclic voltammetry; Fluorescence; Fluorophores; Metal ions; Metals; Negative ions; Organometallics; Probes; Pyrene; Salts; Copper salt; Detection and identifications; Ferrocenes; Fluorescence enhancement; Fluorescence quantum yield; Fluorescent sensors; Steady state fluorescences; Voltammetry measurements; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018972582

In order to reconstruct Holocene peatland, vegetation and climate changes on eastern Tibetan Plateau, we conducted analyses of fossil pollen, loss-on-ignition, and carbon accumulation rate on one peat core from Zoige Basin. Our results show local peatland initiated at 10.3 ka, thrived in the early-mid Holocene, and then began to degrade. Throughout the Holocene, Zoige Basin was dominated by alpine meadow. Coniferous forest on montane regions expanded for several times during 10.5–4.6 ka, and then dramatically retreated. Results of peatland property, principal component analysis on fossil pollen suggested the climate maintained warm/wet during 10–5.5 ka, and became relatively cold/dry in the late Holocene. Rapid degradation of peatland, retreat of coniferous forest and climatic drought/cooling occurred at 10.2–10, 9.7–9.5, 8.7–8.5, 7.7–7.4, 6.4–6, 5.5–5.2, 4.8–4.5, 4–3.6, 3.1–2.7, 1.4–1.2 and 0.8–0.6 ka. The long-term variations of Holocene climate and vegetation on eastern Tibetan Plateau could be attributed to changes in insolation-driven temperature and Asian Summer Monsoon intensity, while those rapid centennial changes were probably triggered by abrupt monsoon failures and temperature anomalies in the high northern latitudes. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Climate change; Fossil pollen; Holocene; Peatland; Tibetan Plateau","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon; Financial data processing; Forestry; Peat; Principal component analysis; Vegetation; Wetlands; Asian summer monsoons; Carbon accumulation; Eastern Tibetan plateau; Fossil pollens; Holocenes; Peatland; Peatland development; Tibetan Plateau; Climate change; climate variation; fossil record; Holocene; monsoon; paleoclimate; peatland; pollen; summer; vegetation dynamics; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Zoige Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027513325

In addition to many critical lands that were left barren, different cases have shown that land clearance to satisfy food production and increase income has often used quick and cheap methods. These human-driven activities have become terrifying images of climate change. Various analyses have indicated that socio-economic circumstances are generally more important considerations in designing effective conservation methods for households faced with the primary need to survive and satisfy basic needs. These reinforced that sustainable development must focus on the power of local people to manage the environment on which they depend. Using the Bangkalan Madura region of East Java and peat swamp areas of four provinces in Indonesia as examples, this chapter discusses the drivers behind the successful implementation of a community empowerment model in responding to climate change and at the same time developing livelihood strategies for food, energy and water security as well as improving economic welfare by enhancing resource use efficiency. The presence of high social capital of Bangkalan community and readily available free agricultural inputs in the peatland provinces were also significant factors. This chapter concludes that the low resource use and high yield concept in empowerment programme is the key success to an effective climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as enhancing community livelihood. This chapter also highlights the need of policy shift, the sustainability and scalability of the programme. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

Application of waste-to-energy technology to produce electricity can reduce waste accumulation in landfills in addition to lessening the GHG emissions. This study aimed to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions from application of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) as waste-to-energy technology using refuse-derived fuel (RDF), which is produced from municipal solid waste, according to the life cycle assessment approach. The functional unit is defined as 1 kWh. The results indicate that the GHG emissions of 1 kWh of power generated from a RDF hybrid with an ORC power generation system are mostly contributed from RDF combustion in the operation stage, which accounts for 77% of the total. The RDF hybrid ORC shows fewer GHG emissions than the existing combustion-based power generation in Thailand, except for natural gas with the combined-cycle technology. The RDF hybrid ORC power generation can reduce 51.47% of GHG emissions when compared with an open dump, and 34.31% when compared with a landfill. The RDF hybrid ORC was also demonstrated as an environmentally friendly system that can be considered as a source of power generation in power planning in the future. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Combustion; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Life cycle; Population statistics; Rankine cycle; Refuse derived fuels; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Combined cycle technology; Environmentally friendly systems; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Organic Rankine cycles; Power generation systems; Waste to energy technologies; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031287001

TTSP can handle multiple uncertainties expressed as type-2 fuzzy sets, random variables and interval values; it can also provide an effective linkage between the pre-regulated energy and environmental policies as well as the associated economic implication. The TTSP method is then applied to planning energy system of Shanghai through introducing carbon emission trading (CET) and green certificate (GC) schemes. The solutions obtained can help generate energy-supply and electricity-generation schemes under different carbon trading ratios and various development plans of renewable energy. Results reveal that (i) the city's future energy structure would transit to the clean-production pattern on the basis of CET and GC policies; (ii) replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources (i.e. wind and photovoltaic power) can effectively facilitate reducing the emissions of pollutants (e.g., SO2, NOx and PM) and greenhouse gas (e.g., CO2).

The analysis finds no evidence to justify delaying climate action in the name of reducing technological costs. Even without considering social and environmental damage costs, delaying aggressive climate action does not reduce CO2 abatement costs even under the most optimistic trajectories for improvements in fuel efficiencies, demand, and technology costs in the U.S. auto and electric sectors. In fact, the abatement cost for both sectors is found to increase sharply with every year of delay beyond 2020. When further considering reasonable limits to technology turnover, retirements, and new capacity additions, these costs would be higher, and the feasible time frame for initiating successful climate action on the 70% by 2050 target would be shorter, perhaps having passed already. The analysis also reveals that optimistic business-as-usual scenarios in the U.S. will, conservatively, release 79-108 billion metric tons of CO2.

With a synoptic climatological approach, the synoptic-scale patterns conducive to lake-effect snowfall are identified for the eastern Great Lakes region during the November–March seasons of 1950–2009. Seven synoptic types identified as lake effect are combined with daily snowfall observations to examine the role of individual synoptic types on seasonal snowfall. The types exhibit a wide range of surface and 850 hPa temperatures and winds, sea-level pressures, snowfall intensities, and inter-annual frequencies. These factors result in substantial differences in the location and magnitude of seasonal lake-effect snowfall. Recent research has revealed that snowfall within portions of the Great Lakes region subject to lake-effect snow has undergone a trend reversal, declining in recent decades. Examining the inter-annual frequency of the seven lake-effect synoptic types, a majority of types increased in frequency prior to 1980, before becoming less frequent thereafter. The variability in frequency of lake-effect synoptic types can partially be explained by relationships to large-scale atmospheric and oceanic modes of variability.

In particular it remains unclear how MSPs can support the transition from agenda setting to implementation in response to multiple current and future pressures threatening the resilience of cities. Through the lens of the London Climate Change Partnership (LCCP) and drawing from other MSP examples, this paper investigates the scope for MSPs to enhance climate adaptation in an urban context. Our paper has two main aims: to expand understanding of the role of MSPs in the adaptation decision process in the context of the wider governance literature, and to shed some light on the complexities of transitioning through that process. To clarify the role of a MSP we propose a distinction between “first generation” and “second generation” MSPs, illustrating the progression from agenda-setting to implementation: “first generation” MSPs are focused on agenda setting and knowledge sharing in order to support decision makers, while “second generation” MSPs are aimed at implementing solutions. We consider this distinction from the perspective of the individual members and their perceptions, motivations, and expectations. We find that the dynamic nature of urban adaptation with a shifting focus from initial agenda setting toward the implementation of actions presents challenges for existing MSPs, particularly such long-established ones like the LCCP. Our investigation shows that “first generation” MSPs can play important roles in agenda setting, but finds little evidence of “second generation” MSPs achieving implementation. © 2017 The Authors.","climate adaptation; climate risks; multi-sectoral partnerships; urban risk governance","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision analysis; decision making; global climate; governance approach; partnership approach; risk assessment; urban area; urban climate; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033678104

Here, the case of maize seeds in Malawi provides new insights into some of the implications of this orientation. Malawi presents a context where market liberalization coupled with a national input subsidy programme has led to the growth of corporate power within the formal maize seed system and a strong reliance upon commercial providers to breed, multiply and diffuse new cultivars. At both the local and national levels, facets of this market-orientation mean that poverty reduction and climate change adaptation goals may not be met. In order to address these potential shortcomings, multiple measures are required. Institutions are needed to oversee the coordination of appropriate breeding and marketing efforts by corporate actors within the formal seed system; research programmes are required which can enhance understandings of genetic evolution within farmer-saved varieties and its implications for climate resilience; and policies must be carefully implemented which can support market participation by the poorest. © The Author(s) 2017.","Agricultural technology; Climate change adaptation; Poverty reduction; Seed systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054785207

We find that crofters are similar to other livestock farmers, both inside and outside of the traditional crofting counties, in terms of age, years of involvement in the holding and percentage of identified successors, but are less likely to own their holdings or to operate them for profit. Crofters reported being more subsidy dependent than other livestock producers, and many appear likely to retreat from crofting in the event of substantive subsidy reductions. However, crofting respondents identified input costs, regulations, commodity prices and climate change as having had greater influence on how they manage their crofts than the 2005 transition to the ‘Single Farm Payment’. Overall, crofters reported making fewer changes than their counterparts in non-crofting counties, but similar levels to those of other livestock farmers within crofting counties, suggesting less ‘room for manoeuvre’ within the remote areas in which most crofts are located. However, there is some evidence that ‘active’ crofts are ‘bouncing forward’ in response to recent challenges, particularly into forestry and agri-tourism, also reporting significantly higher perceived economic prospects. © 2017 Royal Scottish Geographical Society.","adaptation; CAP reform; smallholding","adaptive management; Common Agricultural Policy; livestock farming; reform process; smallholder; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026232349

Electrocatalysts are vital to these devices that perform water electrolysis, CO2 electrochemical reduction, and fuel cell reactions, but they are often based on expensive and scarce platinum group metals (PGMs). In this Perspective, we summarize the potential applications of low-cost transition metal carbides (TMCs) to optimize hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions, oxygen evolution/reduction reactions, CO2 electrochemical reduction, and alcohol oxidation reactions. The most recent advances in understanding the activity and stability of TMC electrocatalysts for each reaction are highlighted. Promising research directions are provided for both fundamental studies on model surfaces and the development of industrially relevant high-surface-area electrocatalysts. The potential applications of TMCs are presented within the context of the global energy trends that are currently driving the growth of energy storage and conversion devices. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) are considered promising electrocatalyst support materials for energy storage and conversion devices that will reduce the cost of platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the ability to tune adsorbate binding energies using TMCs, which can optimize reactivity for several electrochemical reactions. Metal-modified TMCs have recently been synthesized as industrially relevant, high-surface-area core-shell nanoparticles that offer enhanced activity and reduced PGM loading compared with state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Further TMC research should focus on (1) combining DFT and model-surface experiments to identify the most active and cost-effective electrocatalysts for various reactions and (2) developing low-cost synthesis techniques for large-scale metal-modified TMC core-shell nanoparticle production. Supporting platinum group metal electrocatalysts on transition metal carbides reduces Pt loading and optimizes activity and stability for electrochemical reactions. This could enable energy storage and conversion devices to support rapid global solar energy growth. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","electrocatalysis; electrochemical CO2 conversion; energy storage and conversion; transition metal carbides","Binding energy; Carbides; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Density functional theory; Economic geology; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrolysis; Electrolytic reduction; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanoparticles; Platinum; Platinum metals; Reduction; Shells (structures); Solar energy; Storage (materials); Synthesis (chemical); Transition metals; Core-shell nanoparticles; Electrocatalyst support; Electrochemical reactions; Electrochemical reductions; Energy storage and conversions; Platinum group metals; Synthesis techniques; Transition metal carbide; Electrocatalysts; carbon; carbon dioxide; catalyst; electrochemistry; electrokinesis; energy storage; metal; transition element",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031759150

Short of legal obligations, we discuss the effectiveness and moral legitimacy of voluntary approaches based on naming and shaming. We argue that effectiveness and legitimacy are closely tied together; as voluntary approaches are the only alternative to legally imposed duties, they are most morally defensible particularly if they would be the most effective in reducing the harmful greenhouse gases. Shaming could be made effective if states could prompt more corporations to accept voluntary cuts with high gains—such as public acknowledgements—and high losses, such as reporting on noncompliance and public exposure (naming), along with some kind of condemnation (shaming). An important challenge of such voluntary approaches is how to ensure compliance with the agreed upon commitments, while avoiding greenwashing or selective disclosure. Certain institutional arrangements are inevitable, including an independent measurement, monitoring and verification mechanism. In this paper, we discuss the potentials and ethical pitfalls of shaming as a strategy when corporations have a direct relationship with consumers, but also when they are in a relationship with governments and other corporations. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climate change; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; INDC; Multinational corporations; Naming and shaming","climate; climate change; commercial phenomena; cooperation; government; greenhouse gas; human; interpersonal communication; morality; organization; shame; social psychology; voluntary program; Climate; Climate Change; Commerce; Cooperative Behavior; Disclosure; Government; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Morals; Organizations; Shame; Social Values; Voluntary Programs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017414991

This PCC combustion process markedly reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the high-output region while maintaining high levels of thermal efficiency and power. On the other hand, as burning lean mixture of fuel and air is the conventional way to improve thermal efficiency and reduce NOx, a high λ premixed mixture of hydrogen and air formed by injecting hydrogen in the early stage of the compression stroke has been used in direct-injection hydrogen engines. It was recently reported, however, that this mixture condition does not always offer expected improved thermal efficiency under even lean mixture conditions by increasing unburned hydrogen emissions caused by incomplete flame propagation in the non-uniform and extremely lean portion of the mixture. In this study, the effect of retarding the injection timing to late in the compression stroke but slightly advanced from original PCC was examined as a way of reducing unburned hydrogen emissions and improving thermal efficiency. These effects result from a centroidal axially stratified mixture that positions a fairly rich charge near the spark plug. This stratified mixture is presumably effective in reducing incomplete flame propagation thought to be the cause of unburned hydrogen emissions and also promoting increasing burning velocity of the mixture that improve thermal efficiency. Finally, this research is characterized by measuring the hydrogen fuel concentration at the point and the time of spark ignition quantitatively by spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy in order to identify the changes in mixture ratio mentioned above caused by the parameters involved. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Efficiency; Hydrogen direct injection; Hydrogen engine; Spark ignition engine; Spark plasma; Spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy","Air engines; Combustion; Efficiency; Engines; Fuels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen engines; Ignition; Internal combustion engines; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Breakdown spectroscopy; Combustion pro-cess; Fuel concentration; High-pressure direct injection; Improved thermal efficiencies; Spark plasma; Stratified mixtures; Thermal efficiency; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029584812

In line with this commitment, in 2011 the Hungarian Ministry of National Development has announced the publication of the final version of the Hungarian Renewable Energy Utilization Action Plan (or National Renewable Action Plan--NREAP) for the period between 2010 and 2020. The goal of the NREAP was to guarantee maximal total social recovery by building on the environmental, economical, social, cultural and geopolitical potential of Hungary. However, as the European Commission has also highlighted in 2013, a change of the attitude is needed in many European countries to foster developments in order to achieve the previously undertaken targets. This situation encouraged the joint work of the Hungarian Ministry of National Development and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences which prepared a revision of the NREAP in order to determine future scenarios to utilize the country's renewable energy potential as efficiently as possible and to reach the 2020 targets. The manuscript presents the continuation of the study, prepared in 2014, focusing on the optimal use of solar energy resources. The aim of the chapter was to achieve maximal possible solar primary energy gain by deploying of either solar photovoltaics or solar collectors on the building stock on the country. Since only 1-2% of the stock is exchanged annually, it is very important to increase the energy efficiency of the existing buildings. The study shows that the building sector is able to deliver large energy consumption and CO2 reduction at low costs. The methodology is based on two main database, the building typology from the EPBD-based (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2002/91/EC) Hungary Building Energy Strategy, and the LAU-1 (Local Administrative Units, previous NUTS-4) level solar energy potential assessment, both partly created by the authors. Additionally, statistical data on infrastructure, provided by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, were used to support the decision making process. The study examines possible maximal solar primary energy gain, the ratio of domestic hot water and electricity needs and possible energy generation on a monthly basis. This chapter provides a methodology and an example, how countries can select the best solutions to benefit the most of their solar resources at low costs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

These changes can alter interception, evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration, soil moisture, water balance, and biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements. The need to evaluate the combined effect of land use change and CC of watershed systems is a focus of this study. We simulated watershed processes in the SuAsCo River watershed in MA, USA, using a calibrated and validated Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran model. Climatic scenarios included downscaled regional projections from Global Climate Model models. The Land Transformation Model was used to project land use. Combined change in land cover and climate reduce ET with loss of vegetation. Changes in climate and land cover increase surface runoff significantly by 2100 as well as stream discharge. Combined change in land cover and climate cause 10% increase in peak volume with 7% increase in precipitation and 75% increase in effective impervious area. Climate and land use changes can intensify the water cycle and introduce seasonal changes in watershed systems. Understanding dynamic changes in watershed systems is critical for mitigation and adaptation options. We propose restoration strategies that can increase the resilience of watershed systems. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Climate change; Hydrologic processes; Land use/land cover change; Stormwater; Watershed systems","Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Climate models; Forestry; Land use; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Biogeochemical cycling; Biogeochemical process; Effective impervious area; Hydrologic process; Hydrological simulation program - fortrans; Land use/land cover change; Restoration strategies; Stormwaters; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; discharge; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; precipitation (climatology); runoff; stormwater; watershed; Massachusetts; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029045208

All European and National roads in Norway and Sweden have been included assuming different degrees of electrification in terms fraction of the road length with ERS, prioritizing high traffic roads. The results show similar effect from ERS in Norway and Sweden. Implementing ERS on 25% of the busiest European and National road length in both countries is enough to result in an electrification of approximately 70% of the vehicle kilometres on these roads and 35% of the total vehicle kilometres on all roads. An ERS on all European and National roads will include 60 and 70% of the vehicle kilometres and CO2 emissions from all heavy traffic in Norway and Sweden, respectively. The results also show that aiming to electrify more than 50% of the light vehicles with ERS implies that also county roads and private roads need to be included.

Here, filter-contained urban updraft tower (FUUT) is proposed to be an approach to govern the air pollution and generate electricity. Due to buoyancy with the help of urban heat island (UHI), the air with air pollution can flow into the tower, and the air pollution mainly being particulate matters less than 10 µm in diameter (PM10) is then intercepted by the filter. FUUTs are assumed to be introduced in the typical metropolitan city in China, i.e., Beijing in 2012, and then the methods to predict the performance and estimate the health and economic benefits are established. Under these conditions, the design value of air velocity in FUUT is 5.00 m/s. The initial yearly mean PM10 concentration is 109 µg/m3, and the reduction is 6.72 µg/m3 in the first year brought by one FUUT, which contributes to the reduction in premature mortality to 227.8 and in respiratory hospital admissions to 1051.9 and the equivalent economic benefits estimated to be 211.48 million RMB yuan in total.

In this study, the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University/National Centre for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model and Community Multiscale Air Quality model system was applied to conduct two sets of modelling analyses of the period from July 20 to September 20, 2008, to illustrate the influences of emission reduction measures on regional photochemical pollution over northern China during the Beijing Olympics. The results indicated that the implementation of emission control measures decreased the concentrations of ozone (O3) precursors, namely nitrogen oxide (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), throughout the boundary layer. The concentrations of these compounds were reduced by 45% in the central urban area of Beijing at the ground level. Although the average O3 concentration in the central urban area increased by more than 8 ppbv, the total oxidant concentration decreased significantly by more than 5 ppbv. Greater O3 concentrations mainly occurred during periods with weak photochemical reactions. During periods of strong photochemical production, the O3 concentration decreased significantly due to a weakening vertical circulation between the lower and upper boundary layer. Consequently, the number of days when the O3 concentration exceeded 100 ppbv decreased by 25% in Beijing. The emission control measures altered the sensitivity of the regional O3 production. The coordinated control region of NOx and VOCs expanded, and the control region of VOCs decreased in size. The reduction of non-point-source emissions, such as fugitive VOCs and vehicles, was more useful for controlling regional photochemical pollution over northern China. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CMAQ; Emission control measures; Integrated process rate","Air quality; Boundary layers; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Pollution; Volatile organic compounds; CMAQ; Community multi-scale air quality models; Emission control measures; Oxidant concentrations; Pennsylvania State University; Photochemical pollution; Photochemical production; Vertical circulation; Air pollution; air quality; boundary layer; concentration (composition); emission control; modeling; nitrogen oxides; Olympic Games; ozone; volatile organic compound; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017458723

Data were collected from 100 randomly selected participants from three villages of Kurigram district through questionnaire survey and focus group discussions. The gender vulnerability index was used to measure the extent of vulnerability and the factors influencing vulnerability. The results show that 72.2 per cent are highly vulnerable with females being almost more than twice as vulnerable as males. The analysis indicates that the amount of land, difficulty in bathing when the basic bathroom structure was destroyed and use of borrowed money were the main determinants of gender vulnerability in changing climatic conditions.

But most of the total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation plans crafted to meet water quality standards in the USA are developed assuming stationary climate and at best a small number of land use futures, although neither assumption seems reliably justified. To address this challenge, this study employs robust decision making (RDM) methods, commonly used to help develop water supply plans, to stress test the proposed Enhanced Watershed Management Plan (EWMP), a TMDL implementation plan, for the Tujunga Wash, the largest subwatershed of the Los Angeles River, over a wide range of climate and land use futures. We find that climate change could significantly reduce the ability of the Tujunga EWMP to meet water quality goals; however, meeting the city’s goals for increasing permeable land cover offsets the risk of non-compliance in the face of climate change uncertainties. This study also introduces innovations in RDM analyses, including: treatment of the deeply uncertain incidence of extreme precipitation events, an explicit link between RDM scenario discovery methods and the specification of signposts for adaptive policy pathways, and the use of (imprecise) probabilistic climate projections to inform the choice among robust adaptive policy pathways.

In order to utilize these emitters, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of their atomic structure and the associated excitation processes that give rise to this single photon emission. Here, we performed density-functional theory (DFT) and constrained DFT calculations for a range of hBN point defects in order to identify potential emission candidates. By applying a number of criteria on the electronic structure of the ground state and the atomic structure of the excited states of the considered defects, and then calculating the Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, we found that the CBVN defect, in which a carbon atom substitutes a boron atom and the opposite nitrogen atom is removed, is a potential emission source with a HR factor of 1.66, in good agreement with the experimental HR factor. We calculated the photoluminescence (PL) line shape for this defect and found that it reproduces a number of key features in the experimental PL lineshape. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atoms; Calculations; Carbon; Defects; Electronic structure; Excited states; Ground state; Particle beams; Photons; Point defects; DFT calculation; Emission sources; Excitation process; First-principles investigations; Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN); Quantum photonics; Single photon emission; Single photon emitters; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029828458

The Chihuahuan bioregion, which is the largest desert in North America, exhibits high biodiversity and important cultural significance for parts of Mexico and the United States. With low levels of development, the Big Bend region is a relatively unmodified ecosystem, which makes it a good representative landscape to study desert ecosystem services. We found that this region has $504 (2015 USD) of annual value per hectare ($1.61 billion for entire study area), with raw materials, climate regulation, ornamental services, and cultural services contributing the most value. This estimate is markedly lower than published values for other terrestrial biomes, which is not surprising considering deserts are low productivity environments. However, given the size of the Chihuahuan Desert, the ecosystem services value for the entire bioregion is likely considerable. The Chihuahuan Desert is facing numerous threats, including energy development and overuse of natural resources. Projected growth in oil, gas, and wind energy could further degrade the services provided by this region. The relatively low ecosystem services values for this desert environment also indicate that the widespread desertification occurring globally is causing large decreases in ecosystem services across many landscapes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Big Bend; Chihuahuan Desert; Deserts; Ecosystem services",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026828196

The relevant spectral features of the optical centers (emission peaks at 593.5, 620.3, 630.7, and 646.7 nm) are attributed to Sn-related defects through the correlation of their photoluminescence (PL) intensity with the implantation fluence. Single Sn-related defects were identified and characterized through the acquisition of their second-order autocorrelation emission functions, by means of Hanbury-Brown and Twiss interferometry. The investigation of their single-photon emission regime as a function of excitation laser power revealed that Sn-related defects are based on three-level systems with a 6 ns radiative decay lifetime. In a fraction of the studied centers, the observation of a blinking PL emission is indicative of the existence of a dark state. Furthermore, absorption dependence on the polarization of the excitation radiation with ∼45% contrast was measured. This work shed light on the existence of a new optical center associated with a group-IV impurity in diamond, with similar photophysical properties to the already well-known Si-V and Ge-V emitters, thus, providing results of interest from both the fundamental and applicative points of view. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","color centers; diamond; ion implantation; single-photon; tin","Color centers; Crystal impurities; Defects; Diamonds; Fabrication; Germanium; Ion implantation; Laser excitation; Optical correlation; Photons; Single crystals; Tin; Excitation radiation; Implantation fluence; Photoluminescence intensities; Photophysical properties; Single crystal diamond; Single photon emission; Single photons; Three level systems; Particle beams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031705976

Efficient and accurate numerical methods must be applied to two-phase flow mathematical models that are just as accurate if such process facilities and equipment are to be properly designed and simulated. This problem has been currently tackled by means of one-dimensional simulations based predominantly on Two-Fluid (Separated) and Drift-Flux (Mixture) Models, although simpler methods which are based on the assumption of homogeneous flow are also seen to persist. Given this context, the goals of the present study are twofold. In order to improve and consolidate the model selection process, Differential- Algebraic Equations (DAE) numerical techniques were combined with the steady-state mass and momentum conservation equations of the Two-Fluid, Drift-Flux and Homogeneous models, and also with numerous constitutive equations for relevant quantities such as drag coefficients and specific interfacial area, in the reproduction of experimental void fraction and pressure drop data comprising the most important flow regimes as well as the entire range of inclination angles between upward and downward orientations. In this assessment of experimental data reproducibility, most accurate predictions were obtained with the Drift-Flux Model, thus making that approach even more attractive given its simpler formulation as compared to the Two-Fluid Model. Subsequently, extension of the DAE numerical approach to dynamic two-phase flow simulations is demonstrated. The proposed technique was applied to a test case of a multicomponent hydrocarbon transient two-phase flow including mass and heat transfer. This scenario was successfully investigated by means of dynamic simulations based on the Two-Fluid and Drift-Flux models, both including rigorous calculations of flash and thermophysical and transport properties as well as truncation error estimates for stepsize selection. Such results are expected to encourage the application of DAE numerical methods to both steady and unsteady-state one-dimensional two-phase flow calculations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Drift-Flux Model; Two-Fluid Model; Two-phase flow",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041424256

In this case, it is a question how to define an energy benchmarking model with fairness and comparability. To alleviate this problem, this paper, taking the budget (limited service) hotel as an example, develops an energy benchmarking model with composite indicator. At first an energy efficiency indicator is defined as EEUI (Equivalent Energy Use Intensity), which is indicated by energy consumption of unit hotel characteristics. The hotel characteristics involve both the business characteristics and energy use characteristics. The proposed energy benchmarking model is expressed by the weighted sum of major factors impacting on energy use, where EEUI is regarded as the dependent variable while the major factors are regarded as the independent variables. The coefficients of the independent variables are determined by the optimization model built in this paper. In the optimization model, the benchmark value of EUI (energy use intensity) provided by the nation or hotel industry is used as the benchmarking target. Finally the proposed energy benchmarking model is tested on the budget hotels. The purpose of this paper is to provide a simple energy benchmarking model with fairness and comparability to support the macro planning and management of energy saving and emission reduction urgently required by the hotel industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Composite indicator; Energy benchmarking; Energy consumption and operating income; Genetic algorithm; Hotel; Optimization model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029577370

Reverse current transport modes of several types were observed depending on the bias voltage range: thermionic emission (TE) associated with the image force barrier lowering was dominant in the lower voltage range of &lt;50 V, whereas thermionic-field emission (TFE) mechanism governed transport in the higher voltage range. The Schottky barrier height φb estimated from the reverse characteristics was lower than that obtained from the forward characteristic by more than 0.4 eV, which indicates that the low Schottky barrier height φblow area localized in the patch shape at the diamond Schottky contact. This Schottky contact inhomogeneity was found to increase the reverse current effectively even though the φblow area is smaller because the reverse current in TE mode flows preferentially through φblow patches. The current transport mode changed from TE to TFE when the maximum electric field was &gt;1 MV cm-1, which indicates that a strong electric field concentration exists at the Schottky electrode fringe. When the high reverse voltage was biased, a sudden current increase occurred, followed by a permanent increase of reverse current, indicating that mid-gap defects were formed at the interface. These results indicate that reverse current and electric-field breakdown have different origins. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Bias voltage; Diamonds; Electric fields; Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconductor metal boundaries; Thermionic emission; Transportation; Different origins; Maximum electric field; Reverse characteristics; Schottky barrier heights; Schottky contacts; Schottky electrodes; Strong electric fields; Thermionic field emission; Power semiconductor diodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031785698

Here we investigate the chemical signature of the plankton-dominated fraction of particulate organic matter (POM) collected along the Siberian Shelf. POM (&gt; 10μm) samples were analysed using molecular biomarkers (CuO oxidation and IP25) and dual-carbon isotopes (δ13C and Δ14C). In addition, surface water chemical properties were integrated with the POM (&lt; 10μm) dataset to understand the link between plankton composition and environmental conditions. ä13C and 114C exhibited a large variability in the POM (&lt; 10μm) distribution while the content of terrestrial biomarkers in the POM was negligible. In the Laptev Sea (LS), (δ13C and Δ14C) of POM (&lt; 10μm) suggested a heterotrophic environment in which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the Lena River was the primary source of metabolisable carbon. Within the Lena plume, terrestrial DOC probably became part of the food web via bacteria uptake and subsequently transferred to relatively other heterotrophic communities (e.g. dinoflagellates). Moving eastwards toward the sea-ice-dominated East Siberian Sea (ESS), the system became progressively more autotrophic. Comparison between δ13C of POM (&lt; 10μm) samples and CO2aq concentrations revealed that the carbon isotope fractionation increased moving towards the easternmost and most productive stations. In a warming scenario characterised by enhanced terrestrial DOC release (thawing permafrost) and progressive sea ice decline, heterotrophic conditions might persist in the LS while the nutrient-rich Pacific inflow will likely stimulate greater primary productivity in the ESS. The contrasting trophic conditions will result in a sharp gradient in δ13C between the LS and ESS, similar to what is documented in our semi-synoptic study. © 2017 Author(s).",,"biomarker; carbon isotope; data set; dissolved organic carbon; food web; geochemistry; isotopic fractionation; particulate organic matter; permafrost; phytoplankton; primary production; suspended particulate matter; trophic conditions; Arctic Ocean; East Siberian Sea; Laptev Sea; Lena River; Russian Federation; Siberian Shelf; Dinophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029584859

In spite of the heterogeneity of cold-adapted species, two main contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain their responses to Late Quaternary glacial cycles, namely, the interglacial contraction versus the interglacial expansion hypotheses. Here, we use the coldadapted plant Primula farinosa to test two demographic models under each of the two alternative hypotheses and a fifth, null model.We first approximate the time and extent of demographic contractions and expansions during the Late Quaternary by projecting species distribution models across the last 72 ka.We also generate genome-wide sequence data using a Reduced Representation Library approach to reconstruct the spatial structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of lineages within P. farinosa. Finally, by integrating the results of climatic and genomic analyses in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework, we propose the most likely model for the extent and direction of population-size changes in P. farinosa through the Late Quaternary. Our results support the interglacial expansion of P. farinosa, differing from the prevailing paradigm that the observed distribution of cold-adapted species currently fragmented in high altitude and latitude regions reflects the consequences of postglacial contraction processes. © The Author(s) 2017.","Approximate Bayesian computation; climate change; hindcasting; Late Quaternary glacial cycles; paleoclimate; Reduced Representation Library; species distribution models","adaptation; Bayes theorem; climate; cold; genetic variation; genetics; ice cover; phylogeny; physiology; plant genome; Primula; Adaptation, Physiological; Bayes Theorem; Climate; Cold Temperature; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Ice Cover; Phylogeny; Primula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032036275

Creating and mobilizing AC is a continuous process that requires social learning (SL). Although rich with empirical cases, the literature theorizing and empirically investigating the relationship between AC and SL is highly fragmented. This paper aims to critically examine the peer-reviewed literature that focusses on SL and AC in the context of climate change adaptation (CCA). Special attention is paid to the interplay between the two. Understanding this interplay can help improve our understanding of how CCA takes place in practice and advances theoretical debates on CCA. Systematic review methods are used to analyse 43 papers (1997–2016). Our findings reveal three perspectives that each play an important role in different contexts: an AC-focused perspective, a SL-focused perspective, and a hybrid perspective. These differences in conceptualizations of the relationship between SL and AC may seem trivial at first, but they have consequences for the design of learning-based interventions aimed at helping communities respond to climate change. It appears that such interventions need to be preceded by an analysis of the climate change context in order to decide whether to emphasize AC, SL or both simultaneously. © 2017 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences","Adaptive capacity; Climate change adaptation; Interplay; Social learning; Systematic review","adaptive management; capacity building; climate change; conceptual framework; empirical analysis; learning; literature review; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020441044

Localized sources of both trace gases can create strong local gradients in its columnar abundance, which can be discerned using absorption spectroscopy at high spatial resolution. In a previous study, more than 250 methane plumes were observed in the San Juan Basin near Four Corners during April 2015 using the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) and a linearized matched filter. For the first time, we apply the iterative maximum a posteriori differential optical absorption spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) method to AVIRIS-NG data and generate gas concentration maps for methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor plumes. This demonstrates a comprehensive greenhouse gas monitoring capability that targets methane and carbon dioxide, the two dominant anthropogenic climate-forcing agents. Water vapor results indicate the ability of these retrievals to distinguish between methane and water vapor despite spectral interference in the shortwave infrared. We focus on selected cases from anthropogenic and natural sources, including emissions from mine ventilation shafts, a gas processing plant, tank, pipeline leak, and natural seep. In addition, carbon dioxide emissions were mapped from the flue-gas stacks of two coal-fired power plants and a water vapor plume was observed from the combined sources of cooling towers and cooling ponds. Observed plumes were consistent with known and suspected emission sources verified by the true color AVIRIS-NG scenes and higher-resolution Google Earth imagery. Real-time detection and geolocation of methane plumes by AVIRIS-NG provided unambiguous identification of individual emission source locations and communication to a ground team for rapid follow-up. This permitted verification of a number of methane emission sources using a thermal camera, including a tank and buried natural gas pipeline. © Author(s) 2017.",,"airborne sensing; atmospheric plume; atmospheric pollution; AVIRIS; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); cooling; greenhouse gas; methane; natural gas; pipeline; pollutant source; spatial resolution; ventilation; water vapor; San Juan Basin [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031904456

Measurements of grain size, magnetic susceptibility (MS), total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), atomic TOC/TN (C/N) and carbonate content were conducted in order to reconstruct the climate since ∼3700 cal a BP. In addition to a regional drying trend in the late Holocene, closely related to the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), four distinct climatic stages can be identified. (i) From 3700 to 2909 cal a BP, a semi-arid and cool climate dominated the lake area, with a transitory climatic amelioration from 3300 to 3150 cal a BP. (ii) The interval from 2909 to 2589 cal a BP was characterized by a rising temperature and the recovery from drought. (iii) From 2589 to 1903 cal a BP, drought conditions were renewed and significantly intensified in a cold environment. (iv) After 1903 cal a BP, a warm climate with severe evaporation accelerated the shrinking of Qrdin Nuur. A comparison of our results with other paleoclimatic records, mainly from southern Inner Mongolia, reveals similar climatic trends and highlights the asynchronous nature of the regional climatic transition to increased aridity, which was reflected by the activation of the Otindag sandy land and by the dominance of steppe landscapes. Several multi-centennial temperature oscillations are recognized over the last two millennia, as inferred from fluctuations in TIC and carbonate content. We correlate the warm interval from 853 to 560 cal a BP (1097–1390 AD) with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), and the consequent cold interval from 560 to 128 cal a BP (1390–1822 AD) with the Little Ice Age (LIA). Furthermore, the climatic reconstruction shows that the lake area was generally drier during the LIA than in the MWP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","East Asian monsoonal region; Lacustrine sedimentary sequence; Late Holocene; Paleoclimate","climate variation; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; monsoon; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; sedimentary sequence; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014059051

This paper determines the potential impact of the REDD+ program on poverty reduction by comparing income and poverty rate between two household groups that were willing to participate in this study, but that will not participate in the REDD+. The results showed that carbon payment from forests is a significant contributor to the increase in household income of poor people. The average income of households participating in the program is VND 20.68 million in contrast to those not participating whose average income is VND 14.72 million. Results showed that the REDD+ program intervention helped reduce the poverty rate in the two communes by 6.40% (from 39.4% to 33%). The paper recommends that the REDD+ program should facilitate the distribution of land titles to provide security of tenure for individual households that are participating in the program. While the program can contribute to poverty reduction, the program payments can increase income inequality and conflicts between those involved and those not involved in the program and legal ownership of the lands. In addition, a comprehensive research study on the impact of the program on forest conservation and poverty reduction is necessary. Stakeholders of the program should recognize and acknowledge the trade-offs between conservation and economic development or poverty reduction.

However, few studies have considered the local scale of urban forests to effectively evaluate their potential long-term carbon offset. The lack of precise, consistent and up-to-date forest details is challenging for long-term prognoses. Therefore, this review aims to identify uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset assessment and discuss the extent to which such uncertainties can be reduced by recent progress in high resolution remote sensing. We do this by performing an extensive literature review and a case study combining remote sensing and life cycle assessment of urban forest carbon offset in Berlin, Germany. Main text: Recent progress in high resolution remote sensing and methods is adequate for delivering more precise details on the urban tree canopy, individual tree metrics, species, and age structures compared to conventional land use/cover class approaches. These area-wide consistent details can update life cycle inventories for more precise future prognoses. Additional improvements in classification accuracy can be achieved by a higher number of features derived from remote sensing data of increasing resolution, but first studies on this subject indicated that a smart selection of features already provides sufficient data that avoids redundancies and enables more efficient data processing. Our case study from Berlin could use remotely sensed individual tree species as consistent inventory of a life cycle assessment. However, a lack of growth, mortality and planting data forced us to make assumptions, therefore creating uncertainty in the long-term prognoses. Regarding temporal changes and reliable long-term estimates, more attention is required to detect changes of gradual growth, pruning and abrupt changes in tree planting and mortality. As such, precise long-term urban ecological monitoring using high resolution remote sensing should be intensified, especially due to increasing climate change effects. This is important for calibrating and validating recent prognoses of urban forest carbon offset, which have so far scarcely addressed longer timeframes. Additionally, higher resolution remote sensing of urban forest carbon estimates can improve upscaling approaches, which should be extended to reach a more precise global estimate for the first time. Conclusions: Urban forest carbon offset can be made more relevant by making more standardized assessments available for science and professional practitioners, and the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data and the progress in data processing allows for precisely that. © 2017 The Author(s).","Carbon offset; Change detection; Climate change mitigation; High resolution; Individual tree detection; Life cycle assessment; Tree species; Uncertainty; Urban forests; Urban remote sensing","adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; data processing; detection method; emission control; forest canopy; growth; life cycle analysis; literature review; mortality; remote sensing; resolution; tree; uncertainty analysis; urban area; Berlin; Germany",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030310127

Land management agencies, like the U.S. Forest Service, have developed multi-faceted strategies that utilize concepts like resilience and ecological integrity to guide adaptation. To address an extant research need, we conducted a qualitative case study, consisting of interviews with Forest Service staff in the Rocky Mountain Region, to explore how local federal land managers approach adaptation. Our goals were to understand what impacts managers are finding salient, perceptions of current agency strategies, and aspects of policy and practice that support effective adaptation planning. Interview participants anticipate impacts to disturbance regimes, wildlife species, and human uses. Participants intend to draw on agency policies, like its climate change scorecard and its land management planning regulations. However, the participants note that ambiguous concepts, uncertainty, and institutional variables make adaptation planning challenging in practice. A major theme apparent in the interviews was the use of partnerships with a range of other entities to address climate change. Ambiguity associated with concepts like resilience and ecological integrity allow them to function as boundary concepts; however, this ambiguity makes it challenging for managers to operationalize these concepts. These findings revealed that climate change adaptation is leading to and revealing the need for broader governance change. Moving forward, it will be crucial to adjust current governance structures to support long-term partnerships adept at translating scientific knowledge into actions and implementing complex boundary concepts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Ecology; Forestry; Human resource management; Land use; Managers; Mergers and acquisitions; Natural resources; Natural resources management; Climate change adaptation; Ecological integrity; Federal Land Manager; Governance structures; Long-term partnerships; Qualitative case studies; Scientific knowledge; U.S. Forest Service; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; federal system; forest; governance approach; land management; management practice; partnership approach; policy approach; qualitative analysis; Rocky Mountains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025830221

One way to better understand the issues is to learn from the experiences of farmers themselves. Thus, this study aimed to better understand rainfed upland cropping systems in NW Cambodia and to identify practical, social and economic constraints to adoption of known climate adaptation options applicable to local agro-ecosystems. The study also sought to document the climate change perceptions and adaptation options employed by farmers to mitigate the climate risks. A household survey was conducted in the districts of Sala Krau and Samlout in North-west Cambodia in 2013 where 390 representatives of households were randomly selected for interviews, group discussions and field observations. The majority of respondents perceived that changes had occurred in the rainfall pattern such as a later start to the monsoon season, decreasing annual rainfall, increasing frequencies of drought and dry spells, and warmer temperatures. Farmers reported reductions in crop yields of 16–27 % over the five-year period of 2008–2012. However, these reductions were not evident in provincial data for the same period. Farmers claimed climate impacts resulted in significant yield reductions, but they appear not to have an effective strategy to adapt to the changes in climate.

The reactivity of soluble Fe(III) toward known benzene photooxidation products that include fumaric (trans-butenedioic) and muconic (trans,trans-2,4-hexadienedioic) acids was investigated. Efficient formation of brightly colored nanoparticles was observed that are mostly rod- or irregular-shaped depending on the structure of the organic precursor. The particles were characterized for their optical properties, growth rate, elemental composition, iron content, and oxidation state. Results indicate that these particles have mass absorption coefficients on the same order as black carbon and larger than that of biomass burning aerosols. The particles are also amorphous in nature and consist of polymeric chains of Fe centers complexed to carboxylate groups. The oxidation state of Fe was found to be in between Fe(III) and Fe(II) in standard compounds. The organic reactant to iron molar ratio and pH were found to affect the particle growth rate. Control experiments using maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) and succinic acid (butanedioic acid) produced no particles. The formation of particles reported herein could account for new pathways that lead to SOA and brown carbon formation mediated by transition metals.

This study addresses one of the key bottlenecks to the commercialisation of microalgal bioproducts: the high energy and environmental cost of harvesting microalgal cells out of suspension. An innovative and sustainable autoflocculation procedure was developed to pre-concentrate microalgal biomass for easier harvesting. Microalgal cell agglomeration by autoflocculation at high pH was induced for the first time, without the addition of a chemical flocculant, in the commercially-relevant microalga Nannochloropsis oculata. Photosynthetic inorganic carbon uptake, in the absence of carbon dioxide supply by mass transfer, was used to raise the culture pH. Autoflocculation started at pH 9.5 and reached a maximum flocculation efficiency of 90% at pH 10.4. Microalgal surface charge-neutralisation by calcium cations, and sweep flocculation by calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate precipitates were identified as the dominant flocculation mechanisms. This was also the first study to measure changes in bacterial community composition under autoflocculation. There was a clear shift from free-living bacteria in suspension to attached bacteria during autoflocculation, with Flavobacteriales becoming the dominant order of bacteria. This highlights the influential role of attached bacteria and bacteria-produced extracellular polymeric substances in microalgal flocculation. This study shows that regulating carbon dioxide supply is a promising green alternative to traditional microalgal flocculation processes as it alleviates the requirement for costly and harmful chemical flocculants and brings us closer to sustainable microalgal bioproducts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Autoflocculation; Bacterial community composition; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Flocculation mechanisms; Microalgal harvesting; Nannochloropsis oculata",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026893176

But despite long held assumptions about intra-disciplinary engagements between its “human” and “physical” branches, geography's weakness as a discipline is that it has yet to gather sufficient momentum to collectively shape and implement practical and sustainable climate change policies and actions (Castree, 2014a). However, by considering together the heuristic values of the concepts of the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries, the Anglo-American sphere of geography recognizes in either ironic, or unconscious manners that a new strand of environmental determinism (discredited by geographical thought and practice in the early twentieth century) has re-emerged to elide the role of human agency and broadly dominate the discussion of climate change. Mike Hulme (2011, 247) states that “climate determinism” is “a form of analysis and prediction in which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies that shape human life within the physical world”. Within this discourse it is often the biophysical sphere that is employed to explain the course of human behavior; consequently, this dominating perspective threatens to skew our predictions and understandings of future societies, cultures, climates and destinies. Climate change will certainly constrain human agency, but it also creates the potential for geography to play to its intra and inter disciplinary strengths and begin discussing and addressing human-environmental dilemmas in practical and realistic ways; and secondly, seize the climate change crisis as an opportunity to study where, why and for whom global environmental change matters. Firstly, this paper considers a theoretical balance between the NHC, the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries as a way forward for geography to begin addressing the common dilemma of climate change. Within this consideration it engages Anne Buttimer's geographical translation of Martin Heidegger's lebenswelt as a dimension of the NHC. Secondly, the paper discusses how GeoHumanities and GIScience integrations with phenomenology, the digital and environmental humanities and social media generated “Big-Data” can explore the perceptual scales and scopes of the NHC/Anthropocene/Planetary Boundaries conceptual triad. Lastly, it argues that such integrations are salient to the study of emerging Smart City Lifeworlds as a means to engage the increasing urban agencies of global climate change driven by the vagaries of the human condition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropocene; Geography; GeoHumanities; GIScience; Hannah Arendt; Lifeworld; Planetary boundaries; Smart Cities","Behavioral research; Big data; Anthropocene; Geography; GeoHumanities; GIScience; Hannah Arendt; Lifeworld; Smart cities; Climate change; Anthropocene; climate change; environmental policy; GIS; global climate; smart city; sustainability; twenty first century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008477829

Reservoir heterogeneity is also a key factor controlling plume spreading and trapping efficiency as well as a source of uncertainty about the deep subsurface. However, these two features are typically overlooked or overly simplified by numerical models that emphasize on viscous flow driven by pressure gradients. In particular, when considering far-field regions of storage reservoirs with vanishing pressure gradients, the physics governing the CO2 flow into brine-saturated rocks become dominated by capillary and buoyancy forces. Hence, there is currently a debate on whether numerical models founded on Darcy’s law can capture some of the migration phenomena that characterize long-term CO2 migration in saline formations. In this study, we consider experimental observations from a previous physical model that illustrates flow patterns of a CO2-surrogate plume migrating through a well-characterized sand aquifer saturated with a brine-analog. Then, we compare Monte Carlo sets of invasion percolation simulations with direct observations of plume distribution to evaluate the effects of a heterogeneous capillary pressure field. The observed plume distribution appears to be controlled by a combination of buoyant migration and trapping at capillary barriers under near-hydrostatic pressure conditions. Although these observations are gathered in a simplified and relatively small laboratory system, an analogous behavior has been documented at reservoir scale for the Sleipner storage site, where a series of shale layers inhibited the buoyant migration of the plume. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Capillary pressure heterogeneity; Invasion percolation; Sandbox experiments; Surrogate fluids","Aquifers; Buoyancy; Capillarity; Capillary tubes; Carbon dioxide; Hydrostatic pressure; Monte Carlo methods; Numerical models; Percolation (solid state); Pressure gradient; Solvents; Carbon sequestration; Hydrostatic pressure conditions; Invasion percolation; Invasion percolation simulation; Migration phenomena; Reservoir heterogeneity; Sandbox experiments; Trapping efficiencies; Percolation (fluids)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058819632

An analysis is made of the results of the environmental activity during the period of planned economy and post-perestroika. In the reform years, Baikal was included on the List of the World Natural Heritage Sites, the Federal Law “On the protection of Lake Baikal” was adopted as well as three federal target programs of the protection of the lake and socioeconomic development of the Baikal natural territory. Due to funding shortages, however, they are hardly implemented. The latest legal acts substantially restrict the rights of local residents to land privatization, the development of the social infrastructure, and to use natural resources. Furthermore, in spite of a large number of federal nature conservation directives, closure of many enterprises and reductions in emissions, the ecological situation on Lake Baikal is not improving.

In addition, all ecological legislative acts are adopted without any public discussion and funding of environmental protection expenditures is not a priority.

Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model to simulate the ability of planets initially completely frozen to escape from glaciation episodes by accumulating enough gaseous CO2. The model includes CO2 condensation and sublimation processes and the water cycle. We find that planets with Earth-like characteristics (size, mass, obliquity, rotation rate, etc.) orbiting a Sun-like star may never be able to escape from a glaciation era, if their orbital distance is greater than ∼1.27 Astronomical Units (Flux&lt;847 Wm−2 or 62% of the Solar constant), because CO2 would condense at the poles – here the cold traps – forming permanent CO2 ice caps. This limits the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and thus its greenhouse effect. Furthermore, our results indicate that for (1) high rotation rates (Prot&lt;24 h), (2) low obliquity (obliquity &lt;23.5°), (3) low background gas partial pressures (&lt;1 bar), and (4) high water ice albedo (H2O albedo &gt; 0.6), this critical limit could occur at a significantly lower equivalent distance (or higher insolation). For each possible configuration, we show that the amount of CO2 that can be trapped in the polar caps depends on the efficiency of CO2 ice to flow laterally as well as its gravitational stability relative to subsurface water ice. We find that a frozen Earth-like planet located at 1.30 AU of a Sun-like star could store as much as 1.5, 4.5 and 15 bars of dry ice at the poles, for internal heat fluxes of 100, 30 and 10 mW m−2, respectively. But these amounts are in fact lower limits. For planets with a significant water ice cover, we show that CO2 ice deposits should be gravitationally unstable. They get buried beneath the water ice cover in geologically short timescales of ∼104 yrs, mainly controlled by the viscosity of water ice. CO2 would be permanently sequestered underneath the water ice cover, in the form of CO2 liquids, CO2 clathrate hydrates and/or dissolved in subglacial water reservoirs (if any). This would considerably increase the amount of CO2 trapped and further reduce the probability of deglaciation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","climate; climate cycling; CO2 condensation; exoplanet; habitability; snowball","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Condensation; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouses; Orbits; Planets; Poles; Silicates; Solar radiation; Stars; climate; climate cycling; Exoplanet; habitability; snowball; Ice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012247939

Mobilizing such action can be made more optimal with knowledge about how the public views climate change solutions and what they think needs to be done in the face of climate change. Yet most public opinion research to date uses either closed questions about agreement with various pre-determined statements (such as views on science, worry, and support for given policy options) or use open-ended questions eliciting generic associations with climate change. This article uses an open-ended survey question in a probability-based Internet survey panel in Norway, analyzing 4634 textual responses to the question of “what should be done” about climate change. Using structural topic modeling (STM), we induce seven topics: Transportation, energy transition, attribution of climate change, emission reduction, the international dimension, lifestyle/consumption and government measures. We find that Norwegians strongly emphasize mitigation over adaptation, as few responses mention the latter topic. Also, men seem to externalize the solutions to climate change, emphasizing energy policies, the international dimension, and discussions about the causes of climate change, while women to a larger extent understand climate action as an issue involving individual behavior, calling for better public transportation and lifestyle changes. Overall, our results suggest a willingness to accept stronger mitigation action, but also that central and local governments need to facilitate low-carbon choices, bridging policy and individual action to mitigate climate change. © 2017 The Authors","climate change; climate change adaptation; climate change mitigation; public opinion; qualitative text analysis; quantitative text analysis","climate change; energy policy; environmental policy; Internet; lifestyle; local government; perception; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire survey; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026536586

This system has evolved into public works called the Agricultural Infrastructure Improvement and Rural Development Projects (A&R). We investigated the economic and environmental impacts of A&R using an interregional input–output (IRIO) analysis, with a limited scope on the construction stage. We incorporated an unpublished database on A&R into published IRIO tables to compile a public-work (PW) extended IRIO. The results showed that: (1) PW, particularly A&R, had greater impacts on regional economies of remote regions; and (2) major GHG-emitting input sectors included construction materials, oil/coal products, electricity, transport, as well as fossil-fuel consumptions by PW themselves. Furthermore, scenario analyses, in which PW sectors must suffer a budget cut, were conducted. The results suggested that the national government may well choose different budget allocations according to their objectives. If they aimed to minimize regional discrepancies in economic development, then lighter budget cuts should be imposed on remote regions. Meanwhile, if they aimed at minimizing the losses of National Total Outputs or maximizing the national GHG reduction, then they would face a trade-off, which stemmed from a strong proportional linkage between the outputs and the GHG emissions of PW. To moderate such a trade-off, technological structures of PW should be innovated, including: (1) increase energy efficiency (i.e., reduce consumption of electricity and fossil fuels); (2) reduce construction materials where possible or procure low emission-intensive materials; and (3) reduce wasted materials. © 2017, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.","C67; Construction; Greenhouse gas emission; Input–output analysis; Irrigation; Public works; Q15; Q51; Rural development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100619909

The stationarity of a time series gives information about its future behavior based on past behavior. More specifically, stationarity properties give information on whether shocks have transitory or permanent effects on a variable; therefore, the stationarity of a time series has important implications to the formation of appropriate policies by decision makers.

Case studies of the determinants of agricultural land conversion potentially contribute to the analysis of the main causes of land-use change. This can assist authorities and policy makers in understanding the relative importance of a wide range of factors on urban expansion and associated agricultural land-use change. This paper explores the determinants of agricultural land conversion to urban uses in the studied 25 European Union countries between 2000 and 2006. European-level as well as region-specific land-use changes are studied. The research is using the spatial data adapted from European Corine Land Cover maps of 2000 and 2006 and utilised other European sources regarding socio-economic, natural, geological, climate, and policy-related data. The differences in urbanisation processes observed in different regions in Europe emphasise the regional variations of urban conversion process of agricultural land use. This study identifies a combination of socio-economic drivers, policy-related factors, nature and location-based factors as key influences on agricultural land conversion processes in Europe. Specifically we found that the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies were influential in curbing urbanisation and reducing agricultural land consumption. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agricultural land conversion; Drivers of land-use change; European countries; Urban land-use change; Urbanisation","Economics; Land use; Agricultural land; European Countries; Land-use change; Urban land-use change; Urbanisation; Agriculture; agricultural land; Common Agricultural Policy; European Union; land use change; policy making; urban area; urbanization; agricultural land; climate; driver; Europe; European Union; human; urban area; agriculture; economics; environmental protection; legislation and jurisprudence; natural resource; procedures; socioeconomics; urbanization; Europe; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; European Union; Natural Resources; Socioeconomic Factors; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021952284

Ca-Carbonates are powerful proxies for the alteration conditions of CMs because they are direct snapshots of the chemical and isotopic compositions of the parent fluids. Here, we report a petrographic and a C isotope and O isotope survey of Ca-carbonates in Paris in order to better characterize the earliest stages of aqueous alteration. Petrographic observations show that Paris contains two distinct populations of Ca-carbonates: Type 1a Ca-carbonates, which are surrounded by rims of tochilinite/cronstedtite intergrowths (TCIs), and new Type 0 Ca-carbonates, which do not exhibit the TCI rims. The TCI rims of Type 1a Ca-carbonates commonly outline euhedral crystal faces, demonstrating that these Ca-carbonates were (i) partially or totally pseudomorphosed by TCI and (ii) precipitated at the earliest stages of aqueous alteration, before Type 0 Ca-carbonates. Isotopic measurements show that Paris' Ca-carbonates have δ13C values that range from 19 to 80‰ (PDB), δ18O values that range from 29 to 41%, and δ17O values that range from 13 to 24‰ (SMOW). According to the δ13C–δ18O values of Paris' Ca-carbonates, we developed a new alteration model that involves (i) the equilibration of a primordial 17,18O-rich water (PW) with 16O-rich anhydrous silicates and (ii) varying contribution of 12C- and 13C-rich soluble organic matter (SOMs). It also suggests that many parameters control the C and O isotopic composition of Ca-carbonates, the principles being the degree of isotopic equilibration between the PW and the anhydrous silicates, the respective contribution of 12C and 13C-rich SOMs as well as the thermal evolution of CM parent bodies. Consequently, we suggest that CM Ca-carbonates could record both positive and negative δ13C–δ18O relationships, but a systematic correspondence is probably absent in CM chondrites due to the large number of factors involved in generating the isotopic characteristics of Ca-carbonates. From recent reports of the C-isotopic compositions of SOM in CM chondrites, we propose that water-soluble organic compounds were the most probable source of 13C enrichment in the majority of CM carbonates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aragonite; Calcite; Chondrites; Oxygen and carbon isotopes; Pseudomorphism; Secondary alteration","carbon isotope; chemical alteration; chondrite; isotopic composition; oxygen isotope; petrography; petrology; pseudomorph; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024912133

Using data for recently-installed systems, we estimate the balance of benefits and costs associated with installing a non-utility solar PV system today. We also study the geographical distribution of the various subsidies that are made available to owners of rooftop solar PV systems, and compare it to distributions of population and income. We find that, after accounting for federal subsidies and local rebates and assuming a discount rate of 7%, the private benefits of new installations will exceed private costs only in seven of the 19 states for which we have data and only if customers can sell excess power to the electric grid at the retail price. These states are characterized by abundant sunshine (California, Texas and Nevada) or by high electricity prices (New York). Public benefits from reduced air pollution and climate change impact exceed the costs of the various subsidies offered system owners for less than 10% of the systems installed, even assuming a 2% discount rate. Subsidies flowed disproportionately to counties with higher median incomes in 2006. In 2014, the distribution of subsidies was closer to that of population income, but subsidies still flowed disproportionately to the better-off. The total, upfront, subsidy per kilowatt of installed capacity has fallen from $5200 in 2006 to $1400 in 2014, but the absolute magnitude of subsidy has soared as installed capacity has grown explosively. We see considerable differences in the balance of costs and benefits even within states, indicating that local factors such as system price and solar resource are important, and that policies (e.g. net metering) could be made more efficient by taking local conditions into account. © 2017 The Author(s).

These inundated, anoxic soils featuring abundant nitrogen compounds and methane are an ideal niche for nitrate-dependent anaerobic methanotrophs. After 2 years of enrichment with a continuous supply of methane and nitrate as the sole electron donor and acceptor, a stable enrichment dominated by ‘Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens’ archaea and ‘Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera’ NC10 phylum bacteria was achieved. In this community, the methanotrophic archaea supplied the NC10 phylum bacteria with the necessary nitrite through nitrate reduction coupled to methane oxidation. The results of qPCR quantification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene copies, analysis of metagenomic 16S rRNA reads, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) correlated well and showed that after 2 years, ‘Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens’ had the highest abundance of (2.2 ± 0.4 × 108) 16S rRNA copies per milliliter and constituted approximately 22% of the total microbial community. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 16S rRNA genes of the dominant microorganisms clustered with previously described ‘Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens ANME2D’ (96% identity) and ‘Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera’ (99% identity) strains. The pooled metagenomic sequences resulted in a high-quality draft genome assembly of ‘Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens Vercelli’ that contained all key functional genes for the reverse methanogenesis pathway and nitrate reduction. The diagnostic mcrA gene was 96% similar to ‘Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens ANME2D’ (WP_048089615.1) at the protein level. The ‘Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera’ draft genome contained the marker genes pmoCAB, mdh, and nirS and putative NO dismutase genes. Whole-reactor anaerobic activity measurements with methane and nitrate revealed an average methane oxidation rate of 0.012 mmol/h/L, with cell-specific methane oxidation rates up to 0.57 fmol/cell/day for ‘Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens’. In summary, this study describes the first enrichment and draft genome of methanotrophic archaea from paddy field soil, where these organisms can contribute significantly to the mitigation of methane emissions. © 2017, The Author(s).","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; NC10 phylum bacteria; ‘Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens’","Bacteria; Fluorescence microscopy; Genes; Nitrates; Oxidation; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Soils; Activity measurements; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Fluorescence in situ hybridization; Methane oxidation; Methane oxidation rates; Microbial communities; Nitrate reduction; Phylogenetic analysis; Methane; methane; nitrate; RNA 16S; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; agricultural soil; anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; genome; methane; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; microbial community; microbial ecology; nitrate; oxidation; paddy field; phylogenetics; prokaryote; anaerobic metabolism; archaeon; Article; bioreactor; Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens; fluorescence in situ hybridization; Italy; metagenomics; nonhuman; paddy field soil; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; soil; anaerobic growth; archaeal genome; archaeon; DNA sequence; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular genetics; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; wetland; Italy; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Bioreactors; Genome, Archaeal; Methane; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nitrates; Nitrites; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026835353

Typically, CO2 assisted enhanced oil recovery projects are operated at the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), beyond which the CO2 and oil phases are completely miscible and the incremental oil recovery from CO2 displacement does not increase dramatically anymore. Thus, the MMP is a critical parameter in screening-level performance assessments of potential CO2 floods. The MMP can be measured from displacement experiments in a laboratory using a slim tube apparatus. Alternatively, it can be estimated from statistical correlations developed using reservoir temperature and detailed crude oil composition and analytical methods such as equation of state based simulations. In this paper, we describe the development and validation of an improved correlation to estimate the MMP of CO2 in crude oil based only on: (a) reservoir temperature, and (b) molecular weight of the C5+ fraction, which can also be estimated from the oil's specific gravity. A power law based predictive model for MMP has been developed through statistical analysis of data from published literature pertaining to crude oil with a wide range of temperatures and molecular weights. The resulting predictions were compared with those obtained from previously established and widely used correlations (e.g., Cronquist, 1978) and found to have a higher degree of accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 sequestration; Correlation; Enhanced oil recovery; Minimum miscibility pressure (MMP)","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Correlation methods; Crude oil; Digital storage; Equations of state; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Molecular weight; Natural gas fields; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoirs; Solubility; Carbon capture , utilization , and storages; CO2 sequestration; Displacement experiments; Enhanced oil recovery; Minimum miscibility pressure; Performance assessment; Reservoir temperatures; Statistical correlation; Enhanced recovery; carbon sequestration; correlation; crude oil; displacement; enhanced oil recovery; estimation method; hydrocarbon reservoir; pressure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032914888

Tropical forests present an important opportunity, as they take up and store large amounts of carbon. It is often suggested that forests with high biodiversity have large stocks and high rates of carbon uptake. Evidence is, however, scattered across geographic areas and scales, and it remains unclear whether biodiversity is just a co-benefit or also a requirement for the maintenance of carbon stocks and uptake. Here, we perform a quantitative review of empirical studies that analyzed the relationships between plant biodiversity attributes and carbon stocks and carbon uptake in tropical forests. Our results show that biodiversity attributes related to species, traits or structure significantly affect carbon stocks or uptake in 64% of the evaluated relationships. Average vegetation attributes (community-mean traits and structural attributes) are more important for carbon stocks, whereas variability in vegetation attributes (i.e., taxonomic diversity) is important for both carbon stocks and uptake. Thus, different attributes of biodiversity have complementary effects on carbon stocks and uptake. These biodiversity effects tend to be more often significant in mature forests at broad spatial scales than in disturbed forests at local spatial scales. Biodiversity effects are also more often significant when confounding variables are not included in the analyses, highlighting the importance of performing a comprehensive analysis that adequately accounts for environmental drivers. In summary, biodiversity is not only a co-benefit, but also a requirement for short- and long-term maintenance of carbon stocks and enhancement of uptake. Climate change policies should therefore include the maintenance of multiple attributes of biodiversity as an essential requirement to achieve long-term climate change mitigation goals. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","biodiversity-ecosystem functioning; biomass dynamics; biomass growth; climate change mitigation; functional traits; species diversity; tropical forest","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem function; environmental policy; species diversity; tropical forest",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020734608

Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1-ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand-level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition – which is an indicator for the mass-ratio theory – had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers. In sum, diversity and mass-ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general. © 2017 The Authors.

Livestock treading damage and high soil water contents increase the risk of N2O emissions. Duration controlled grazing (DCG) practices that are implemented in response to soil water conditions above a threshold may therefore provide an effective means of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dairy farms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential decrease in GHG emissions from dairy farms when implementing DCG when soil water content is above a specific threshold (akin to ‘wet’ days). We used the DairyNZ Whole Farm Model and APSIM model to assess the cost-benefit of implementing DCG to reduce total N2O and manure-derived CH4 emissions from dairy farms. We modelled scenarios on poorly drained or imperfectly drained soils in four regions of New Zealand including Waikato, Manawatu, Canterbury and Southland, where the grazing time on wet days was 0, 13, 17 or 21 h per day. Emissions were estimated using a refined version of New Zealand's current national greenhouse gas inventory methodology. Our analysis suggested that reducing the grazing time from 21 h to 0, 13 or 17 h per day when soils were wet could reduce annual N2O and manure-derived CH4 emissions by up to, respectively, 12, 9 or 5% on farms with poorly drained soils. The 13 h per day grazing duration was the least costly, particularly if there were &gt; 150 ‘wet’ days per year. In contrast, for dairy farms on imperfectly-drained soils, DCG increased emissions, suggesting this management approach for reducing GHG emissions is not suitable for these soils. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","APSIM; Duration controlled grazing; Modelling; Nitrous oxide; Whole Farm Model","agricultural modeling; cattle; emission inventory; grazing management; greenhouse gas; manure; methane; nitrous oxide; removal experiment; soil amendment; soil emission; Canterbury [South Island]; Manawatu; Manawatu-Wanganui; New Zealand; North Island; South Island; Southland; Waikato",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020894442

Our knowledge of historic fire emissions has progressively improved over the past decades due mostly to the development of new proxies and the improvement of fire models. Currently, there is a suite of proxies including sedimentary charcoal records, measurements of fire-emitted trace gases and black carbon stored in ice and firn, and visibility observations. These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emission estimates back in time based on satellite data starting in 1997, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example, the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage. According to our approach, global biomass burning emissions were relatively constant, with 10-year averages varying between 1.8 and 2.3 PgC yr-1. Carbon emissions increased only slightly over the full time period and peaked during the 1990s after which they decreased gradually. There is substantial uncertainty in these estimates, and patterns varied depending on choices regarding data representation, especially on regional scales. The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58% of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia. These global fire emission estimates are mostly suited for global analyses and will be used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations. © Author(s) 2017.",,"biomass; biomass burning; carbon emission; charcoal; CMIP; data set; deforestation; emission; fire history; global climate; historical record; satellite data; savanna; Asia; South America; Tracheophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029315994

Management of coral reefs through maintenance (e.g., marine-protected areas, catchment management to improve water quality), restoration, as well as global and national governmental agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement) is critical for the persistence of coral reefs. Despite these initiatives, the health and abundance of corals reefs are rapidly declining and other solutions will soon be required. We have recently discussed options for using assisted evolution (i.e., selective breeding, assisted gene flow, conditioning or epigenetic programming, and the manipulation of the coral microbiome) as a means to enhance environmental stress tolerance of corals and the success of coral reef restoration efforts. The 2014–2016 global coral bleaching event has sharpened the focus on such interventionist approaches. We highlight the necessity for consideration of alternative (e.g., hybrid) ecosystem states, discuss traits of resilient corals and coral reef ecosystems, and propose a decision tree for incorporating assisted evolution into restoration initiatives to enhance climate resilience of coral reefs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","assisted evolution; climate change; coral reefs; global warming; hybrid ecosystems; rehabilitation; restoration; scleractinia","climate change; coral reef; ecosystem resilience; environmental management; environmental stress; evolution; global warming; restoration ecology; Anthozoa; Scleractinia; animal; Anthozoa; climate; climate change; coral reef; ecosystem; Animals; Anthozoa; Climate; Climate Change; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014009497

While such claims may resist a key driver of the “resource curse” when applied to mineral resources in the ground, and are often recognized as among a people’s territorial rights, their implications differ in the context of climate change, where they are invoked on behalf of a right to extract and combust fossil fuels that is set in opposition to global climate change mitigation imperatives. Moreover, granting full national sovereignty over territorial carbon sinks may conflict with commitments to equity in the sharing of national mitigation burdens, since much of the planet’s carbon sink capacity lies within territorial borders to which peoples have widely disparate access. In this paper, I shall explore this tension between a global justice principle that is often applied to mineral resources and its tension with contrary principles that are often applied to carbon sink access, developing an analysis that seeks to reconcile what would otherwise appear to be fundamentally incompatible aims. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon budgets; Carbon sinks; Climate justice; Emissions rights; Permanent sovereignty; Territorial rights","carbon; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate; climate change; developing country; environmental protection; forest; government; greenhouse effect; human; international cooperation; natural resource; organization and management; social justice; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Climate; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developing Countries; Federal Government; Forests; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; International Cooperation; Natural Resources; Ownership; Social Justice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000869873

In this review, we engage with some of the key design features, achievements, and challenges that situate and characterize the IPCC as an intergovernmental organization that is tasked with producing global environmental assessments (GEAs). These include the process of working through consensus to assess and summarize climate science and the need to include knowledge from as many of the 195 IPCC nation-states as possible, despite the structural inequalities between developed and developing countries. To highlight salient features that are unique to the IPCC but that offer lessons for other organizations that conduct GEAs, we include case studies on the politics of climate denialism, the use of geoengineering in mitigation scenarios, and the links between adaptive capacity, adaptation, and global development. We conclude with a discussion of institutional reflexivity. We consider how the IPCC can model an ethical and participatory response to climate change by critically examining, and being transparent about, the relation between science and politics. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

Materials and Methods This prospective, HIPAA-compliant study randomly assigned 85 women undergoing ultrasound- or stereotactic-guided core-needle breast biopsies to receive intradermally and intraparenchymally either 1% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate (9:1 ratio) (bicarbonate study group) or 1% lidocaine alone (control group). Pain was evaluated using a 0-to-10 Likert pain scale during both intradermal and intraparenchymal anesthesia injections and during tissue sampling. Prebiopsy breast pain, anxiety, medical history, demographics, biopsy type, radiologist level of training, breast density, and lesion histology were recorded. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. Results Unadjusted mean pain scores were 1.47 and 2.07 (study and control groups, respectively; P =.15) during intradermal injections, and 1.84 and 2.98 (study and control groups, respectively; P =.03) during intraparenchymal injections. Tissue sampling mean pain scores were.81 and 1.71 (study and control groups, respectively; P =.07). Moderator analyses found (1) among patients with preprocedural pain, those in the bicarbonate group experienced less intradermal injection pain (0.85 ± 1.23) than patients in the control group (2.50 ± 2.09); (2) among patients with fatty or scattered fibroglandular tissue, those in the bicarbonate group (1.35 ± 1.95) experienced less intraparenchymal injection pain than the control group (3.52 ± 3.13); and (3) during ultrasound-guided biopsies, patients in the bicarbonate group experienced less tissue-sampling pain (0.23 ± 0.63) than the control group (1.79 ± 3.05). Conclusions Overall, buffering lidocaine with sodium bicarbonate significantly reduced pain during intraparenchymal injections, and additional pain reduction was found in certain patient subgroups during intradermal injections, intraparenchymal injections, and tissue sampling. © 2017 American College of Radiology","anesthesia; Imaging-guided breast biopsy; lidocaine; patient experience; patient pain; sodium bicarbonate","bicarbonate; lidocaine; bicarbonate; buffer; lidocaine; local anesthetic agent; adult; analgesia; anxiety; Article; breast biopsy; breast density; catastrophizing; comparative study; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; injection pain; major clinical study; mastalgia; medical history; middle aged; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; stereotactic biopsy; chemistry; image guided biopsy; pain measurement; procedural pain; procedures; Anesthetics, Local; Buffers; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Image-Guided Biopsy; Lidocaine; Pain Measurement; Pain, Procedural; Prospective Studies; Sodium Bicarbonate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019353322

The ever increasing proportion of intermittent power sources (wind and solar) in the power system changes the basic paradigm of power engineering economics whereby instead of adjusting generation output to the demand at the time, the focus is shifting towards adjusting consumption based on the output of intermittent generation. That is the goal of the so-called smart grids, where the consumer will be adapting to intermittent generation by responding to price signals. In spite of or rather because of this, there will still be (at the moment, more and more) the need for power sources and appliances that will, at the dispatcher's request, quickly increase or decrease generation or instead of generators become consumers, i.e. their technical parameters enable them to maintain balance between generation and consumption and network frequency within set limits. On the generation side, these are primarily gas turbines and closed cycle gas turbines, pumped storage hydro stations, heat plants with turbines equipped with heat accumulators or accumulating heat into a heat distribution network and networks of CHPs (combined heat and power) also with heat accumulators supplying heat into buildings in a wide area, but centrally controlled. On the demand side, these are HDO systems (a form of ripple control in the Czech Republic) which control appliances that convert electricity into useful heat, which is easier to accumulate for water heating purposes, electrical boilers connected into heat networks and in the future also P2G systems using cheap electricity to break down water into oxygen and hydrogen. Being affiliated with current heat plants, they will utilize carbon from fossil or biofuel combustion for the methanisation of hydrogen and its injection into the natural gas network for the purposes of seasonal energy accumulation. Nonetheless, for accumulation of alternate current over the course of a day to a week it is still the best to make use of the benefits of pumped storage hydro power stations which remain to be a proven form of electricity accumulation in the grid. The vast majority of them are designed and constructed in mountainous regions so that they can take advantage of the differences in elevation of the landscape. This appears to be at odds with nature protection interests. The paper concentrates on a location of an active lignite quarry in the northwest of the Czech Republic, where the interests of nature protection would not be affected. From an economical perspective, in the case of a pumped storage hydro station, capital expenditure is key and therefore the paper also includes an assessment of the economic viability of the project, through the valuation of the effects resulting from the provision of ancillary services to the transmission system.","Accumulator of energy; Ancillary services; Conventional power units; Economic efficiency of investments; Flooded quarry; Income from services provisions; Income from services sales; Investment outlay; Photovoltaic panels; Power balance; Power to gas; Pumped storage power plant; Reclamation after mining; System services; Transmission power system; Wind turbines","Boiler control; Carbon; Closed cycle machinery; Cogeneration plants; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric equipment protection; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Hydroelectric power plants; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Plants (botany); Pumped storage power plants; Quarries; Wide area networks; Wind turbines; Accumulator of energy; Ancillary service; Conventional power; Economic efficiency; Income from services provisions; Photovoltaic panels; Power balance; System services; Transmission power systems; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029668441

Moreover, it evaluates the legitimacy both of the process of introducing REDD + and the outcomes in the form of new governance structures. We find that establishing tradable carbon is demanding. In fact, no carbon has yet been sold. We observe that while the Kilosa REDD + pilot managed to engage local communities to a rather unusual extent, the case also showed that introducing REDD + ‘on the ground’ faces several challenges regarding legitimacy. © 2017","Carbon trading; Forest policy; Institutional change; Legitimacy; Participation; Reduced deforestation","Deforestation; Emission control; Societies and institutions; Carbon trading; Forest policy; Institutional change; Legitimacy; Participation; Forestry; Deforestation; Degradation; Forest Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019974446

People everyday use a large variety of cosmetic products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, deodorant, skin care, perfume, make-up, among others. The cosmetic industry encompasses several environmental, social and economic impacts that are being addressed through the search for more efficient manufacturing techniques, the reduction of waste and emissions and the promotion of personal hygiene, contributing to an improvement of public health and at the same time providing employment opportunities. The current trend among consumers is the pursuit for natural ingredients in cosmetic products, as many of these products exhibit equal, better or additional benefits in comparison with the chemical-based products. In this sense, biosurfactants are natural compounds with great potential in the formulation of cosmetic products given by their biodegradability and impact in health. Indeed, many of these biosurfactants could exhibit a “prebiotic” character.

There are various approaches how this distortion could be addressed. Among possible solutions indirect carbon tax based tool was identified as the most appropriate way how to remedy distortions on the heat market towards inclusion of CO2 costs into price of fuels for installations outside EU ETS. This solution could be easily realized by using existing legislation tools and application of possible remedial tool on the heat market is described.

The focus of this proposed effort is to leverage advances in materials technology, specifically thin films, to reduce secondary electron generation and outgassing from anode surfaces. By using advanced thin film deposition techniques, hybrid materials can be developed that provide the thermal and electrical conductivity required for operation, while reducing secondary electrons and desorption of gas species from the anode surface. Proposed solutions to these issues need to be robust, yet cost effective and applicable through available manufacturing processes. In this paper, we will introduce an improved mathematical expression for the secondary emission yield as a function of the impact voltage which is an extension of the formula first introduced by Vaughan [1].

To reduce Sb leaching from MSWI bottom ash below the regulatory limit for recycling as construction material, Ca- and Fe-containing chemicals and industrial residues were added to this bottom ash. Short term and medium long term leaching tests were performed by lab batch tests and outdoor field tests. This confirmed that the tested chemicals and industrial residues reduce Sb leaching to below the regulatory limit. Carbonation tests with subsequent leaching were performed to provide information on the long term leaching behavior of Sb from MSWI bottom ash. Upon carbonation, Sb leaching from the bottom ash to which Fe2(SO4)3 or Ca- and Fe-containing industrial residues were added, increased over time, but did not exceed the regulatory limit value after full carbonation. When carbonation progressed, Sb leaching from the untreated bottom ash decreased, which could not be explained by the current state of the knowledge on mechanisms for Sb leaching in alkaline environments. As the leaching of Sb after carbonation was altered similarly as that of Cu, we experimentally checked if Sb leaching could also be influenced by the presence of organic acids,. As a result, we showed that Sb leaching from MSWI bottom ash in alkaline environments is indeed influenced by the presence of organic acids like humic and fulvic acids. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Antimony; Leaching; MSWI bottom ash; Organic acids; Waste incineration","Antimony; Ash handling; Ashes; Calcium; Carbonation; Incineration; Industrial chemicals; Organic acids; Waste incineration; Alkaline environment; Batch tests; Humic and fulvic acids; Industrial residues; Long-term leaching; Mineral additives; MSWI-bottom ash; Regulatory limit; Leaching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007240748

The simulated nutrients and chlorophyll fields were validated using satellite and in situ observations at a continental shelf time-series station. The annual cycles of modeled chlorophyll and nutrients were consistent with the highest values observed in spring and summer, which is in agreement with enhanced upwelling observations. Co-limitation of phytoplankton growth by nutrients and light was analyzed for diatoms, the dominant phytoplankton group in the simulations. The results showed that co-limitation, near the coast, was governed in autumn and winter by light, and by silicate in spring and summer, whereas other nutrients were limiting offshore between January and April. Nutrient transport in the surface layer was analyzed. Vertical advection reflected areas with higher coastal upwelling, and was partly offset by horizontal processes related to eddy-induced transport from the nearshore to the open ocean.

The state of California acknowledges that agriculture both contributes to and is affected by climate change, and in 2016 it adopted legislation to help growers reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, explicitly including N2O. Nitrous oxide emissions can vary widely due to environmental and agronomic factors with most emission estimates coming from temperate grain systems. There is, however, a dearth of emission estimates from perennial and vegetable cropping systems commonly found in California's Mediterranean climate. Therefore, emission factors (EFs) specific to California conditions are needed to accurately assess statewide N2O emissions and mitigation options. In this paper, we review 16 studies reporting annual and seasonal N2O emissions. This data set represents all available studies on measured emissions at the whole field scale and on an event basis. Through this series of studies, we discuss how such farm management and environmental factors influence N2O emissions from California agriculture and may serve as a basis for improved EF calculations.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029517685

Monthly BC emission (83–364 Gg) obtained from the present study exhibited a spatial and temporal variability with this being the highest (lowest) during February (July). Monthly BC emission flux was considerably high (&gt; 100 kg km− 2) over the entire Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP), east and the west coast during winter months. This was relatively higher over the central and western India than over the IGP during summer months. Annual BC emission rate was 2534 Gg y− 1 with that over the IGP and central India respectively comprising 50% and 40% of the total annual BC emissions over India. A high relative increase was observed in modified BC emissions (more than five times the initial emissions) over the most part of the IGP, east coast, central/northwestern India.

Here, we identify numerous wells poking through shallow gas pockets in 3-D seismic data of the CNS indicating that about one-third of the wells may leak, potentially releasing a total of 3-17 kt of methane per year into the North Sea. This poses a significant contribution to the North Sea methane budget. A large fraction of this gas (∼42%) may reach the atmosphere via direct bubble transport (0-2 kt yr-1) and via diffusive exchange of methane dissolving in the surface mixed layer (1-5 kt yr-1), as indicated by numerical modeling.

A scheme was recently announced aimed at encouraging ownership of electric vehicles, reducing the number of old motor vehicles from the road and thus reducing emissions. The scheme comprises a grant of €4000 to persons registering an electric vehicle, increasing to €5000 in the case of persons registering for an electric vehicle while at the same time de-registering their own vehicle, if it is at least 10 years old. The unique problem in Malta is that as much as 98% of electricity generation is produced from combustion of fossil fuels, mainly heavy fuel oil and diesel oil. The combustion of fossil fuels results in significant environment impacts, particularly in emission of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). Against this background, the energy consumption of two locally available battery electric vehicles in the super-mini category is analyzed, taking into account the CO2 generation characteristics of the Maltese electric power plants. Their performance is compared with that of vehicles in the same category, powered by different fuels. This paper determines that the benefits of driving BEVs in Malta depend on the electricity mix at the point of charging, and with the existing electricity mix. Three scenarios are analyzed and in the case where the energy mix is dependent on natural gas, this study shows that the CO2 emissions of BEVs are considerably less than for either hybrid or vehicle powered by conventional fuel. © 2017 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Battery electric vehicle (BEV); Greenhouse gas (GHG); Internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019681292

In these networks, nodes are constrained in terms of energy, memory, and processing. Links are lossy and exhibit a transient behavior. From the point of view of energy expenditure, governing control overhead emission is crucial and is the role of the Trickle algorithm. We address Trickle's fairness problem to evenly distribute the transmission load across the network, while keeping the total message count low. First, we analytically analyze two underlying causes of unfairness in Trickle networks: 1) desynchronization among nodes and 2) nonuniform topologies. Based on our analysis, we propose a first algorithm whose performance and parameters we study in an emulated environment. From this feedback, we design a second algorithm Trickle-D that adapts the redundancy parameter to achieve high fairness while keeping the transmission load low. We validate Trickle-D in real-life conditions using a large scale experimental testbed. Trickle-D requires minimal changes to Trickle, zero user input, emits 17.7% less messages than state-of-the-art and 37.2% less messages than state-of-practice, while guaranteeing high fairness across the network. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Parameter estimation; Redundancy; Control overhead; Desynchronization; Energy expenditure; Experimental testbed; State of practice; Transient behavior; Transmission loads; Underlying cause; Low power electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037060169

We performed compositional simulation with permeability variation (based on log-normal distribution parameters of measured data from similar formations in an oil field above the aquifer) in order to include changes of aqueous and gaseous phase properties (composition, viscosities, density), and heterogeneity of a regional CO2 storage site. We performed sensitivity tests on vertical permeability multiplier, different grid block sizes, diffusivity and capillary pressures to detect the key parameters for injectivity and storage efficiency. In this way, we modelled heterogeneity of CO2 storage site and possible injection rate in this detail for the first time. Based on pressure analysis in simulation cases, we found that it will be hard to avoid fracturing near-wellbore zone, but fracturing these zones might also increase the injectivity, and this can still be done without damaging the cap rock. Simulation results showed that maximum pressure will occur in zones above wellbores at the short period after the injection, and almost no change of average pressure in regional aquifer will be noticeable, which leads to conclusion that the total (theoretical) storage capacity is not the key issue for CO2 storage in aquifers and that injectivity for storage site (expressed as rate) should be the key parameter for selecting the pilots for CO2 storage. © 2017 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and American Association of Petroleum Geologists.","aquifer; heterogeneous; sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029102168

About 95% of NH3 emissions in Germany originate from agriculture, mainly from livestock husbandry. This case study is aimed at presenting an approach that evaluates NH3 emission abatement measures in agriculture regarding their abatement costs for farmers and their benefits for the society in terms of avoided external costs of health damages and loss of terrestrial biodiversity. Following the impact-pathway chain, an economic-ecological farm model for estimating NH3 emission reductions and abatement costs was combined with an environmental impact assessment model for estimating the benefits for human health and biodiversity. The case study analysed a variety of manure storage cover and application techniques in Lower Saxony, a region in the north-west of Germany with the highest livestock density in Germany and high NH3 emissions. In the reference situation, the damage costs of NH3 emissions were EUR 2.7 billion. The implementation of concrete storage covers and slurry injection, the most effective measures, reduced NH3 emissions by 25% and achieved net benefits of EUR 505 million. Farmers' abatement costs averaged over all farms ranged from EUR 3.6 to 6.8 per kilogramme NH3 reduced. The abatement costs per farm type ranged from EUR 2.4 to 16.6 for floating plastic covers and from EUR 2.2 to 11.4 for concrete covers. The abatement costs for floating plastic covers were lower for grazing livestock specialists, while the abatement costs for concrete covers were lower for pig specialists, poultry specialists and mixed farms. Farm type specific abatement costs for manure application techniques ranged from EUR 4.5 to 9.6 per kilogramme NH3 reduced with little variation between trailing shoe and cultivator/injector techniques. Abatement costs for trailing shoe application were lower than for cultivator/injector application for grazing livestock specialists, poultry specialists and mixed farms. The average benefits per kilogramme NH3 reduced were EUR 14.1 for health and EUR 10.4 for biodiversity, totalling EUR 24.5. As the benefits exceed the abatement costs for all measures analysed in this study, principally, they can be recommended for implementation. However, the variation in abatement potentials and costs per farm type indicate differences in suitability. While manure covers should above all be implemented by pig specialists because of their high abatement potential, manure application techniques should be implemented by grazing livestock specialists. Among manure storage covers, floating plastic covers are more favourable for grazing livestock specialists, whereas concrete covers are more suitable for all other farm types. The analysis with the farm model was considered more appropriate than recent analyses at technical or macroeconomic level, because the abatement costs reflect differences in farm types, detailed production processes and farmers' profit-maximising behaviour. Overall, it can be concluded that an assessment of NH3 emission abatement measures should be carried out for farm types and should consider impacts of NH3 emission abatement both on human health and biodiversity. The presented modelling approach enables to estimate abatement costs for farm types and benefits for human health and biodiversity. Cost-efficient NH3 emission abatement measures tailored to farm types can be identified and farm type specific regional abatement strategies can be developed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural modelling; Air pollution control; Biodiversity loss; Economic-ecological modelling; Environmental impact assessment; Health damage","abatement cost; agricultural emission; agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agricultural worker; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; biodiversity; cost-benefit analysis; damage; ecological economics; ecological modeling; environmental impact assessment; farm; livestock; livestock farming; pollution control; public health; waste facility; Germany; Lower Saxony; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023644093

There is widespread consensus that the sustainable establishment of such strategies requires transdisciplinary approaches, that is, the involvement of internal and external stakeholders (state, civil society and market actors) to become part of the change and find innovative ways to unite their efforts and capacities. However, there is little research and hardly any empirical evidence on the process of stakeholder involvement and co-production in the development of municipal adaptation strategies. Against this background, this paper examines the factors that influence how and why different stakeholders are involved (or excluded) during the processes of developing adaptation strategies, and how this gets reflected in process outcomes. Based on applied participatory analysis of two pioneering municipalities in Germany and Sweden, the paper identifies and contrasts existing patterns to feed back into both theory and practice. Synergies, mismatches, barriers and driving forces for adaptation co-production are identified and contrasted with current adaptation discourses. The results highlight how the level of internal and external stakeholder involvement is conditional on (changes in) the broader governance context, and the associated power constellations in which stakeholders act (e.g., standing of departments, proximity to the decision-making body, changes in [or constellations of] political parties, contractual arrangements for staff, individual champions, progress in mainstreaming). On this basis, conclusions are drawn regarding how to foster sustainable and transformative adaptation through increased stakeholder involvement. The results and conclusions are crucial to advance theory on adaptation co-production, providing a basis for further analyses, research and action. They inform how existing theory, policies and/or guidelines for strategic adaptation planning need to be revisited to support change across current risk governance. © 2017 The Author","Adaptation plan; Adaptation strategy; Co-production; Collaborative governance; Distributed risk governance; Intervention research; Participatory governance; Policy integration","adaptation; Article; climate change; environmental planning; Germany; government; policy; practice guideline; priority journal; strategic planning; Sweden; theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020393619

Because dominant tree species (DTS) play central roles in stabilizing forest ecosystems, to effectively protect forests, we need to pay more attention to the protection of DTS. Furthermore, we need to integrate potential impacts of climate change into conservation efforts of DTS for improving forest protection. We utilized species distribution modeling, coupled with conservation planning, to establish climate-informed conservation prioritization for 136 taxa of DTS in three forest types (broad-leaved forests, mixed broadleaf-conifer forests, and coniferous forests) in China. We considered both current and future distributions and assessed the ability of existing nature reserves in China to protect forests based on these DTS. Regions with the highest climate-informed conservation prioritization were distributed in the southern, southwestern, and northeastern regions of China. There was a small gap between existing nature reserves and predicted conservation prioritization areas for conserving forests: the proportions of overlap between existing reserves and areas prioritized under climate change scenarios were 87.8, 95.7, and 80.4% for broad-leaved forests, mixed broadleaf-conifer forests, and coniferous forests, respectively. Even so, we need to increase the number and/or area of nature reserves to protect coniferous forests in Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and broad-leaved forests in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hu’nan, Yunnan, and Sichuan. Our results demonstrate the importance of conservation planning under climate change, taking both current and future distributions of plant species into consideration.

This paper develops measures to capture the firms' unified (operational and environmental) performance using data envelopment analysis, and examines the effects of different climate change mitigation technologies on the unified performance. The research finds that the adoption of low-carbon energy technology positively and significantly affects the unified performance, whereas the adoption of pollution control technology has a significantly negative effect. Moreover, increasing the share of investment in low-carbon energy out of total technology investment can positively and significantly affect the unified performance, and the share of pollution control has a negative and significant effect. The other technologies do not display significant impacts on unified performance.

To track the energy structure, the conversions, efficiencies, end consumptions of total energy and coal and the whole CO 2 emission status, the energy flow, coal flow and CO 2 flow in 2015 were, respectively, drawn at the national level based on Sankey diagrams. Besides, each provincial fossil fuel structure, CO 2 structure and CO 2 intensity were calculated and plotted. It is mainly found that China’s energy structure consisted of 69.2% of coal, 19.9% of oil, 6.3% of natural gas and 4.7% of non-fossil energy, where 45.5% of energy was consumed by industry and 23.9% by losses and statistical difference; coal was distributed to industry (55.6%), etc., with a utilization rate of 70.1%; and CO 2 were derived from coal (84.7%), oil (11.1%) and natural gas (4.2%), of which 39.0% was released through the process of thermal power generation and 19.4% by industry. The structures of fossil fuels and their CO 2 emissions together with the evolution of CO 2 intensity at the provincial level and the regional level were also given. Besides, two pieces of policy implications were proposed to provide the government with reference. © 2017, Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbon dioxide flow; CO 2 intensity; Coal flow; Energy flow; Fossil fuel; Utilization efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051847081

The fate of SOC in cropland soils plays a significant role in both sustainable agricultural production and climate change mitigation. The spatiotemporal changes of soil organic carbon in croplands in response to different carbon (C) input management and environmental conditions across the main global cereal systems were studied using a modeling approach. We also identified the key variables that drive SOC changes at a high spatial resolution (0.1°ĝ€ × ĝ€0.1°) and over a long timescale (54 years from 1961 to 2014). A widely used soil C turnover model (RothC) and state-of-the-art databases of soil and climate variables were used in the present study. The model simulations suggested that, on a global average, the cropland SOC density increased at annual rates of 0.22, 0.45 and 0.69ĝ€Mgĝ€Cĝ€haĝ'1ĝ€yrĝ'1 under crop residue retention rates of 30, 60 and 90ĝ€%, respectively. Increasing the quantity of C input could enhance soil C sequestration or reduce the rate of soil C loss, depending largely on the local soil and climate conditions. Spatially, under a specific crop residue retention rate, relatively higher soil C sinks were found across the central parts of the USA, western Europe, and the northern regions of China. Relatively smaller soil C sinks occurred in the high-latitude regions of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and SOC decreased across the equatorial zones of Asia, Africa and America. We found that SOC change was significantly influenced by the crop residue retention rate (linearly positive) and the edaphic variable of initial SOC content (linearly negative). Temperature had weak negative effects, and precipitation had significantly negative impacts on SOC changes. The results can help guide carbon input management practices to effectively mitigate climate change through soil C sequestration in croplands on a global scale, ©Authors 2017.",,"agricultural land; carbon sink; cereal; crop residue; cropping practice; environmental conditions; modeling; organic carbon; soil organic matter; Africa; China; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030786810

A series of stringent emission-reduction measures were implemented in Beijing and neighbouring regions to ensure good air quality in Beijing. PM2.5 concentrations and major components (water-soluble ions and carbonaceous aerosol) were analyzed and compared between the two events. PM2.5 concentration during control demonstrated a decreasing trend with 51.6%–65.1% and 34.2%–64.7% compared to no control during APEC and Parade, respectively. The water-soluble ions and carbonaceous aerosol concentrations also decreased obviously. The lower secondary inorganic ions (SIA, including SO42 −, NO3−, and NH4+) percentage (31.7%–38.3%) during control indicated the relative weak contribution of atmospheric chemical processes. Due to the unfavorable weather conditions and increased emissions during coal-fired heating, the relative higher organic carbon (OC), secondary organic carbon (SOC), secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations during APEC was found. The WRF-CMAQ modeling system was also used to quantify the effect of emission-reduction and different sources controls on PM2.5. The results indicated PM2.5 decrease by 30.4% and 34.2% under control during APEC and Parade, respectively. We found that the local emission-reduction in Beijing contributes more to “APEC blue” (20.8%) and “Parade blue” (25.8%) in Beijing than those from neighbouring regions of Beijing, and meteorological condition was more beneficial for the improvement of the air quality during Parade than APEC. The emission source apportionment to PM2.5 in Beijing indicated that PM2.5 concentration increased by 13.5% and 14.7% during APEC and Parade, respectively if no vehicles emission-reduction measures were taken in Beijing. © 2017","APEC; Carbonaceous aerosol; Emission control evaluation; Parade; PM2.5 pollution; Water-soluble ions","Aerosols; Air quality; Ions; Organic carbon; Water pollution; APEC; Carbonaceous aerosol; Economic Co-operation; Meteorological condition; Parade; Secondary organic aerosols; Secondary organic carbons (SOC); Water-soluble ions; Emission control; organic carbon; aerosol; air quality; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; emission control; implementation process; organic carbon; particulate matter; reduction; source apportionment; traffic emission; trend analysis; air analysis; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; airflow; Article; atmospheric dispersion; biomass; China; coal combustion; combustion; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; high temperature; low temperature; particulate matter; photooxidation; secondary organic aerosol; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Shijiazhuang; Tangshan; Sia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016456081

Brucellosis remains rampant worldwide in both domesticated animals and humans. This study used human brucellosis (HB) as a test case to identify important environmental determinants of the disease and predict its outbreaks. A novel artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed, using annual county-level numbers of HB cases and data on 37 environmental variables, potentially associated with HB in Inner Mongolia, China. Data from 2006 to 2008 were used to train, validate and test the model, while data for 2009-2010 were used to assess the model's performance. The Enhanced Vegetation Index was identified as the most important predictor of HB incidence, followed by land surface temperature and other temperature- and precipitation-related variables. The suitable ecological niche of HB was modeled based on these predictors. Model estimates were found to be in good agreement with reported numbers of HB cases in both the model development and assessment phases. The study suggests that HB outbreaks may be predicted, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, using the ANN model and environmental variables obtained from satellite data. The study deepened the understanding of environmental determinants of HB and advanced the methodology for prediction of climate-sensitive infectious disease outbreaks. © 2017 by the authors.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Brucellosis; Climate-sensitive; Disease outbreak prediction; Environmental health; Infectious disease; Inner Mongolia; Remote sensing","Diseases; Environmental technology; Forecasting; Neural networks; Brucellosis; Climate-sensitive; Disease outbreaks; Environmental health; Infectious disease; Inner Mongolia; Remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032877261

China's non-ferrous metals industry is energy intensive, accounting for 24% of the total industrial energy consumption in 2011. In this study, we adopted a non-radial DEA model to examine the energy-environmental performance of the non-ferrous metals industry from a regional perspective during the 2006–2011 period. The energy-environmental performance was evaluated by the eco-efficiency under natural disposability (EN), eco-efficiency under managerial disposability (EM), eco-efficiency under natural and managerial disposability (ENM) and ENM with desirable congestion (ENM (DC)). Based on the EN, both the energy conservation and emission reduction potentials were calculated. Additionally, the investment strategy was confirmed by regional types of damages to return (DTR). In the second-stage study, the factors influencing eco-efficiency were measured using Tobit regression and truncated regression models. The results indicated that the efficiency scores of EN, EM, ENM and ENM (DC) were considerably different. Investment was effective in improving the energy-environmental performance for twenty-one regions during the whole study period. Henan had the highest energy conservation and emission reduction potentials. The results obtained from the regression models were similar, which displayed that the population density and energy price were responsible for the increase in eco-efficiency while economic development level and industrial structure affected eco-efficiency negatively. Based on these results, policy recommendations for the non-ferrous metals industry to improve their performance in a low-carbon economy are suggested. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy conservation; Energy-environmental performance; Investment strategy; Non-ferrous metals industry; Non-radial DEA model","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Industrial economics; Iron; Managers; Metals; Nonferrous metals; Planning; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Strategic planning; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental performance; Industrial energy consumption; Industrial structures; Investment strategy; Non-ferrous metals industry; Non-radial DEA models; Policy recommendations; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959568707

The electron transport layer (ETL) is regarded as a crucial medium in transporting electrons and blocking holes for PSCs. In this study, CO2 plasma generated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was introduced to modify the TiO2 ETL. The results indicated that the CO2 plasma-treated compact TiO2 layer exhibited better surface hydrophilicity, higher conductivity, and lower bulk defect state density in comparison with the pristine TiO2 film. The quality of the stoichiometric TiO2 structure was improved, and the concentration of oxygen-deficiencyinduced defect sites was reduced significantly after CO2 plasma treatment for 90 s. The PSCs with the TiO2 film treated by CO2 plasma for 90 s exhibited simultaneously improved short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor.

Conventional atmospheric dispersion models can seldom give accurate predictions due to inaccurate input parameters. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of dispersion models, two data assimilation methods (i.e., the typical particle filter & the combination of a particle filter and expectation-maximization algorithm) are proposed to assimilate the virtual Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) observations with measurement error into the atmospheric dispersion model. Two emission cases with different dimensions of state parameters are considered. To test the performances of the proposed methods, two numerical experiments corresponding to the two emission cases are designed and implemented. The results show that the particle filter can effectively estimate the model parameters and improve the accuracy of model predictions when the dimension of state parameters is relatively low. In contrast, when the dimension of state parameters becomes higher, the method of particle filter combining the expectation-maximization algorithm performs better in terms of the parameter estimation accuracy. Therefore, the proposed data assimilation methods are able to effectively support air quality monitoring and emergency management in chemical industry parks. © 2017 by the authors.","Air contaminant dispersion; Data assimilation; Expectation-maximization algorithm; Particle filter","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Bandpass filters; Chemical industry; Civil defense; Contamination; Disasters; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Maximum principle; Monte Carlo methods; Numerical methods; Risk management; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Air contaminants; Atmospheric dispersion modeling; Atmospheric dispersion models; Chemical industry parks; Data assimilation; Data assimilation methods; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Particle filter; Air filters; air quality; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; data assimilation; filter; monitoring; prediction; unmanned vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029830230

In this work, a carbon nanotube (CNT)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Si nanoparticle composite with alternated structure as Li-ion battery anode is prepared. In this structure, rGO completely wraps the entire Si/CNT networks by different layers and CNT networks provide fast electron transport pathways with reduced solid-state diffusion, so that the stable solid-electrolyte interphase layer can form on the whole surface of the matrix instead of on single Si nanoparticle, which ensure the high cycle stability to achieve the excellent cycle performance.

Numerical simulation is becoming an important vehicle to enhance the understanding of these changes and their impacts, with regional and global simulation models producing vast amounts of data.

PolarGlobe is implemented upon an emerging web graphics library, WebGL, and an open source virtual globe system Cesium, which has the ability to map spatial data onto a virtual Earth. We have also integrated volume rendering techniques, value and spatial filters, and vertical profile visualization to improve rendered images and support a comprehensive exploration of multi-dimensional spatial data. In this study, the climate simulation dataset produced by the extended polar version of the well-known Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) is used to test the proposed techniques.

In this study, we quantified the temporal trends and spatial variations of spring phenology and snow cover across the Tibetan Plateau by calibrating and analyzing time series of the NOAA AVHRR-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during 1983–2012. We also examined how snow cover dynamics affect the spatio-temporal pattern of spring alpine vegetation phenology over the plateau. Our results indicated that 52.21% of the plateau experienced a significant advancing trend in the beginning of vegetation growing season (BGS) and 34.30% exhibited a delaying trend. Accordingly, the snow cover duration days (SCD) and snow cover melt date (SCM) showed similar patterns with a decreasing trend in the west and an increasing trend in the southeast, but the start date of snow cover (SCS) showed an opposite pattern. Meanwhile, the spatial patterns of the BGS, SCD, SCS and SCM varied in accordance with the gradients of temperature, precipitation and topography across the plateau. The response relationship of spring phenology to snow cover dynamics varied within different climate, terrain and alpine plant community zones, and the spatio-temporal response patterns were primarily controlled by the long-term local heat-water conditions and topographic conditions. Moreover, temperature and precipitation played a profound impact on diverse responses of spring phenology to snow cover dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine vegetation; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Snow cover; Spring phenology; The Tibetan Plateau","Dynamics; Vegetation; Normalized difference vegetation index; Snow cover durations; Snow covers; Snow-cover dynamics; Spatiotemporal patterns; Tibetan Plateau; Topographic conditions; Vegetation phenology; Snow; alpine environment; AVHRR; NDVI; NOAA satellite; phenology; snow cover; spatiotemporal analysis; spring (hydrology); vegetation structure; alpine vegetation phenology; Article; calibration; China; climate change; environmental impact; environmental parameters; growing season; heat water condition; normalized difference vegetation index; phenology; plant community; precipitation; seasonal variation; snow cover; spring; temperature sensitivity; topography; vegetation dynamics; ecosystem; plant development; season; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature; Tibet; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; snow; China; Ecosystem; Plant Development; Seasons; Snow; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Temperature; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015994234

In the present study,“3S” (GIS, RS, GPS) technology, the Equivalence Factor Evaluation Method of Ecosystem Services and the Index System Evaluation Method of Human Well-being were separately used to analyze land use changes, ecosystem services and human well-being in the Manas River Basin in 2003 and 2013 and to characterize the relationship between these factors. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. In the past ten years, driven by the market economy, the structure of land use in the basin has obviously changed. Croplands and developed lands markedly increased, leading to a marked reduction in aquatic, grassland and woodland regions. 2. The land use changes resulted in a large increase in human economic income, in contrast with the obvious decrease in the value of climate regulation, gas regulation and other various types of ecosystem services influenced by the decrease in grasslands, woodlands and aquatic regions. 3. Most aspects of human well-being were improved. The most important aspect was the economic income well-being as a result of land use changes. However, the well-being associated with natural ecological resources showed a significant decline. 4. The extreme increase of croplands and developed lands has resulted in a structural imbalance of the ecosystem services and abnormal development of the structure of human well-being. Thus, to enhance the stability of the “nature-society-economy” system of the basin and pursue sustainable development, it is imperative to slow down or even stop the existing development trend of land use, and it is urgent to improve the structure of ecosystem services and human well-being. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Human well-being; Land use change; Manas River Basin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028959497

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) use both electricity and gasoline to propel the vehicle, and is being recognized as a potential alternative to conventional vehicles. PHEVs offer opportunity to use electric energy generated by renewable resources and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The electric energy requirement of PHEV can, however, cause negative impacts on the power system reliability, especially when the size of a PHEV fleet is relatively large. This paper presents the development of a probabilistic model considering the driving distance, charging times, charging locations, battery state of charge, and charging requirements of a PHEV. A methodology using hybrid analytical and Monte Carlo simulation approach is presented to evaluate the reliability of a power system integrated with PHEVs, considering the important PHEV characteristics, charging scenarios, and power system parameters.

The study of the interfacial characteristics and charge transfer mechanisms by doping of PCBM were analyzed by material and electrical measurements. Doping of PCBM does not affect the size and crystallinity of perovskite films, but has an impact on carrier extraction in perovskite MOS devices. The electrical hysteresis observed in capacitance-voltage and current-voltage measurements can be alleviated by doping of PCBM. Experimental results demonstrate that extremely low trap densities are found for the perovskite device without doping, while the doped sample leads to higher density of interface state. Three mechanisms including Ohm's law, trap-filled-limit (TFL) emission, and child's law were used to analyze possible charge transfer mechanisms. Ohm's law mechanism is well suitable for charge transfer of both the perovskite MOS devices under light condition at large voltage, while TFL emission well addresses the behavior of charge transfer under dark at small voltage.

The urban transportation sector is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China and India. The goal of this study is to analyze the characteristics and factors of CO2 emissions produced by commuters in Chinese and Indian cities and thus to identify strategies for reducing transportation CO2 emissions and mitigating global climate change. Xi’an in China and Bangalore in India were chosen as two case study cities for their representativeness of major cities in China and India. The trends of CO2 emissions produced by major traffic modes (electric motors, buses, and cars) in major cities of China and India were predicted and analyzed. The spatial distributions of CO2 emissions produced by commuters in both cities were assessed using spatial analysis module in ArcGIS (Geographic Information System) software. Tobit models were then developed to investigate the impact factors of the emissions. The study has several findings. Firstly, in both cities, the increase of vehicle occupancy could reduce commuting CO2 emissions by 20 to 50 % or conversely, if vehicle occupancy reduces, an increase by 33.33 to 66.67 %. It is estimated that, with the current increasing speed of CO2 emissions in Xi’an, the total CO2 emissions from electric motors, buses, and cars in major cities of China and India will be increased from 135 × 106 t in 2012 to 961 × 106 t in 2030, accounting for 0.37 to 2.67 % of the total global CO2 emissions of 2013, which is significant for global climate change. Secondly, households and individuals in the outer areas of both cities produce higher emissions than those in the inner areas. Thirdly, the lower emissions in Xi’an are due to the higher density and more compact urban pattern, shorter commuting distances, higher transit shares, and more clean energy vehicles. The more dispersed and extensive urban sprawl and the prevalence of two-wheeler motorbikes (two-wheeler motorbike is abbreviated as “two-wheeler” in the following sections) fueled by gasoline cause higher emissions in Bangalore. Fourthly, car availability, higher household income, living outside the 2nd or Outer Ring Road, distance from the bus stop, and working in the foreign companies in Bangalore are significant and positive factors of commuting CO2 emissions. Fifthly, “70-20” and “50-20” (this means that generally, 20 % of commuters and households produce 70 % of total emissions in Xi’an and 20 % of commuters and households produce 50 % of total emissions in Bangalore) emission patterns exist in Xi’an and Bangalore, respectively. Several strategies have been proposed to reduce urban CO2 emissions produced by commuters and further to mitigate global climate change. Firstly, in the early stage of fast urbanization, enough monetary and land investment should be ensured to develop rail transit or rapid bus routes from outer areas to inner areas in the cities to avoid high dependency on cars, thus to implement the transit-oriented development (TOD), which is the key for Chinese and Indian cities to mitigate the impact on global climate change caused by CO2 emissions. Secondly, in Bangalore, it is necessary to improve public transit service and increase the bus stop coverage combined with car demand controls along the ring roads, in the outer areas, and in the industry areas where Indian foreign companies and the governments are located. Thirdly, Indian should put more efforts to provide alternative cleaner transport modes while China should put more efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from high emitters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","China and India; CO2 emissions by commuters; Global climate change; Impact factor; Spatial distribution; Urban transportation","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; economic growth; emission control; GIS; global climate; government; household income; software; spatial distribution; traffic emission; transport vehicle; urban area; urban sprawl; urban transport; urbanization; Bengaluru; China; India; India; Karnataka; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960435498

Indeed, waste-to-energy plays a crucial role in addressing various environmental issues such as climate change and security of energy supply. Two waste-to-energy approaches were compared with simple landfill in this study, i.e. incineration with energy recovery (electricity and heat), and landfill with landfill gas utilization. It is imperative to investigate which approach is more effective in terms of GHG emission reduction in the context of different climatic conditions. The effects on GHG emission reductions are examined in the Temperate Dry Zone and Tropical Moist Zone. An assumption is made that in 2020, the waste disposal approach will be switched from simple landfill to waste-to-energy approach in China. The contribution of different waste disposal approach to the GHG reduction (1 t municipal solid waste annually) during 2020–2060 is examined in this paper. Both landfill gas utilization and incineration with energy recovery approaches reduce GHG emissions in all cases compared to the simple landfill. However, this study revealed that landfill gas power generation system is more effective in the Tropical Moist Zone, whereas incineration with energy recovery is a better choice in the Temperate Dry Zone according to the comprehensive benefit. Similarly, the improvement of landfill gas collection rate and the heat recovery efficiency play a crucial role to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during the process of managing the municipal solid waste. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Avoided emissions; Greenhouse gas; Municipal solid waste; Waste-to-energy","Biogas; Climate change; Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy security; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Land fill; Recovery; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Avoided emissions; Climatic conditions; Comprehensive benefit; Energy recovery; Environmental issues; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Heat recovery efficiency; Waste to energy; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945929267

The local climate zone (LCZ) classification scheme is employed to examine the diversity and complexity of the climate response within a city. This study suggests that zonal practice could be an efficient way to bridge the knowledge gap between climate research and urban planning. Urban surfaces classified by LCZ are designated as urban climate landscapes, which extends the LCZ concept to urban planning applications. Selecting Wuhan as a case study, we attempt to explore the climatic effect of landscape patterns. Thermal effects are compared across the urban climate landscapes, and the relationships between patch metrics and land surface temperature (LST) are quantified. Results indicate that climate landscape layout is a considerable factor impacting local urban climate. ForWuhan, 500 m is an optimal scale for exploring landscape pattern-temperature relationships. Temperature contrast between surrounding landscape patches has a major influence on LST. Generally, fragmental landscape patches contribute to heat release. For most climate landscape types, patch metrics also have a significant effect on thermal response. When three metrics are included as predictive variables, 53.3% of the heating intensity variation can be explained for the Large Lowrise landscape, while 57.4% of the cooling intensity variation can be explained for the Water landscape. Therefore, this article claims that land-based layout optimization strategy at local scale, which conforms to planning manner, should be taken into account in terms of heat management. © 2017 by the authors.","Local climate zone (LCZ); Mitigation and adaptation strategy; Urban climate; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban landscape; Urban planning","adaptive management; heat island; heating; land surface; landscape structure; optimization; surface temperature; urban climate; urban planning; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029811440

To explain the contradictory phenomena, an observation-based box model (OBM) coupled with CB05 mechanism was applied in order to understand the influence of both locally produced O3 and regional transport. The simulation of locally produced O3 showed an increasing trend in spring, a decreasing trend in autumn, and no changes in summer and winter. The O3 increase in spring was caused by the net effect of more rapid decrease in NO titration and unchanged TVOC reactivity despite decreased TVOC mixing ratios, while the decreased local O3 formation in autumn was mainly due to the reduction of aromatic VOC mixing ratios and the TVOC reactivity and much slower decrease in NO titration. However, the decreased in situ O3 formation in autumn was overridden by the regional contribution, resulting in elevated O3 observations. Furthermore, the OBM-derived relative incremental reactivity indicated that the O3 formation was VOC-limited in all seasons, and that the long-term O3 formation was more sensitive to VOCs and less to NOx and CO in the past 10 years. In addition, the OBM results found that the contributions of aromatics to O3 formation decreased in all seasons of these years, particularly in autumn, probably due to the effective control of solvent-related sources. In contrast, the contributions of alkenes increased, suggesting a continuing need to reduce traffic emissions.

Conservation tillage is extensively used in northern China, which alters the soil structure and nutrient conditions, causing changes in the soil microbial community. However, the influence of conservation tillage on rhizosphere bacteria during plant growth, and associations with plant root nutrient efficiency, and plant productivity remains unclear, particularly regarding the effects on the stability of the soil bacterial community that modifies plant growth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the contributions of conservation (chisel plow, zero) tillage and conventional (plow) tillage on the soil rhizosphere bacterial community throughout plant growth. The responses and succession of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of winter wheat crops growing under conservation and conventional tillage practices were determined through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA. The response of plant growth was determined by measuring plant carbon and nitrogen accumulation from the wheat tillering stage to the flowering stage. Here, we show that variations in rhizosphere alpha and beta diversity throughout plant growth had the greatest contributions to distinguishing conventional plow tillage from conservation (chisel plow, zero) tillage. Additionally, zero tillage (dissimilarity: 11.3%) had less of an effect on the relative abundances of Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-) and Bacteroidetes in the rhizosphere in response to plant growth as compared with plow tillage (dissimilarity: 21.7%). This is the first in-depth study of the effects of conservation and conventional tillage on the stability of rhizosphere bacterial community in response to plant growth. Furthermore, our study indicates that conservation tillage can modify the soil conditions and preserve rhizosphere bacterial memberships. The consequent enhanced stability of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria population can help to establish a profitable agroecosystem to in turn enhance soil nutrient conditions and improve plant production sustainably. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.","Bacterial community; Conservation tillage; Plant growth; Rhizosphere; Stability","agricultural ecosystem; bacterium; community response; conservation tillage; growth; microbial community; nutrient cycling; plant; relative abundance; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Proteobacteria; Rhizobiales; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029751064

As standard tools different Life Cycle Assessment methods have been established, which are continuously improved. While those are designed for evaluating single processes they run into difficulties when it comes to assessing environmental impacts of process innovations at macroeconomic level. In this paper we develop a multi-step evaluation framework building on multi regional input–output data that allows estimating macroeconomic impacts of new process technologies, considering the network characteristics of the global economy. Our procedure is as follows: i) we measure differences in material usage of process alternatives, ii) we identify where the standard processes are located within economic networks and virtually replace those by innovative process technologies, iii) we account for changes within economic systems and evaluate impacts on emissions. Within this paper we exemplarily apply the methodology to two recently developed innovative technologies: longitudinal large diameter steel pipe welding and turning of high-temperature resistant materials. While we find the macroeconomic impacts of very specific process innovations to be small, its conclusions can significantly differ from traditional process based approaches. Furthermore, information gained from the methodology provides relevant additional insights for decision makers extending the picture gained from traditional process life cycle assessment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Economic wide technology replacement; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life-cycle assessment; Multi-regional input–output data; Process innovations; Sustainability assessment","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Emission control; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Innovation; Sustainable development; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Input-output data; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Process Innovation; Sustainability assessment; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959497781

However, lack of spatially explicit and accurate information on carbon exchange components from diverse forest ecosystem types in India limits carbon budgeting on a regional scale. Remote-sensing-driven ecosystem models are well-established tools for estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) over large areas but they are seldom found erroneous if implemented without proper calibration of biome-specific parameters. The present study evaluates the combined use of eddy covariance (EC) data and satellite-derived variables for estimating GPP over large areas. Four remote-sensing-driven models, (i) temperature–greenness (TG) model, (ii) greenness– radiation (GR) model, (iii) light use efficiency (LUE) model, and (iv) remote-sensing-based LUE (LUERS) model, were parameterized with EC measurements and compared with 8-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP products for a moist Shorea robusta forest in northern part of India. EC observed 8-day average GPP varied from 5.38 to 12.42 g C m−2 day−1. Among the four tested models, TG model had the highest root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.28 g C m−2 day−1, while GR and LUERS models had moderate RMSE of 0.99 g C m−2 day−1 and 0.98 g C m−2 day−1, respectively. The closest GPP estimate was given by LUE model with RMSE of 0.93 g C m−2 day−1. The RMSE for all four models were four times lower than that of MODIS GPP. Lower maximum LUE (εmax Þand uncertainty in the environmental scalar used in MODIS GPP algorithm could have contributed to higher RMSE. More accurate modelling of GPP can help in better understanding of forest ecological functions with the changing climate. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Budget control; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Changing climate; Ecological functions; Forest ecosystem; Gross primary productivity; Light use efficiency; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Root mean square errors; Spatially explicit; Remote sensing; algorithm; carbon budget; climate change; forest ecosystem; MODIS; parameterization; primary production; remote sensing; satellite data; India; Shorea robusta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046266203

Land degradation increases the vulnerability of agroecological systems to climate change and reduces the effectiveness of adaptation options. Yet these interactions have largely been omitted from climate impact assessments and adaptation planning. We examine how land degradation can influence climate-change impacts and the adaptive capacity of crop and livestock producers across agroecological systems. We then present novel strategies for climate-resilient agriculture that support opportunities to integrate responses to these challenges. Forward-looking, climate-resilient agriculture requires: (1) incorporation of land degradation processes, and their linkages with adaptive capacity, into adaptation planning; (2) identification of key vulnerabilities to prioritize adaptation responses; (3) improved knowledge exchange across local to global scales to support strategies for developing the adaptive capacity of producers; and (4) innovative management and policy options that provide multiple “wins” for land, climate, and biodiversity, thus enabling global development and food security goals to be achieved. © The Ecological Society of America",,"adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; environmental policy; food security; land degradation; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028767653

This article examines this global science-policy ecosystem using the case of climate services produced by Australian science agencies for consumption in adaptation programming in the Pacific Island countries of Kiribati and Solomon Islands. Linking research on geographies of marketization and the neoliberalization of science, I demonstrate that within the climate service movement a focus on usefulness is paired with an emphasis on commercialization. As a result, this case shows the inherent tensions in the climate service model: first, a focus on competition and circulating service products at the expense of collaborative relationships; second, difficulties in negotiating uncertainty; and third contradictions between ‘objective’ and ‘entrepreneurial’ science. In each of these instances, the commercialized mechanisms through which climate services are governed, and the political economic circumstances within which they are produced, magnify rather than ameliorate gaps between science and policy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Climate science; Climate services; Commercialization; Neoliberalization","adaptive management; climate change; commercialization; decision making; ecosystem service; environmental policy; neoliberalism; political economy; Kiribati; Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024400709

Numerical models allow water managers to evaluate the combined effects of climate and water management on the biogeochemical processes thereby identifying opportunities to optimize water management to protect ecosystem function, biodiversity and associated services. We used a 3D hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with an aquatic ecosystem dynamic model (CAEDYM) to compare two scenarios across three climatic and hydrologic conditions (extreme wet, extreme dry and average) for Deadwood Reservoir (USA). Additionally, we collected water temperature, water chemistry and biological data from the reservoir and inflowing tributaries to validate the model, as well as migration and growth data from Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) the top predator of the food web. Modeled scenarios identified that reducing minimum outflows from 1.4 to 0.06 m3 s−1 during the fall and winter months resulted in higher reservoir elevations and cooler water temperatures the following year, which extended reservoir rearing during the summer and fall seasons. The scenarios with reduced stream flow during the fall and winter seasons indicate benefits to the reservoir ecosystem, particularly during dry years, and could reduce the effects of climatic warming. © 2017, Springer International Publishing.","Aquatic ecosystem; Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus); ELCOM-CAEDYM; Fish habitat; Reservoir; Water operations","aquatic ecosystem; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; food web; hydrological regime; mountain environment; operations technology; reservoir; salmonid; streamflow; Pacific Northwest; United States; Salvelinus confluentus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019840870

The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research. First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the ‘main experiment’, where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity–stability theory. Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness. Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above- than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances. Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle. Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above- and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions. Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes. Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse ‘High Nature Value Grasslands’ are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services. A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort (in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments. To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible. © 2017 The Authors","Biomass; Carbon storage; Complementarity; Multi-trophic interactions; Nutrient cycling; Selection effect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029155355

Expected benefits of adoption are lower than the reported realisation, and this finding is significant for some categories such as competitive market advantage and relationships with regulators. Findings regarding the effect of ISO on environmental performance are mixed, but generally point to a relatively limited effect. We conclude that, even if ISO 14001 has a moderate effect on firm environmental action, the structural barriers in the US generally limit the viability of these types of voluntary policy. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

The review structure considers the market, technical, supply, environmental, institutional, and future contexts. The main global conclusions are low utilisation of district heating in buildings, varying implementation rates with respect to countries, moderate commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, low recognition of possible carbon dioxide emission reductions, and low awareness in general of the district heating and cooling benefits. The cold deliveries from district cooling systems are much smaller than heat deliveries from district heating systems. The European situation can be characterised by higher commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, lower specific carbon dioxide emissions, and higher awareness of the district heating and cooling benefits. The conclusions obtained from the six contexts analysed show that district heating and cooling systems have strong potentials to be viable heat and cold supply options in a future world. However, more efforts are required for identification, assessment, and implementation of these potentials in order to harvest the global benefits with district heating and cooling. © 2017 The Author","Carbon dioxide emissions; District cooling; District heating; Energy efficiency; Heat recycling","Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Cooling systems; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Thermoelectric equipment; Carbon dioxide emissions; District cooling; District cooling system; District heating and cooling; District heating and cooling systems; District heating system; Heat delivery; In-buildings; District heating; annual review; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cooling; energy efficiency; heating; recycling",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017504983

Previous studies have estimated carbon accumulation rates across Russia based on large-scale modelling. Studies that assess carbon sequestration on abandoned land based on robust field sampling are rare. We investigated soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks using a randomized sampling design along a climatic gradient from forest steppe to Sub-Taiga in Western Siberia (Tyumen Province). In total, SOC contents were sampled on 470 plots across different soil and land-use types. The effect of land use on changes in SOC stock was evaluated, and carbon sequestration rates were calculated for different age stages of abandoned cropland. While land-use type had an effect on carbon accumulation in the topsoil (0–5 cm), no independent land-use effects were found for deeper SOC stocks. Topsoil carbon stocks of grasslands and forests were significantly higher than those of soils managed for crops and under abandoned cropland. SOC increased significantly with time since abandonment. The average carbon sequestration rate for soils of abandoned cropland was 0.66 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 (1–20 years old, 0–5 cm soil depth), which is at the lower end of published estimates for Russia and Siberia. There was a tendency towards SOC saturation on abandoned land as sequestration rates were much higher for recently abandoned (1–10 years old, 1.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) compared to earlier abandoned crop fields (11–20 years old, 0.26 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). Our study confirms the global significance of abandoned cropland in Russia for carbon sequestration. Our findings also suggest that robust regional surveys based on a large number of samples advance model-based continent-wide SOC prediction. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon sequestration; climate change mitigation; land-use change; self-restoration; soil organic carbon; Western Siberia","abandoned land; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; climate change; inventory; land use change; soil carbon; soil organic matter; topsoil; Russian Federation; Siberia; Tyumen; carbon; soil; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; China; crop; Russian Federation; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Crops, Agricultural; Russia; Siberia; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013865624

The pollutants included in this inventory include VOC&lt; NOx, PM2.5, PM10, NH3, and SO2. Emission inventories are needed to develop and assess new control strategies that the states may use in attainment demonstration SIP for the new NAAQS for ozone and PM2.5. The inventory may also serve as part of statewide inventories for purposes of regional modeling in ozone and Regional haze transport areas. The inventory plays an important role in modeling demonstrations for areas classified as nonattainment for ozone, CO, and PM2.5.

The increase has been driven by land clearing, increased coal mining, and increased production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). The electricity sector is the major contributor to the total emissions. Coal has been and continues to be a major source of low-cost energy and foreign income source. Nevertheless, Australia's renewable energy resources have the potential to meet the total energy requirements of the country. Hydroenergy is the largest source of renewable energy used for electricity generation. Government policies, both at the Federal and State levels, have increased the use of wind and solar power in recent years. Despite this, Australia's electricity supply will remain dominated by fossil fuels. Australian Government energy policy has been to keep a balance between environmental and economic concerns. There are efforts being made to reduce emissions from coal and gas using carbon capture and storage (CCS). There are some impediments to Australia's increasing the renewable energy supply in the short-to-medium terms.

However, the nutrient and sediment reduction efficiencies of these novel designs are virtually unknown, and the possibility of increasing riverine flow in the Chesapeake Bay watershed associated with climate change this century necessitates an evaluation of their performance to develop and utilize those that optimize reductions in nutrient and sediment fluxes. We compare pre- and post-construction loads (total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS)) from RSCs (i.e., upland BMPs) and a SWC (i.e., stream restoration) constructed at the outflow of a highly developed watershed in the Coastal Plain physiographic province of Maryland. The largest of the two RSCs performed best in relation to expected nutrient and sediment reductions because of superior water retention capability. By the length of river reach restored, the SWC attained from 79 to 88% of its N reduction TMDL goal, but only 19 to 23 and 2.7 to 3.1% for TP and TSS, respectively; by watershed area, % attainments of TMDL goals were much lower. Results indicate that SWCs have the potential to curtail N loading from developed catchments, but additional water quality benefits may be limited. Climate change projections indicate that there will be an increased frequency of larger-volume storms that will result in an increase in stormflow runoff from urban areas, and increased pollutant loads will likely curtail potential gains made by efforts to achieve TMDL goals. Given the large-scale implementation of BMPs currently underway to accommodate the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, the restoration community needs to adopt a concerted strategy of building climate resilience into many types of urban BMPs to help attain and maintain loads at TMDL levels in anticipation of a progressively wetter climate throughout this century. © 2017, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Best management practices (BMPs); Climate change; Nutrients; Stream restoration; Total maximum daily load (TMDL)","best management practice; climate change; coastal plain; environmental restoration; nitrogen; nutrient; outflow; performance assessment; phosphorus; runoff; sediment transport; standard (reference); stormwater; stream; suspended load; urban area; water retention; watershed; wetland; Chesapeake Bay; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014102548

Analyzing household survey data, this research identifies household, institutional, and agroecological factors that influence how water-stressed farmers are working to adapt to changing conditions and how the strategies they employ impact rice yields. Paralleling studies conducted elsewhere, we identified institutional factors as particularly relevant in farmer adaptation decisions. Notably, our research identified farmers’ use of hybrid seed varietals as the only local climate adaptation strategy to positively correlate with farmers’ rice yields. These findings provide insight into additional factors pertinent to successful agricultural adaptation and offer encouraging evidence for policies that promote plant breeding and distribution in Sri Lanka as a means to buffer the food system to climate change-exacerbated drought. © 2017, The Author(s).","Agricultural adaptation; Climate change; Irrigated agriculture; Sri Lanka","agriculture; climate change; family size; human; Sri Lanka; water supply; Agriculture; Climate Change; Family Characteristics; Humans; Sri Lanka; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013106419

This article summarizes the first national-level, integrated assessment of the future costs and benefits of existing RPS policies; the same metrics are evaluated under a second scenario in which widespread expansion of these policies is assumed to occur. Depending on assumptions about renewable energy technology advancement and natural gas prices, existing RPS policies increase electric system costs by as much as $31 billion, on a present-value basis over 2015-2050. The expanded renewable deployment scenario yields incremental costs that range from $23 billion to $194 billion, depending on the assumptions employed. The monetized value of improved air quality and reduced climate damages exceed these costs. Using central assumptions, existing RPS policies yield $97 billion in air-pollution health benefits and $161 billion in climate damage reductions. Under the expanded RPS case, health benefits total $558 billion and climate benefits equal $599 billion. These scenarios also yield benefits in the form of reduced water use. RPS programs are not likely to represent the most cost effective path towards achieving air quality and climate benefits. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that US RPS programs are, on a national basis, cost effective when considering externalities. © 2017 The Author(s).

In this context, gasoline-like fuels have been recently identified as good candidates. Straight run naphtha, a refinery stream derived from the atmospheric crude oil distillation process, allows for a reduction of both NOx and particulate emissions when used in compression-ignition engines. CO2 benefits are also expected thanks to naphtha's higher H/C ratio and energy content compared to diesel. In previous studies, wide ranges of Cetane Number (CN) naphtha fuels have been evaluated and CN 35 naphtha fuel has been selected. The assessment and the choice of the required engine hardware adapted to this fuel, such as the compression ratio, bowl pattern, nozzle design and air-path technology, have been performed on a light-duty single cylinder compression-ignition engine. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of a recalibrated light-duty multi-cylinder compression-ignition engine running with CN 35 naphtha fuel with the just necessary engine and after-treatment hardware modification. The implementation of a specific global Design of Experiment (DoE) methodology developed by IFPEN was applied in steady-state conditions to calibrate the engine. The behavior of an after-treatment exhaust line (ATS) with DOC, DPF and SCR systems, was evaluated by 0D simulation. To be compliant with the Euro 6d regulation, several DoEs, considering the coolant temperature were performed to fully cover the WLTC cycle range and models representing the engine behavior in a large part of the engine map were then created. The Euro 6 regulation was met with a reduction of almost 7% of CO2 on WLTC, using a Euro 6 diesel like ATS design. Noise levels were comparable to a Euro 5 diesel reference engine. Different ATS efficiencies were also assessed with a significant impact on the CO2 potential. Engine calibration and after-treatment are, de facto, strongly linked.

How will policymakers choose between the myriad of options for distributing REDD+ benefits, and be able to evaluate its potential effectiveness, efficiency and equity (3Es)? This is a pressing issue given the results-based aspect of REDD+. We present here a three-element assessment framework for evaluating the outcomes and performance of REDD+ benefit sharing mechanisms, using the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and equity: (1) the structures (objective and policies) of a REDD+ benefit sharing mechanism; (2) the broader institutional and policy contexts underlying forest governance; (3) outcomes of REDD+ including emission reductions, ecosystem service provision and poverty alleviation. A strength of the assessment framework is its flexible design to incorporate indicators relevant to different contexts; this helps to generate a shared working understanding of what is to be evaluated in the different REDD+ benefit sharing mechanisms (BSMs) across complex socio-political contexts. In applying the framework to case studies, the assessment highlights trade-offs among the 3Es, and the need to better manage access to information, monitoring and evaluation, consideration of local perceptions of equity and inclusive decisionmaking processes. The framework does not aim to simplify complexity, but rather serves to identify actionable ways forward towards a more efficient, effective and equitable implementation and re-evaluation of REDD+ BSMs as part of reflexive policymaking.

However, the rate at which climate compatible development is being operationalised has outpaced academic enquiry into the concept. Interventions aiming to achieve climate compatible development “wins” (for development, mitigation, adaptation) can also create negative side-effects. Moreover, benefits and negative side-effects may differ across time and space and have diverse consequences for individuals and groups. Assessments of the full range of outcomes created by climate compatible development projects and their implications for distributive justice are scarce. This article develops a framework using a systematic literature review that enables holistic climate compatible development outcome evaluation over seven parameters identified. Thereafter, we explore the outcomes of two donor-funded projects that pursue climate compatible development triple-wins in Malawi using this framework. Household surveys, semi-structured interviews and documentary material are analysed. Results reveal that uneven outcomes are experienced between stakeholder groups and change over time. Although climate compatible development triple-wins can be achieved through projects, they do not represent the full range of outcomes. Ecosystem—and community-based activities are becoming popularised as approaches for achieving climate compatible development goals. However, findings suggest that a strengthened evidence base is required to ensure that these approaches are able to meet climate compatible development goals and further distributive justice. © 2017, The Author(s).","adaptation; Climate change; development; equity; mitigation; social justice","Surveys; adaptation; Development project; development; equity; mitigation; Negative side effects; Semi structured interviews; Social justice; Systematic literature review; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; development project; equity; holistic approach; literature review; social justice; stakeholder; climate change; controlled study; female; household; human; Malawi; male; semi structured interview; social justice; systematic review; ecosystem; environmental policy; Malawi; social aspect; socioeconomics; Malawi; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; Humans; Malawi; Social Justice; Social Planning; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019639359

It has many advantages over other forms insulation; however, concerns have been raised related to chemical emissions during and after application. The American Chemistry Council’s (ACC’s) Center for the Polyurethanes Industry (CPI) has gathered previously unpublished industrial hygiene air sampling studies submitted by member companies that were completed during an eight-year period from 2007–2014. These studies address emissions from medium density closed cell and low density open cell formulations. This article summarizes the results of personal and area air samples collected during application and post application of SPF to interior building surfaces in both laboratory and field environments. Chemicals of interest included: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), flame retardants, amine catalysts, blowing agents, and aldehydes. Overall, the results indicate that SPF applicators and workers in close proximity to the application are potentially exposed to MDI in excess of recommended and governmental occupational exposure limits and should use personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of air supplied respirators and full-body protective clothing to reduce exposure. Catalyst emissions can be reduced by using reactive catalysts in SPF formulations, and mechanical ventilation is important in controlling emissions during and after application. © 2017 Richard D.

To our knowledge, researchers have not applied the concept of carbon lock-in to higher education institutions and their climate commitments. We hypothesize that carbon lock-in effects will present a major obstacle to achieving carbon neutrality and expose these institutions to significant carbon liability, even with aggressive emissions mitigation efforts. Examples of fossil fuel-consuming infrastructure on our own campus and scenario analysis of emissions from eight higher education institutions in Ohio support this hypothesis. We find that carbon offset purchases to eliminate lock-in emissions could cost these institutions tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Future regulatory penalties could impose similar costs, even on campuses without climate commitments. As a result, campus operations management should carefully consider further investment in carbon-emitting infrastructure, especially at institutions committing to carbon neutrality. © 2017, AESS.","Carbon lock-in; Carbon neutrality; Carbon offsets; Climate commitment; Higher education; Social cost of carbon","carbon emission; energy planning; energy use; environmental education; environmental management; environmental technology; environmental values; higher education; infrastructure; participatory approach; renewable resource; research institution; scenario analysis; social impact; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027078675

In this study we evaluate the variable-resolution Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) with a high-resolution (0.125°) refinement over the Rocky Mountain region. The VR-CESM results are compared with observations, as well as CESM simulation at a quasi-uniform 1° resolution (UNIF) and Canadian Regional Climate Model version 5 (CRCM5) simulation at a 0.11° resolution. We find that VR-CESM is effective at capturing the observed spatial patterns of temperature, precipitation, and snowpack in the Rocky Mountains with the performance comparable to CRCM5, while UNIF is unable to do so. VR-CESM and CRCM5 simulate better the seasonal variations of precipitation than UNIF, although VR-CESM still overestimates winter precipitation whereas CRCM5 and UNIF underestimate it. All simulations distribute more winter precipitation along the windward (west) flanks of mountain ridges with the greatest overestimation in VR-CESM. VR-CESM simulates much greater snow water equivalent peaks than CRCM5 and UNIF, although the peaks are still 10–40% less than observations. Moreover, the frequency of heavy precipitation events (daily precipitation ≥ 25 mm) in VR-CESM and CRCM5 is comparable to observations, whereas the same events in UNIF are an order of magnitude less frequent. In addition, VR-CESM captures the observed occurrence frequency and seasonal variation of rain-on-snow days and performs better than UNIF and CRCM5. These results demonstrate the VR-CESM's capability in regional climate modeling over the mountainous regions and its promising applications for climate change studies. ©2017.

This paper examines CO2 emission efficiency and productivity in 286 Chinese cities under different production scenarios using a non-radial directional distance function approach. The examination is conducted via three scenarios, namely CO2 emission reduction (ER), emission reduction and energy conservation (EREC), and emission reduction, energy conservation, and economic growth (ERECEG). The results show substantial differences in total-factor emission efficiency and productivity across the three scenarios. We also found that total-factor emission efficiency varies considerably across regional and different-sized city groups. However, the distribution dynamics analysis provides strong evidence for the convergence of total-factor emission efficiency across Chinese cities in the long run. Efficiency change contributes of the majority of cross-city variation in productivity growth for the sample period. However, low average total-factor emission efficiency and large disparity in emission efficiency indicate great potential for future CO2 reduction. Regional development programs tend to drive economic activities into low CO2 emission performance regions. Our empirical findings provide valuable policy implications for achieving the joint targets of economic growth and CO2 emission reduction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese cities; CO2 emissions; Directional distance function; Emission efficiency; Productivity","Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Productivity; Public policy; Regional planning; Carbon emission reductions; Chinese cities; Directional distance function; Emission efficiencies; Emission performance; Policy implications; Regional development; Scenario-based analysis; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020458312

Peatlands are critical ecosystems because they store ~30% of the global soil organic C pool and are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic changes. The Zoige peatland on the eastern Tibet Plateau, as the largest alpine peatland in the world, accounts for 1‰ of global peat soil organic C storage. However, this peatland has experienced dramatic climate change including increased temperature and reduced precipitation in the past decades, which likely is responsible for a decline of the water-table and facilitated earthworm invasion, two major factors reducing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage of peatlands. Because earthworms often are more active in low- than in high-moisture peatlands, we hypothesized that the simultaneous occurrence of water-table decline and earthworm invasion would synergistically accelerate the release of SOC from peatland soil. We conducted a field experiment with a paired split-plot design, i.e. presence vs. absence of the invasive earthworms (Pheretima aspergillum) nested in drained vs. undrained plots, respectively, for 3 years within the homogenous Zoige peatland. Water-table decline significantly decreased soil water content and bulk density, resulting in a marked reduction of SOC storage. Moreover, consistent with our hypothesis, earthworm presence dramatically reduced SOC in the drained but not in the undrained peatland through the formation of deep burrows and decreasing bulk density of the lower soil layer over 3 years. The variation in SOC likely was due to changes in above-ground plant biomass, root growth and earthworm behaviour induced by the experimental treatments. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that incentive measures should be taken to prevent further water-table decline and earthworm invasion for maintaining the soil carbon pool in Zoige peatland. Artificial filling of drainage canals should be implemented to increase the water-table level, facilitating the recovery of drained peatlands. Moreover, the dispersal of earthworms and their cocoons attached to the roots of crop plants and tree saplings from low-lying areas to the Zoige region should be prevented. © 2017 The Authors.

Therefore, it is a strong candidate for transport and diesel powered machines including electricity generators and other off-road machines. In this research, a waste cooking oil derived HVO diesel was investigated for its combustion and emission performance including ignition delays, size segregated particulate number emissions and gaseous emissions. The results were compared to the standard petroleum diesel. A EURO5 emission compliant three litre, direct injection, intercooled IVECO diesel engine equipped with EGR was used which has a maximum power output of 96kW. The engine was equipped with an integrated DOC and DPF aftertreatment system. Both the upstream and downstream of the aftertreatment emissions were measured. The tests were conducted at different RPM and loads at steady state conditions. A DMS500 particle size measurement instrument was used for measuring particles between 5 nm and 1000nm. The engine was instrumented with a number of thermocouples so that the engine conditions were closely monitored. Gaseous emissions were measured using a HORIBA 7100 series gas analyzer. The results showed that HVO reduced particulate numbers significantly at the upstream of the aftertreatment system. The particle number emissions were not much different between HVO and standard diesel at the downstream of the aftertreatment system due to the low particle number concentrations.

To accommodate this directly, this paper presents a modified version of the Kaya Identity formula, U-Kaya, that includes a direct urbanization factor to determine the relationship between energy consumption intensity, population growth, urbanization rates, urban and rural GDP per capita and the volume of carbon emissions, for application in the dynamic forecasting of carbon emissions by Monte Carlo simulation. The method is demonstrated in forecasting China's likely carbon emissions in 2020 by three different modes of urbanization policy: the government-dominant mode, market-dominant mode and a hybrid government market-dominant mode. The results indicate that a higher urbanization rate, energy carbon emission coefficient and energy intensity will lead to increased carbon emissions. Finally, three policy implications are identified, comprising the narrowing of the economic gap between urban and rural areas, adjustments to the energy structure and technical innovation, which will provide a valuable reference for developing countries in their efforts to reduce carbon emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Forecasting; U-Kaya identity; Urbanization","Carbon; Commerce; Developing countries; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Population statistics; Public policy; Rural areas; Carbon emissions; Dynamic forecasting; Energy consumption intensity; Policy implications; Population growth; Technical innovation; Urban and rural areas; Urbanization; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047640304

To study this hypothesis we used the lysine producer Corynebacterium glutamicum ZW04, and we exposed it to 12 different conditions regarding anaerobic gas environment, applied electrode potential (cathodic, open circuit, anodic), redox mediator and nitrate presence. The gas environment was found to play a major role, with CO2 leading to double the lysine concentrations and yields when compared to N2. Electrode potentials also played a major role, with reductive conditions doubling the titers and increasing the yields of lysine up to 4 times. Addition of the redox mediator anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQ2S) under the presence of CO2 and reductive conditions led to additional doubling of the titers, although the yields were not altered considerably. This study demonstrates for the first time that cathodic electrode conditions combined with CO2 and AQ2S as a redox mediator can significantly improve both the yields and the titers of lysine production of a C. glutamicum lysine producing strain, reaching levels that have only been achieved under aerobic conditions. © 2017 The Authors","Anthraquinone-2-sulfonate; Biocathodes; Corynebacterium glutamicum; Electrofermentations; Lysine","Aromatic compounds; Carbon dioxide; Electric potential; Electrodes; Ketones; Anthraquinone 2 sulfonates; Biocathodes; Corynebacterium glutamicum; Electrofermentations; Lysine; Amino acids; carbon dioxide; carboxylic acid; glucose; lysine; nitrate; oxaloacetic acid; phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; sulfonic acid derivative; anthraquinone derivative; anthraquinone sulfonate; carboxylic acid; glucose; lysine; nitric acid derivative; aeration; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic bacterium; anaerobic fermentation; Article; calculation; Corynebacterium glutamicum; electric potential; electricity; electrode; electron; glucose intake; metabolism; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; pH; temperature; anaerobic growth; bioenergy; biosynthesis; Corynebacterium glutamicum; electrochemistry; electron transport; fermentation; microbiology; Anaerobiosis; Anthraquinones; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Carbon Dioxide; Carboxylic Acids; Corynebacterium glutamicum; Electrochemistry; Electron Transport; Fermentation; Glucose; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lysine; Nitrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020317824

A new approach integrating hazard, sensitivity, resilience, exposure and risk is developed to assess the VRWR from climate change. Drought is regarded as the key hazard, with its frequency and severity defined using a surface humidity index. Exposure is quantitatively linked with indicators of population and social and economic characteristics using statistical and Geographical Information System (GIS) methodologies. Risk is defined as the product of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, while vulnerability is treated as a function of sensitivity and adaptation. Vulnerability and risk in the water resources system in the coming 20 years are assessed for the RCP 4.5 scenario. The results reveal that both hazard and exposure of water resources display strong spatial variation in the study area. High hazard and exposure are found in the northern Tianshan Mountain as well as the eastern part of Hexi Corridor. Water resources are particularly sensitive to variation in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the upstream areas of Hexi Corridor, rivers in Central Asia, headwater streams of Tarim River and most of Chang Tang Plateau. Our assessment shows that there is high vulnerability of and risk to water resources in the study area, especially in the areas of Hexi Corridor, northern Tianshan Mountain and Tarim River. Under the RCP 4.5 climate change scenario, the vulnerability and risk decline over the entire area but remain at a serious level in inland rivers in Hexi Corridor, northern Tianshan Mountain and headwater streams of Tarim River. Thus, these areas are the highest priority for strengthening policy measures to adapt to climate change and reduce exposure and vulnerability and their risk to water resources. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Arid regions; Climate change; Hazards; Landforms; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Rivers; Surface water resources; Arid and semi-arid regions; Climate change scenarios; Economic characteristics; Northern tianshan mountains; Potential evapotranspiration; Spatial variations; Surface humidity; Water resources systems; Water resources; arid region; climate change; drought; GIS; humidity; potential evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); risk assessment; semiarid region; spatial variation; vulnerability; water resource; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031391830

We also determined that vegetation cover in the Chongqing area decreased gradually from east to west. During the 10-year study period, vegetation cover in the Chongqing area generally increased, changing from low to high coverage. This increase in vegetation cover was mainly the result of ecological protection policies and improving climate conditions. We also found that changes in vegetation cover were mainly the result of urban construction and afforestation initiatives, but vegetation cover improved overall. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Dimidiate pixel model; Dynamic change analysis; TIMESAT; Vegetation cover","Pixels; Radiometers; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Dimidiate pixel methods; Dynamic changes; Ecological protection; Normalized difference vegetation index time series; Pixel models; Spatial and temporal changes; TIMESAT; Vegetation cover; Vegetation; MODIS; monitoring system; NDVI; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; vegetation cover; afforestation; climate; remote sensing; time series analysis; vegetation; China; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; plant; procedures; season; theoretical model; trends; urbanization; China; Chongqing; China; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Plants; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029225287

To respond to this challenge, China has pledged to cut emissions of two major water pollutants, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4), and has disaggregated the national target among provinces. However, the abatement potential and costs have not been thoroughly assessed. This paper aims to examine the reduction potential and associated costs of COD and NH4 in the Chinese industrial sector. A parametric directional distance function is applied to modeling joint production, in which COD and NH4 are treated simultaneously as byproducts of the production process. Using provincial data from 2003 to 2012, we find that 13.18% of COD and 13.27% of NH4 can be reduced if all provinces perform efficiently. The average abatement cost to cut one additional unit of COD and NH4 is 710 and 7,390 Yuan/kg, respectively. The abatement cost is significantly correlated with the economic development level, pollution intensity and capital-labor ratio. Our results call for a market-based instrument, such as an Emission Trading System, to assist China in achieving this environmental goal in a cost-effective way. Moreover, it will become more difficult and costly to control COD, while there still exists a 'win-win' opportunity to control NH4 emissions through efficiency improvements. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Abatement cost; Abatement potential; Chinese industrial sector; Water pollutant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032215067

We studied the effect of Mn oxides on soil nitrification and N2O emissions to validate the hypothesis that Mn oxides affect the soil's nitrification and denitrification processes. Subtropical paddy soil with three different water regimes (50, 100 and 200% of soil water-holding capacity (WHC)) was treated with 3% birnessite (Mn oxide) or left untreated. The nitrification process was simulated with zero- or first-order kinetic models and N2O emissions were also measured. The maximum net rates of soil nitrification (Va1) decreased significantly with increasing soil moisture contents (F = 184.8; P &lt; 0.001), and so did the average net rates of soil nitrification (Va2) (F = 6.96; P = 0.008). Manganese oxide significantly decreased Va1 (F = 474.7; P &lt; 0.001), whereas it had no significant effects on Va2 (F = 0.26; P = 0.62). Manganese oxide changed the best fitting nitrification kinetic model from first- to zero-order for both 50 and 200% WHC, but it had no effect at 100% WHC. The maximum rates of emission of N2O significantly increased with increasing soil water contents (F = 15 007; P &lt; 0.001). Manganese oxide retarded the maximum rate of N2O emission at 100% WHC, whereas it depressed the rate from 1084 to 225 μg N kg−1 day−1 at 200% WHC (F = 7494; P &lt; 0.001). The results indicate that the effects of Mn oxide on regulating nitrification and N2O emissions are associated with water regime-dictated redox potential, and might have important implications for regulating N cycling in rice-based ecosystems. Highlights: Effect of manganese oxide on nitrification and denitrification in a paddy soil. Mn oxide retarded nitrification in oxic conditions and enhanced it in anoxic conditions. Mn oxide decreased rate of emission of nitrous oxide in anoxic conditions. Manganese oxide might be able to regulate N cycling in rice paddy soil. © 2017 British Society of Soil Science",,"birnessite; denitrification; hydrological regime; manganese oxide; nitrification; nitrous oxide; oxic conditions; paddy field; redox conditions; rice; soil emission; soil moisture; soil water; subtropical region; water content; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028016262

Due to the nonlinearity in the response of O3 and PM2.5 to their precursors, contributions from multiregional sources are challenging to quantify. Here we developed an updated extended response surface modeling technique (ERSMv2.0) to address this challenge. Multiregional contributions were estimated as the sum of three components: (1) the impacts of local chemistry on the formation of the pollutant associated with the change in its precursor levels at the receptor region; (2) regional transport of the pollutant from the source region to the receptor region; and (3) interregional effects among multiple regions, representing the impacts on the contribution from one source region by other source regions. Three components were quantified individually in the case study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei using the ERSMv2.0 model. For PM2.5 in most cases, the contribution from local chemistry (i.e., component 1) is greater than the contribution from regional transport (i.e., component 2). However, regional transport is more important for O3. For both O3 and PM2.5, the contribution from regional sources increases during high-pollution episodes, suggesting the importance of joint controls on regional sources for reducing the heavy air pollution. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Surface properties; Transport properties; Fine particles; Multiple regions; Pollution episodes; Regional sources; Regional transport; Response surface modeling; Three component; Tropospheric ozone; Air pollution; nitrate; ozone; receptor; sulfate; atmospheric pollution; emission; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollutant transport; quantitative analysis; response surface methodology; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; controlled study; nonlinear system; particulate matter; precursor; reduction (chemistry); response surface method; troposphere; air pollutant; China; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031782298

This paper discusses how to solve this issue from the perspective of financial development in China. Although many studies have analyzed its impact on carbon emissions, the conclusions are contradictory. A major criticism of the existing studies is the reasonability of the selection of appropriate indicators and panel estimation techniques. Almost all studies use only one or limited indicators to represent the financial development and ignore the cross-sectional dependence. To fulfil the gaps mentioned above, a financial development index system is built, and with the framework of the STIRPAT (Stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model, this paper applies an ARDL approach to investigating the long-run relationship between financial development and carbon emissions and a dynamic panel error-corrected model to capture the short-run impact. The empirical results show that financial development can improve carbon emissions, and such impact not only shows a regional difference but also reflects the features of stage differences. Additionally, based on the discussion on seven specific aspects of financial development, our findings can be helpful for policy makers to enact corresponding policies to realize the goal of reducing carbon emissions in China. © 2017 by the authors.

However, the factors controlling the underlying efficiencies of the light-driven processes on ZnTe are not well understood. Here we report a combined spectroelectrochemical and transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic investigation of ZnTe photoelectrodes for CO2 reduction. In the visible region TA spectra are dominated by a broad positive photoinduced absorption at 540 nm following initial charge carrier relaxation (&lt;540 nm). The 540 nm spectral feature is shown to be related to deeply trapped photoelectrons with charge carrier recombination occurring via a trapping-detrapping model on the microsecond time scale. Significantly these deeply trapped electrons are insensitive to the presence of electron acceptors and to the applied potential of the ZnTe electrode. Trapping at such states is proposed to be a significant factor limiting the photoelectrochemical activity of ZnTe. Near-IR spectral features associated with shallow trapped/conduction band electrons exist at &gt;1150 nm. Shallow trapped electrons are generated and accumulate at potentials where photoelectrochemical H2 evolution and CO2 reduction occur, and we show these charges are able to undergo interfacial electron transfer to an acceptor molecule. The passivation of sites related to deep traps is proposed to be the key to optimize the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance of ZnTe.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 76 published studies of 24 sites in the NCP to examine the effects of natural conditions and farming practices on GHG emissions in that region. We found that N2O was the main component of the area-scaled total GHG balance, and the CH4 contribution was &lt;5%. Precipitation, temperature, soil pH, and texture had no significant impacts on annual GHG emissions, because of limited variation of these factors in the NCP. The N2O emissions increased exponentially with mineral fertilizer N application rate, with y = 0.2389e0.0058x for wheat season and y = 0.365e0.0071x for maize season. Emission factors were estimated at 0.37% for wheat and 0.90% for maize at conventional fertilizer N application rates. The agronomic optimal N rates (241 and 185 kg N ha−1 for wheat and maize, respectively) exhibited great potential for reducing N2O emissions, by 0.39 (29%) and 1.71 (56%) kg N2O-N ha−1 season−1 for the wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Mixed application of organic manure with reduced mineral fertilizer N could reduce annual N2O emissions by 16% relative to mineral N application alone while maintaining a high crop yield. Compared with conventional tillage, no-tillage significantly reduced N2O emissions by ~30% in the wheat season, whereas it increased those emissions by ~10% in the maize season. This may have resulted from the lower soil temperature in winter and increased soil moisture in summer under no-tillage practice. Straw incorporation significantly increased annual N2O emissions, by 26% relative to straw removal. Our analysis indicates that these farming practices could be further tested to mitigate GHG emission and maintain high crop yields in the NCP. © 2017 The Authors.

Quantifying the temporal change in Moso bamboo forest carbon stocks is important for understanding forest dynamics and global climate change feedback capacity. In 2009, 168 Moso bamboo forest sample plots were established in Zhejiang Province using National Forest Continuous Inventory protocols and enhanced measurements. These plots were revisited and remeasured in 2014. By comparing the two years, culms number in age classes 2 and 4 increased by 12.3% and 82.5%, respectively, while that in age classes 1 and 3 decreased by 14.7% and 0.03%, respectively. The total aboveground culms carbon stocks increased by 2.95 Mg C ha-1 in the sample plots. On average, age classes 2 and 4 contributed 25.5% and 86.7% of the change in total carbon stocks, respectively. The carbon sequestrated by aboveground culms was 0.42 Tg C year-1, accounting for 1.55 Tg CO2 year-1 in Moso bamboo over an area of 0.78 million hectares in Zhejiang Province.

We have researched the factors that influence fuel NO emissions during the char grate-fired process by changing the char/oxygen (O2) ratio in a small-scale one-dimensional fixed-bed system. With an increase in the char/O2 ratio compared to the mass loss of char, the advent of excess O2 is delayed and carbon monoxide (CO) is generated. As a result, oxidation-reduction layering of char occurs. Char grate firing leads to an increase in char mass of the complete oxidation layer, and a thicker ash layer covers the char surface. The reduction layer and low-O2 region of the oxidation layer favor NO reduction; therefore, NO emission is delayed or shows a double-peak trend. The ash layer covering and a long residence time at a high temperature increase the NO generation rate of the oxidation layer. However, the overall NO generation rate is controlled by the reduction and oxidation layer, and an optimal char/O2 ratio exists, which makes the overall NO generation rate the lowest. A difference in the NO trend between the chain boiler and reciprocating grate boiler in and after the O2-deficient zone is because of the influence of the reciprocating disturbance on the reduction layer, ash layer, and char N release. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Boilers; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Chains; Fuels; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Chain boilers; Complete oxidation; Fuel nitrogen; Generation rate; High temperature; Oxidation layers; Oxidation reduction; Residence time; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030103061

Adjusting plant density is one of the most effective measures for maximizing maize yield under different climatic conditions. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the optimum plant density as well as the corresponding leaf area index (LAI) and yield in different maize producing regions in China and (2) to learn how climatic conditions influence maize growth and grain yield. The 3-year (2013–2015) field experiment used a hybrid maize cultivar (‘Zhengdan 958’) with six plant density treatments: 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5, and 12 plants m−2. Three different ecological regions were chosen for the study: Gongzhuling (Jilin Province, China), Yinchuan (Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China), and Qitai (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China). Comparing the same plant density treatment at different sites, grain yield and dry matter accumulation decreased in the order Qitai &gt; Yinchuan &gt; Gongzhuling. The optimum plant densities (i.e., treatments with greatest yield) were 12 plants m−2 at Qitai, 10.5 plants m−2 at Yinchuan, and 7.5 plants m−2 at Gongzhuling. At the optimum plant density, the LAIs at silking and physiological maturity were, respectively, 8.94 and 4.27 at Qitai, 7.50 and 1.85 at Yinchuan, and 6.18 and 1.67 at Gongzhuling. Climatic factors, especially solar radiation and diurnal temperature range, exerted significant influences on maize yield. These observations will be useful for determining best management practices for maize production under different climatic conditions across large areas and for providing helpful suggestions for maize breeders. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; High yield; LAI; Maize; Plant density","agrometeorology; best management practice; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; dry matter; leaf area index; maize; solar radiation; China; Gongzhuling; Jilin; Ningxia Huizu; Ningxia Huizu; Xinjiang Uygur; Yinchuan; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026468580

The pollutants included SO2, NOx, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). Emission factors for SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10 were adopted from standardized official promulgation, supplemented by those from local studies. The estimated annual emissions of SO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, EC, OC, CO and NMVOC were 152.4, 314.8, 16.6, 26.4, 0.07, 0.27, 64.9 and 2.5 kt, respectively. Small units (&lt; 100 MW), which accounted for ~ 60% of total unit numbers, had less coal consumption but higher emission rates compared to medium (≥ 100 MW and &lt; 300 MW) and large units (≥ 300 MW). Main factors affecting SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10 emissions were decontamination efficiency, sulfur content and ash content of coal. Weinan and Xianyang were the two cities with the highest emissions, and Guanzhong Plain had the largest emission density. Despite the projected growth of coal consumption, emissions would decrease in 2030 due to improvement in emission control technologies and combustion efficiencies. SO2 and NOx emissions would experience significant reduction by ~ 81% and ~ 84%, respectively.

To evaluate their influences, H2S and NH3 contributions to total alkalinity are added to CO2SYS, which is a most often used publicly available software package that calculates oceanic carbonate parameters. We discuss how these two metabolites affect the carbonate parameters and compare the differences in total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, pH, fCO2, and aragonite saturation state between the CO2SYS packages with and without considering the acid-base systems of H2S and NH3. The results show that, without considering these two acid-base systems, even low to moderate concentrations (e.g., 2–20 μmol kg−1) of these metabolites cause errors in the calculated carbonate parameters larger than the accuracies of the best measurements, and thus it is important to include contributions from these metabolites. The outputs from this updated version of CO2SYS agree well with outputs from AquaEnv, which is the only other computation program for the ocean carbonate system that includes the acid-base systems of H2S and NH3.

It is composed of two elementary reactions, i.e. product synthesis reaction and cofactor regeneration reaction, both of which have been expressed by Michaelis–Menten type rate equations. A novel dimensionless variable, r, has been introduced, which is defined as the concentration of one of the two cofactor components, [X] (NADH+ or NADPH+), divided by [C]0, i.e. r.e[X]/[C]0. The following results have been obtained. (1) The fundamental equation of the batch-wise enzymatic cycling system has been transformed to a differential equation whose formula is: dr/dT = N(r)/D(r) (N(r) and D(r) are quadratic equations of r having different coefficients). (2) It has been elucidated that the batch-wise enzymatic cycling system has two phases, an early short transient phase followed by a long phase in quasi-steady state (QSS). (3) In the enzymatic cycling system, r converges to a definite level regardless of any initial value of r. (4) In QSS, the definite level of r nearly equals the singular solution, rsingular, of the differential equation. (5) The actual rate of the targeted product (chiral compound) formation can be calculated by Michaelis–Menten equation in which the cofactor concentration is [C]0×rsingular instead of [C]0. rsingular has been proposed to name “redistribution factor”. (6) It is recommended that the “unit” of the cofactor regeneration enzyme be 2–3 times more used than the “unit” of the synthesis enzyme and that [C]0 be 15–25 times more than the Km value.

Nitrification rate in oxic section was reduced, while denitrification rate in anaerobic and anoxic section was elevated and the removal efficiency of COD, NH4 +-N, TN, and TP was enhanced in different extent. As the C/N ratio increased from 3.4 to 7.5, activities of three key denitrifying enzymes of nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase were increased. Moreover, microorganism analysis indicated that the relative abundance of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were positively correlated with N2O generation, which was reduced from (8.42 ± 3.65) to (3.61 ± 1.66)% and (10.38 ± 4.12) to (4.67 ± 1.62)%, respectively. NosZ gene copy numbers of the A2O system were increased from (1.19 ± 0.49) × 107 to (2.84 ± 0.54) × 108 copies/g MLSS with the influent C/N ratio elevated from 3.4 to 7.5. Hence, appropriate influent C/N condition of A2O process could optimize the microbial community structure that simultaneously improve treatment efficiency and decrease the N2O generation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process; Biological nitrogen removal; C/N ratio; Greenhouse gas; Nitrous oxide; NosZ gene","anoxic conditions; carbon; gene; greenhouse gas; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxic conditions; pollutant removal; ammonium derivative; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; bacterium; chemistry; denitrification; nitrification; waste water; Ammonium Compounds; Bacteria; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028749484

However, few studies have examined the detailed characteristics of PCIs, the effect of urban park features on their individual temperatures, and monthly variation in PCIs. Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from Landsat 8 TIR images between May and October were used to represent the thermal environment. Urban park characteristics were extracted from high-resolution GF-2 images. Using these datasets, the relationships between urban park characteristics and PCIs were explored in this study using Changchun, which has a snow climate, as a case study. The results showed the following: (1) the urban parks exhibited a cooling island effect, and the PCIs showed significant monthly variations with the highest intensities in the hot months; (2) the effects of composition (e.g., park size and the percentage of water area) on LSTs and PCIs showed significant monthly variability and were stronger than the configuration effects. Furthermore, an unexpected, negative correlation between PCIs and the area of park grass was also found; and (3) larger parks tended to have stronger PCI intensities and extents of influence. For parks larger than 30 ha, the cooling effects extended approximately 480 m from the park edge between June and August. For all of parks during the study duration, the rate of temperature increase was highest within 60 m from the park edge. The PCI we employ specifically in this study is characterized by LST. © 2017 by the authors.","Cooling effect; Land surface temperature; Monthly variations; Urban parks","Landforms; Snow; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Cooling effects; Land surface temperature; Monthly variations; Negative correlation; Park cool islands; Temperature increase; Thermal environment; Urban parks; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032877355

In our attempt to study the feasibility of combining the newly developed rapid LWIR LIBS linear array detection system to existing rapid analytical techniques for a wide range of chemical analysis applications, two different solid pharmaceutical tablets, Tylenol arthritis pain and Bufferin, were studied using both a recently designed simultaneous UVN + LWIR LIBS detection system and a fast AOTF NIR (1200 to 2200 nm) spectrometer. Every simultaneous UVN + LWIR LIBS emission spectrum in this work was initiated by one single laser pulse-induced micro-plasma in the ambient air atmosphere. Distinct atomic and molecular LIBS emission signatures of the target compounds measured simultaneously in UVN (200 to 1100 nm) and LWIR (5.6 to 10 µm) spectral regions are readily detected and identified without the need to employ complex data processing. In depth profiling studies of these two pharmaceutical tablets without any sample preparation, one can easily monitor the transition of the dominant LWIR emission signatures from coating ingredients gradually to the pharmaceutical ingredients underneath the coating. The observed LWIR LIBS emission signatures provide complementary molecular information to the UVN LIBS signatures, thus adding robustness to identification procedures. LIBS techniques are more surface specific while NIR spectroscopy has the capability to probe more bulk materials with its greater penetration depth. Both UVN + LWIR LIBS and NIR absorption spectroscopy have shown the capabilities of acquiring useful target analyte spectral signatures in comparable short time scales. The addition of a rapid LWIR spectroscopic probe to these widely used optical analytical methods, such as NIR spectroscopy and UVN LIBS, may greatly enhance the capability and accuracy of the combined system for a comprehensive analysis. © 2017 Optical Society of America.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Bandpass filters; Chemical analysis; Chemical detection; Coatings; Data handling; Depth profiling; Emission spectroscopy; Identification (control systems); Infrared devices; Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy; Near infrared spectroscopy; Spectrometers; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Ultraviolet lasers; Acousto-optic tunable filters; Comprehensive analysis; Identification procedure; In-depth profiling; Molecular information; Pharmaceutical ingredients; Pharmaceutical tablets; Spectroscopic probes; Infrared radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032897018

A scenario analysis is carried out based on different participation rate of residents who separate WCO from general waste, corresponding to different BDF utilisation rate in transportation system. Sub scenarios complying with different gas emission standards regarding vehicles are designed as well. Afterwards, life cycle impact assessment is conducted to focus on global warming, acidification, and urban air pollution. Overall improvement of almost all kinds of life cycle inventories is significant when diesel is replaced with BDF, demonstrating that a shift from WCO-to-incineration to WCO-to-BDF is more beneficial. Under carbon neutral, compared to base scenario (S0), about 746.05 ton CO2 emission will be reduced annually in the scenario with 100 % BDF utilisation in vehicles (S4). Meanwhile, total external cost in three environmental impacts (EI) sharply reduces by 51.90 %, showing much economic sustainability in S4. Moreover, the manufacturing cost for producing one litter WCO-to-BDF is 97.32 Yen. Sensitivity analysis shows that the gas emission standard regarding vehicles had much bigger effect on EI than BDF manufacturing process in this research. © 2016, Springer Japan.","Biodiesel fuel; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle impact assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Waste cooking oil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986292290

To meet these requirements, automakers are using combinations of technologies throughout the vehicle drivetrain to improve efficiency. One of the most efficient types of gasoline engine technologies is the turbocharged gasoline direct injection (TGDI) engine. The market share of TGDI engines within North America and globally has been steadily increasing since 2008. TGDI engines can operate at higher temperature and under higher loads. As a result, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have introduced additional engine tests to regional and OEM engine oil specifications to ensure performance of TGDI engines is maintained. One such engine test, the General Motors turbocharger coking (GMTC) test (originally referred to as the GM Turbo Charger Deposit Test), evaluates the potential of engine oil to protect turbochargers from deposit build-up. In this paper, the authors discuss the impact of typical engine oil components on GMTC performance. Concern about turbocharger deposits is not a new phenomenon, however. In the early 1990s the TEOST 33C bench test was developed to simulate turbocharger coking, and early studies showed a correlation between TEOST 33C results and field issues. A comparison of the TEOST 33C bench test and the GMTC engine test revealed no such correlation between the two tests under the conditions studied. Due to this lack of correlation, a comparison of TEOST 33C response with turbocharger deposits generated during field operation was performed.

In order to investigate how increasing levels of nitrogen (N) deposition affect CH4 uptake in a forest, we conducted a five-year experimental study on three forms of N (NaNO3, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4NO3) at two levels (50 (L) and 150 (H) kg N ha−1 yr−1) in a temperate deciduous forest in northern China. From 2011 to 2015, additional N was added equally once per month during the growing season (from March to October). Soil CH4 flux was measured three times per month from March 2011 to February 2016. Except for L-NaNO3 addition, which had no significant influence on annual CH4 uptake, all other N additions significantly decreased annual CH4 uptake by 49% (H-(NH4)2SO4), 43% (H-NH4NO3), 40% (L-(NH4)2SO4), 31% (H-NaNO3), and 29% (L-NH4NO3), respectively. As N addition significantly increased soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) concentrations, we inferred that the inhibition of CH4 uptake by N addition could be attributed to restricted methanotroph activity caused by higher osmotic stress. High level N addition exerted stronger inhibitory effects on CH4 uptake than low level, and the effects of the different N forms on inhibiting the annual CH4 flux exhibited a general order of (NH4)2SO4 &gt; NH4NO3 &gt; NaNO3. NH4+, rather than NO3−, was the major factor contributing to the inhibitory effect of N input on CH4 uptake which might be attributed to their different mobilities. Considering the decreasing ratio of NH4+ to NO3− in the local N deposition and the stronger suppression of CH4 uptake by NH4+, the inhibition of soil CH4 uptake by the atmospheric N deposition could be alleviated at our study plots in the near future. Due to the time-lag in the suppression of CH4 uptake by N addition, if the experimental period had been less than three years there would have been a different conclusion compared with that observed in the following years. Overall, our findings suggest that N deposition-induced increases in soil organic N concentrations may affect processes linked to CH4 dynamics and change soil-atmospheric CH4 fluxes in a temperate forest in northern China depending on the levels and forms of N addition. © 2017","Nitrogen deposition; Northern China; Soil CH4 flux; Temperate deciduous forest soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027857724

The objectives of this study are: 1) identify major factors that determine planting initiation and progression of six major crops in the U.S. and 2) develop a spatially explicit planting initiation and progression model. The crops that were evaluated are maize (Zea mays), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), soybean (Glycine max), and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). County-level daily planting data from 2005 to 2015 for representative states were obtained from USDA Risk Management Agency. For the five summer crops, the earliest planting gradually shifts to later dates with increasing latitude and elevation. The trend is reversed for winter wheat, with planting initiation shifting to earlier dates from south to north and from low to high elevation. A minimum planting temperature threshold was established for the five summer crops, which decreases from south to north and from low to high elevation. A maximum planting temperature threshold was established for winter wheat, which decreases from south to north but increases from low to high elevation. A spatially explicit temperature model as a function of latitude, longitude and elevation was established to predict planting initiation, while a soil texture-based soil wetness index predicts planting delays due to excessive precipitation. The model was calibrated with 2005–2009 data and validated with 2010–2015 data; it provided sound goodness of fit for planting initiation and weekly planting progression. The spatially explicit model for planting initiation and progression could be used to guide crop production planning and to improve the planting date and progression algorithms in crop models for regional simulation analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Planting date; Planting initiation; Planting progression; Planting temperature; Soil wetness; Spatially-explicit model","Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Oryza sativa; Sorghum bicolor; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028375993

However, the changes in microbial community structure during SOC decomposition are poorly known. Here we examine these changes using frozen soils from Barrow, Alaska, USA, in anoxic microcosm incubation at -2 and 8°C for 122 days. The functional gene array GeoChip was used to determine microbial community structure and the functional genes associated with SOC degradation, methanogenesis, and Fe(III) reduction. Results show that soil incubation after 122 days at 8°C significantly decreased functional gene abundance (P &lt; 0.05) associated with SOC degradation, fermentation, methanogenesis, and iron cycling, particularly in organic-rich soil. These observations correspond well with decreases in labile SOC content (e.g., reducing sugar and ethanol), methane and CO2 production, and Fe(III) reduction. In contrast, the community functional structure was largely unchanged in the -2°C incubation. Soil type (i.e., organic vs. mineral) and the availability of labile SOC were among the most significant factors impacting microbial community structure. These results demonstrate the important roles of microbial community in SOC degradation and support previous findings that SOC in organic-rich Arctic tundra is highly vulnerable to microbial degradation under warming. © 2017 Yang, Yang, Van Nostrand, Zhou, Fang, Qi, Liu, Wullschleger, Liang, Graham, Yang and Gu.","Climate warming; Functional genes; Microbial community; Permafrost; Soil organic carbon","carbon dioxide; DNA; ferric ion; methane; organic carbon; arctic tundra; Article; community structure; decomposition; environmental factor; fermentation; gene; geochemical analysis; hybridization; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial degradation; microcosm; nonhuman; soil analysis; soil microflora; soil property; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029703364

In this review paper, we provide a brief overview of one major endorheic basin on each continent, plus a number of endorheic basins in Central Asia (CA), a region where a large proportion of the land area is within this type of basin. We summarize the effects of (changing) climate drivers and land surface-atmosphere feedbacks on the water balance. For the CA region, we also discuss key anthropogenic activities, related water management approaches and their complex relationship with political and policy issues. In CA a substantial increase in irrigated agriculture coupled with negative climate change impacts have disrupted the fragile water balance for many endorheic basins and their lakes. Transboundary integrated land and water management approaches must be developed to facilitate adequate climate change adaptation and possible mitigation of the adverse anthropogenic influence on endorheic basins in CA. Suitable climate adaptation, mitigation and efficient natural resource management technologies and methods are available, and are developing fast. A number of these are discussed in the paper, but these technologies alone are not sufficient to address pressing water resource issues in CA. Food-water-energy nexus analyses demonstrate that transboundary endorheic basin management requires transformational changes with involvement of all key stakeholders. Regional programs, supported by local governments and international donors, which incorporate advanced adaptation technologies, water resource research and management capacity development, are essential for successful climate change adaptation efforts in CA. However, there is a need for an accelerated uptake of such programs, with an emphasis on unification of approaches, as the pressures resulting from climate change and aggravated by human mismanagement of natural water resources leave very little time for hesitation. © 2017 by the authors.","Central Asia; Climate change; Drylands; Endorheic; Evaporation; Kazakhstan; Lake; Semi-arid; Water resources","Catchments; Evaporation; Lakes; Natural resources management; Research and development management; Resource allocation; Water management; Water resources; Central Asia; Dry land; Endorheic; Kazakhstan; Semi arid; Climate change; adaptive management; basin management; climate change; climate effect; drainage network; evaporation; exploitation; freshwater; future prospect; human activity; land type; resource management; semiarid region; stakeholder; water budget; water planning; Central Asia; Kazakhstan",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031942365

In view of current climate variability and change, and projected increases in extreme events, adaptation to climate risks is vital. Policies have been put in place to enhance adaptation across sub-Saharan Africa in accordance with international agreements. At the same time, local people, through experience, have learned to adapt. This paper examines current policy actions and their implementation alongside an assessment of barriers to local adaptation. In doing so it links adaptation policy and practice. Policy documents were analysed that covered key livelihood sectors, which were identified as climate sensitive. These included agriculture, water, housing and health policies, as well as the National Climate Change Policy. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were also held with key stakeholders in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Analyses were carried using thematic content analysis. Although policies and actions complement each other, their integration is weak. Financial, institutional, social, and technological barriers hinder successful local implementation of some policy actions, while lack of local involvement in policy formulation also hinders adaptation practice. Integration of local perspectives into policy needs to be strengthened in order to enhance adaptation. Coupled with this is a need to consider adaptation to climate change in development policies and to pursue efforts to reduce or remove the key barriers to implementation at the local level. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptation; Multiple climatic hazards; Policy action; Savannah ecosystem","Ecology; Ecosystems; Hazards; Adaptation; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change policies; Climate variability and change; Climatic hazards; Policy actions; Savannah ecosystem; Thematic content analysis; Climate change; water; action plan; adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; extreme event; international agreement; meteorological hazard; policy analysis; policy implementation; savanna; stakeholder; adult; agriculture; Article; climate; climate change; ecosystem; environmental policy; female; Ghana; health care policy; housing; human; interview; local adaptation; male; savanna; adaptation; climate change; ecosystem; physiological stress; Ghana; Upper East Region; Adaptation, Physiological; Agriculture; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Ghana; Humans; Stress, Physiological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020735607

The importance of the relationship between these factors is demonstrated in the extensively studied interactions between water-limited vegetation and its ecosystem's physical components. Landscape geodiversity is often neglected in studies of vegetation dynamics and response to drought. Here, we combine field studies and mathematical modeling to elucidate the effects of geodiversity on shrub mortality following drought. In Israel's semi-arid northwestern Negev Desert, we found that homogeneous hillslopes, with little or no stoniness, experienced considerable shrub mortality following droughts, while neighboring slopes with higher stoniness showed little or no mortality. A mathematical model describing the dynamics of water-limited vegetation and accounting for landscape geodiversity predicted similar responses. The measurements and the model suggest that geodiversity increases the amount of water available for the shrubs, thereby increasing their durability. Future climate predictions of reduced precipitation and increased drought frequency in many regions make studies of ecosystem responses to water deficiency timely. Our findings suggest that future studies should account for landscape geodiversity in order to explain local differences in vegetation mortality and to better assess the possible impacts of climate fluctuations on ecosystem dynamics. In particular, geodiversity has a great effect on regime shifts and their nature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020271889

Plant invasion success or failure is based on a combination of evolutionary and ecological processes. Abiotic (e.g., climate) and biotic (e.g., plant competition) conditions in the environment and plant genetics (e.g., fitness) combine in either decreasing or increasing invasion, yet it has proven challenging to know exactly which of these conditions leads to success for a given species, even when a wealth of empirical data is available. Further, current regional distribution models for invasive plant species rarely consider biotic and fitness interactions, instead focusing primarily on abiotic conditions. The crucial role of all three factors (climate dynamics, invader fitness, and ecosystem resistance) must not be ignored. Here we construct a three-factor invasion framework from which we develop conceptual models using empirical studies for yellow starthistle, nonnative common reed, and musk thistle, three dissimilar but commonly occurring invasive plant species in North America. We identify how components of the invasion process-rapid population increase, established local dominance, and rapid range expansion-are influenced by ecosystem resistance, invader fitness, and/or climate dynamics, a set of broadly defined factors for each of the three invasive plant species. Our framework can be used to (1) establish research priorities, (2) address gaps in theoretical understanding, and (3) identify invasion process components that can be targeted to improve management. Building on previous models, our unifying framework, which can be used for assessing any invasive plant species having sufficient empirical data, simultaneously shows the influence of ecosystem resistance, invader fitness, and climate dynamics factors on the invasion process.

Physical activity is widely accepted as a method to promote health and well-being and is potentially influenced by air pollution. Previous population-based studies have focused on the impact of air pollution on physical activity in the U.S. using a cross-sectional survey method; however, few have examined the impact on middle income countries such as China using follow-up data. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on physical activity among freshmen students living in Beijing by use of follow-up data. Methods: We conducted 4 follow-up health surveys on 3445 freshmen students from Tsinghua University from 2012 to 2013 and 2480 freshmen completed all 4 surveys. Linear individual fixed-effect regressions were performed based on repeated-measure physical activity-related health behaviors and ambient PM2.5 concentrations among the follow-up participants. Results: An increase in ambient PM2.5 concentration by one standard deviation (44.72 μg/m3) was associated with a reduction in 22.32 weekly minutes of vigorous physical activity (95% confidence interval [CI] = 24.88-19.77), a reduction in 10.63 weekly minutes of moderate physical activity (95% CI = 14.61-6.64), a reduction in 32.45 weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (95% CI = 37.63-27.28), and a reduction in 226.14 weekly physical activity MET-minute scores (95% CI = 256.06-196.21). The impact of ambient PM2.5 concentration on weekly total minutes of moderate physical activity tended to be greater among males than among females. Conclusions: Ambient PM2.5 air pollution significantly discouraged physical activity among Chinese freshmen students living in Beijing. Future studies are warranted to replicate study findings in other Chinese cities and universities, and policy interventions are urgently needed to reduce air pollution levels in China. © 2017 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Fine particulate matter; Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, youth; Physical activity","adult; air pollution; China; city; cohort analysis; female; follow up; health behavior; health survey; human; juvenile; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; physical activity; university student; adolescent; air pollution; analysis; Asian continental ancestry group; China; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; drug effects; exercise; particulate matter; physiology; statistics and numerical data; student; university; young adult; Adolescent; Air Pollution; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Cities; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Particulate Matter; Students; Universities; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030326439

Process studies of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms controlling these emissions are advancing our understanding and the accuracy of model predictions but efforts to quantify regional emissions have been limited by a lack of constraints on regional distributions of ecosystem emission capacities. We used an airborne wavelet-based eddy covariance measurement technique to characterize isoprene and monoterpene fluxes with high spatial resolution during the 2013 SAS (Southeast Atmosphere Study) in the southeastern United States. The fluxes measured by direct eddy covariance were comparable to emissions independently estimated using an indirect inverse modeling approach. Isoprene emission factors based on the aircraft wavelet flux estimates for high isoprene chemotypes (e.g., oaks) were similar to the MEGAN2.1 biogenic emission model estimates for landscapes dominated by oaks. Aircraft flux measurement estimates for landscapes with fewer isoprene emitting trees (e.g., pine plantations), were about a factor of two lower than MEGAN2.1 model estimates. The tendency for high isoprene emitters in these landscapes to occur in the shaded understory, where light dependent isoprene emissions are diminished, may explain the lower than expected emissions. This result demonstrates the importance of accurately representing the vertical profile of isoprene emitting biomass in biogenic emission models. Airborne measurement-based emission factors for high monoterpene chemotypes agreed with MEGAN2.1 in landscapes dominated by pine (high monoterpene chemotype) trees but were more than a factor of three higher than model estimates for landscapes dominated by oak (relatively low monoterpene emitting) trees. This results suggests that unaccounted processes, such as floral emissions or light dependent monoterpene emissions, or vegetation other than high monoterpene emitting trees may be an important source of monoterpene emissions in those landscapes and should be identified and included in biogenic emission models. © 2017","Aircraft flux measurements; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Isoprene; Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN); Monoterpenes","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Essential oils; Fighter aircraft; Forestry; Inverse problems; Isoprene; Physiological models; Volatile organic compounds; Wavelet analysis; Atmospheric chemistry model; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Eddy covariance measurements; Flux measurements; High spatial resolution; Particle distributions; Physiological mechanisms; Regional distribution; Monoterpenes; isoprene; terpene; volatile organic compound; airborne sensing; atmospheric chemistry; biochemistry; biogenic emission; isoprene; monoterpene; understory; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; biomass; canopy; forest; land use; leaf litter; mass spectrometry; meteorological phenomena; nonhuman; oak; pine; proton transport; solar radiation; United States; vegetation; wavelet analysis; United States; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016714299

With the increasing availability of remote sensing data, monitoring of forest changes at high temporal resolution and on various scales is becoming more realistic. Though several methods based on time series data have been used to detect forest disturbance, there are few studies paying attention to boreal areas where the forest is significant in regulating the global carbon cycle and biogeophysical processes. In this paper, we present a robust method of Breaks Detection Based On Polynomial Model (BDPM) to track boreal (e.g. Lesser Khingan Mountains) deforestation and forest fires based on the MODIS and Landsat TM time series data. Compared with the previous methods, the BDPM offers the following advantages: (1) Fitting of the polynomial model using the seasonal variation of forests in the whole region instead of a single pixel to avoid error accumulation; (2) to avoid confusion between vegetation change due to climate changes and abrupt forest disturbances, we segmented the long-time NDVI series data into 12 seasonal cycles and simulated the temporal variations in each seasonal cycle. © 2016, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","BDPM; MODIS time series; Monitoring forest disturbances; Processing of long-term data; Remote sensing","carbon cycle; deforestation; environmental disturbance; forest cover; forest ecosystem; forest fire; Landsat thematic mapper; MODIS; NDVI; remote sensing; seasonal variation; time series analysis; China; Heilongjiang; Xiao Hinggan Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001817420

Great efforts have been made in reducing national emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) since 2006 in China. However, the total emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) continued to increase until 2011. To evaluate the effects of SO2 and NOx emission abatement on acid deposition and acidification of soil and water, we monitored the chemical composition of throughfall, soil water, and streamwater from 2001 to 2013 in a small, forested catchment near Chongqing city in Southwestern China. The deposition of S decreased significantly, whereas N deposition increased in the recent years. This clearly showed the effect of SO2 abatement but not of NOx. Overall the rate of acid deposition was reduced. However, there was delay in the recovery of soil and surface water from acidification, probably due to desorption of previously stored sulfate (SO42-) and increase in nitrate (NO3-) leaching from soil. The average acid input by N transformations has greatly exceeded the H+ input directly by atmospheric deposition. The reversal of acidification with an increase in pH of soil water, requires additional abatement of emissions of both SO2 and NOx. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Acidification; Air pollution; Catchments; Deposition; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Soils; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Surface waters; Acid deposition; Acidified soils; Atmospheric depositions; Chemical compositions; Chongqing cities; Forested catchments; Monitoring effect; N transformation; Soil pollution; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; soil water; sulfur dioxide; surface water; nitrogen; sulfur dioxide; acid deposition; acidification; atmospheric deposition; chemical composition; emission control; forested catchment; leaching; monitoring; nitrogen oxides; recovery; soil water; stream; sulfur dioxide; surface water; throughfall; transformation; Article; atmospheric deposition; catchment; chemical composition; China; desorption; leaching; nitrogen deposition; pH; soil acidification; stream (river); analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; season; soil; soil pollutant; water pollutant; China; Chongqing; Europe; North America; China; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Seasons; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Sulfur Dioxide; Water Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028753359

A saturated state was reached after absorbing 17 CH4 or 22 CO2 molecules per DV-8 molecule. The functional groups (FGs) on the surface of the vitrinite can be ranked in order of decreasing CH4 and CO2 adsorption ability as follows: [−CH3] &gt; [−C=O] &gt; [−C–O–C–] &gt; [−COOH] and [−C–O–C–] &gt; [−C=O] &gt; [−CH3] &gt; [−COOH]. CH4 and CO2 distributed as aggregations and they were both adsorbed at the same sites on vitrinite, indicating that CO2 can replace CH4 by occupying the main adsorption sites for CH4–vitrinite. High temperatures are not conducive to the adsorption of CH4 and CO2 on vitrinite. According to the results of density functional theory (DFT) and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculations, vitrinite has a higher adsorption capacity for CO2 than for CH4, regardless of whether a single-component or binary adsorbate is considered. The equivalent adsorption heat (EAH) of CO2–vitrinite (23.02–23.17) is higher than that of CH4–vitrinite (9.04–9.40 kJ/mol). The EAH of CO2–vitrinite decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature than the EAH of CH4–vitrinite does, indicating in turn that the CO2–vitrinite bond weakens more quickly with increasing temperature than the CH4–vitrinite bond does. Simulation data were found to be in good accord with the corresponding experimental results. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","CH4/CO2; Coal vitrinite; Competitive adsorption; DFT/GCMC; Isothermal adsorption","carbon dioxide; coal; functional group; methane; adsorption; Article; controlled study; density functional theory; heat; high temperature; hydrogen bond; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; simulation; surface property; retraction notice",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029674897

Therefore, reducing the CO2 emissions in China will play a decisive role in global CO2 emissions reduction. This paper is a proposal of optimum insulation thickness (OIT) for the exterior walls of buildings in 32 regions of China to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. The determination of the OIT for exterior walls its impact on the annual total energy cost and annual CO2 emissions per unit area of building exterior walls were calculated for 32 regions of China using the life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) and degree-days (DD) method. The results indicate that the annual total energy cost decreases up to the OIT level, and increases beyond the OIT level. The annual CO2 emissions can be reduced by increasing the insulation thickness. It is predicted that the average total energy cost of 32 regions can potentially be decreased by about $5/m2-year (40%) and the average CO2 emissions of the 32 regions can potentially be reduced by about 27 kg/m2-year (63%) when the OIT is applied. It also shows it is more effective to apply the OIT for the exterior walls of buildings to save annual total energy cost and reduce annual CO2 emissions in the Severe Cold and Hot Summer &amp; Cold Winter climatic zones rather than the other climatic zones of China. © 2017 by the authors.","China regions; CO2 emission; degree-day method; life-cycle cost analysis; Optimum insulation thickness; total energy cost","building; carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; insulation; life cycle analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029875043

Given that climate change and air pollution have the same source, energy systems, the rational development and use of energy for collaborative governance should be emphasized to solve these problems in parallel. This paper presents a multi-dimensional, multi-perspective and achievable analysis framework to quantitatively evaluate the emission reduction effects of energy countermeasures aimed at tackling climate change and governing air pollution in support of sustainable development. As a typical developing country pursuing sustainable development, China is taken as an example to demonstrate an application of the proposed framework to assess the emission reduction effects of energy countermeasures issued for tackling climate change and governing air pollution on CAPs and GHG. The results indicate that the key energy actions proposed in this paper would result in emission reductions of approximately 6 million tons (Mt) of CAPs and 575 Mt of GHG in 2016. By 2020 and 2030, emission reductions of 12 Mt of CAPs and 1094 Mt of GHG and of 21 Mt of CAPs and 1975 Mt of GHG, respectively, will be achieved. The proposed framework can effectively help China identify the emissions reduction effect of a given energy countermeasure and support the development of policy describing the next steps for tackling climate change and haze pollution. The proposed framework in this paper is also beneficial for countries similar to China in their efforts to simultaneously address climate change and improve air quality. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution; China; Climate change; Collaborative governance; Energy countermeasure; Sustainable development","analytical framework; atmospheric pollution; climate change; developing world; emission control; energy; environmental management; global climate; governance approach; greenhouse gas; measurement method; pollution control; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029180102

Many prediction models have been developed during the last decades, but their use has been limited because of incomplete understanding of internal processes and lack of observation datasets needed for calibration and validation. Dependency on species and locations further complicates the model selection procedure which is an essential part of phenology predictions. To overcome the limitations raised by using a single model, we propose a multi-model ensemble that simplifies model selection and provides competitive performance. We hypothesize that 1) no single individual model consistently outperforms the others and 2) an ensemble model performs equally as or better than any individual models. Nine individual models based on the concept of thermal-time accumulation and their ensembles were cross-validated with 137 datasets of four species collected from multiple locations and years in the United States and South Korea. Non-parametric tests concluded that the performance of a simple mean ensemble model was as good as the best individual model and outperformed the others. Differences between individual models were not statistically significant. The use of ensemble, however, does not preclude any bias in the interpretation caused by characteristics of the underlying models. When the ensemble was classified into groups: 1) with and 2) without chilling components, to assess spring phenology of flowering cherry species in the long-term projections, the predictions of two ensemble groups diverged considerably under RCP8.5 scenario. Our results suggest that a simple ensemble model can be a good phenology prediction tool for avoiding the pitfalls of model selection and reducing inherent uncertainties in climate change studies, but also highlight the importance of implementing the underlying mechanisms of key physiological processes into individual models used in an ensemble. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chilling requirement; Climate change; Ensemble; Flowering; Phenology; Prediction","Biology; Climate change; Forecasting; Physiological models; Calibration and validations; Chilling requirement; Competitive performance; Ensemble; Flowering; Model selection procedures; Phenology; Physiological process; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028499873

Environmental stressors such as ocean acidification (OA) potentially affect DOM production and degradation processes, e.g., phytoplankton exudation or microbial uptake and biotransformation of molecules. Resulting changes in carbon storage capacity of the ocean, thus, may cause feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. Previous experiments studying OA effects on the DOM pool under natural conditions, however, were mostly conducted in temperate and coastal eutrophic areas. Here, we report on OA effects on the existing and newly produced DOM pool during an experiment in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean at the Canary Islands during an (1) oligotrophic phase and (2) after simulated deep water upwelling. The last is a frequently occurring event in this region controlling nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics. We manipulated nine large-scale mesocosms with a gradient of pCO2 ranging from ~350 up to ~1,030μatm and monitored the DOM molecular composition using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry via Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). An increase of 37μmol L-1 DOC was observed in all mesocosms during a phytoplankton bloom induced by simulated upwelling. Indications for enhanced DOC accumulation under elevated CO2 became apparent during a phase of nutrient recycling toward the end of the experiment. The production of DOM was reflected in changes of the molecular DOM composition. Out of the 7,212 molecular formulae, which were detected throughout the experiment, ~50% correlated significantly in mass spectrometric signal intensity with cumulative bacterial protein production (BPP) and are likely a product of microbial transformation. However, no differences in the produced compounds were found with respect to CO2 levels. Comparing the results of this experiment with a comparable OA experiment in the Swedish Gullmar Fjord, reveals similar succession patterns for individual compound pools during a phytoplankton bloom and subsequent accumulation of these compounds were observed. The similar behavior of DOM production and biotransformation during and following a phytoplankton bloom irrespective of plankton community composition and CO2 treatment provides novel insights into general dynamics of the marine DOM pool. © 2017 Zark, Broda, Hornick, Grossart, Riebesell and Dittmar.","Dissolved organic matter; FT-ICR-MS; Mesocosm experiment; Molecular composition; Ocean acidification; Subtropical North Atlantic; Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028957832

The presented data were collected during the winter workshop between 7th and 13th March 2016 in Krynica-Zdroj (southern Poland). During this campaign photoacoustic instruments were used to observe the single-scattering optical properties at two sites with a vertical separation distance of about 360 m. The micro-aethalometer AE-51 and the optical particle counter OPC-N2 were mounted on the cable car and used to measure profiles of black carbon concentration and aerosol size distribution. The mean extinction coefficients at the upper (37 Mm−1) and lower (43 Mm−1) sites were about three times lower than the long-term average for this season due to weather conditions, which did not favour the haze conditions. However, a significant correlation between temperature gradient and difference of extinction coefficient between the valley and mountain was found. During nights and stable thermodynamic conditions the values in the valley were higher than close to the top of the mountain. Profiles obtained from cable car measurements shown significant reduction of black carbon and aerosol concentration with altitude also during the day time. In addition, the effective radius, and the fine and coarse mode aerosol concentration was slightly changed with altitude when the relative humidity was below 100%. During condensation and cloud formation the significant variability in particles effective radius were found as a result of aerosol activation close to the top of the mountains. © 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Aerosol properties; Black carbon; Cable car; Vertical profile",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016583999

Lauder is a clean rural measurement site often representative of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) mid-latitude background atmosphere. O3 trends over this period at this location are characterised by a significant positive trend below 6ĝ€km, a significant negative trend in the tropopause region and the lower stratosphere between 9 and 15ĝ€km, and no significant trend in the free troposphere (6-9ĝ€km) and the stratosphere above 15ĝ€km. We find that significant positive trends in lower tropospheric ozone are correlated with increasing temperature and decreasing relative humidity at the surface over this period, whereas significant negative trends in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere appear to be strongly linked to an upward trend of the tropopause height. Relative humidity and the tropopause height also dominate O3 variability at Lauder in the lower troposphere and the tropopause region, respectively. We perform an attribution of these trends to anthropogenic forcings including O3 precursors, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and O3-depleting substances (ODSs), using CCM simulations. Results indicate that changes in anthropogenic O3 precursors contribute significantly to stratospheric O3 reduction, changes in ODSs contribute significantly to tropospheric O3 reduction, and increased GHGs contribute significantly to stratospheric O3 increases at Lauder. Methane (CH4) likely contributes positively to O3 trends in both the troposphere and the stratosphere, but the contribution is not significant at the 95ĝ€% confidence level over this period. An extended analysis of CCM results covering 1960-2010 (i.e. starting well before the observations) reveals significant contributions from all forcings to O3 trends at Lauder-i.e. increases in GHGs and the increase in CH4 alone all contribute significantly to O3 increases, net increases in ODSs lead to O3 reduction, and increases in non-methane O3 precursors cause O3 increases in the troposphere and reductions in the stratosphere. This study suggests that a long-Term ozonesonde record obtained at a SH mid-latitude background site (corroborated by a surface O3 record at a nearby SH mid-latitude site, Baring Head, which also shows a significant positive trend) is a useful indicator for detecting atmospheric composition and climate change associated with human activities. © Author(s) 2017.",,"atmospheric chemistry; chemical composition; climate modeling; ozone; ozonesonde; relative humidity; rural atmosphere; Southern Hemisphere; statistical analysis; stratosphere; trend analysis; Lauder; New Zealand; Otago; South Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029315546

The proposed cooperative configuration considers that buildings with different load patterns exchange power through a common DC bus, so that an optimum utilization of the energy generated by local renewables is achieved. The problem of selecting the optimal capacities of photovoltaic arrays, energy storage systems and inverters, as well as of determining the optimal daily power operation plan is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, where the objective function is optimized based on the Nash bargain method. The impact of the daily scheduling of the energy storage systems and electric vehicles, as well as the impact of power exchanges on the equipment sizing and vice versa is also highlighted.

The bounded F-test for cointegration among the model variables yielded evidence of a long-run relationship among climate change, technical progress, and the wheat yield per unit area. In the long run, agricultural machinery and fertilizer use both had significantly positive impacts on the per unit area wheat yield. A 1% increase in the aggregate quantity of fertilizer use increased the wheat yield by 0.19%. Additionally, a 1% increase in machine use increased the wheat yield by 0.21%. In contrast, precipitation during the wheat growth period (from emergence to maturity, consisting of the period from last October to June) led to a decrease in the wheat yield per unit area. In the short run, the coefficient of the aggregate quantity of fertilizer used was negative. Land size had a significantly positive impact on the per unit area wheat yield in the short run. There was no significant short-run or long-run impact of temperature on the wheat yield per unit area in Henan Province. The results of our analysis suggest that climate change had a weak impact on the wheat yield, while technical progress played an important role in increasing the wheat yield per unit area. The results of this study have implications for national and local agriculture policies under climate change. To design well-targeted agriculture adaptation policies for the future and to reduce the adverse effects of climate change on the wheat yield, climate change and technical progress factors should be considered simultaneously. In addition, adaptive measures associated with technical progress should be given more attention. © 2017 Zhai et al.

Most of the previous research efforts in this area focused more on analyzing manufacturing energy consumption of a process or that of a machine tool with less concern on the system level of advanced machining workshop, especially a flexible manufacturing system. In this article, a new energy-saving approach of flexible manufacturing system is put forward based on energy evaluation model for integration of process planning and scheduling problem in flexible manufacturing system (flexible manufacturing system-integration of process planning and scheduling). First, complying with feature precedence and other technological requirements, flexible manufacturing system -integration of process planning and scheduling is mapped as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem of which operations are provinces and candidate operations are cities belonging to different provinces. To evaluate the performance of each solution of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem, energy consumption evaluation criteria for flexible manufacturing system-integration of process planning and scheduling are established and three energy efficiency indicators are also provided to perform further analysis on manufacturing energy consumption, that is, part energy efficiency, machine tool energy efficiency and feasible solution energy efficiency. Then, a mutation-combined ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the flexible manufacturing system-integration of process planning and scheduling which combined roulette and mutation selection methods to pick out the next candidate operation. The pheromone trails associated with edges are released by the so-far-best ant or the iteration-best ant probabilistically to both keep the search directed and avoid converging to the local best. Finally, a case study of flexible manufacturing system in advanced machining workshop is employed to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of this approach in three different scenarios and compared with the ""process planning then scheduling"" approach; energy consumption obtained by the proposed method drops 10.7%. © 2015 Institution of Mechanical Engineers.","ant colony optimization; energy conservation; energy efficiency; Flexible manufacturing system; integration of process planning and scheduling","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Flexible manufacturing systems; Industrial research; Iterative methods; Machine tools; Manufacture; Optimization; Power management; Process planning; Scheduling; Traveling salesman problem; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Asymmetric traveling salesman problem; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Energy efficiency indicator; Evaluation criteria; Flexible manufacturing; Integration of process planning and scheduling; Manufacturing industries; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027726129

A novel approach combining molecular proxies and compound-specific carbon isotopes is used to quantitatively constrain the origins and transport mechanisms of TOM in surface sediments from the ECS shelf. The content of terrestrial biomarkers of (C27+C29+C31) n-alkanes (52 to 580 ng g−1) revealed a seaward decreasing trend, the δ13CTOC values (−20.6‰ to −22.7‰) were more negative near the coast, and the TMBR (terrestrial and marine biomarker ratio) values (0.06 to 0.40) also revealed a seaward decreasing trend. These proxies all indicated more TOM (up to 48%) deposition in the coastal areas. The Alkane Index, the ratio of C29/(C29+C31) n-alkanes indicated a higher proportion of grass vegetation in the coastal area; While the δ13C values of C29n-alkane (−29.3‰ to −33.8‰) indicated that terrestrial plant in the sediments of the ECS shelf were mainly derived from C3 plants.

However, an understanding of the valence band reactions is also essential, especially since CO can also be produced in the absence of CO2 by oxidation of diamond via C + H2O → CO + 2H+ + 2e− (E° = 0.52 V). Here, we demonstrate that H-terminated diamond nanoparticles with a median diameter of 125 nm can initiate selective photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, and that argon-purged control samples show no production of CO production in the absence of intentional CO2 reactant as long as a sacrificial electron donor (here, Na2SO3) is present. However, in the absence of an electron donor clear signs of diamond oxidation and aggregation are observed. In contrast, experiments with detonation nanodiamond show rapid changes upon illumination consistent with oxidation of the samples.

Developing countries such as China are investing significantly in the construction of additional water infrastructure at the cost of increased GHG emissions. To understand the complexities of the inclusive impacts of GHG emissions from urban water systems, this study aims to examine both direct and indirect GHG emissions for water utilities in China's cities. A practical hybrid framework was proposed to reveal hidden GHG emissions via a combination of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines (bottom-up) and an Environmental Input-Output model (top-down). The study found that average annual GHG emissions between 2006 and 2012 from urban water utility operation in China accounted for 41 Mt CO2-eq, 58% came from energy use, 40% from treatment processes, and 2% from chemical use. Based on the proposed framework, Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions other than electricity and heat purchase) for the operation of water utilities were estimated to be 8 Mt CO2-eq, which is significant to the total emission inventory; this corrected the bottom-up estimation in which 90% of Scope 3 emissions were not captured. The main hidden emission sources were upstream emissions of electricity and heat generation (21%), management of water conservancy (9%), manufacture of metal products (15%) and plastics (6%), and other chemical inputs (4%).Embodied emissions from cement and lime production (27%) and steel rolling of (22%) were the main sources of Scope 3 emissions for the construction of water infrastructure. Future variations of GHG emissions from water utilities were determined to be largely a result of the growth of wastewater treatment. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a hybrid approach to supporting low-carbon planning of water utilities from the viewpoint of water-energy-GHG nexus, and suggests that reduction of non-CO2 emissions in wastewater treatment and emissions of electricity consumption across supply chains has a significant potential to mitigate total GHG emissions from China's water sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental input-Output analysis; GHG emission inventory; Scope 3 emissions; Urban water systems; Water-energy-GHG nexus","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Potable water; Reclamation; Supply chains; Wastewater treatment; Water; Water management; Water supply; Water treatment; Waterworks; Bottom-up estimations; Electricity-consumption; Environmental input-output analysis; GHG emission; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Urban water systems; Water energy; Water infrastructure; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024122880

In this study, the city-level panel data of 106 Chinese cities over the 2002–2014 period are utilized to investigate the impacts of government expenditure on the emissions of three typical pollutants. Specifically, the total effects are divided into two types: direct effects, through which government expenditure affects pollution directly; and indirect effects, which refer to the indirect influences of government expenditure on environmental pollution through its impacts on GDP per capita. To control for potential endogeneity and introduce dynamics, the generalized method of moments (GMM) method is utilized. The estimation results indicate that the total effects of government expenditure on these three pollutants are very different: for sulfur dioxide (SO2), soot and chemical oxygen demand (COD), the total effects are decreasing, inverted-U and U-shaped, respectively.

First, we conducted a systematical review of the development of spatial econometrics. Second, we generated a panel data set about energy and socioeconomic development of 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2005 to 2012. Next, we chose the most appropriate model to explain the predominant factors of energy-related CO2 emissions based on a series of tests of the spatial econometrics models. The results suggested that technology improvement, adjustment of industrial and energy structures, and environmentally friendly behaviors and patterns of consumption of habitants play an important role in CO2 emissions mitigation. The results also revealed that CO2 emissions had strong spatial spillover effects, which indicate that policies adopted in one province will affect policy-making in neighboring provinces, implying that provinces need take combined action to balance climate change mitigation and economic policy goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Impact factor; Policy implication; Spatial panel regression; STIRPAT model","Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Energy policy; Industrial emissions; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Statistics; Climate change mitigation; Emissions mitigation; Impact factor; Policy implications; Socio-economic development; Spatial panel regression; Stirpat models; Technology improvement; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020103610

In addition to the technical aspect, there have been increasing concerns over howtominimize the negative environmental impact of the dyeing industry. The emissions of pollutants are mainly caused by frequent cleaning operations which are necessary for initializing the dyeing equipment, as well as idled production capacity which leads to discharge of unconsumed chemicals. Motivated by these facts, we propose a methodology to reduce the pollutant emissions by means of systematic production scheduling. Firstly, we build a three-objective scheduling model that incorporates both the traditional tardiness objective and the environmentally-related objectives. A mixed-integer programming formulation is also provided to accurately define the problem. Then, we present a novel solution method for the sustainable scheduling problem, namely, a multi-objective genetic algorithm with tabu-enhanced iterated greedy local search strategy (MOGA-TIG).

Several human diseases are associated with altered CFTR channel function. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by the absence or dysfunction of CFTR channel activity, resulting from mutations in the gene. Secretory diarrhea is caused by the hyperactivation of CFTR channel activity in the gastrointestinal tract. CFTR is a validated target for drug development to treat CF, and extensive research has been conducted to develop CFTR inhibitors for therapeutic interventions of secretory diarrhea. The intracellular processing, trafficking, apical membrane localization, and channel function of CFTR are regulated by dynamic protein-protein interactions in a complex network. In this paper, we review the current knowledge of a macromolecular complex of CFTR, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2), and lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) receptor 2 (LPA2) at the apical plasma membrane of airway and gut epithelial cells, and discuss its relevance in human physiology and diseases. We also explore the possibilities of targeting this complex to fine tune CFTR channel activity, with a hope to open up new avenues to develop novel therapies for CF and secretory diarrhea. © 2017 by the authors.

Previous studies have focused on the quantity of emissions, whereas the present study focuses on the issue of uncertainty in building emission assessment. In this context, a semi-quantitative approach was adopted, and the probabilistic distributions of the quantities and emissions of building materials and energy were assessed based on data quality indicators. Further, a case study was conducted to compare the deterministic and stochastic emissions. The results showed that the sample mean of the stochastic results (5891.97 tCO2e) was consistent with that of the conventional method, while the relevant standard deviation was estimated as 248.90 tCO2e owing to the uncertainty of input parameters. In addition, scenario analyses were conducted, including the system boundary, potential reduction of material consumption and emission, and adoption of local production and low-carbon energy to quantify the scenario uncertainty, and the transformation coefficients and temporal correlation to quantify the model uncertainty. The relevant analyses revealed the key factors (e.g. system boundary, steel, concrete, and masonry works, local production, and applicable period of the data) in reducing the embodied emissions and corresponding uncertainties. Overall, the present study can facilitate comprehensive assessment of the uncertainties in building embodied emissions, thereby contributing to low-carbon policy-making in the building industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building embodied emission; Data quality indicator; Scenario analysis; Stochastic analysis","Buildings; Carbon footprint; Construction; Construction industry; Data reduction; Probability distributions; Quality control; Stochastic systems; Building construction; Comprehensive assessment; Data quality; Embodied emissions; Probabilistic distribution; Scenario analysis; Stochastic analysis; Transformation coefficients; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024921983

Green space can mitigate warming, providing cooling benefits important to reducing energy consumption and improving human health. The arrangement of green space to reap the full potential of cooling benefits is a challenge, especially considering the diurnal variations of urban heat island effects. Surprisingly, methods that support the strategic placement of green space in the context of urban heat island are lacking. Integrating geographic information systems, remote sensing, spatial statistics and spatial optimization, we developed a framework to identify the best locations and configuration of new green space with respect to cooling benefits. The developed multi-objective model is applied to evaluate the diurnal cooling trade-offs in Phoenix, Arizona. As a result of optimal green space placement, significant cooling potentials can be achieved. A reduction of land surface temperature of approximately 1–2 °C locally and 0.5 °C regionally can be achieved by the addition of new green space. 96% of potential day and night cooling benefits can be achieved through simultaneous consideration. The results also demonstrate that clustered green space enhances local cooling because of the agglomeration effect; whereas, dispersed patterns lead to greater overall regional cooling.

Quantifying the source contributions to PM2.5 concentrations has been a challenging task because of the complicated nonlinear relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and emissions of multiple pollutants from multiple spatial regions and economic sectors. In this study, we use the extended response surface modeling (ERSM) technique to investigate the nonlinear response of PM2.5 concentrations to emissions of multiple pollutants from different regions and sectors over the BTH region, based on over 1000 simulations by a chemical transport model (CTM). The ERSM-predicted PM2.5 concentrations agree well with independent CTM simulations, with correlation coefficients larger than 0.99 and mean normalized errors less than 1g%. Using the ERSM technique, we find that, among all air pollutants, primary inorganic PM2.5 makes the largest contribution (24-36%) to PM2.5 concentrations. The contribution of primary inorganic PM2.5 emissions is especially high in heavily polluted winter and is dominated by the industry as well as residential and commercial sectors, which should be prioritized in PM2.5 control strategies. The total contributions of all precursors (nitrogen oxides, NO1 sulfur dioxides, SO2; ammonia, NH3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOCs; intermediate-volatility organic compounds, IVOCs; primary organic aerosol, POA) to PM2.5 concentrations range between 31 and 48g%. Among these precursors, PM2.5 concentrations are primarily sensitive to the emissions of NH3, NMVOCg IVOC, and POA. The sensitivities increase substantially for NH3 and NOx and decrease slightly for POA and NMVOCg1 IVOC with the increase in the emission reduction ratio, which illustrates the nonlinear relationships between precursor emissions and PM2.5 concentrations. The contributions of primary inorganic PM2.5 emissions to PM2.5 concentrations are dominated by local emission sources, which account for over 75g%of the total primary inorganic PM2.5 contributions. For precursors, however, emissions from other regions could play similar roles to local emission sources in the summer and over the northern part of BTH. The source contribution features for various types of heavy-pollution episodes are distinctly different from each other and from the monthly mean results, illustrating that control strategies should be differentiated based on the major contributing sources during different types of episodes. © Author(s) 2017.",,"atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; industrial emission; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollutant transport; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032231206

Therefore, it is critical to determine the effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors on the reduction in sediment load. The Huangfuchuan River is the primary tributary in the sediment-rich region of the Loess Plateau in China. This study identified a significant reduction in the sediment load in the Huangfuchuan River basin. The accumulative anomaly method was used to determine the change in annual sediment load from 1960 to 2010. The mean annual sediment load in the Huangfuchuan River was 0.564 × 108 t from 1960 to 1979 (Period I), and it decreased to 0.379 × 108 t between 1980 and 1996 (Period II) and to 0.100 × 108 t between 1997 and 2010 (Period III). Instead of conventional ways, a method that coupled a dynamic water balance model and a back-propagation artificial neural network was employed to separate the contributions of climate variability and human activities on the reduction in sediment load. The results showed that compared to the sediment load in Period I, human activities were responsible for 64.32 and 71.55% of the reductions in sediment load in Periods II and III, respectively, while climatic effects accounted for 35.68 and 28.45% of the reductions in Periods II and III, respectively. The construction of check dams was the main human activity that resulted in the sediment reduction between Periods I and II and accounted for 35.51% of the decrease. Vegetation restoration due to the implementation of the “Grain-to-Green” program was the dominant cause of the reduction in sediment between Periods II and III and caused more than 40.00% of the decrease. The increase of water consumption by humans also contributed the reduction in sediment between Periods II and III in the Huangfuchuan River basin. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","BPANN; Climate variability; Huangfuchuan River basin; Human activities; Hydrological model; Sediment load","Backpropagation; Climate change; Climate models; Landforms; Neural networks; Rivers; Water management; Watersheds; BPANN; Climate variability; Human activities; Hydrological modeling; River basins; Sediment loads; Sediments; anthropogenic effect; artificial neural network; climate effect; climate variation; fluvial deposit; human activity; hydrological modeling; river basin; China; Huangfuchuan River; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009895093

These changes have brought significant harm to humans and are imposing high costs on societal maintenance and development. In that context, low/no-fossil carbon transformations and improved material's and energy efficiency are crucial elements for reconciling human activities with sustainable societal development, which is built upon vibrant and sustainable ecosystems. The urgently needed changes are bound to be difficult to make due to the perceived contradictions between low/no-fossil-carbon systems and sustainable and economically vibrant societies. This Special Volume (SV) is comprised of thirty-three articles, which mainly focus on investigations of low/no-fossil carbon transformations in countries, regions, industries and enterprises. Some authors provided insights of ways to proceed based upon new research and development (R&D), evaluations of specific low/no-fossil carbon technologies and lessons learned from policy simulations and analyses of potential post-fossil carbon societies. This SV introductory article contains an overview of the content of the articles divided into five topics: (a) low/no-fossil carbon transformations within industrial sectors, (b) regional planning and low/no-fossil carbon developments, (c) multi-regional, low/no-fossil carbon economies, (d) specific low-fossil carbon technologies, and (e) low/no-fossil carbon policy results. Given the extensive coverage of low/no-fossil carbon transformations, the papers on mechanisms and pathways are clearly the most important contributions of this SV. The researchers focused broadly on ways to address two objectives: (a) To characterize the main factors catalyzing high-fossil carbon development and (b) To accelerate the transition to low/no fossil carbon societies. Some authors focused upon new, low/no-fossil carbon development and planning in different countries and regions, while others focused upon ways to make changes within energy-intensive industries. Additionally, some authors reported on progress in the evaluation of the effectiveness of specific low/no-fossil-carbon technologies and in the design and implementation of low/no-fossil carbon policies. The findings and recommendations of the authors are positive and encouraging. However, it is clear, that there are many additional research, policy and educational challenges, which must be solved, to establish and support systems to guide and to monitor the transformations to sustainable, equitable, livable, low/post-fossil carbon societies. Much work remains but the wisdom in the articles in this SV will help societies make the needed transitions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental, social and health benefits; Evaluation of transformations; Low/no-fossil carbon technologies; Low/no-fossil carbon transformations; Policy analyses of low/no-fossil carbon systems; Transformation mechanisms","Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Industrial economics; Population statistics; Regional planning; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Carbon systems; Carbon technologies; Design and implementations; Energy intensive industries; Health benefits; Human population growth; Research and development; Transformation mechanisms; Economic and social effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009230734

Medicago sativa (‘lucerne’) and Dactylis glomerata (‘cocksfoot’) were grown as sole crops or intercropped in soils with or without addition of biogas digestate to also evaluate fertilizer effects. Eight genes involved in inorganic N-cycling were quantified using real-time PCR to determine the genetic potential for different N-cycling pathways. Both plant species and intercropping affected the abundance of root-associated microbial-derived genes involved in N-cycling processes, while there was no effect of amendment with biogas digestate. The genetic potential for the various pathways differed between bulk soil and roots, as well as between the roots of the two plant species, suggesting that organisms involved in different N-cycling processes were favored in different compartments in the soil-root environment. Ammonia oxidizers involved in nitrification, a pathway resulting in N-leaching, dominated in soil whereas those related to N2 fixation and gaseous N losses (denitrification) were more abundant on roots. We also observed niche differentiation between the two major groups of organisms with the capacity to reduce N2O in the root- and soil compartment. Legume-grass intercropping resulted in a decreasing trend for several root-associated functional communities. More specifically, the legume exerted an effect on the N-cycling communities on the roots of both the legume and grass species, which suggests altered plant-microbial or microbial-microbial interactions during intercropping. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Denitrification; Forage crops; Legumes; Nitrification; Nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen retention",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022189774

We propose to use clustering to explore anomaly correlation, which indicates the performance of raw GCM forecasts, in the three-dimensional space of latitude, longitude, and initialization time. Focusing on a certain period of the year, correlations for forecasts initialized at different preceding periods form a vector. The vectors of anomaly correlation across different GCM grid cells are clustered to reveal how GCM forecasts perform as time progresses. Through the case study of Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) forecasts of summer precipitation in China, we observe that the correlation at a certain cell oscillates with lead time and can become negative. The use of clustering reveals two meaningful patterns that characterize the relationship between anomaly correlation and lead time. For some grid cells in Central and Southwest China, CFSv2 forecasts exhibit positive correlations with observations and they tend to improve as time progresses. This result suggests that CFSv2 forecasts tend to capture the summer precipitation induced by the East Asian monsoon and the South Asian monsoon. It also indicates that CFSv2 forecasts can potentially be applied to improving hydrological forecasts in these regions. For some other cells, the correlations are generally close to zero at different lead times. This outcome implies that CFSv2 forecasts still have plenty of room for further improvement. The robustness of the patterns has been tested using both hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering and examined with the Silhouette score. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

In shallow lakes, the lake bottom may shift from being inundated to being exposed, which substantially alters the energy exchange pattern. We measured the turbulent fluxes of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat over Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, using the eddy covariance method from January to December 2014. Our results show two different diurnal patterns of H and LE related to shifts in the lake's surface type, from land-covered to water-covered. The diurnal variations in H and LE are coupled with net radiation (Rn) during the land-covered period and are out of phase with Rn during the water-covered period. The average Bowen ratio is 0.15 during the water-covered period and exceeds 0.27 during the land-covered period. The ratio of LE to Rn (LE/Rn) is approximately 0.6 on average and is not obviously different between periods. However, H/Rn and the Bowen ratio significantly decrease with increasing water depth, because more energy is stored in the water body during the water-covered period. The relative regulations of LE and H by different environmental variables largely depend on water surface coverage (WSC). Under low WSC conditions, daily LE and H variation are controlled primarily by Rn, whereas under high WSC conditions, daily LE and H are mainly determined by the water vapor deficit multiplied by the wind speed (UΔe) and the surface-air temperature difference multiplied by the wind speed (UΔT), respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Eddy covariance; Energy exchanges; Land cover changes; Large lake","air temperature; Bowen ratio; diurnal variation; eddy covariance; environmental factor; freshwater environment; land cover; net radiation; phase transition; surface energy; water depth; wind velocity; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020311734

Ecological benefits of street trees are getting more attention. Carbon sequestration of street trees refers to the carbon stocks of street trees, which can be a measurement for ecological benefits of street trees. Estimating carbon sequestration in a traditional way is costly and inefficient. In order to solve above problems, a carbon sequestration estimation approach for street trees based on 3D point cloud from vehicle-borne laser scanning system is proposed in this paper. The method can measure the geometric parameters of a street tree, including tree height, crown width, diameter at breast height (DBH), by processing and analyzing point cloud data of an individual tree. Four Chinese scholartree trees and four camphor trees are selected for experiment. The root mean square error (RMSE) of tree height is 0.11m for Chinese scholartree and 0.02m for camphor. Crown widths in X direction and Y direction, as well as the average crown width are calculated. And the RMSE of average crown width is 0.22m for Chinese scholartree and 0.10m for camphor. The last calculated parameter is DBH, the RMSE of DBH is 0.5cm for both Chinese scholartree and camphor. Combining the measured geometric parameters and an appropriate carbon sequestration calculation model, the individual tree's carbon sequestration will be estimated. The proposed method can help enlarge application range of vehicle-borne laser point cloud data, improve the efficiency of estimating carbon sequestration, construct urban ecological environment and manage landscape. © Authors 2017.

In this paper we present new pollen data and other proxies (lithology, grain size, loss-on-ignition (LOIorg at 550 °C)) obtained from a sediment core (BLK11A) from Balikun Lake, north-west China, to explore the vegetation and climate history of 60.4–27.3 ka (1 ka = 1000 calendar years before AD 1950), covering Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Our three main results are: 1) a high relative abundance of thermophilous temperate tree pollen (e.g. Betula) accompanied by other warm-wet associated species (e.g. Ranunculaceae, Cyperaceae, Typha) suggesting warm and wet climate conditions during most of the early MIS3 (59.0–51.7 ka) that resemble the “Holocene optimum” with an increase in effective moisture in most parts of arid western China. Watershed bio-productivity was high as represented by the high LOIorg value. A high abundance of Ephedra pollen was assumed to be caused by frequent shifts in lake level, with locally favourable habitats (dry lake beds) forming when lake area shrank. In addition, an interval with deteriorated climate and vegetation was found between 57 and 56 ka, with a sharp decrease of vegetation cover and bio-productivity. 2) The middle to late MIS3 (51.7–27.3 ka) was marked by the development of desert shrubs (e.g. Rhamnaceae, Nitraria, Zygophyllum), together with low pollen concentrations of upland communities, indicating a continuous and gradually cooling and drying climate that resulted in reduced vegetation cover. Deterioration of the climate is also suggested by the presence of halite deposits and a sustained decrease in watershed bio-productivity. 3) The regional vegetation around Balikun was mainly dominated by Artemisia and Amaranthaceae, which are typical desert-steppe and/or desert taxa, indicating a progressive aridification in north-western China in the late Quaternary. Our new interpretations contradict earlier inferences of highest lake level and wettest conditions prevailing during the late MIS3, and we propose that the decline of northern high-latitude summer insolation and the increase of global ice volume from early to late MIS3 have exerted a remarkable influence on the evolution of vegetation communities and lake level in arid western China on orbital or sub-orbital time scales. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arid western China; Balikun Lake; Late Quaternary; Pollen analysis","arid region; climate change; climate conditions; lake level; marine isotope stage; medicinal plant; paleobotany; palynology; proxy climate record; Quaternary; relative abundance; sediment core; vegetation cover; vegetation history; Balikun Lake; China; Xinjiang Uygur; Amaranthaceae; Artemisia; Betula; Cyperaceae; Ephedra; Nitraria; Ranunculaceae; Rhamnaceae; Typha; Zygophyllum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018361447

Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is a special form of microbial aggregates. In this study, the removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus, enzyme activities and microbial community of AGS under long-term exposure to CuO NPs (at concentrations of 5, 20, 50 mg/L) in aerobic/oxic/anoxic (A/O/A) sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were investigated. The results showed the chronic toxicity caused by different concentrations of CuO NPs (5, 20, 50 mg/L) resulted in increases in the production of ROS of 110.37%, 178.64%, and 188.93% and in the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 108.33%, 297.05%, 335.94%, respectively, compared to the control. Besides, CuO NPs decreased the activities of polyphosphate kinase (PPK) and exophosphatase (PPX), leading to lower phosphorus removal efficiency. However, the NH4+-N removal rates remained stable, and the removal efficiencies of TN increased due to the synthesis of nitrite and nitrous oxide (N2O) reductases. In addition, CuO NPs at concentrations of 0, 5, 20 mg/L increased the secretion of protein (PN) to 90, 91, 105 mg/gVSS, respectively, which could alleviate the toxicity of CuO NPs. High-throughput sequencing showed that CuO NPs increased the abundance of nitrogen-removal bacteria and reduced the abundance of phosphorus-removal bacteria, which is consistent with the results of pollutant removal upon long-term exposure to CuO NPs. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Batch reactors; Copper oxides; Efficiency; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Granular materials; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Phosphorus; Removal; Toxicity; Aerobic granular sludges; Environmental toxicity; High-throughput sequencing; Lactate dehydrogenase; Microbial communities; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Nitrogen and phosphorus removal; Sequencing batch reactors; Nitrogen removal; cupric oxide; lactate dehydrogenase; nanoparticle; nitrite; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; phosphorus; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; copper; cupric oxide; nanoparticle; abundance; bacterium; concentration (composition); enzyme; enzyme activity; long-term change; microbial community; nanoparticle; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; phosphorus; pollutant removal; protein; secretion; sludge; toxicity; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; biomass production; carbon source; cell membrane; chronic toxicity; controlled study; denitrification; enzyme activity; Gemmata; high throughput sequencing; long term exposure; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; Nitrosomonas; Nitrospira; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein secretion; sludge; waste component removal; Zoogloea; bioreactor; sewage; Bioreactors; Copper; Nanoparticles; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029671981

Photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are both related to isoprene emission at large spatiotemporal scales, but neither is a perfect proxy. We apply multiple satellite products and site-level measurements to examine the impact of water deficit on the three interlinked variables at the Missouri Ozarks site during a 20-day mild dryness stress in summer 2011 and a 3-month severe drought in summer 2012. Isoprene emission shows opposite responses to the short- and long-term droughts, while GPP was substantially reduced in both cases. In 2012, both remote-sensed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and satellite HCHO column qualitatively capture reductions in flux-derived GPP and isoprene emission, respectively, on weekly to monthly time scales, but with muted responses. For instance, as flux-derived GPP approaches zero in late summer 2012, SIF drops by 29–33% (July) and 19–27% (August) relative to year 2011. A possible explanation is that electron transport and photosystem activity are maintained to a certain extent under the drought stress. Similarly, flux tower isoprene emissions in July 2012 are 54% lower than July 2011, while the relative reductions in July for 3 independent satellite-derived HCHO data products are 27%, 12% and 6%, respectively. We attribute the muted HCHO response to a photochemical feedback whereby reduced isoprene emission increases the oxidation capacity available to generate HCHO from other volatile organic compound sources. Satellite SIF offers a potential alternative indirect method to monitor isoprene variability at large spatiotemporal scales from space, although further research is needed under different environmental conditions and regions. Our analysis indicates that fairly moderate reductions in satellite SIF and HCHO column may imply severe drought conditions at the surface. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Formaldehyde; Gross primary productivity; Satellite; Solar-induced fluorescence; The Missouri Ozarks; Water stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027556432

Existing studies generally tend to choose a city or an entire region as the research object. For this reason, these kinds of studies can neither analyze the differences in the vehicle emission effects of road charging on regions with different built environment attributes, nor distinguish how different built environment attributes affect the vehicle emission effects of road user charging. To fill in the research gap, this paper focuses on the influences of road charging on the vehicle emissions of regions with different built environment characteristics. In order to achieve the above mentioned goal, this paper first applies a method which combines the land use and transport interaction model with a vehicle emission model to simulate the automobile emissions under different road pricing schemes. Then, using multiple regression analysis, this paper establishes the association between the built environment attributes and the vehicle emissions under different road charging levels. Additionally, using factor analysis and cluster analysis, this research further distinguishes the vehicle emission effects of road pricing based on attributes of the built environment. The results confirmed that road pricing affects vehicle emissions in different regions differently. More importantly, not every region will experience decreases in vehicle emissions after the implementation of a road charging policy. The presence of retail amenities, good street design, and public transportation, the more significant the effect of road pricing in reducing vehicle emissions. Furthermore, a healthy jobs-housing balance is also conducive to the decline of regional automobile emissions as well. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment characteristics; Land use and transport interaction model; Road pricing; Traffic analysis zone typologies; Vehicle emissions","Automobiles; Cluster analysis; Costs; Economics; Land use; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Toll highways; Traffic control; Transportation charges; Built environment; Interaction model; Road pricing; Traffic analysis zones; Vehicle emission; Road vehicles; land use; policy implementation; price dynamics; pricing policy; simulation; traffic emission; traffic management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021449671

In order to curb these trends, the government of China has introduced stricter regulations. With this in mind, it is important to quantify the potential co-benefits of introducing air pollution and climate change mitigation policies. This study proposes relevant scenarios ranging from the current trends (baseline) to the introduction of different policies in the thermal power sector, including different carbon tax rates, technology innovation promotion, and technology cost reduction methods. We aim to comparatively evaluate the impact of the proposed policies within the thermal sector and within the entire socio-economic system. To this end, we used a dynamic input-output (I-O) model, into which high-efficiency technologies were incorporated as new thermal power industries in order to estimate policy impact during the time period 2010-2025. The results of this study demonstrated that the introduction of one or more of the following policies: carbon taxes, subsidies, technology innovation, and technology cost reduction, has no notable impact on the environment or the economy without the implementation of environment regulations. In contrast, the strong support of a government subsidy coupled with strict environmental regulations will promote technological innovation, for example through the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and the integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC). Our study also showed that the reduction of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as well as energy consumption would curb economic development to a certain extent. Taking this into consideration, innovation must also be promoted in other economic sectors. This research provides a strong reference for policy-makers to identify effective polices under different types of environmental regulations. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution; Carbon tax; Environmental regulation; GHG emissions; Subsidy; Technology innovation","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; climate change; economic development; environmental degradation; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; innovation; natural gas; pollution tax; regulatory approach; subsidy system; technological development; thermal power; China; Chongqing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030151926

However, one of the major challenges for LTC is the cold condition. In cold conditions, stable compression ignition is hard to realize, while thermal efficiency and emissions deteriorate, especially for gasoline or fuel with high octane number. This study presents using pressure sensor glow plugs (PSG) to realize Glow plug assisted compression ignition (GA-CI) at cold conditions. Further, a glow plug control unit (GPCU) is developed, a closed-loop power feedback control algorithm is introduced based on GPCU. In the experiment, engine coolant temperature is swept. Experimental results show that GA-CI has earlier combustion phases, larger combustion duration and higher in-cylinder pressure. And misfire is avoided, cycle-to-cycle variations are greatly reduced. Moreover, though NOx emissions rise slightly, significant reductions of CO emissions HC emissions and PM emissions are observed. Further analysis shows that under GA-CI the combustion efficiency is enhanced nearly 2% at all test points. The glow plug plays a role of a hot spot that increases the temperature of neighboring region and the reactivity of the charge in this region. As a result, it triggers the inhomogeneous charge and helps to realize better combustion process under cold condition.

Climate-sensitive events have already been critical obstacles of poverty reduction and sustainable economic development. Assessing how climate change affects poverty reduction is of great significance to the comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts on social economy and mitigation of its negative impacts. With geo-spatially referenced malnutrition and infant mortality data as a proxy for poverty, focusing on the aspects of agriculture and human well-being that consist of physical health and personal autonomy. This study selects three countries, China, India and Senegal, to investigate the impacts of climate change on poverty reduction. Contrast to previous work when analyze climate changes’ impacts most concentrated on coastal urban areas, this paper is focused more on the rural poor areas and conduct a contrastive analysis of different income groups of countries. The correlation analysis results show the same is that the indicators of climate change are in significant correlations with indicators of poverty and that of agriculture and human well-being in China, India and Senegal.

We examined the changes in plant biomass C and soil organic C (SOC) storage across a chronosequence of E. urophylla × E. grandis forests (4-, 7-, 10-, 13-, and 21-year-old) in subtropical China. Biomass C stock significantly increased with stand age. SOC storage increased initially after afforestation, peaking in 10-year-old stands, and declined gradually. Ecosystem C pools in the five development stages were 111.76, 167.66, 234.04, 281.00, and 299.29 Mg ha−1, respectively. Trees and soils were the dominant C pools across all stand ages with the contribution of tree biomass C storage significantly increasing and SOC storage decreasing with age. Eucalyptus plantations are still in vigorous growth phase and have great potential for C sequestration at the end of the current rotation length (within 7 years). Considering the sharp decrease of annual biomass C increment rate and the gradual loss of SOC storage in stands older than 13 years, we recommend the optimal length for one full Eucalyptus plantation cycle should be 12–15 years in subtropical China to maximize land-use value and carbon sink value. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon allocation; Carbon sequestration; Chronosequence; Eucalyptus hybrid; Plantation forest; Subtropical China","Biomass; Carbon; Land use; Reforestation; Soils; Tropics; Carbon allocation; Carbon sequestration; Chronosequences; Eucalyptus hybrid; Plantation forests; Subtropical China; Ecology; afforestation; biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; chronosequence; developmental stage; evergreen tree; hybrid; organic carbon; plantation forestry; soil carbon; subtropical region; Biomass; Eucalyptus; Forests; Plantations; Rotation; China; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus grandis; Eucalyptus hybrida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019246034

This study shows that particulate matter with particle sizes below 10 micron (PM10) is most closely related to the incidence of lung cancer among air pollution factors including annual mean concentrations of SO2, NO2, PM10, annual haze days, and annual mean Air Pollution Index/Air Quality Index (API/AQI). Air pollution has a greater impact on urban inhabitants as compared to rural inhabitants. When gender differences are considered, women are more likely to develop lung cancer due to air pollution. Smokers are more likely to suffer from lung cancer.

As the first step in the process of CO2 reduction, CO2 adsorption plays an important role in photocatalytic activity. In the present work, the CO2 adsorption ability of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was evaluated by adsorption energy derived from first-principle calculation. To provide a more realistic result, a variety of parameters, including various adsorption sites, separation distances and rotation angles were examined to determine the most stable adsorption system. The results showed that CO2 molecule preferred to adsorb at the two-coordinated nitrogen atom, which contributed to both valance band and conduction band edge. The most negative adsorption energy obtained was -0.4181 eV, which is indicative of physisorption. The electronic properties of the adsorbed system were investigated, including band gap, density of states, work function, the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. The effects of molecular number of the adsorbate and layer number of the adsorbent on the adsorption behavior were also examined.

The Grain for Green Project, local natural resources, and geographical conditions have resulted in farmland conversion into tea plantations in the hilly region of Western Sichuan. However, the effect of such land conversion on SOC mineralization remains unknown. In order to understand the temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition in tea plantations converted from farmland, this study considered the different years (i.e., 2-3, 9-10, and 16-17 years) of tea plantations converted from farmland as the study site, and soil was incubated for 28 days at 15°C, 25°C, and 35°C to measure the soil respiration rate, amount, and temperature coefficient (Q10). Temperature and land use type interactively affected the SOC mineralization rate, and the cumulative amount of SOC mineralization in all the plots was the largest at 35°C. SOC mineralization was greater and more sensitive to temperature changes in the farmland than in the tea plantations. Compared with the control, tea plantation soils showed lower SOC mineralization rate and cumulative mineralization amount. The 16-17-year-old tea plantation with a low SOC mineralization amount and high SOC content revealed the benefits of carbon sequestration enhancement obtained by converting farmland into tea plantations. The first-order kinetic equation described SOC mineralization dynamics well. Farmland conversion into tea plantations appeared to reduce the potentially mineralizable carbon pool, and the age of tea plantations also had an effect on the SOC mineralization and sequestration. The relatively weak SOC mineralization temperature sensitivity of the tea plantation soils suggested that the SOC pool of the tea plantation soils was less vulnerable to warming than that of the control soils. © 2017 Zhu et al.",,"carbon; soil; agricultural land; agriculture; Camellia sinensis; chemistry; China; computer simulation; soil; temperature; Agriculture; Camellia sinensis; Carbon; China; Computer Simulation; Farms; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031682264

Given the uncertainty about carbon pricing and the outcomes of FCS management, household perceptions of FCS management will be heavily dependent upon their risk attitudes, especially in developing countries with rich forest resources. Using a survey of 200 smallholder forest managers in Zhejiang Province in China and a risk experiment, this paper analyzes how the risk attitudes of households drive their FCS supply. We simulated the carbon supply with different risk attitudes of households based on a revised Faustmann model and a sensitivity analysis. A key finding is that compared with a timber benefit only, FCS management will generate more investment value. However, households have little incentive to change their harvest decision-making when the carbon price is low. Among the three identified risk attitude groups, although they have the same optimal rotation age when the carbon value is considered, their carbon supply per hectare is different due to difference in their planting densities. Also, the rotation age with FCS management and the FCS supply per hectare do not change significantly unless there is a substantial change in the carbon price, the management costs and the discount rate for all three risk attitude groups completely. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Faustmann model; Forest carbon sequestration; Halt–Laury risk experiment; Optimal rotation age","carbon sequestration; developing world; farmers attitude; forest management; forest resource; numerical model; optimization; perception; smallholder; China; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992205933

Empirical examples of governance networks include, but are not limited to, watershed partnerships, airshed partnerships, regional transportation and land-use planning networks and climate action partnerships. For this study of watershed governance networks, we develop agent-based models to examine how agents holding diverse beliefs interact under different assumptions for network structure. Using a simulation methodology, we address three research questions: (1) How do voting outcomes in watershed partnerships differ when planning proposals with low, medium and high scores on decision criteria regarding the environment, market and local government are introduced for discussion and voting by agents with heterogeneous mental models? (2) How sensitive are decision making outcomes to changes in the tolerance of a network members' beliefs to other members' beliefs in small world versus like-minded networks? (3) How sensitive are decision-making outcomes to changes in the average number of connections per agent in small world versus tolerance of belief difference in connections in like-minded networks? Results from a survey of watershed stakeholders are used to initialize the simulated beliefs of six stakeholder groups in an agent-based model: environmentalists, farmers, business people, government officials, and water and forestry experts. Simulated voting outcomes are sensitive to both stakeholder beliefs and simulated social networks among stakeholders. Increasing an agent's tolerance of other's beliefs increases the likelihood of majority or consensus voting on planning proposals. Counter to our expectations, simulated group consensus emerged more readily in small world networks than like-minded networks in which stakeholders had narrow thresholds of tolerance for other beliefs. As the diversity of stakeholder connections increases, consensus becomes more likely for watershed and other environmental planning governance networks. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Agent Based Models; Governance Networks; Mental Models; Network Science; Voting Behavior; Watershed Partnerships","Autonomous agents; Cognitive systems; Computational methods; Decision making; Land use; Mergers and acquisitions; Motor transportation; Small-world networks; Watersheds; Agent-based model; Environmental planning; Government officials; Mental model; Network science; Regional transportation; Simulation methodology; Voting behaviors; Behavioral research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049383027

Energy saving measures reduce energy consumption, CO2 emissions and installed capacity of heating equipment thus facilitating the transition of the DH system towards zero emission system. Reduction of the required installed heating capacity allows implementing a low-temperature regime for heat distribution networks. For four of the analyzed scenarios this regime was achieved without increase of electricity consumption for heat supply. Results show that the implementation of 4GDH depends on the policies applied. The research identifies a balance point between the implementation of energy efficiency measures at the source and at heat consumers’ side.

This article offers a survey of CCS projects in the South China Sea region and discusses the legal challenges associated with CCS activities in state practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); China; Climate change; South China Sea; Southeast Asia","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; developing world; emission control; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026253155

This move has great significance in Chinese history, and the reasons for it have aroused intense and long-lasting controversy. To explore the environmental factors underlying this event, this study focuses on the impact of natural disasters on Pingcheng in the fifth century based on continuous high-resolution paleoclimatic data combined with extensive historical records. It finds that Pingcheng experienced a significant decline in the late 470s CE as a result of continuous droughts and a low-temperature environment. Moreover, it is argued that the rapid growth of the population in Pingcheng might have increased its societal vulnerability to natural disasters. By comparing the food systems and geographical locations of Pingcheng and Luoyang, this study suggests that the relocation of the capital should be considered as an adaptation to climate change and a mitigation of its effects by the Northern Wei dynasty. In addition, the paper shows that other important cities along latitude 40° N in East Asia also stopped growing during this period of rapid climate change. © 2017","Capital city; China; Climate; Drought; Migration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028623007

The results showed that, for a state-of-the-art GDI engine, PN emissions met the Euro 6c limit on the New European Driving Cycle and Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Test Cycle regulatory test cycles. During the on-road Real Driving Emission campaign, PN emissions were below the not-to-exceed limit (NTE) limit. PN emissions of the vehicle without the GPF increased when vehicle acceleration, dynamometer load, and ambient temperature were varied towards the boundary conditions defined within the RDE procedure. With the use of the GPF, PN emissions stayed below the NTE limit, even towards the RDE boundary. NOx emissions were always below the Euro 6d NTE limit in the original configuration throughout the tests.
