These observations, recorded every 15 days since 1847, provide direct insight into the effect of large-scale atmospheric motions in climatological studies. The lake drains nearly 100,000 km2, and it thus acts as a spatial filter for the finest degrees of freedom for climate. In filtering out a very large number of atmospheric and climatological motions, it reduces its complexity but retains its effectiveness as a climate sensing system. We demonstrate that there are four degrees of freedom active in the Great Salt Lake volume record, that these data reside on a strange attractor of dimension slightly larger than three, and that these data are predictable with a horizon of order a few years. We then show that predictive models based on local properties on the attractor perform remarkably well in reproducing the observations when trained on earlier observations. The ability to predict using earlier observations on the attractor suggests very strongly that over the period of the record, the system has been stationary and that it is a record of the natural variation of the climate. If there is anthropomorphic influence leading to changes in climate, this record suggests it has not made its effect measurable in such large-scale integrating observations.

The proposed mathematical model incorporates optimal power flow (OFF) constraints in the unit commitment stage. By OFF constrains, we refer to the relevant active power constraints that are incorporated in the constrained economic dispatch stage (i.e. transmission capacity constraints, fuel and various regulated emission requirements). The inclusion of OFF constraints in the commitment stage will improve the feasibility of the constrained economic dispatch solution. Other unit commitment constraints such as spinning and operating reserve requirements, power balance as well as other relevant local constraints (i.e. unit ramping rates, upper and lower generation limits, minimum up and down times) are taken into account in the proposed model. As we deal with a larger number of constraints, a more rigorous method is introduced for updating Lagrange multipliers to improve the solution convergence.

The CoPc(BuO)8 worked as a catalyst to produce CO with higher activity and selectivity than the non-substituted CoPc. Under typical conditions at pH 4.4, the most active and selective CO2 reduction was achieved at -1.30 V with turnover number of the catalyst ~1.1 x 106 h-1 and the selectivity of the produced CO/H2 ~4.2. The high activity was ascribed to the electron-donating BuO substituents of the complex, which would facilitate the coordination of CO2 as well as the electron transfer from the complex to the coordinated CO2 molecule. The use of a poly(4-vinylpyridine) membrane to disperse the complex decreased the activity. The mechanism was investigated by the use of in situ potential- step chronoamperospectroscopy (PSCAS) in a homogeneous CoPc(BuO)8/pyridine solution. In the absence of CO2, distinct two-steps visible spectral changes were observed following the first and second reductions of the complex. However, under CO2 atmosphere, only the one-electron reduced species was present under steady state. It was proposed that the third reduction of a CO2-coordinated CoPc(BuO)8 should take place for CO production.","Catalytic mechanism; Cobalt octabutoxyphthalocyanine; Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction; Potential-step chronoamperospectroscopy (PSCAS)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030579140

The model is applied to study the distribution of soot particles in a direct-injection Diesel engine. In particular, the effect of thermophoresis on soot distribution is examined. It is shown that thermophoresis could be important once the soot particles are brought close to the walls, i.e. within the boundary layer, by turbulent eddy convection or as a result of the orientation of the sprays. Thermophoresis does not appear to result in a change in the distribution of soot in the regions outside the boundary layer as the characteristic time associated with turbulent eddy convection is at least an order of magnitude shorter than that associated with thermophoresis and it and bulk convection are by far the dominant factors in determining the soot distribution. Particulate emissions from Diesel engines are stringently regulated because of their harmful effects on health and the environment. The limit on particulate matter emissions from heavy-duty Diesel engines is 0.1 g/bhp.hr for 1994 and become tighter in the coming years [1, 2]. The challenge of attaining these goals by faster mixing and faster combustion is confounded by the fact that NO emissions, which are also toxic and therefore regulated, tend to increase as particulate emissions decrease and vice versa [3]. Diesel engine manufacturers have adopted various strategies, such as increased injection pressures and retarded timings, to meet these goals [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11]. But as the regulations become tighter, and the rather obvious sources of particulate emissions are better controlled, it becomes necessary to understand the physical processes that control particulate formation and oxidation in greater detail and depth so as to design effective strategies of control. In identifying and understanding these processes, wall deposition mechanisms have been explored as a possible one [12, 13]. It has been suggested that during combustion in the Diesel engine, wall deposition mechanisms result in particulate matter being deposited on walls where they are shielded from oxidation. During the exhaust blowdown process, these particulates that are on the wall would be vigorously stirred and stripped off the walls by the shear forces induced by the high velocity gas stream and they would then be reentrained and exhausted. The lack of oxidation of particulate matter trapped on walls results in the particulate concentration in the chamber being higher than it should be otherwise during exhaust [12]. Several of these wall deposition mechanisms that might be relevant in Diesel engines have been reviewed in the literature by Suhre and Foster [13]. They considered thermophoresis, inertial deposition, electrophoresis and gravitational sedimentation. Characteristic times associated with these processes were estimated and the authors concluded that thermophoresis was likely to be the most important of these mechanisms. Inertial deposition, though less important, was also likely to be a minor contributor. In thermophoresis, particles move down a temperature gradient because of the differential forces acting on them due to differences in molecular collisions on the hot and cold sides [14]. Experimental measurements made by Kittelson et.al [12] suggests that the thermophoretic effect is likely to be an important mechanism affecting soot deposition on walls and emission from Diesel engines. They carried out measurements of deposition rates on a probe in an indirect-injection Diesel engine and concluded that wall deposition rates were significant and caused by thermophoresis. They support their results by using simple analysis. Similar measurements and analysis were also carried out by Suhre and Foster who arrived at similar conclusions [13]. Theoretical expressions for the thermophoretic force have been derived in the limit of high Knudsen number [15] and low Knudsen number [14]. The Knudsen number is the ratio of the gas mean free path to the soot particle radius. For soot particles, Knudsen numbers may vary by as much as three orders of magnitude and so using one expression or the other is not always rigorously justified [12]. However, the likely error in using one expression over the other is only a few percent even in the limit and so theoretical expressions for thermophoretic velocities may be derived by equating the thermophoretic force to the drag force on the particle which are approximately valid over the range of particle sizes that are encountered in a Diesel engine [16]. Then, characteristic times associated with the thermophoretic process may be estimated. These estimates would typically lie in the order of milliseconds, which in an engine running at 1500rpm would correspond to about 100°CA. Such estimates have been presented in the work of Kittelson et.al [12] and Suhre and Foster [13]. However, these estimates do not consider the details of the spatial and temporal variations in the flowfield, such as in the spatial distribution of temperature, the gas velocity and the details of the boundary layer. The anaylsis presented have been essentially zero-dimensional. In this work, a three dimensional model for flows, sprays, combustion and emissions in Diesel engines is used to evaluate the possible effects of thermophoresis on soot distribution in a Diesel engine. The accuracy of the model has been assessed previously in comparisons with experimental data [17]. These comparisons were of cylinder pressure, soot and NO as a function of crank angle. Adequate quantitative agreement and also agreement in trends with changes in engine conditions were obtained. Such models are being used increasingly to provide guidance in identifying strategies for engine design to improve efficiency and reduce emissions [17, 18, 19 and 20]. Also, in this work, we use a recently developed method to compute soot particle dynamics. This approach, based on a stochastic particle technique which is described in detail elsewhere [21], is briefly summarized below. The approach allows the calculation of the effects of various forces on the soot particles with relative ease and hence is appropriate for computing thermophoretic effects in multidimensional computations. In the next section, we describe the three-dimensional model that we use in our work. The stochastic particle approach is briefly described in this section. Following this, we present and discuss the results of our work. We end the paper with summary and conclusions. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Combustion; Deposition rates; Direct injection; Drag; Dust; Electrophoresis; Machine design; Oxidation; Particle size; Particulate emissions; Process control; Sedimentation; Shear flow; Soot; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Thermophoresis; Direct injection diesel engines; Gravitational sedimentation; Indirect injection diesel engine; Particulate matter emissions; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatial distribution of temperature; Thermophoretic velocities; Three orders of magnitude; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072446179

Pollution by oxides of nitrogen, which is mainly caused by the transport sector, has not been included in this study. The report concludes that although economic restructuring alone can be expected to improve air quality, at least for a while, strictly enforced ""command-and-control"" should lead to further improvements; that clear cost savings can be achieved through incentive-based instruments; that a tax on a single fuel, such as coal, is not sufficiently broadly based to be an effective policy instrument for pollution control; and that although implementation of any policy to improve air quality in the Krakow area will raise the costs of energy supply, the effect on energy prices should be minor in relation to the consequences of economic restructuring in Poland as a whole. The analysis yields some interesting insights into differences between pollution control policies that focus on air quality rather than on emissions. In the Krakow area, the study shows, market-based instruments (both taxes and tradable permits) targeting emissions are much less appropriate for problems of local air pollution; and the comparison between the resource costs of the various policies considered indicates that economic instruments by themselves may not be able to deliver an efficient solution. The household sector has a disproportionate effect on air quality and has high abatement costs. Apart from the complexity of implementing and monitoring economic instruments at the household level, it may be more efficient to impose a ban on coal use (possibly limited to the town center) and leave economic instruments to allocate pollution control responsibilities among the other sources. As far as tradable permits are concerned, the report argues that a simple emission permit trading system extended to all sources would not be appropriate to tackle the air quality problem in Krakow. At the same time, an emission trading system confined to large sources would yield a result that is similar to that of the emission tax scenario. For these reasons, the report suggests that environmental policy may have to rely on a mixed strategy of applying ""command-and-control"" measures to households and economic instruments to larger sources. Economic incentives, such as emission taxes and emission permit trading, can help reduce the costs of abating emissions from large pollution sources. Nevertheless, it makes sense to treat small pollution sources differently, because they exhibit different abatement costs and markedly different effects on the local environment.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244321783

A root-zone nitrate leaching study in this area revealed that soils with a high carbon concentration had minimal leaching compared to soils with lower concentrations. Soils high in carbon have an active population of denitrifying bacteria possibly causing denitrification and in turn reduction of nitrate leaching. Denitrifying bacteria are principally heterotrophic using soil organic carbon for both an energy and carbon source. The objective of this research was to interpret how root-zone denitrification affected nitrate leaching and ground water contamination by nitrate. A modified version of a solute transport model developed for the Eastern Sandhills was used to assess the risk of nitrate contamination for combinations of fertilizer and irrigation rates and for various soil carbon levels. The first attempt was to make risk assessment with eight farm management practices for cells with increasingly greater carbon levels until only those cells with the greatest carbon level were kept in production. Results of this assessment showed that even with excessive fertilizer and irrigation rates, risk of nitrate leaching was reduced as the minimum carbon level was increased. However, since less cropland was leaching nitrate with each successive risk calculation, the impact that root-zone denitrification had in nitrate leaching reduction could not be definitively determined. This prompted a model modification of the risk calculation procedure which kept all cropland in production and computed nitrate leachate risk For increasingly higher artificial carbon levels during successive risk calculations. Changing carbon levels was still more detrimental on nitrate leaching rates than changing farm management practices.","Groundwater; Monte Carlo simulation; Nitrate; Nonpoint source pollution","carbon; fertilizer; ground water; nitrate; bacterial metabolism; conference paper; crop; denitrification; leaching; model; pollution transport; risk assessment; soil; United States; water contamination; Agriculture; Carbon; Computer simulation; Contamination; Denitrification; Environmental impact; Leaching; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Nitrates; Risk assessment; Soils; Nonpoint source pollution; Soil carbon levels; Solute transport model; Groundwater pollution; bacterium; carbon; contamination; denitrification; fertilizer; leaching; nitrate; risk assessment; soil; united states; groundwater pollution; nitrate; soil organic carbon; USA, Nebraska; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029657669

The design of PV plant was based on the specification of the site, the depth and quality of water, the daily water quantity produced and the autonomy period of the plant during cloudy conditions as well as other local climatic conditions. The plant has two main PV separate systems, first, PV water pumping system which is characterized by storing the water in two storage tanks and without electric energy storage, second, PV system for the operation of the reverse osmosis unit (water desalination), this system is characterized by the storage of electric energy (batteries). The storage batteries are used to supply the required electric power to the equipment in the plant, during night and cloudy weather. The batteries capacity is designed to be sufficient for 5 days autonomy. In order to make the operation and maintenance of the PV plant highly reliable, the design is based on the selection of equipment which are commonly available in the local market. The head of the submersible pump is 50 m from surface level, and the amount of water production from Reverse Osmosis Unit is about 600 liters per hour. The total installed PV capacity for pumping system is 980 Wp, and for desalination system is 10.89 kWp. In this paper the performance analysis and the development in the plant are discussed.","Desalination; Photovotaics; Pumping; Remote area; Reverse osmosis; Saudi Arabia; Solar","Desalination; Electric batteries; Maintenance; Performance; Photovoltaic cells; Plant layout; Pumps; Reverse osmosis; Site selection; Water quality; Water supply systems; Photovoltaic plants; Remote area; Saudi Arabia; Water pumping; Solar power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042036837

This focuses on industrialized countries, drawing heavily on those countries that have been actively involved in PCDD/F monitoring and research, notably Germany, the United States, Sweden, The Netherlands, and the U.K. Information on temporal trends comes from the analysis of dateable deposits (e.g., sediments), retrospective analysis of preserved or archived samples, and ongoing monitoring programs. The data on changes in air concentrations, deposition, sediments, soil, biota, food, and human tissues are reviewed. The evidence for natural input/formation of PCDD/Fs is also briefly reviewed and discussed. Human activity has dominated PCDD/F inputs to the environment this century. Conceptually, it is probably appropriate to consider a 'pulse' of PCDD/Fs arising from human activities entering the environment in the 1930/1940s, peaking in the 1960/1970s, and continuing to a lesser degree today. A series of measures introduced in the past, recently, and anticipated for the future have reduced emissions to the atmosphere of industrialized countries and are projected to continue to reduce emissions over the coming decade.

C., Allen, J. P., and Lubitz, W. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 8130-8143]. Pigment extractions and Fourier transform Raman spectra confirm that all of the mutants contain a heterodimer. The bands in the resonance Raman spectra arising from the BPhe molecule, which is selectively enhanced, exhibit the shifts expected for the addition of a hydrogen bond to the 9-keto and 2-acetyl carbonyl groups. The oxidation reduction midpoint potential of the donor is increased by approximately 85 mV by the addition of a hydrogen bond to the BChl molecule but is only increased by approximately 15 mV by the addition of a hydrogen bond to the BPhe molecule. An increase in the rate of charge recombination from the primary quinone is correlated with an increase in the midpoint potential. The yield of electron transfer to the primary quinone is 5-fold reduced for the mutants with a hydrogen bond to the BPhe molecule. Room- and low-temperature optical absorption spectra show small differences from the features that are typical for the heterodimer, except that a large increase in absorption is observed around 860-900 nm for the donor Q(y) band in the mutant that adds a hydrogen bond to the BChl molecule. The changes in the optical spectra and the yield of electron transfer are consistent with a model in which the addition of a hydrogen bond to the BChl molecule increases the energy of an internal charge transfer state while the addition to the BPhe molecule stabilizes this state. The results show that the properties of the heterodimer are different depending on which side is hydrogen-bonded and suggest that the hydrogen bonds alter the energy of the internal charge transfer state in a well- defined manner.",,"bacteriochlorophyll; bacteriopheophytin; article; controlled study; electron transport; hydrogen bond; molecular interaction; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phytochemistry; priority journal; protein protein interaction; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacteriochlorophylls; Fourier Analysis; Histidine; Hydrogen Bonding; Leucine; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Macromolecular Substances; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Pheophytins; Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins; Point Mutation; Recombinant Proteins; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Spectrophotometry; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Rhodopseudomonas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15844403219

Rates of O2 consumption and CO2 release were faster in the very fine sand (41- 43% CaCO3 content) of the sheltered lagoon of Mangrove Bay (means = 10.5 mmol m-2 day-1 O2 and 9.4 mmol m-2 day-1 CO2) than in the carbonate-rich (73% CaCO3) sand of the exposed back-reef lagoon of Ningaloo Reef (means = 2.1 mmol m-2 day-1 O2 and 3.5 mmol m-2 day-1 CO2). Rates of sulfate reduction (ΣSRR) were similarly faster in the Mangrove Bay sediments (6.1-25.3 mmol m-2 day-1 S), sufficient to account for all of the organic matter mineralization. In Ningaloo reef sands, ΣSRR rates (1.0 mmol m-2 day-1 S) accounted for a significant fraction (57%) of total organic carbon oxidation. In Mangrove Bay, in contrast to previous measurements of sulfate reduction in tropical sediments, most (mean = 64%) of the reduced 35S was incorporated into the acid-volatile sulfide fraction with a buildup of iron sulfides. In contrast to most carbonate-bearing sediments, the production and accumulation of Fe sulfides (most evident in Mangrove Bay) increased pH to levels promoting carbonate precipitation. Higher decomposition rates in Mangrove Bay are attributed to restricted water circulation, a richer benthic community, and geomorphology conducive to greater input and retention of mangrove- and macroalgae-derived detritus. At both sites, the lack of a clear zonational sequence of porewater solutes, discrepancies between depth profiles of solutes and solid-phase elements, and high core-to-core variation in conservative element concentrations and in rates of bacterial activity, suggest non-steady state diagenesis. Non-steady state conditions may be fostered by a combination of factors, such as physical disturbances, temporal changes in rates and quality of organic sedimentation, and tidal advection.","biogeochemistry; carbonate; organic matter; sediment; terrigenous; Western Australia","biogeochemistry; carbonate; diagenesis; lagoon; lagoons; organic matter; oxidation; terrigenous sediment; terrigenous sediments; Australia, Western Australia, Ningaloo Reef",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030251189

Twenty-four workers from petroleum plants in Poland and 35 unexposed controls were examined for cytogenetic effects and ras oncoprotein levels and their relationship to confounding factors (e.g., smoking habit, sex, family cancer history, and seasonal influence). Preliminary data of chromosome aberrations (CA) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) showed differences among sampling subgroups. In this present study, the levels of ras p21 proteins were determined and further analyses of CA, SCE, high frequency cells (HFC), and proliferative rate index (PRI) have been undertaken. Results show that the exposed group has statistically significant increases in CA, and percent of aberrant cells. There were no differences between exposed and unexposed groups in SCE, HFC, PRI, or the levels of ras p21 proteins. Smoking was found to statistically significantly affect levels of CA, percent of aberrant cells, SCE, HFC, and ras proteins. Sister chromatid exchanges were also statistically significantly sex dependent (7.5 breaks/cell for females and 6.8 breaks/cell for males). There were no statistically significant differences for CA, percent aberrant cells, SCE, HFC, or ras p21 protein levels in subgroups characterized according to cancer cases reported in the immediate family. A seasonal variability was shown with statistically significant increases in various biomarkers in the winter. Unexposed groups also showed increases due to smoking and season. The nonsmoking group individuals also showed statistically significant increases in cytogenetic damage with exposure.","Chromosome aberrations; Petroleum emissions; ras oncoproteins; Workers","benzene; biological marker; petroleum; protein p21; adult; biological monitoring; chromosome aberration; conference paper; controlled study; cytogenetics; DNA strand breakage; family history; female; genetic damage; human; human cell; human tissue; male; normal human; occupational exposure; petrochemical industry; Poland; priority journal; risk factor; seasonal variation; sister chromatid exchange; smoking habit",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030011090

The assumptions used in the MOBILE model continue to receive scrutiny. Comments about potential inconsistencies in transportation data and activity levels also impact I/M emission reduction quantification. This paper summarizes recent I/M issues, briefly critiques the emission factor models (MOBILE5a_h & MVEI7G), discusses methodologies and uncertainties in vehicle miles of travel (VMT) estimates, and briefly critiques the multi-step regional transportation models. EPA and FHWA have agreed to base emissions inventories on the annual VMT reports produced by state DOTs using the existing national Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS). Metropolitan Planning Organizations have been advised to calibrate the network modeled VMT to HPMS volumes, but some MPOs have resisted. Network models can underestimate VMT by 10% to 40% when compared to HPMS VMT. MPOs may resist HPMS calibration for fear that excessive VMT growth will require more restrictive TCMs. The error in emissions quantification due to flawed VMT estimates may be significant. Potential errors in emission inventory data gathering may have led to questionable and incomplete policy decisions under CAAA 90. Since the goals of attaining cleaner air standards are moving targets, new control strategies can be fashioned from lessons learned so far. Issues of I/M program type will resurface in 2005 if areas do not attain the standards. A renewed analysis of diesel emissions is warranted presently, especially given states' reliance on NOx reductions to improve air quality.",,"Air quality; Calibration; Estimation; Ground vehicles; Laws and legislation; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Societies and institutions; Standards; Emission control; Emission factor model; Emission inventory; Vehicle miles of travel; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030315365

Downs Blvd., Tampa, FL 33612, United States; Lindahl, P.A., Department of Chemistry, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX 77843, United States","CO dehydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2, at an active site (called the C-cluster) composed of an Fe4S4 cube with what appears to be a 5-coordinate Fe (called FCII), linked to a Ni (Hu, Z., Spangler, N. J., Anderson, M. E., Xia, J., Ludden, P. W., Lindahl, P. A., and Munck, E. (1996) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 830-845). During catalysis, electrons are transferred from the C-cluster to an [Fe4S4](2+/1+) electron-transfer cluster called the B-cluster. An S = 1/4 form of the C-cluster (called C(red1)) converts to another S = 1/4 form (called C(red2)) upon reduction with CO, at a rate well within the turnover frequency of the enzyme (Kumar, M., Lu, W.-P., Liu, L., and Ragsdale, S. W. (1993) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 11646- 11647). This suggests that the conversion is part of the catalytic mechanism. Dithionite is reported in this paper to effect this conversion as well, but at a much slower rate (k(so) = 5.3 x 10-2 M-1 s-1 for dithionite vs 4.4 x 106 M-1 s-1 for CO). By contrast, dithionite reduces the oxidized B- cluster much faster, possibly within the turnover frequency of the enzyme. Dithionite apparently effects the C(red1)/C(red2) conversion directly, rather than through an intermediate. The conversion rate varies with dithionite concentration. The C(red1)/C(red2) conversion occurs at least 102 times faster in the presence of CO2 than in its absence. CO2 alters the g values of the g(av) = 1.82 signal, indicating that CO2 binds to a C-cluster- sensitive site at mild potentials. CN- inhibits CO oxidation by binding to FCII (Hu et al., 1996), and CO, CO2 in the presence of dithionite, or CS2 in dithionite accelerate CN- dissociation from this site (Anderson, M. E., and Lindahl, P. A. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 8702-8711). The effect of CO, CO2, and CS2 on CN- dissociation suggested that these molecules bind at a site (called the modulator) other than that to which CN- binds. The effects of CO2, CS2, CO, and dithionite on the C(red1)/C(red2) conversion rate followed a similar pattern, suggesting that this rate is also influenced by modulator binding. Some batches of enzyme cannot convert to the C(red2) form using dithionite, but pretreatment with CO or CO2/dithionite effectively 'cures' such batches of this disability. The results presented suggest that the Ni of the C-cluster is the modulator and the substrate binding site for CO/CO2. The inhibitor CS2 in the presence of dithionite also accelerates the decline of C(red1), leading first to an EPR-silent state of the C- cluster, and eventually to a state yielding an EPR signal with g(av) = 1.66. CS2 binding thus shares some resemblance to CO2 binding. Approximately 90% of the absorbance changes at 420 nm that occur when oxidized CODH(Ct) is reduced by dithionite occur within 2 min at 10 °C. This absorbance change occurs in concert with the g(av) = 1.94 signal development. The remaining 10% of the A420 changes occur over the course of ~50 min, apparently coincident with the C(red1)/C(red2) conversion. One possibility is that the conversion involves reduction of an (unidentified) Fe-S cluster. A three- state model of catalysis is proposed in which C(red1) binds and oxidizes CO, C(red2) is tWO electrons more reduced than C(red1) and is the state that binds and reduces CO2, and C(int) is a one-electron-reduced state that is proposed to exist because of constraints imposed by the nature of the CO/CO2 reaction and the properties of the clusters involved in catalysis.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; dithionite; article; bacterial metabolism; binding site; catalysis; clostridium; electron spin resonance; enzyme active site; enzyme substrate; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Binding Sites; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Clostridium; Dithionite; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Kinetics; Metalloproteins; Models, Chemical; Multienzyme Complexes; Nickel; Oxidation-Reduction; Spectrophotometry; Bacteria (microorganisms); Clostridium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030057102

First Ave., Maywood, IL 60153, United States","The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PIS1 gene encodes phosphatidylinositol synthase. The amount of phosphatidylinositol synthase is not affected by the presence of inositol and choline in the growth medium. This is unusual because the amounts and/or activities of other phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes are affected by these precursors, and the promoter of the PIS1 gene contains a sequence resembling the regulatory element that coordinates the inositol-mediated regulation (UAS(INO)). We found that transcription of the PIS1 gene was insensitive to inositol and choline and did not require the putative UAS(INO) regulatory sequence or the cognate regulatory genes (INO2 and OPI1). The PIS1 promoter includes sequences (MCEs) that bind the Mcm1 protein. Because the Mcm1 protein interacts with both the Sin1 and the Gal11 regulatory proteins, we examined the effect of mutant alleles of the MCM1 and SLN1 genes and carbon source on expression of the PIS1 gene. We found that expression of the PIS1 gene was reduced when cells were grown in a medium containing glycerol and increased when grown in a medium containing galactose relative to cells grown in a glucose medium. The glycerol-mediated repression of PIS1 gene expression required both the MCM1 gene and the MCEs, whereas the SLN1 gene was required for full galactose-mediated induction of a PIS1-lacZ reporter gene. Thus, PIS1 gene expression is unique among the phospholipid biosynthetic structural genes because it is uncoupled from the inositol response and regulated in response to the carbon source. This is the first example in yeast of a complete circuit linking a stimulus (carbon source) to gene regulation (PIS1) using a two-component regulator (SLN1).",,"carbon; choline; cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol inositol 3 phosphatidyltransferase; fungal protein; fungal rna; inositol; phospholipid; article; culture medium; enzyme activity; fungus growth; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; nonhuman; phospholipid synthesis; priority journal; promoter region; regulator gene; rna analysis; saccharomyces cerevisiae; structural gene; yeast; Base Sequence; Carbon; CDP-Diacylglycerol-Inositol 3-Phosphatidyltransferase; DNA, Fungal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; MCM1 Protein; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein Kinases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups); Fungi; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029974122

The two engines exhibited different trends in forming the particulate emissions. For both fuels the particulate emissions were dominated by the carbon for the old engine, and by the SOF for the new engine where the latter was characterized by its low level of emissions. The engine operating conditions also influenced the emissions of the different particulate fractions. Generally, the old engine had higher unburnt lube oil emissions as well as high survival of diesel n-alkanes and PAH in the emissions. However, in the case of kerosene and the new engine when operated both with kerosene and diesel fuel, the pyrosynthesis of these compounds was evident. Sulphates in the particulates, which originated mainly in the fuel, were shown to incorporate low levels of background from the engine deposits and the lubricating oil. DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS are function of many factors; including engine design, fuel properties and engine operating conditions. It is difficult to assign any of the fuel physical or chemical properties as the only factor that could be responsible for the formation of the particulate or gaseous emissions, since they are all inter-correlated. However, it has been shown that the fuel sulphur (1, 2, 3, 4) and the fuel PAH (5, 6, 7) has a direct influence on the emissions through the recurrence of these fuel components in the particulate emissions.

Urbanization is advancing rapidly in the developing world. There are needs for adequate infrastructure, environmental protection, and fiscal reform. Development can result in a reduction in poverty, if properly conducted. By the turn of the century, 8 of the world's 10 megacities will be located in developing countries. There are already the megacities of Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Bombay, Calcutta, and Shanghai. By 2015 there will be 27 megacities, and urban population in developing countries will amount to over 4 billion. By 2020, 50% of total population in developing countries and 80% of total population in Latin America will be urban, of which 25% will live in poverty. Economic progress is at risk if cities cannot develop effective roads and transportation systems, public transportation, communications, sanitation services, and adequate shelters. The City Summit was held in June 1996 in Istanbul. The World Bank announced priorities for funding of urban health initiatives for reducing lead and particulate emissions, for providing sanitation and clean water to slum areas, and for securing sustainable, business-like city finances. The World Bank, the City Summit's Global Plan of Action, and Parliamentarians for Global Action support the reduction of lead emissions from gasoline and air. Cost-effective approaches include refitting public transportation vehicles with cleaner-burning engines or engines relying on natural gas, reducing emissions from industrial and power plants, and shifting domestic fuel sources from coal to natural gas. The World Bank in Slovenia and Beijing is financially supporting this household conversion. Reductions in soot and dust levels reduce public health costs, lost work time due to illness, and mortality. The cost to the poor for basic services is too high.

Research Centre Trombay, Bombay 400 085, India","Cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation depends on photosynthesis for provisions of reductant, ATP and carbon skeletons. Direct photoreduction of nitrogenase does not occur in cyanobacteria and electrons for nitrogen fixation are essentially supplied by the dark reactions both in heterocystous forms (where photosynthate imported from vegetative cells is used for the purpose) as also in the non-heterocystous forms (where photosynthate generated at a different time is used later for the purpose). In light, NADH (from glycolysis/TCA cycle) and recycled H2 (from nitrogenase) contribute electron via the PS I. In dark, NADPH (generated by OPP/TCA cycle) reduces Fd directly through FNR. The NADH-dehydrogenase and FNR are essential elements of a PS I-energised transhydrogenase reaction that acts as a central device to link NADH- and NADPH-dependent catabolism to nitrogenase through cyclic electron flow generating ATP on the way. The NADPH/NADP ratio (through FNR) regulates linear and cyclic electron flow at the reducing side of PS I to provide a ratio of ATP/e- most optimal for nitrogenase. Photosynthesis also generates oxygen that destroys nitrogen fixation in many ways. To combat this, cyanobacteria resort to separating these apparently incompatible processes either in space or in time. Devices used for oxygen protection create additional problems for both heterocystous as well as non-heterocystous forms. Thus, heterocysts live in a state of carbon starvation at the mercy of vegetative cells, while in the non-heterocystous strains there is wasteful degradation/resynthesis of nitrogenase and reductant has to be accumulated well in advance. Thus, problems created by inoperation of photosynthesis (carbon, e-, ATP starvation) are just as severe as those caused by its operation (O2). In both situations nitrogenase proteins produced at great expense have to be protected. Cyanobacterial cells have evolved safeguards for this purpose. Both presence of oxygen as also carbon starvation are responded to by protection of Fe-protein of nitrogenase by its modification. In turn, nitrogen fixation is vital for all cellular activities including synthesis and optimal function of several photosynthetic components. Cyanobacteria indeed represent culmination of biochemical symbiosis of a high order between these two most vital life processes on our planet.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000166042

The ground state of 9Be is obtained accurately with the stochastic variational method, while several particle-unbound states of both 9Be and 9B are investigated with the complex scaling method.

The similarity of the calculated spectra of 9Be and 9B enables one to identify unknown spins and parities of the 9B states.

Additional capacity being brought online to satisfy increasing demand will be almost entirely fossil-based in the next 10-15 years, despite technological advances in renewables and nuclear generation. The U.S. National Energy Strategy of 1991 called for reductions in global warming potential, as measured in billions of tons of CO2 equivalent, of 10% by the year 2010, and 20% by the year 2030. Achievement of such goals will require emphasis on both transportation and energy industries. The U.S. electric power industry has undertaken a voluntary program to return CO2 emissions to 1990 levels. New generation in the U.S. will emphasize high efficiency options, based for the next 10-20 years largely on combined Rankine and Brayton cycles. Such combined cycles, whether fired by coal or gas, result in significantly higher efficiency. However, the complete solution to the control of CO2 emissions in the U.S. will largely depend on improvements in the installed capacity base which will retain the predominant share of electric generation. Reduction of CO2 emissions, as a consequence of burning less fossil fuel per kW generated, is a near-term option for both developed and developing nations. This paper reviews opportunities for efficiency improvement in existing fossil-fuel plants and the likely deployment of new generation options designed to improve plant efficiency and reduce emissions. It is concluded that the most likely future scenario points to CO2 emissions from generating plants being 34% higher than 1990 by the year 2010.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30244490225

Design - Descriptive and immunohistochemical study. Animals - 4 clinically normal male horses. Procedure - The testis (seminiferous tubules, rete tubules), epididymis (initial, middle, and terminal segments), proximal and distal portions of the ductus deferens, ampulla ductus deferentis, seminal vesicle, prostate, and bulbourethral gland were excised from euthanatized horses after administration of an overdose of pentobarbital. The tissue specimens were quickly placed in fixative solution, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded; then thin sections were cut. For immunohistochemical staining, antibodies against purified equine CA-I, CA-II, and CA-III were raised in rabbits. After examination of the specificity of each antiserum, the monospecific antisera against carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes were used to localize the isoenzymes. Results - Specific staining for CA-III was found in the Sertoli and basal cells of the ductus deferens. Most of the testicular and epididymal tissue, as well as ductus deferens, were virtually negative for the enzymes when stained with the antibody to CA-I and CA-II. In the initial segment of the epididymis, a few principal cells had intense cytoplasmic staining with anti-CA-II. In the male accessory glands, CA-I, CA-II, and CA-III were detected in the epithelial cells of the seminal vesicle, prostate, and bulbourethral gland. Conclusions - In the equine male reproductive tract, the bicarbonate in semen originates mainly from accessory reproductive glands. All 3 isoenzymes may have central roles in the regulation of bicarbonate concentration in seminal plasm and, accordingly, regulate seminal plasma pH Distribution of CA-III in Sertoli and basal cells of the ductus deferens suggests other specialized physiologic roles.",,"antibody; carbonate dehydratase; isoenzyme; animal; article; bulbourethral gland; cytology; enzymology; epididymis; histology; horse; immunohistochemistry; male; male genital system; methodology; prostate; rabbit; seminal vesicle; testis; vas deferens; Animals; Antibodies; Bulbourethral Glands; Carbonic Anhydrases; Epididymis; Genitalia, Male; Horses; Immunohistochemistry; Isoenzymes; Male; Prostate; Rabbits; Seminal Vesicles; Testis; Vas Deferens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030120437

Two scenarios, a baseline and one in which North American fossil fuel NOx emissions are reduced 50% are simulated. The largest decreases in O3 are found in the summer months closest to the east coast of North America, presumably because of strong photochemical production and transport from the southwest due to the Bermuda High. Ozone decreases are also predicted for other North Atlantic Ocean sites and occur throughout the year, but tend to be smaller than those off North America. The total tropospheric mass of O3 over a region from (2.2S, 82.5W) to (68.8N, 0) decreases by 1.8 Tg O3 from 41.3 to 39.5 Tg O3 when North American NOx fossil fuel emissions are reduced, or roughly 4.4%. Given recent estimates of the export of North American O3 to the global atmosphere, the 50% fossil fuel NOx reduction corresponds to a 30% reduction in the total mass of tropospheric O3 exported from North America to the North Atlantic Ocean. Nonlinearities may be due to the fact that ozone production potential per unit NOx increases as NOx concentrations decrease.","Fossil fuel; Nitrogen oxides; North Atlantic Ocean; Ozone; Tropospheric chemistry","anthropogenic emissions; nitrogen compounds; ozone; tropospheric model; Atlantic, (North); Air pollution control; Atmospheric chemistry; Computer simulation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical reactions; Three dimensional; Troposphere; Anthropogenic emissions; Fossil fuel emissions; North Atlantic ocean; Photochemical production; Ozone; fossil fuel; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air pollution; atlantic ocean; conference paper; north america; photochemistry; pollution transport; priority journal; seashore; summer; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030131763

We describe the traditional process for making barley bread (orgiathu) in Sardinia, where a special starter called ghimisone was prepared. Today, barley is cultivated only as animal feed, with two uses, grain yield and grazing. Many farmers prefer to grow local populations belonging to landrace locally known as 'S' orgiu sardu'. Local Sardinian populations of barley evolved in diverse environments, being cultivated from sea-level up to 1000 m elevation, on various soil types at different intensities of abiotic stresses, and with climates and environments associated with various agricultural practices, depending both on production strategies and climatic conditions. These barley materials are thought to be valuable genetic and cultural inheritance which must be preserved and used for both productive and research purposes.","barley; biodiversity; germplasm; H. vulgare; landraces",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029768053

When parties disagree about risk, co-operative institutions for environmental protection perform poorly [Keohane et al., 1993]. In the case of Baltic Sea regional efforts to control emissions of organochlorines from the pulp industry, diplomats from the two largest polluting states, Sweden and Finland, disagreed about the level of risk posed by chlorinated toxins. This divergence in risk perception formed a stubborn obstacle in the negotiation. As negative publicity grew about the stalemated talks, Finnish participants became concerned about another type of risk: risk to national economic security. Eventually, Finland redoubled its efforts to obtain an accord, anxious about prospective diminishing market share in the vital pulp and paper sector. Lessons learned from the contentious negotiation of the 1980s have not abetted co-operative efforts in the 1990s: divergent risk perception continues to confound Swedish-Finnish negotiations to reduce pollution emissions from the Nordic chemical pulp industry.",,"emissions control; negotiation process; organochlorines; pollution policy; pulp and paper industry; risk perception; toxic risk; Baltic; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030391663

Other analyses have used power generation data for a specific utility but require hourly generation profiles, which are difficult to obtain. Thus, many of the existing models are either too general to provide valuable information or too complex to be practical for the day-to-day applications engineers face. This paper introduces a simple yet reliable hand calculation method for estimating the combustion-related emissions and source energy use of gas and electric chillers. The user needs to supply only two inputs: annual chiller system energy use and the utility's power generation mix during chiller operation.

Two scenarios of climate change are considered: a 4°C temperature increase combined with 10% precipitation increase and a 4°C temperature increase combined with 10% precipitation decrease. The modelled effect of a 10% precipitation increase on the water partition between runoff and evapotranspiration is a slight dilution of the streamwater chemistry. Correspondingly, the modelled effect of a 10% precipitation decrease is a sharp concentration increase in streamwater chemistry. Weathering rates increase with increased temperature and increased precipitation but are almost unaffected by increased temperature and decreased precipitation. Therefore, changes in streamwater concentrations, linked to the effect of weathering changes, appear only in the scenario with a warmer and wetter climate. The approach has also been used to assess the effects of changing air mass patterns caused by climate change as an increase in alkaline-rich rains associated with Sahelo-Saharan dust may well result. This study indicates that the main chemical changes following climate change will be associated with weathering rate changes rather than with changes in the atmospheric supply of base cations and alkalinity.

Despite high levels of scattered light in the G130H (1140-1606 Å) spectra, the key C IV λ1549 blend was detected in all of the targets. The 105 K emission displays a dramatic decline from the youngest to the oldest stars of the sample, well correlated with rotational velocity; evidence of flaring in the most active of the G dwarfs; a wide spread in intensity among the Pleiades stars; but a small dispersion among the Hyades stars. The Mg II λ2800 emission is strongly enhanced in the younger stars, and the 2000 Å continuum is significantly elevated in the Hyades stars compared with the Sun. The hyperactive stars of the sample show an apparent saturation of their C IV emission at high rotational velocities, analogous to that seen in X-rays. The rotation-activity relations possibly exhibit mild curvature, in addition to the saturation, which nevertheless maps onto a simple power law in fx/fbol versus fciv/fbol. The Sun apparently tracks a similar power law over the course of its magnetic activity cycle. We discuss these results in terms of simple magnetic loop models. We show that the nonlinear power-law variation of fC IV/fbol with rotational velocity (slope ∼ 1.5, contrary to the suspected linear dependence of the magnetic filling factor) very likely arises from a systematic increase in the base pressures of the dominant coronal loops compared with their counterparts on the Sun. The nonlinear X-ray/C IV power law (slope ∼ 1.7) separately indicates a significant increase in the mean apex temperature of the dominant coronal loops. We argue that the distribution of loop structures might change character from inactive stars like the Sun (dominated by X-ray-bright points and Active Region loops) to the hyperactive cluster stars (dominated by interregion large-scale structures or postflare loops). © 1996 The American Astronomical Society.

A GIS-based modeling approach can provide emissions estimates for both on-network and off-network vehicle activities on a modal basis (as a function of various vehicle operating modes that significantly affect vehicle emission rates). An entire metropolitan region can be modeled on a zone, link, and point basis. Vehicle subfleet composition can be tracked or estimated and combined with estimates of vehicle activity and characteristic operating modes to provide emissions estimates in a spatial and temporal context. Emissions from various modal activities are aggregated into grid cells to be used as input to an airshed model. Identifying spatial and temporal distributions of these activities adds to a greater understanding of emissions impacts. A research prototype of this modeling concept was produced to illustrate its capabilities and identify difficulties that must be addressed in the development of a fully functional model. The GIS-based displays and hard-copy maps that present the spatial variability of emissions levels help improve the communication of research findings to decision makers and the public.

This latter absorption is diminished by CO2 adsorption, which produces surface carbonate. UV reflectance and IR results with CO are correlated to show that CO adsorption on the outgassed oxide occurs with rapid formation of carbonite CO22- ions, accompanied at room temperature by a slow reaction forming reduced oligomeric (CO)n2- anions and carbonate CO32-. The reaction stages have been resolved by extending the UV and IR measurements to low temperatures. CO22-, identified by UV absorption at 340 nm and IR bands at 1390 and 987 cm-1, is the only process occurring at 90 K. As the temperature is increased, the ketenic dimer anion C2O32- is formed, characterized by a UV band at 300 nm and IR bands at 2075 and 1367 cm-1. The onward disproportionation producing reduced oligomers and carbonates gives a complex IR spectrum in the 1700-1000 cm-1 range. The bands due to the oligomers are readily discriminated by their sensitivity to oxygen. The discussion illustrates that UV and IR spectroscopy afford a powerful combination in defining and understanding the stages involved in the adsorption and reaction of CO on lanthanum oxide. The nature and extent of the reactivity towards CO shows that the basicity of La2O3 is not as great as that of the alkaline-earth-metal oxides.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845482969

Comparison of rotating rod source and uniform cylinder data suggests that the position of the source used to correct for sensitivity should be similar to that of the emission data. A plane source method has been devised that uses a moving line source that traverses the transaxial fleld-of-view, emulating a plane source, but without the problems associated with using a conventional plane source in 3-D (uniformity, scatter, cost, etc.). This device has been used to record high count density acquisitions for direct normalization of emission data and also to examine geometric effects with increasing azimuthal (<f>) and polar (6) angles in the 3-D data set. The data have confirmed observations of two distinct geometric patterns seen previously in two-dimensional PET: an overall transaxial sensitivity profile that decreases toward the center of the projection and a crystal interference profile that changes with position in the block. Correction for the first geometric component removes a lowsensitivity hole in 3-D PET reconstructions, and correction for the second component removes ring artifacts. The direct normalization approach produces an artifact along the central axis of the scanner. A quantitative index of nonuniformity for 1-pixel-thick annular regions of interest showed a reduction from 60% nonuniformity with no corrections to less than 15% when the plane source data were used to directly normalize the emission data. The moving line source provides high quality data and may be an appropriate normalization device for 3-D PET. © 1996 IEEE.",,"Image reconstruction; Particle detectors; Radiation effects; Three dimensional; Geometric correction; Normalization; Positron emission tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030354161

The topside injection facilities, the well and reservoir aspects are discussed as well as the considerations made during establishing the design basis and the solutions chosen. The CO2 injection issues in this project differs from industry practice in that the CO, is wet and contaminated with methane, and further, because of the shallow depth, the total pressure resistance in the system is not sufficient for the CO, to naturally stay in the dense phase region. To allow for safe and cost effective handling of the COj, it was necessary to develop an injection system that gave a constant back pressure from the well corresponding to the output pressure from the compressor, and being independent of the injection rate. This is accomplished by selecting a high injectivity sand formation, completing the well with a large bore, and regulating the dense phase CO2 temperature and thus the density of the fluid in order to account for the variations in back pressure from the well. © 1996 Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Aquifers; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Offshore oil well production; Safe handling; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Industrial waste disposal; Offshore oil fields; Cost effective; Industry practices; Injection rates; Injection systems; Offshore locations; Sand formations; Shallow depths; Total pressure; Carbon dioxide; Offshore oil wells; Carbon dioxide injection; Shallow underground aquifers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029770169

Fluorescence studies of the erbium 4S3/2 → 4I13/2 transition, a characteristic emission for a reduced phonon energy host, were conducted for both sol-gel-derived films and conventionally prepared glass rods. The peak intensity observed from the sol-gel films was blue-shifted by 16 nm with a FWHM value approximately half that measured for the melt-quenched rods. Excitation studies indicate that, unlike conventionally prepared glasses, sol-gel materials suffer from nonradiative relaxation of the 453/2 excited state to the 4I9/2 level, where subsequent radiative emission to the 4I15/2 ground state occurs. The proposed source of the quenching mechanism are remnant species inherent to the sol-gel process.

The periodic inventory for Davidson county is being developed by the Davidson county local program. The base year for the first periodic inventory is 1993. Subsequent base year shall be every third year, e.g., 1996, 1999 etc. until the area is redesignated to attainment. These periodic inventories are based on actual emissions and address both VOC and NOx emission sources. The primary purpose of developing the periodic inventories is to assess emission reduction over time. This division is also engaged in developing the modeling inventory for the base year of 1993 for East Tennessee Area including 40 counties. The modeling inventories for both Knox and Hamilton Counties will be developed by the Knox and Hamilton County local programs. The primary purpose of this modeling inventory is to quantify the impact of VOC and NOx sources on ecosystems in the Smoky Mountains. This paper discusses about the different steps in collecting stationary point source emissions related data and conducting quality assurance/control procedures on those data. This paper describes the procedure of computerizing the collected stationary point source data. The emission inventories involve a large amount of data either to be provided by the stationary sources or to be obtained from the permit application files. This paper discusses about the, procedures to simplify this task and develop an accurate emission inventory.

(DHR) and New York State Electric and Gas Corporation (NYSEG) have investigated and applied advanced optimization technologies to on-line performance improvement and emissions reduction problems in fossil fuel power plants. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques have been investigated and incorporated into on-line applications. Two of these techniques, expert systems and quantitative optimization using neural network process models, have proven particularly useful. These techniques are synergistic, and when combined provide a powerful tool that can offer power plants significant performance improvements. Quantitative optimization using neural network models provides an effective, low cost method to identify control system setpoints under a variety of operating conditions for optimal performance with minimal emissions. Expert systems can help operators interpret the results of the quantitative optimization and also identify problem areas which may be compromising plant performance. This paper presents the optimization techniques applied in DHR's and NYSEG's Total Optimization Process AdviZor (TOPAZTM) on-line process optimization system. Quantitative results from several performance improvement and emissions reduction projects for fossil-fired power plants currently underway at DHR and NYSEG are also presented.",,"Control systems; Expert systems; Fossil fuel power plants; Neural networks; Operations research; Optimization; On line applications; Total optimization advizor; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030314232

We extend the existing literature by expanding the scope of the analysis to different regions of Australia thus providing a comprehensive national picture of end-use gas consumption and facilitating interregional comparisons. Our results show that there are significant interregional differences in the gas consumption for different end uses.

These emission models are based on the assumption that vehicle running exhaust emissions can be represented as integrated values for a specific driving cycle, and then later adjusted by speed correction factors. What is needed in addition to these ""regional-type"" mobile source models is an emissions model that considers at a more fundamental level the modal operation of a vehicle (i.e., emissions that directly relate to vehicle operating modes such as idle, steady-state cruise, various levels of acceleration/deceleration, and so forth). A new modal-emissions modeling approach that is deterministic and based on analytical functions that describe the physical phenomena associated with vehicle operation and emissions productions is presented. This model relies on highly time-resolved emissions and vehicle operation data that must be collected from a wide range of vehicles of varying emission control technologies.

This study attempted to characterize goods movement in the region, perform a corridor emissions analysis, and make recommendations in terms of capacity and improvements, as well as economic feasibility of using rail in conjunction with trucks for goods movement. The emissions analysis of goods movement along the I-40 corridor is examined, specifically emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and paeticulate matter associated with both truck and rail traffic. Heavyduty diesel truck emissions are estimated using truck activity data recorded along the corridor. A unique methodology is used to calculate these truck emissions, incorporating road grade factors and determining engine load on a link-by-link basis. These emissions are then compared with the emissions associated with freight trains that travel along this I-40 corridor. On the basis of current (1994) truck and rail volumes, it was found that goods moved by rail produces lower emissions, except for NOx, which is slightly higher for rail. The factor decrease of other pollutants ranges from 2.49 to 8.50, which is consistent with other recent studies. Given the amount of pollutants produced by trucks, shifting some of the freight from trucks to rail with a greater emphasis on intermodal business should reduce the total freight emissions along the I-40 corridor.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Data recording; Exhaust gases; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Railroad transportation; Truck transportation; Corridor emission analysis; Economic feasibility; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030181923

To estimate the air quality impact, emissions of CO, HC, NOx, and PM associated with an automobile-only-based commute and a Metrolink-based commute from Riverside to Los Angeles are compared. Analysis of the Metrolink-based commuting scenario includes the emissions from the home-to-station automobile trip and the Metrolink diesel locomotive emissions. Essential data for the automobile emissions modeling process were obtained through a survey of Metrolink passengers and through remote emissions sensing of Metrolink passenger vehicles. Train emissions were estimated using emission rate data provided by recent diesel locomotive studies. Results indicated that at current ridership levels there is a reduction in total amount of all four pollutants combined through Metrolink commuting. On a pollutant-by-pollutant basis, it was estimated that the Metrolink commuting scenario reduces the emissions of CO and HC relative to the automobile-only commuting scenario; however, it increases the emissions of NOx and PM.

Due to the diversity of particle sources and sinks, and complexity of physical and chemical transformation processes, source-receptor relationships and the impact of such emissions control measures can best be described using aerosol models. Inorganic aerosols typically dominate light extinction and hence it is particularly important to obtain information regarding the formation and transport of secondary inorganic aerosols and to understand the limiting factors of aerosol formation in order to devise and implement successful regulatory professes designed to improve visibility. A lagrangian trajectory model is used to assess the limits on inorganic aerosol formation in a region which has previously been identified as episodically experiencing elevated concentrations of inorganic fine aerosols and reduced visibility. The model used is the Atmospheric Chemistry and Deposition model (ACDEP), which is based on the Carbon-Bond Mechanism IV and includes extended ammonia/ammonium chemistry. The region selected for this analysis is located in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern British Columbia. Modeled aerosol concentrations show reasonable accord with observations.

Two samples are considered, one selected from IRAS detections and on average at low redshift (16 objects), and the other selected by radio and optical properties and covering a range of redshifts up to z=2.6 (23 objects). We find the radio spectral shapes in both samples to be quite heterogeneous, and categorize the spectra into four general classes similar to those defined by Kuhr et al. [A&AS, 45, 367 (1981)] for radio loud objects: straight, concave, convex, and complex. The relative frequencies of these classifications in our radio quiet samples are similar to those seen in radio loud quasars and radio galaxies. Based on this and other considerations we conclude that radio quiet and radio loud quasars have similar spectral shapes. About 40% of the RQQs studied here appear to have flat or inverted spectral components. Evidence is found for variability in seven sources, based on comparison with a single previous observation from the literature. At least five of these variable sources show flat or inverted radio spectra, and none have straight, steep spectra. We have detected one of our sources with VLBI, and essentially all the flux resides in a compact, subparsec core. This source has an inverted spectrum and is variable, strongly indicating partially opaque synchrotron emission. Thus the cores of many radio quiet quasars appear to be scaled-down versions of those found in radio loud objects. However, we cannot rule out free-free emission for the flat spectrum component in all cases. Radio quiet quasar spectra probably include contributions from three components, in varying degrees: optically thin synchrotron from star-forming regions in the disk of the host galaxy and in a circumnuclear starburst; oplically thin synchrotron from an extended (perhaps jet-like) component powered by the active nucleus; and partially opaque synchrotron from a compact, VLBI-scale core. All three of these components may play a role in the radio spectra of low-redshift quasars, but only the latter two are significant contributors in luminous, high-redshift objects. © 7996 American Astronomical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010958468

The photosynthetic temperature optimum of recently expanded leaves in the sun canopy was linearly related to the average temperature of the preceding week during the 9-month measurement period. The optimum temperature for net photosynthesis of E. globulus increased from 17 to 23°C as the mean daily temperature increased from 7 to 16°C. Similarly, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis of E. nitens increased from 14 to 20°C as the mean daily temperature increased from 7 to 19°C. The temperature for maximum photosynthetic response of E. globulus and E. nitens was similar at each measurement time, but the photosynthetic performance of E. nitens was less sensitive to temperatures above and below this optimum than that of E. globulus. In December, the apical shoots of branches of E. globulus had a net photosynthetic temperature optimum of between 10 and 15°C. The corresponding values for expanding leaves, fully expanded leaves from the current year's growth, and fully expanded leaves from the previous year's growth were 15, 20 and 20-25°C, respectively. In a second experiment, E. globulus clones taken from four mother plants originating from climatically dissimilar locations within Tasmania were acclimated at day/night temperatures of 10/15, 18/23 and 25/30°C in temperature-controlled greenhouses. Another set of clones was acclimated in a shade-house where temperatures ranged between 10 and 25°C and with a mean daily temperature of approximately 15°C. Plants grown at 25/30°C had significantly lower net photosynthetic rates when measured at 10 and 20°C than plants grown at lower temperatures. Plants grown at 10/15°C had significantly lower net photosynthetic rates when measured at 30°C than plants grown at higher temperatures. Plants grown at the ambient conditions prevailing in midautumn in Hobart had significantly higher net photosynthetic rates at 20°C than plants raised in the greenhouses and were equal best performers at 10 and 30°C. A comparison of the light response curves of the plants showed that the maximum rate of net photosynthesis was affected by the growth temperature, whereas the apparent quantum efficiency remained unchanged. There were no significant differences in the photosynthetic temperature responses of the four genotypes derived from climatically dissimilar locations within Tasmania. A comparison of temperature response models for E. globulus indicated that incomplete acclimation (defined by a slope value of less than 1 for the linear relationship between the temperature optimum for photosynthesis and the growth temperature) generally resulted in a greater daily carbon uptake than complete acclimation (slope value of 1).","Apparent quantum efficiency; Genotype; Response model; Temperature acclimation","Eucalyptus globulus; Eucalyptus nitens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003091238

The second sulfur protocol recently signed in Oslo (June 1994) is based on a 'critical loads' approach(1) to emission reduction. In this approach sulfur dioxide reductions are calculated according to the need to reduce acid deposition at sensitive acidified sites to below a threshold, or critical load, where ecological 'damage' should not occur (1,2). Using our large dataset of inferred acidification profiles from dated lake sediment cores throughout the UK (3- 5), we have developed an empirical model based on a dose-response function that can be used to set critical load values for a site from a knowledge of the ratio of Ca++ of the water (sensitivity) to modelled S deposition (loading) at the site. This diatom model is most suited to setting the baseline critical load for a site as, in theory, it identifies the first point of biological change in the acidification of an aquatic ecosystem and, unlike the steady-state water chemistry model, it is not dependent on the fixing of a threshold ANC value for a waterbody. We compare the use of both models in the generation of critical-load maps for the UK.",,"Bacillariophyta; acidification; critical load; emission reduction; palaeolimnological model; sulphur dioxide; surface water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659987

The relevant work that has been performed so far at ISL was based on a conventional source of ignition, i.e., a blasting cap having the initiation energy equivalent of Ig of tetryl. It was thus possible to plot the outer envelope of the detonable region of CH4/O2/Dil mixtures, the diluent being either N2, Ar or CO2. Although this type of ignition provides a reliable way to obtain the direct onset of detonation for many detonable mixtures, it happens to be inappropriate when the mixtures are excessively diluted or when the equivalence ratio is far from stoichiometry. Furthermore, detonation that could not be initiated by this method in some fuel-rich mixtures, actually did occur for “unstarts” in ram accelerator experiments. Both ram accelerator facilities at the University of Washington and at ISL were used to investigate the detonability of so-called insensitive mixtures by means of different types of initiation conditions. Experiments carried out at ISL using the 90mm caliber Ramac were performed using a supersonic piston entering an intermediate section filled with a dense inert gas and situated prior to the test section. This intermediate inert section allowed the formation of a normal shock front which characteristics at the entrance of the test mixture can be easily adjusted in terms of shock velocity and shock peak pressure. 2CH4+2O2+3N2 mixtures at an initial pressure of 2.5MPa have been detonated this way. Experiments carried out at the University of Washington are based on the 38mm cal. Ramac with the 16m long test section. Two sets of experiments were first performed using a piston entering the test section in the velocity range of 1100 - 1800 m/s. A stoechiometric mixture of CH4/air was the first to be experimented with, since it has been previously shown that a detonation cannot propagate in a self sustained way in this type of mixture, at least in a narrow tube. After a series of direct impact shots which detonated the test mixture at initial pressures in the range of 0.7 to 3.5 MPa, an intermediate section of the test section was filled with CH4/O2, in order to check whether the piston was driving the detonation. The CH4/O2 detonation wave turned out to be a successful ignitor as well. Under certain conditions it would stop the piston within a few meters, thus removing its influence from the propagation of the shock induced combustion wave. Moreover, a third step was undertaken, using an initiator stage of stoechiometric CH4/O2 ignited by a conventional ignitor. This 150 J ignition device turned out to yield a stable detonation through a DDT process in the initiator mixture, which, in turn, impacted the test mixture. In all three initiation scenarios, detonation was successfully initiated in CH4/Air. The details of all the experiments and their results are described in this paper. The detonation characteristics data that were obtained are readily applied to the ram accelerator performance calculations and equation of state validation. © 1996, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Explosives; Mixtures; Pistons; Propulsion; Shock waves; Detonation waves; Equation of state; Equivalence ratios; Initiation energy; Performance calculation; Shock induced combustion; Shock velocities; University of Washington; Detonation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961876820

To investigate potentially different carbon uptake strategies within the same plant, plasma membrane H+-ATPase distribution and polar current patterns were investigated in Elodea leaves and stems. Specific activity of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in leaf microsomal fractions was tenfold higher than in stem derived microsomes. Probing western blots with a monoclonal antibody specific for plasma membrane H+-ATPase, yielded strongly visible double bands at 100 kDa in leaf microsome preparations, whereas little antigen was detected in analogous stem microsome preparations. Using the same plasma membrane H+-ATPase specific antibody on tissue sections, the enzyme was found almost exclusively localized at the border of cells at the lower leaf surface. A positive ion current leaving the lower leaf surface was measured, using a vibrating probe device. Part of this current entered the upper leaf surface and part of it the internodes of the stem. The experimental results support the view, that Elodea leaves have different means of inorganic carbon uptake than stem internodes.","Carbon uptake; Elodea canadensis; immunolocalization; plasma membrane H+- ATPase; polar currents","Elodea canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029863267

Increasing N2O emissions seem to occur at electron donor-to-acceptor ratios (C(H2O) or BOD5-to-nitrate ratios) below 50 in the cropping systems and below 1200-1400 in the waste water treatment plant. The trapped N2O in the soil body down to a depth of 90 cm demonstrates that agricultural production systems seem to contain a considerable pool of N2O which may be reduced to N2 on its way to the atmosphere, which may be transported to other environments or which may be released at sometime in the future.","Activated sludge; Available carbon-to- nitrate ratio; Carbon availability; Cropping systems; Denitrification; N2O release; Nitrification; Waste water treatment","carbon; cropping system; denitrification; nitrate; nitrification; nitrous oxide; waste water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047680977

The warm winters between 1988-1992 were particularly marked in the Alps, where lack of snow had severe consequences for the tourist-based economies of mountain communities. The investigations presented here focus primarily on minimum temperature records for up to 88 climatological observing sites distributed over Switzerland. Analyses of the departures of temperature minima from the 15-year means in warm and cold winters has shown that there is a very significant altitudinal dependency of the anomalies except at low elevations which are subject to fog or stratus conditions; the stratus tends to decouple the underlying stations from processes occurring at higher altitudes. It is also shown that there is a switch in the gradient of the temperature anomaly with height from cold to warm winters. For warm winters, the higher the elevation, the stronger the positive anomaly; the reverse is true for cold winters. The statistics for the 88 observational stations provide a measure of the damping of the climate signal as an inverse function of height. The altitudinal dependency of temperature departures from the mean are the most important feature, followed by latitudinal effects (north and south of the Alps); continentality is not seen to be a major factor in determining the geographical distribution of temperature anomalies at this scale. The present investigation also emphasizes the fact that high elevation records can more readily identify significant interannual climatic fluctuations than at lower-elevation sites. This is also likely to be the case for longer-term climate change, where possibe greenhouse-gas warming would presumably be detected with more clarity at higher elevations. This type of study can help orientate future high-resolution climate model studies of climate change and in particular the assessment of model capability in reproducing a range of possible temperature anomalies and their altitudinal dependency.",,"altitude; atmospheric temperature; latitude; temperature minima; winter; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030430396

This traffic, combined with the local commuter and commercial traffic, is causing congestion on almost every major roadway. The States of Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin have formed a consortium to address the problems within the Corridor. It is their intent to enhance transportation efficiency, improve safety and reduce emissions in the Corridor by means of a cooperative effort. BRW is leading this effort, working closely with the Consortium members to conduct the Corridor Program Plan (CPP). The CPP establishes a framework whereby the Corridor can take advantage of ITS technologies and establish an open architecture, enabling the Corridor to serve as a testbed for future ITS developments. The complexity of the travel types, facilities and modes of the region are matched only by the area=s jurisdictional and political complexities.

North of STC, communities are dominated by mixo/heterotrophic organisms while south of the STC, physiological or biomass parameters are diagnostic of autotrophic phytoplankton. Only phytoplankton δ13C values, in the southern part, showed a strong correlation with [CO2(aq)] in surface waters which permitted a relationship between these parameters. Using this empirical relationship, we derive, from sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) δ13C, a reconstruction of the paleo-pCO2 in surface water of the Southern Indian Ocean for the last 50 kyr. During the glacial and deglacial periods, the obtained paleo-pCO, were higher than those recorded in the Vostok ice core, suggesting that the Southern Ocean was a potential source of CO2 for the atmosphere. These results are consistent with those of SOC content and indicate that tile biological pump was off during glacial times and unable to lower atmospheric [CO(2(aq))]. Moreover, these dais confirm that stratification of the surface water in summer caused a reduction of gas exchange with the atmosphere during that period.","autotrophic phytoplankton; carbon isotopic composition of phytoplankton; hetero/mixotrophy; partial pressure (paleo) of carbon dioxide; Southern Ocean sediments","Carbon dioxide; Chlorophyll; Composition; Enzymes; Isotopes; Particles (particulate matter); Plants (botany); Seawater; Sediments; Biological pump; Carboxylate; Gas exchange; Heterotrophy; Mixotrophy; Organic carbon isotopic composition; Phytoplankton; Sedimentary organic carbon; Southern Indian ocean; Suspended particulate organic carbon; Carbon; carbon dioxide; isotopic composition; organic carbon; palaeoceanography; pCO2 reconstructions; phytoplankton; seawater; subtropical convergence; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean, (South)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030113982

The effects of the iron chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and desferrioxamine (DEF) were assessed. Both cell lines were treated with various concentrations of 5-ALA in the presence or absence of the iron chelators for 4 h in serum-free medium. The accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) reached a maximum level at 1 mM 5-ALA in WiDr cells [280 ng PpIX (mg protein x 4 h-1] and at 0.1 mM 5-ALA in V79 cells [55 ng PpIX (mg protein x 4 h)-1]. PpIX was the only fluorescing porphyrin in these cells after 5-ALA treatment alone or in combination with the chelators. The iron chelators did not influence the intracellular localisation pattern of PpIX in 5-ALA-treated cells. While both chelators enhanced the accumulation of PpIX in 5-ALA-treated cells, DEF was found to be superior at equal concentrations. A linear relationship between the applied concentration of DEF and the DEF-induced increase in PpIX accumulation was observed in double-reciprocal plots. The intercepts of the regression lines with the ordinate indicate that the ferrochelatase is saturated with PpIX when the 5-ALA concentration exceeds 0.3 mM and 0.05 mM in WiDr and V79 cells respectively. The DEF-induced enhancement of PpIX accumulation in 5-ALA-treated cells was cell line and 5-ALA concentration dependent. NI a 5-ALA concentration inducing a maximum level of PpIX accumulation, inhibition of ferrochelatase activity enhanced the PpIX accumulation 3- and 1.4-fold in V79 and WiDr cells respectively. The relative gain in PpIX accumulation increased with decreasing concentration of 5-ALA. In cells treated with the lowest concentrations of 5-ALA used in this study, DEF enhanced PpIX accumulation 44- and 3.5-fold in V79 and WiDr cells respectively. The iron chelator-induced increase in cellular PpIX accumulation was followed by a similar increase in sensitivity to photoinactivation.

Globally 50-70% (85 Tg, 1 Tg = 1012 g) of the nitrogen supplied in fertilizer (80 Tg N/a) and leguminous crops (40-80 Tg N/a) are used to feed cattle. The aim of the present study was to derive some estimates of global N2O production from animal manure. As the parameter giving the most stable numerical basis for regional and global extrapolation we adopted the molar emission ratios of N2O to NH3. These ratios were measured in cattle, pig and chicken housings with different manure handling systems, in dung-heaps and in liquid manure storage tanks. Individual molar emission ratios from outside manure piles varied over two orders of magnitude, strongly dependent on the treatment of the manure. A median emission ratio of 1.6 x 10-2 (n = 65) was obtained in cow-sheds with slatted floors and liquid manure stored underneath and a median ratio of 24 x 10-2 (n = 31) was measured in a beef cattle housing with a solid manure handling system. We next extrapolated to global NH3 emissions from those estimated for Europe, using N uptake by the animals as a scaling factor. Multiplication with observed N2O to NH3 ratios next provided some estimates of regional and global N2O emissions. To account for the great variability of the emission ratios of N2O/NH3, we developed upper and lower case emission scenarios, based on lower and upper quartiles of measured emission ratios. The global emission from cattle and swine manure is in the range of 0.2-2.5 Tg N-N2O/a, representing 44 ± 39% of the annual atmospheric accumulation rate. This N2O emission arises from about 40 Tg N/a of cattle and pig manure stored in or at animal housings. We did not account for N2O emissions from another 50 Tg N/a excreted by grazing cattle, goats and sheep, and application of the manure to agricultural fields. Our study makes it clear that major anthropogenic N2O emissions may well arise from animal manure. The large uncertainty of emission ratios, which we encountered, show that much more intense research efforts are necessary to determine the factors that influence N2O emissions from domestic animal manure both in order to derive a more reliable global estimate of N2O release and to propose alternative waste treatment methods causing smaller N2O releases. In our studies we found large enhancements in N2O releases when straw was added to the manure, which is a rather common practice. In view of the ongoing discussion in Europe to re-install the traditional solid manure system (bed down cattle) for environmental and animal welfare reasons, it is noteworthy that our measurements indicate highest N2O release from this particulary system. In a similar manner, but based on a smaller data set, we also estimated the release of CH4 from cattle and swine manure and from liquid manure only to be about 9 Tg/year in good agreement with the estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency (1994) of 8.6 ± 2.6 Tg/year. A total annual methane release as high as 34 Tg/a was derived for solid and liquid cattle and pig manure from animals in housings.","Agricultural nitrogen budget; Animal manure; Methane release; Nitrous oxide release","methane; nitrous oxide; agriculture; air pollution; article; atmosphere; building; cattle; chicken; domestic animal; Europe; manure; solid waste management; swine; Animalia; Bos taurus; Capra hircus; Gallus gallus; Ovis aries; Sus scrofa; emission; manure; methane; nitrogen budget; nitrous oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660972

An extended set of chemical compounds are included in the model, of which 25 are transported. Diurnal variations are calculated, including the diurnal cycle of photodissociation rates. The Asian region has been selected for this perturbation study since emissions are rapidly increasing in this region, and because there is a large potential for future increases. A 15-month reference run and 2 perturbation studies, both starting in May and running for 4 months are performed, one with increases in NOx emission of a factor of 2 and one with a factor 4. Increases in the anthropogenic emissions of hydrocarbons and CO are also included. Results for the last month (August) are then compared with the results from the reference run for the same month. In the 3-D model calculations, the adopted perturbations lead to significant increases in surface ozone in the Asian region. It is interesting to notice that enhanced short term ozone values during episodes are becoming more pronounced in the cases with high emissions. Significant ozone increases are also obtained in the upper troposphere due to efficient convective transport. The impact is noticible over a larger region in the free troposphere than in the surface layer due to longer chemical lifetime of ozone, and an efficient transport. A doubling of NOx emission, gives significant ozone increases up to 30% in the upper troposphere. Calculations of the regionally positive radiative forcing from the increases in tropospheric ozone show values of about 0.5 W/m2, which is 30-50% of the estimated negative radiative forcing due to the direct effect of sulphate aerosols in the region.",,"anthropogenic emission; chemical transport modelling; global model; ozone level; ozone precursor; photodissociation rate; pollutant increase; study; tropospheric ozone; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029757529

Although the environmental focus at first was on sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) because of their relationship to acid precipitation, the CCTDP may also lead to reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and in solid waste produced, relative to conventional technologies. Environmental benefits that maybe realized from clean coal technologies (CCTs) will depend upon the degree of acceptance in the marketplace achieved by each of the individual technologies. In general, technologies that replace a major portion of an existing facility (repowering technologies) show the most promise for achieving reductions in all four categories (SO2, NOX, CO2, and solid waste). Technologies that modify existing facilities by adding environmental control equipment or changing feedstocks (retrofit technologies), used singly or in combination, appear capable of achieving substantial reductions in SO2 and NOX, but in general have little effect on CO2, and only a few of these technologies appear capable of reducing solid waste. However, even if decreases in solid waste volume are not always achieved, much of the solid waste from CCTs would be dry and therefore easier to dispose of than scrubber sludge from conventional technologies. © 1996 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Air pollution; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Waste treatment; Clean coal technology; Solid wastes; Coal; carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; acid rain; article; coal mining; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; health program; priority journal; solid waste management; technology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030175578

In Germany the cement works are governed by the NOx limits set by TA Luft (German Clean Air Standards), which have been updated progressively during the past years. This specifies NOx emissions of 0.50 g/m3 for new plants and 0.80 g/m3 for existing plants. For the majority of plants these limits can only be met if appropriate abatement measures are taken. Primary measures for NOx abatement deal mainly with smoothing the kiln operation and the use of low primary air burners for the rotary kilns. These measures have already been successfully implemented in many cement works, and have led to significant reductions in the average NOx emissions from rotary kiln plants. Another possible abatement procedure is staged combustion for the precalciner system. Investigations on existing plants and the experience acquired during a demonstration project promoted by the Federal Environmental Office, Berlin, have shown that NO from the main firing system is decomposed and NOx emissions can be effectively reduced. However, the level of reduction rate is limited, and this applies in particular to the reduction of NOx peak values. The SNCR (selective noncatalytic reduction) process was tested on two rotary kiln plants in long-term tests as part of the demonstration project. The original level in these plants was 1.2 to 1.5 g/m3 NOx. By using SNCR technology it is possible to meet the limit of 0.80 g/m3 even under the evaluation conditions specified in Section 2.1.5 of TA Luft. It will be possible to utilize the experience gained from the demonstration project also in other cement kilns. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides, which is widely used in large power stations, is not straightforward to use in cement works and has not yet been tested on an industrial scale.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004426435

EOM was extracted by dichlormethane (DCM) and crude extract was fractionated into five fractions to obtain a gross partition of different chemical classes. Fractions were incubated with calf thymus DNA (dose 100 μg/ml incubate) under oxidative and reductive conditions using two metabolic activation system: 1) an oxidative rat liver S9 system (S9) and 2) a reductive xanthine oxidase catalyzed system (XO). The different DNA adduct patterns and levels were determined using S9 and XO-mediated metabolism followed by postlabeling with both nuclease PI and butanol extraction enrichment procedures for all fractions examined. The moderately polar fraction (DCM) contained over 50% of the total DNA adduct forming activity both without and with S9 activation. The highly polar fraction (methanol) contained about 60 % of the DNA adduct forming activity under reductive conditions.

The ocean is represented by a 2-D model with prescribed overturning pattern in which the overturning velocities can be adjusted freely. We discuss what influence the use of ice-age conditions (i.e. enhanced land-ice cover, reduced CO2-concentration and reduced oceanic over-turning rate) has on the differences between ice-age and present-day climate. When compared to LGM sea-surface temperatures derived from proxy data, the model is able to simulate fairly well the important features of the meridional distribution of these temperature differences. Applying reduced ocean overturning rates during the LGM significantly decreases poleward heat transport in the oceans, thereby allowing for additional cooling of the polar regions and less cooling of the equatorial region. As a result, the agreement with CLIMAP proxy temperature differences increases, especially in the equatorial region. This mechanism can explain the slight differences in the CLIMAP proxy equatorial surface temperatures between the LGM and the present-day climate.",,"climate; Last Glacial Maximum; Last Glacial maximum; ocean overturning; ocean overturnng; overturn; palaeoclimate; sea surface temperature; SST",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030405833

However, with the exception of abundance, consistent relations between other variables and species geographic extent have not been forthcoming. One reason may be that studies often encompass the entire geographic ranges of only a fraction of the species on the taxon under consideration, setting biologically artificial boundaries to the area of study, and only revealing part of the pattern in question. Here, we examine patterns in the geographic range sizes of birds in the New World. By testing for patterns in the entire avifauna of the geographically isolated region (95% of species are endemic), we avoid many of the problems of previous studies. Most New World bird species have small geographic ranges, although the frequency distribution of logarithmically transformed ranges is left- skewed. The geographic range size-body size relation is approximately triangular. Small-bodied species may have either large or small ranges, whereas large-bodied species have only large ranges. Species threatened with extinction more often fall nearer to (or below) the lower edge defined by the majority of species in this triangular than do non-threatened species, suggesting that this represents the minimum area needed to sustain viable populations of species of different sizes. The maximum range size attained by species is relatively constant across body-sizes, but falls short of the maximum possible given the land area of the New World, and so cannot be limited by this constraint. What does limit maximum range size is thus unclear. There is a latitudinal gradient in the size of species geographic ranges. Species which have the latitudinal mid-point of their geographic ranges at high latitudes either side of the equator tend to have large range sizes, whereas those with mid-points at lower latitudes tend to have small range sizes (as expected from Rapoport's rule). However, this pattern is not symmetrical about the equator, but rather, at about 17° N. It appears to be a consequence of the biogeography of the New World, and implies that mechanisms suggested to explain Rapoport's rule based on climatic variability are incorrect. Migrant birds have larger geographic ranges, on average, than do residents.

Whole air canister samples were collected aboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft and analyzed for a wide range of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and halocarbons. Fast response in situ quantification of CH4, CO, and CO2 were also performed on the DC-8. Sampling took place over Brazilian agricultural areas and southern African savanna where there was active biomass burning. The vertical distribution of the measured gases revealed that the concentrations of most hydrocarbons, methyl halides, CH4, CO, and CO2, were enhanced in the boundary layer of these regions principally as a result of biomass fires. Brazilian and African biomass burning emission ratios were calculated for CH3Br, CH3Cl, CH3I, and NMHCs relative to CO and CO2. Although both fire regions were dominated by efficient (flaming) combustion (CO/CO2 ratios &lt;0.1), the Brazilian samples exhibited the lower (more flaming) CO/CO2 ratio of 0.037 compared with the African savanna value of 0.062. This difference in combustion efficiency was reflected in lower ratios versus CO2 for all correlated gases. However, the gases more closely associated with smoldering combustion (e.g., C3H8 and CH3Cl) exhibited significantly higher ratios relative to CO for the Brazilian fires, while the African samples exhibited higher values versus CO for compounds associated more closely with flaming combustion (e.g., C2H2). This variation in the trace gas ratios versus CO is most likely caused by different fuel characteristics. On the basis of the emission ratios obtained, the total biomass burning emission rates for savannas and worldwide were calculated for the hydrocarbons and methyl halides. From these it was estimated that roughly 25% and 20% of global CH3Cl and CH3Br emissions, respectively, derive from biomass burning but that the contribution of biomass burning to total CH3I emissions was not significant.",,"anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic factors; atmospheric gases; atmospheric transport model; biomass burning; hydrocarbon; methyl halides; methylhalide; reduced carbon gases; TRACE A; vertical profile; vertical profiles; Atlantic, (Tropical South)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030434750

In order to assess the effectiveness of emission control programs, it is essential that deposition monitoring networks continue to fulfill their principal goals of detecting and quantifying temporal changes in deposition, and of describing changes in spatial deposition patterns. A set of statistical techniques has been developed and applied to assess the capabilities of the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) in southeastern Canada according to two performance criteria: (1) the ability of CAPMoN to detect and quantify projected regional trends in precipitation sulfate in a timely fashion, and (2) the ability of CAPMoN to delineate both present and projected future spatial patterns of wet sulfate deposition. In the area of southern Canada now receiving in excess of 20 kg ha-1 yr-1 wet sulfate deposition, the seven CAPMoN stations alone would be able to detect and quantify projected regional trends within one year of the 41 stations now operating in the area. However, in the regions now receiving less than 20 kg ha-1 yr-1 wet sulfate deposition, CAPMoN would require 4-8 yr longer than the larger set of currently available stations to detect projected reductions. The current configuration of CAPMoN is adequate to monitor some areas with sulfate deposition exceeding 20 kg ha-1 yr-1 until deposition goes below this value, but not those areas situated in extreme southwestern and southeastern Ontario, southern Quebec, and the Bay of Fundy region. In comparison to using all currently operating monitoring stations, using only CAPMoN stations underestimates the area in which wet sulfate deposition exceeds 20 kg ha-1 yr-1.","Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network; Monitoring network design; Precipitation sulfate; Spatial pattern analysis; Trend detection","sulfur; acid rain; article; budget; Canada; environmental monitoring; North America; pollution control; precipitation; priority journal; statistics; Acid rain; Air pollution control; Atmospheric chemistry; Evaluation; Gas emissions; Monitoring; Statistical methods; Sulfur; Acid deposition; Precipitation chemistry; Spatial pattern analysis; Sulfate; Trend detection; Precipitation (meteorology); air quality; CAPMoN; control program; monitoring network; precipitation; sulphate; sulphur emission; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663039

The base has approximately 1200 stationary air emission sources and has been placed on the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) list to undergo realignment and closure by 2001. Due to the privatization of workloads, a number of critical air quality issues must be addressed to ensure a successful transfer of operations to the private sector. The paper discusses issues involving Titles III, V, and VI of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments as well as ozone pollution. Kelly AFB exceeded regulatory requirements related to the reduction and elimination of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs). The base utilizes the most advanced hazardous material tracking system in DoD called the Environmental Management Information System (EMIS). EMIS was selected by the Defense Environmental Security Corporate Information Management (DESCIM) organization for export Air Force wide and provides the base with the capability to accurately speciate, track, and report VOC/HAP emissions. Through proactive efforts, the base has reduced VOC/HAP emissions 77% since 1992. These reductions were achieved through implementation of pollution prevention initiatives. To comply with Title III requirements under the Chromium Electroplating and Anodizing NESHAP, Kelly initiated a project to replace existing chrome emission controls with state of the art emissions control technology. The base operates a depaint facility) compliant with Aerospace NESHAP requirements. The depaint facility accommodates aircraft sizes up to and including the C-5, the largest aircraft in the Air Force inventory. The base launched programs to educate base employees about ozone and its importance to base operations and their health.

When DHC is combined with cogeneration (CHP), maximum reductions in sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), particulates, and ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants can most effectively be achieved. Although significant improvements in air quality have been documented in Europe and Scandinavia due to DHC and CHP implementation, accurately predicting such improvements has been difficult. Without acceptable quantification methods, regulatory bodies are reluctant to grant air emissions credits, and local community leaders are unwilling to invest in DHC and CHP as preferred methods of providing energy or strategies for air quality improvement. The recent development and release of a number of computer models designed specifically to provide quantification of air emissions that can result from DHC and CHP implementation should help provide local, state, and national policymakers with information vital to increasing support and investment in DHC development.",,"Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Cogeneration plants; Computer simulation; Cooling; District heating; Electric power generation; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Air emissions; Space conditioning; Sulfur oxides; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030313688

The data were stratified in six subregions of which three can be regarded as tropical, two as subtropical and one as representing midlatitude climatic conditions. Skew-T diagrams together with Rossby diagrams were used to diagnose the atmospheric structure. A Rossby diagram uses potential temperature and water mixing ratio as independent coordinates. This set of coordinates facilitates the comparison between different atmospheric states and climatological regimes. Characteristic curves on the Rossby diagram are explained in terms of relevant transport and air mass transformation process. The results presented in this paper indicate that in order to compare different climatological regimes it is important to distinguish between levels above and below the average top of the boundary layer. The most robust method to identify the mean top of the boundary layer is to designate it as the level of minimum equivalent potential temperature. Thermodynamic profiles in the northern tropical region shift from a deep convective equilibrium structure in the (monsoon) summer to a stable regime in winter with temperature profiles following the wet-adiabat The deep convective equilibrium structure is neutral to parcels ascending from within the boundary layer to the mid-troposphere without shedding their liquid water, i.e. the reversible wet-adiabatic ascent Furthermore, mere appears to exist a large separation in thermodynamic structure between the group of three tropical regions and the group of two subtropical regions and one mid-latitude region. The analysis was supplemented by plotting relationships between the precipitable water and surface air temperature. The precipitable water is a well described function of the surface air temperature, in agreement with reports in the literature.","Australian region; Precipitable water; Rossby diagram; Skew-T diagram; Thermodynamic diagrams","adiabatic lapse; convection; marine atmosphere; thermodynamics; troposphere structure; water vapour",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030431544

In principle, the total costs of these obligations could be substantially reduced if emission reductions are implemented in regions with low marginal costs for CO2 reduction. This has been difficult to quantify because of lack of models with suitable regional and sectoral detail. In this paper we perform these calculations by taking advantage of the capability of the IMAGE 2 model to compute regional emissions and costs. Two main options are examined for allocating emission reductions required of industrialized regions in a cost effective manner: (1) allocating them among industrialized regions (2) allocating them among all world regions. The cost savings for each of these options are presented. The main conclusions are that (a) it is of great importance for the cost comparisons of protocols to use a well defined baseline scenario and clearly formulated targets, and (b) large economic benefits, in the order of 35-65%, can accrue from joint-implementation agreements which allocate investments on the basis of net marginal costs of CO2 emission reduction.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide emissions; climate protocol; economic evaluation; emission reduction; emissions control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; IMAGE 2 model; regional target",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301221

Using this mechanism and the principles of reduction by the introduction of steady-state assumptions for appropriate species, a seven-step reduced mechanism is derived. The oxidation of C1 species and the description of the hydrogen-oxygen system is similar to that of well-established reduced mechanisms for lower hydrocarbons. Additional steps are required to desribe accurately the behavior of intermediate species; namely, propene, ethene, and acetylene are not in steady state. Special attention is directed toward an accurate description of species relevant to pollutant formation. Excellent agreement between reduced and detailed chemistry is obtained for a wide range of conditions. The results serve to illustrate the major phenomena occurring in n-heptane diffusion flames and the manner in which these phenomen change with compression and mixing rate. The reduced mechanism provides a manageable approach to including elementary chemical kinetics in the computation of turbulent diffusion flames. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Air pollution; Combustion; Flame research; Flow patterns; Mixing; Oxidation; Paraffins; Turbulent flow; Counterflow diffusion flames; Elementary reactions; n heptane; Non premixed combustion; Reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030365677

The Simulation of Production and Utilization of Rangelands model was used for the assessment of the climate impacts. Long-term (1961-1990) climatic data and biophysical and physiological parameters of pasture grassland and cattle were used in the study. The selection of simulation sites for the study was based on regions where there are many cattle. Climate change scenario data were obtained by combining historical weather data from each site with predicted output from general circulation models. Results from baseline runs were compared with four climate change scenarios and a scenario with baseline climate conditions and doubled carbon dioxide (2 x CO2). The impact of climate change on pasture production is estimated to be negative in the Gobi desert area and favorable in colder regions. Livestock intake and livestock weight are estimated to generally decline in late summer when digestibility is lower. Average daily weight gain of Mongolian steers that have only pasture forage is estimated to be lower, whereas it is estimated that there will be no negative effects on the weight gain of steers that are provided supplemental feed.","cattle production; CCCM; GFDL; GISS; grasslands/livestock; Mongolia; pasture production; SPUR2; UKMO","air pollution; cattle; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; food industry; greenhouse effect; meteorology; Mongolia; nonhuman; Bos taurus; Bos taurus; agricultural impact; cattle production; climate change; grassland; livestock; pasture production; SPUR 2; Mongolia, Gobi Desert; Agriculture; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; General circulation models; Livestock production; Pasture production; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659139

The pure substances were: toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene, o-xylene, methylcyclohexane, methylnaphtalene, decahydronaphtalene, phenyldodeeane, heptamethylnonane and tetramethylpentadecane (pristane). The three binaries were: toluene + tetramethylpentadecane, toluene + methylnaphtalene and toluene + heptamethylnonane, for molar fractions x of toluene ranging between 0 and 1. The three binaries are highly ""contrasted"" systems, i.e. systems in which the viscosities of the pure components are very different for each P, T pair. In all, 547 experimental determinations were carried out, the 279 experimental data for viscosity of the pure substances and 268 data concerning the mixtures (x ≠ 0 and 1) were used to make a critical analysis of the various representative models, These included an empirical representation of variations of versus T on each isobar, a self-referencing model developed in our laboratory, a corresponding states model with one reference, various mixing rules with or without adjustable parameters, a combination of the self-referencing model and mixing rules, a method based on the Bloomfield and Dewan excess viscosity, and a group contribution method, comparison of the results showed the self-referencing method to be of particular interest, Moreover when coupled with mixing rules without adjustable parameters it was able to account satisfactorily for the variations η(P, T, x) of the mixtures, on the simple basis of knowledge if the viscosity of the components of the system, at 25°C and at atmospheric pressure, For all the binaries an average absolute deviation of 9.5% was observed.

To establish age related lipid composition-membrane structure relationships, we have examined spectroscopically the hydrocarbon chain structure of lipid membranes from human lens cortex and nucleus 0-95 years of age. Lipid membranes were extracted from human lenses using a monophasic methanolic extraction. The lipid composition of these membranes was determined by 31P-NMR and has already been reported. Fourier transform near-infrared Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies were used to determine human lens lipid structure. Lipid compositional differences were related to membrane structure. The frequency corresponding to the CH2 symmetric stretching band was found to increase with age in lipid samples from all regions of the lens. The frequency was used to estimate lipid hydrocarbon order. Lipid order was found to increase with age and was not significantly different for lipids extracted from the cortex compared to those from the nucleus. These results were confirmed qualitatively by comparing the height of the 2880 cm-1 band with the height of the 2850 cm-1 Raman band. Increased lipid order with age was also confirmed by the analysis of the C-C stretching bands. Lipid hydrocarbon chain order increased linearly with increasing sphingomyelin content and decreased linearly with increasing phosphatidylcholine content. This trend, similar to that observed in other types of membranes suggests that these two lipids may play a role in modulating lipid order. © 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001471457

S., Lund University, Gerdagatan 13, S-223 62 Lund, Sweden","Regional production and utilization of biomass in Sweden is analysed, considering the potential of replacing fossil fuels and producing new electricity. Extensive utilization of biomass will decrease biomass transportation distances. The average distance for biomass transportation to a large-scale conversion plant suitable for electricity or methanol production will be 30-42 km when the conversion plant is located in the centre of the biomass production area. The total energy efficiency of biomass production and transportation will be 95-97% and the emissions of air pollutants will be small. In areas where energy crops from agriculture constitute the main part of the biomass, the transportation distance will be two to three times shorter than in areas where logging residues from forestry dominate. When present Swedish fossil-fuel use for heat and electricity production is replaced, more than 75% of the biomass required can be produced locally within the county. The average transportation distance of the remaining part will be between 130 and 240 km, increasing the cost of this biomass by 15-20%. Increased use of biomass by 430 PJ/yr, the estimated potential for increased utilization of energy crops, logging residues and straw, will lead to an excess of about 200 PJ/yr biomass after fossil fuels for electricity and heat production have been replaced. This biomass could be used for methanol or electricity production. The production of biomass-based methanol will lead to a low demand for transportation, as the methanol produced from local biomass can mainly be used locally to replace petrol and diesel. If the biomass is used for electricity production, however, the need for transportation will increase if the electricity is cogenerated in district heating systems, as such systems are usually located in densely populated areas with a deficit of biomass. About 60% of the biomass used for cogenerated electricity must be transported, on average, 230 km. Changing transportation mode when transporting biomass over large distances, compared with short distances, however, will lead to rather low specific transportation costs and environmental impact, as well as high energy efficiency. Replacing fossil fuels with biomass for heat and electricity production is typically less costly and leads to a greater reduction in CO2 emission than substituting biomass for petrol and diesel used in vehicles. Also, cogeneration of electricity and heat is less costly and more energy efficient than separate electricity and heat production.",,"Agriculture; Crops; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Geographical regions; Methanol; Production; Space heating; Biomass production; Biomass transportation; Biomass utilization; Energy crops; Large scale conversion plants; Biomass; alternative energy; biomass power; environmental impact; transport costs; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030240503

The basic structure in the GP model is a Reference Energy System (RES) that maps the optimal flow of intermediate forms of energy from supply side to demand nodes at the end use level in the four major economic sectors, viz., domestic, transport, industry, and services and commercial. The sustainability objectives include: (a) meeting minimum useful energy demand of each end use in different sectors, (b) maximizing the capacity utilization of power stations and the stock of modal fleet, (c) minimizing expenditure on energy within the budget limits, (d) minimizing emissions of different pollutants with respect to the 1990 loading, and (e) minimizing over-utilization of energy resources. The relative weights of importance of each of the goals and sub-goals have been elicited from experts using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The integrated urban model is used to assist in developing an effective sectoral energy plan and is applied to the city of Delhi (India) to examine the effects in the year 2001 under two scenarios. In the first scenario, the possibilities for improving efficiency and abating pollution are ignored. The second scenario illustrates the effect on emissions by improving device, technology and economic efficiency, while reducing urban traffic congestion. Around 10% energy savings is possible in Delhi under scenario 2, with consequent emission reductions of lead (33%), CO (24%), HCs (21%), SPM (17%), SO2 (12%), NOx, and CO2 (10% each).

A composite of spectral field measurements is employed to model UVR-dependent rates of photosynthesis in diatom-dominated waters in a coastal region of the Southern Ocean. Assumptions, caveats and limitations of the modeling are discussed. Calculations begin with the 1991 Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) primary production and optical databases, from which daily integrated rates of carbon fixation in the absence of UVR are calculated as a function of depth for a 140 km transect line sampled between dawn and dusk of a single day (14 November 1991). The UVR measurements from the nearby NSF/OPP Polar Network at Palmer Station are used to determine ozone (O3) concentration on the day of the transect, which is then employed in Madronich's (In UV-B Radiation and Ozone Depletion (Edited by M. Tevini), pp. 17-68. Lewis, Boca Raton, FL, 1993) spectral code to model daytime variations in surface spectral irradiances under clear sky conditions. These data are corrected for cloudiness and then combined with estimates of in- water UVR spectral attenuation coefficients, derived from Icecolors '90 data, to estimate in situ fight exposure for phytoplankton collected at different depths and locations. An absolute chlorophyll-specific biological weighting function (BWF), determined under natural solar light fields for Antarctic diatom communities and shown to be reproducible while differing from a laboratory diatom BWF and other in situ BWF determined for other phytoplankton assemblages, is combined with estimates of in situ UVR exposure to derive in situ estimates of chlorophyll-specific losses of carbon fixation due to UVR inhibition. By repeating calculations for every sampling site along the transect, we derive a spatial map estimated UVR effects on primary production across the region. We repeat calculations for different O concentrations expected during the austral spring over Antarctica and illustrate the O dependency of UVB (280-320 nm) inhibition effects in near surface waters. We estimate ambient UVR reduced carbon fixation rates up to 65% in surface waters, depending upon location, down to undetectable levels at 36 m. Reducing stratospheric O, concentrations by 50% further inhibits near surface primary production by &lt; 5%. Primary production was forced to subsurface maxima across the entire transect line in the presence of UVR.",,"Bacillariophyta; Boca",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030464623

The derived daily averaged BWF had a radiation amplification factor of 0.91 for the environmental radiation conditions under which it was determined, and displayed greater sensitivity to UV-B than BWFs determined for laboratory cultures of temperate latitude phytoplankton (Cullen et al. 1992; Science 258:646-650). In addition, the function was shown to accurately predict the UVR-dependent in situ rates of primary production when the same community was under different stratospheric ozone (O3) conditions. An error estimate for the BWF is also provided and the predictive limitations of the function are discussed briefly. In the early austral spring of 1993 near Palmer Station, Antarctica, surface samples were maintained in 6 spectrally distinct outdoor incubators over the course of a single day and the spectral sensitivity of photosynthetic carbon fixation rates and phytoplankton pigmentation was quantified. The changes in spectral sensitivity to O3-dependent UV-B (280 to 320 nm radiation) and O3- independent UV-A (320 to 400 nm radiation) was resolved on time scale of 2 h intervals over the course of the 10 h incubation. Besides determining the daily peak of cell sensitivity to UVR damage, the derived short-term kinetics for the 6 different spectral light treatments provided the database for resolving a robust action spectrum for the UVR inhibition of in situ rates of primary production. For the diatom community being studied, daily exposure to ambient levels of UVR resulted in a 34% reduction in averaged carbon fixation without any significant effect on the cellular pigment content. The UV-B portion of the solar spectrum photoinhibited daily rates of primary production by 15%, while UV-A was responsible for a 19% reduction in daily averaged rates of carbon fixation. It appears that springtime diatom- dominated communities are equally or more sensitive to UV-B photoinhibition of daily primary production than prymnesiophyte-dominated communities, analyzed during the 1998 'Icecolors' expedition (Smith et al. 1992; Science 258:952-959).","Action spectra; Antarctica; Ozone; Photoinhibition; Phytoplankton; Primary production; UV","Bacillariophyta; Cullen; Haptophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030444284

This paper describes an application of the systems approach to a greenhouse climate model which incorporates crop transpiration, the effects of heating, natural ventilation and evaporative cooling. It represents quite well the complex coupling mechanisms between heat and mass exchanges and allows computation of the inside climate from the state of the actuators such as vent opening, heating intensity and fog system, and the outside climate. System parameters were on-line estimated from sequences of input-output data recorded over the crop production period from December to July.

The C2H2/O/H flames were investigated in an isothermal discharge-flow reactor at a pressure of 2 Torr, with He as bath gas. Concentration vs reaction-time data were obtained by molecular beam sampling and threshold ionization mass spectrometry. The crucial role of CH(2Π) was evidenced by CH4-addition experiments on room-temperature C2H2/O/H systems, where CH(2Π) and CH2(1A1) are the sole intermediates that react rapidly with CH4. The observed strong reduction of [C3H2], [C2H], and [C4H2] upon CH4 addition could be correlated quantitatively with the known removal of CH(2Π) by CH4. The reaction channels r13a and r25a as sources of C3H2 and C2H, respectively, were each established by quasi-steady-state analyses of the pertaining radicals in C2H2/O/H mixtures at 600 K. By a similar method, the observed C3H radicals could be attributed to a minor channel of the CH(2Π) + C2H2 reaction (r13) parallel to that producing C3H2. At 600 K and 2 Torr, the following approximate product yields of reaction r13 were derived: 85-19+9% C3H2 plus H, and 15-9+19% C3H plus H2. Concomitantly with the identification of reaction r25a as dominant C2H source, the rate constant of the reaction C2H + O (r19) was determined relative to the well-known kinetic coefficients of C2H + C2H2 and C2H + O2: k19 = (9 ± 4) × 10-11 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 at 600 K. It is suggested that a sizeable fraction of the ethynyl radicals formed in fuel-rich hydrocarbon flames is produced likewise by oxidation of C3Hx radicals (x = 1-3) that arise in the fast reactions of CH(X2Π) and CH2(a1A1) with C2H2. © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000496351

The selectivity of adsorbed layers of both porphyrins appears to be very sensitive to the support: on gold only hydrogen peroxide is formed whereas on carbon four-electron reduction is observed. On both supports a peculiar, reversible deactivation occurs at low potentials. IrPc gives hydrogen peroxide on both supports and no deactivation. A previously described single site mechanism is discussed in which only out-of-plane iridium can accomplish the four electron reduction to water and deactivation occurs when the iridium is reduced to its 1 + oxidation state. The results of the in-situ Raman study were generally consistent with this mechanism, but were insufficient to establish it beyond reasonable doubt.","Indium-chelates; Oxygen; Raman spectroscopy; Reduction","Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Chelation; Gold; Hydrogen peroxide; Iridium compounds; Oxygen; Raman spectroscopy; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; In situ resonance Raman spectroscopy; Iridium octaethylporphyrin; Iridium phthalocyanine; Iridium tetraphenylporphyrin; Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030120464

In year 2050, on the basis of current scenarios for growth in aviation, the concentration of NOx at 10 km could increase by 30-60% at midlatitudes, and the concentration of ozone could be enhanced by 7% and 2% in summer and winter, respectively (relative to a situation without aircraft effects). The perturbation is not limited to the flight corridors but affects the entire northern hemisphere. The magnitude (and even the sign) of the ozone change depends on the level of background atmospheric NOx and hence on NOx sources (lightning, intrusion from the stratosphere, and convective transport from the polluted boundary layer) and sinks which are poorly quantified in this region of the atmosphere. On the basis of our model estimates, 20% of the NOx found at 10 km (midlatitudes) is produced by aircraft engines, 25% originates from the surface (combustion and soils), and approximately 50% is produced by lightning. For a lightning source enhanced in the model by a factor of 2, the increase in NOx and ozone at 10 km due to aircraft emissions, is reduced by a factor of 2. The magnitude of aircraft perturbations in NOx is considerably smaller than the uncertainties in other NOx sources.

Compared to baseline, the 17% reduction in V(CO2,br) was sustained at 25 min after addition of PEEP11 because V̇A remained depressed. Then, V(CO2,br) could only be restored to baseline if PA(CO2) sufficiently increased. However, CO2 transport was still in unsteady state at 25 min of PEEP. Peripheral tissue retention of CO2 and the significant increase in mixed venous P(CO2) (Pv̄(CO2), 62.4 ± 6.2 Torr) were not enough to normalize CO2 transfer to the lung and to sufficiently increase PA(CO2), especially during the continued depression in Q̇T that occurred at higher PEEP. The sustained decrease in V(CO2,br) during PEEP was not mirrored by changes in end-tidal P(CO2) (PET(CO2)).","Gas exchange, pulmonary CO2 elimination; Heterogeneity, lung, CO2 elimination; Mammals, dog","animal experiment; article; controlled study; dog; female; gas exchange; male; nonhuman; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029934020

From the early rocket experiments, and in particular from the Wisconsin Survey, the existence of a diffuse hot gas in the vicinity of the solar system, extending out to about 100 pc, has been inferred in order to explain the emission below 0.3 keV. The higher angular resolution and sensitivity of ROSAT made it possible to use diffuse neutral clouds as targets for shadowing the soft X-ray background. Thus, in some directions, more than half of the flux in the 0.25 keV band appears to come from outside the Local Bubble. Further, measurements of the diffuse EUV in the LISM, show surprisingly few emission lines. These findings are in conflict with the standard LHB model, which assumes a local hot (T ∼ 106 K) plasma in CIE. Model calculations, based on the non-equilibrium cooling of an expanding plasma, show a promising way of reconciling all available observations. Thus the present temperature within the LB may be as low as 4 × 104 K and its number density as large as 2 × 10-2 cm-3, giving a total pressure that is roughly in agreement with the Local Cloud. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Diffuse emission; Local Interstellar Medium; Non-equilibrium plasma models; Soft X-ray Background",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007143377

The final HON rule includes two provisions that partially encourage pollution prevention, through the emissions averaging program and by setting emission level minimums on emission sources below which the emissions are not regulated. Both provisions have severe limitations and ultimately, compliance for most facilities relies on implementation of reference control technologies (RCT). These are traditional end-of-pipe control technologies. This paper proposes an Alternative Control Strategy (ACS) for the HON rule that incorporates pollution prevention and flexibility, while encouraging innovative technology. The ACS is defined by converting existing language in the HON rule into a performance-based standard permitting regulated facilities to design compliance programs to meet the required hazardous air pollutant emission reduction. The ACS meets all emission reduction and other requirements of the HON rule. The ACS also includes two additional provisions to encourage pollution prevention efforts. The ACS was applied to an example facility to demonstrate its effectiveness. The ACS compliance program incorporated pollution prevention and flexibility while exceeding emission reduction and all other HON requirements. The ACS program reduced risk to the local community to a greater extent than the comparable RCT compliance program at a comparable total cost. The ACS should be incorporated into the HON rule and other similar Title III regulations as an alternative method of compliance. It meshes with the HON rule and existing state programs, and is simple and straight-forward. Although, the proposed strategy is based on the HON rule, the strategy concept is applicable to most CAAA and other media regulations. The ACS provides a major step in the progression of moving regulations from the traditional end-of-pipe treatment philosophy to pollution prevention based standards.",,"Costs; Environmental protection; Hazardous materials; Laws and legislation; Risk assessment; Standards; Maximum achievable control technology; Reference control technology; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030313818

These parameters have been subjected to correlation analysis and the dependence on motor vehicle emissions for many of the PAH species is inferred. The majority of the PAH displayed higher annual mean concentrations during 1991 than previous measurements taken at the same site in 1987. The impact of motor vehicle emission legislation, the increased use of unleaded petrol and the rise in the use of diesel powered motor vehicles are all discussed in the context of the presented results. A pollution event during December 1991 caused significantly increased PAH concentrations.

This hypothesis appears compatible with the known link between industrialization and schizophrenia since air pollution increases soil acidity, reducing selenium's bioavailability. Several feasible biological mechanisms for a selenium deficiency-schizophrenia association are also identified, including prostaglandin imbalances, viral mutation and excess 12-HPETE production. Evidence of a strong negative correlation between activity of the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase and schizophrenic brain atrophy is also reviewed. Nine surveys, conducted between 1880 and 1963 indicate a continuing negative relationship between selenium levels in fodder crops and United States schizophrenia prevalence. Such variations in the prevalence of schizophrenia in state and county mental hospitals suggest a selenium related relative risk of 1.77:1. International similarities in the spatial distributions of schizophrenia and celiac disease, cancer of the esophagus and multiple sclerosis (all of which appear to involve selenium inadequacy as either a cause or an effect) further support a role for selenium deficiency in schizophrenia.

There are basically three categories of promising forestry practices that promote sound management of forests and at the same time conserve and sequester carbon (C): (I) management for conservation of existing C pools through slowing deforestation, changing harvesting regimes and protecting forests from disturbances; (2) management for expanding for storage by increasing the area and/or C density of native forests, plantations and agroforcstry and or in wood products: and (3) management for substitution by increasing the transfer of forest biomass C into products, such as biofuels and long-lived wood products, that can be used instead of fossil-fuel based products. Under baseline conditions of today's climate and no change in the estimated available lands, the cumulative amount of C that could potentially be conserved and sequestered over the period 1995-2050 by slowing deforestation by 138 M ha (million ha) and promoting natural forest regeneration on 217 M ha in the tropics combined with the global establishment of 345 M ha of plantations and agroforcstry on presently non-forested land would be about 60 to 87 Pg (Pg = 1015). equivalent to 11-15% of the projected cumulative fossil fuel C emissions over the same period. If the wood produced from the plantation programme was substituted for fossil fuels, about another 30 Pg of C would be sequestered. The cumulative cost, excluding land costs and transaction costs, to conserve and sequester the above amounts of C, ranges from US$247 billion to $302 billion at a unit cost of about $2-8/Mg C. Under a changed climate, atmospheric composition and land use. the carbon conservation and sequestration potential would be less than that estimated under baseline conditions because land would be less available in the tropics, and sequestration by new forests in temperate and boreal regions might be offset by transient decline and loss of carbon from existing forests in response to climate change.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Costs and benefits; Deforestation; Forestation","biomass carbon; carbon dioxide emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; deforestation; forest management; forest regeneration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029768604

These include 133 Mha for establishment of plantations and agroforests, 33.5 Mha for slowed tropical deforestation, and 48 Mha for natural and assisted regeneration of tropical forests. The potential quantity of C conserved and sequestered on these lands was conservatively estimated to be 24 Pg C (1 Pg = 10 15 g) by 2050. Establishment of plantations and agroforests could account for 58% of the total mitigation potential on Asian forest lands. The amount of C that could be conserved and sequestered by all forest sector practices by 2050 under baseline conditions is equivalent to about 4% of the global fossil fuel emissions over the same time period. The uncertainties in estimates of mitigation potential presented in this paper are likely to be high, particularly with respect to the land area available for forestation projects and the rate at which deforestation could be slowed. The uncertainty terms are compounded in making global estimates of the mitigation potential, perhaps to large proportions, but to what extent is presently unknown. An example of a forestry project in China whose main goal was to rehabilitate degraded lands and at the same time provide biomass fuel for the local rural inhabitants is presented to demonstrate that C sequestration, and thus mitigation, is an added benefit to more traditional uses of forests. This forestry project is currently mitigating CO 2 emissions (up to about 1.4 Mg C ha -1 yr -1) and, with a change in management, an almost two-fold increase in the current reduction of net C emissions would occur.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission; forest management; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030460516

The rate of NO decomposition over the reduced catalyst is seven times greater than the rate of NO decomposition in the C3H6-NO-O2 reaction. This is consistent with a mechanism in which NO decomposition occurs on Pt sites reduced by the hydrocarbon, provided only that at steady state in the lean NOx reaction about 14% of the Pt sites are in the reduced form. However, the (extrapolated) rate of the NO-H2 reaction at 240°C is about 104 times faster than the rate of the NO decomposition reaction thus raising the possibility that NO decomposition in the former reaction is assisted by Hads. It is suggested that adsorbate-assisted NO decomposition in the C3H6-NO-O2 reaction could be very important. This would mean that the proportion of reduced Pt sites required in the steady state would be extremely small. The NO decomposition and the NO-H2 reactions produce no N2O, unlike the C3H6-NO-O2 reaction, suggesting that adsorbed NO is completely dissociated in the first two cases, but only partially dissociated in the latter case. It is possible that some of the associatively adsorbed NO present during the C3H6-NO-O2 reaction may be adsorbed on oxidised Pt sites.","(assisted) NO decomposition; Lean de NOx; Mechanism; Pt/Al2O3",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002374563

The absorption spectrum of CrV has been obtained in the pH range ca. 2-9 by comparing the observed and expected bleaching yields resulting from the one-electron reduction of CrVI by CO2.- or eaq-. The observed second-order rate constant for the disproportionation of CrV, determined from the rate of partial regeneration of CrVI, shows a bell-shaped dependence on pH with a maximum value at pH 3.3. This pH dependence is consistent with a rearrangement of the coordination shell of CrV from tetrahedral, CrtetV, to octahedral, CroctV, in two sequential proton assisted steps followed by disproportionation between CrtetV, and CroctV with k = 3.4 × 108 dm3 mol-1 s-1.

Based on the bell-shaped dependence on pH of the observed rate constant for disproportionation of CrV, the forms of CrV in acidic solution are assigned as H3CrO4 (pKa = 2.7), H2CrO4- (pKa = 3.8), and HCrO42-. At pH ≥ 6.8 the spectral data indicate the presence of CrO43- and pKa = 7.0 for HCrO42-.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748669882

It is shown that the mechanism of oxygen reduction in a potassium melt does not differ from the mechanism in a K, LiCO3 eutectic, which was studied earlier [1]. A peroxide mechanism takes place in a CO2 atmosphere, and a Superoxide mechanism occurs in an O2 atmosphere. On the basis of found values of charge transfer coefficients and the reaction order with respect to oxygen, in a lithium melt, it was found that, in a CO2 atmosphere, the process occurs according to the scheme: O2 + e = O2- (1), O2- + e = O2- (2), O2- + e = O2- + O- (3), O- + e = O2- (4), 2O2- + 2CO32- = 2CO32- (5), where (3) is the limiting stage. In an O2 atmosphere, the reaction steps are: O2 + 2e = O22- (1′), O22- + e = O2- + O2- (2′), O- + e = O2- (3′), 2O2- + 2CO2 = 2CO32- (4′), and (1′) is the limiting stage.

The enzyme reduces the α,β carbon-carbon double bond of nonactivated 2-enoates and in a reversible way that of 2-enals at the expense of NADH or reduced methyl viologen. UV-visible and EPR potentiometric titrations detect a semiquinone species in redox intermediate states characterized by an isotropic EPR signal at g = 2.0 without contribution at 580 nm. EPR redox titration shows two widely spread mid-point redox potentials (-190 and -350 mV at pH 7.0), and a nearly stoichiometric amount of this species is detected. The data suggest the semiquinone radical has an anionic nature. In the reduced form, the [Fe- S] moiety is characterized by a single rhombic EPR spectrum, observed in a wide range of temperatures (4.2-60 K) with g values at 2.013, 1.943, and 1.860 (-180 mV at pH 7.0). The g(max) value is low when compared with what has been reported for other iron-sulfur clusters. Mossbauer studies reveal the presence of a [4Fe-4S](+2/+1) center. One of the subcomponents of the spectrum shows an unusually large value of quadrupole splitting (ferrous character) in both the oxidized and reduced states.

However, no studies have examined the interplay between farm commodity programs and carbon sequestration programs. This study investigates two dimensions of the interaction between farm commodity programs and afforestation programs, using a price-endogenous sector model of agriculture in the United States. First, this study compares the fiscal and welfare costs of achieving specific carbon targets through afforestation, with and without current farm programs. Second, it examines the welfare, fiscal, and carbon consequences of replacing existing farm subsidies, wholly or in part, with payments for carbon. Two approaches, Hicksian and Marshallian, are investigated. In the first, the sector model is used to quantify the carbon consequences and fiscal costs associated with various combinations of farm commodity and carbon sequestration programs that leave consumers and producers in the U.S. agricultural sector no worse off than under existing farm programs. The second approach focuses on the carbon and welfare consequences of various farm commodity and carbon sequestration programs that hold total program fiscal costs constant at current levels. Although the methodology and data are applied to the United States, the issues addressed are common in a number of developed nations, particularly within the European Union (EU). Adapting existing sector models in these nations to perform similar analyses would provide policy makers with more precise information about the nature of the trade-offs involved with second-best policies for replacing farm commodity subsidies with tree planting subsidies. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Farm policy","carbon sequestration; crop subsidy; economic effect; environmental economics; subsidy trade-off; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667933

In fact, the environment is now an ever present factor in the new political agenda and issues of excessive traffic congestion and global atmospheric pollution are increasingly attracting administrators' attention. One of the most important scenarios proposed for the protection of the environment, taking into account the adverse effects of traffic, is the redistribution of freight transport demand. In this paper the Italian situation has been tested, evidencing productive sectors and regions really benefiting from a more effective redistribution of trade flows among existing links on the freight network. This pattern is estimated by evaluating substitution elasticities before and after the introduction of a pollution tax.

However, the strength of this source is highly uncertain. To improve estimates of CH4 emission at the regional and global scales requires process-based models, integrating the environmental and biological factors that determine the rate of CH4 emission. In this study, we used such a model to calculate the spatial and seasonal variations in CH4 emission from rice paddies, with the support of an integrated GIS data set defining distribution of rice paddies, rice calendar, climate, and soil conditions. The calculated rates of CH4 emission in a rice-growing season varied greatly, from 5 to 90 g CH4 m.2, for rice paddies across the globe. In most rice paddies daily mean CH4 effluxes were from 50 to 400 mg CH4 m.2. Annual total emission was estimated to be 53 Tg; two thirds of this was emitted between 10°N and 30°N. Monthly CH4 emissions ranged from 1.4 Tg in January to 8.7 Tg in August, and more than a half of the emission occurred between June and October. Our model suggests that, on average, 12% of the simple carbon substrate from decomposition of soil organic matter and rice plants was transformed into CH4, and the emitted CH4 accounted for 6.5% of the rice net primary production.",,"methane; organic matter; air pollution; article; climate; decomposition; environmental factor; nonhuman; phytochemistry; plant growth; rice; seasonal variation; soil; methane emission; paddy field; rice production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030245567

These were required by researchers in the Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change (SILMU) for assessing the potential impacts of future climate change in Finland, The approach to scenario construction combines information from two sets of models: a simple model framework simulating greenhouse gas emissions. atmospheric composition, temperature and sea-level rise at global scale (MAGICC), and three coupled ocean atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs) simulating global and regional climate. The scenarios are of surface temperature and precipitation for the period 1990-2100. Three policy-oriented scenarios have been developed: Central, Low and High. These attempt to embrace the range of uncertainty in projections. They are seasonal in resolution and apply to the whole of Finland. In addition, three scientific scenarios have also been developed, based on the regional and monthly pattern of change given by the GCMs. Scenario climates can be defined for any location in the Nordic region and for any date up to 2100. Corresponding scenarios of CO2 concentration and global mean sea-level rise are also presented. Furthermore, a stochastic weather generator is described that can be used to produce time series of daily data according to the scenario changes. Some features of the future climate not specified in the scenarios, such as other variables and changes in climatic variability are also discussed.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Finland; Scenario; Sea-level; Weather generator","carbon dioxide; climate change; precipitation; sea level rise; surface temperature; weather generator; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030366790

However, predictions of these changes are uncertain. In the absence of single, firm predictions, the next best approach is to identify sets of plausible future conditions termed scenarios. This paper focuses on the development of climate change scenarios for northern high latitude regions. Three methods of scenario development can be identified: use of analogues having conditions similar to those expected in the study region, application of general circulation model results, and composite methods that combine information from different sources. A composite approach has been used to produce scenarios ot temperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide and sea-level change for Finland up to 2100, as part of the Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change (SILMU). Tools for applying these scenarios in impact assessment studies, including stochastic weather generators and spatial downscaling techniques, are also examined. The SILMU scenarios attempt to capture uncertainties both in future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere and in the global climate response to these emissions. Two types of scenario were developed: (i) simple ""policy-oriented"" scenarios and (ii) detailed ""scientific"" scenarios. These are compared with new model estimates of future climate and recent observed changes in climate over certain high latitude regions.","Baseline; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Finland; Precipitation; Sea-level; Temperature; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039862358

In light, energy-dependent quenching reduced fluorescence emission and decreased PS II efficiency. Within 3 minutes after darkening fluorescence quenching largely relaxed. However, PS II fluorescence emission decreased again after further darkening, F(o) and F(m) decreased to the same relative extent and the PS II efficiency was not reduced. This Reduction in Fluorescence yield in Darkness, termed RFD for the purpose of this paper, lasted about 20 min. The deepoxidation state of xanthophylls remained unchanged during and after the 15-min exposure to high light. We show that RFD is insensitive to the uncoupler nigericin and thus unrelated to energy-dependent quenching. RFD correlated with a reduction of the PQ pool after darkening and low levels of far red or blue light (430 nm more than 460 nm) prevented RFD. This is in contrast to observations in higher plants, where a post-illumination reduction of the PQ pool causes and increase inn F(o) (Groom et al. (1993) Photosynth Res 36; 205-215). Changes in the adenylate energy charge were not correlated with RFD, Antimycin A and cyanide, both inhibitors of the PQ-oxidase, caused an increase in RFD whereas SHAM an inhibitor of the chloroplastic glycolate-quinone oxidoreductase, caused a decrease. Low CO2 concentrations known to increase the oxygenase activity of Rubisco and to generate glycolate and P-glycolate in light, caused an increase in RFD. We propose that accumulated glycolate and P-glycolate reduce the PQ pool in darkness, leading to the formation of RFD. During RFD, 77 K fluorescence emission from PS II was more reduced than that from PS I, thus resembling a state I, state II transition. However, the reduction in fluorescence in yield during RFD is much larger than the reduction previously attributed to state transitions and it is unclear whether RFD and state transitions are identical. The formation and relaxation of RFD increased with higher temperatures and the extent of RFD was largest at the growth temperature (25°C). RFD has to be taken into account when fluorescence is measured after darkening as it may be mistaken for energy-dependent quenching.","chlororespiration; glycolate-quinone oxidoreductase; state transition","algae; Chlorophyta; Dunaliella tertiolecta; Dunaliella tertiolecta; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030440699

The importance of plant nutrient sulphur continues to grow worldwide as food production increases while overall incidental sulphur inputs tend to diminish.

Fuel cells have been identified as one of three primary propulsion system candidates to meet this triple fuel efficiency goal, since they can dramatically increase automotive propulsion efficiency combined with very low to zero emissions. The US Government is working closely with industry and research institutions in pursuing a strategy of aggressive research and development (R&D) to accelerate the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. The US Department of Energy has a major role in this fuel cell technology development effort. R&D activities are focused on overcoming the major technical, economic, and infrastructure-related hurdles. The high efficiency, very low emissions, and other favorable characteristics of fuel cells (such as fuel flexibility, low noise, and vibration) create significant market opportunities for fuel cells over the entire spectrum of transportation applications. While the focus of near-term markets for fuel cell vehicles will be urban areas having severe air-quality problems, long-term market prospects are encouraging since fuel cell vehicles can compete on an even ground with conventional vehicles in all key aspects, including vehicle range and refueling. This paper will discuss near-and long-term market opportunities for fuel cells in transportation and provide an update on driving regulatory developments in the USA at the federal and state level.

The now reactor data are highly reproducible and supplement traditional smog chamber data for mechanism evaluations. Data for smog produced (SP), IR and AR under the steady-state condition which is attained in approximately 120 min, have been emphasized for mechanism evaluations. Modelling results based on the SAPRC93 mechanism show that modelled SP, IR and AR are: in reasonable agreement with measured values for alkenes except for a branched alkene, isobutene; overestimated for aromatics; and underestimated for alkanes. Consequently, a revised chemical mechanism has been introduced by changing product yields coefficients for reactions of aromatics + OH (reduction of unknown carbonyl compounds formation) and alkanes + OH (reduction of alkyl nitrates formation).

Both emission inventories indicate that about 90% of point source nitrogen oxides (NO(χ)) emissions were from power plants. Furthermore, our results show that the daily variation of point source NO(χ) emissions during the Intensive Study was mostly due to the emissions from the power plants. The daily variation of NO(χ) emissions with respect to a typical summer day was as much as 24%. Although the day-to-day variability in point source VOC emissions was as much as 28%, their contribution to the total VOC was not significant.

The mix of social, economic, political, and climatic factors that created a series of national and international controversies over the diversion since 1896 was defined and is the subject of this review. Information was gathered using a literature survey and from experts in hydrology, law, economics, and political science. The historical analysis revealed that the events causing controversies fell within five distinct periods. The 1845-1890 period involved attempts to solve the sewage disposal problems of a rapidly growing Chicago. Polluted waters were being emitted into Lake Michigan causing a series of major typhoid epidemics, and in 1886 the city decided to build a large 45-km-long canal to divert lake water and flush the city's diluted sewage into the Illinois River system. During the 1891-1930 period increasing amounts of water diverted caused four major controversies: Chicago was pitted against Missouri, the federal government, the other states around the Great Lakes, and Canada. The 1931-1956 period had a federally-forced reduction of the diversion after prolonged debates in the U.S. Supreme Court. Illinois frequently attempted to get the diversion increased with controversies over each attempt, and the build-up of navigation in the canal and Illinois River created a new need for diverted water. The 1957-1978 period had a major diversion controversy which went to the Supreme Court as a result of four factors: a temporary increase in the diversion to alleviate drought problems in the Mississippi River basin, the growth of Chicago's suburbs and their attendant demands for lake water, the demands for water by the development of more hydropower plants along the lakes' exit, and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. This controversy was resolved in 1967, and Illinois found the Court's new guidelines unwieldy, ushering in the 1979-1994 period. The Supreme Court again handled the controversy over Illinois' request to change the accounting method for the water diverted. As this period ended in 1994, yet another controversy was brewing over federal claims that Illinois was exceeding the allotted diversion. The 100-year history of controversies over the Chicago diversion contains four lessons for the future. First, future social, economic and political forces affecting the use and control of the Great Lakes waters, both within and outside the basin, will change as both nations' political and economic worlds shift. Second, Chicago's ever continuing growth will lead to calls for more water from the lakes. Third, a major change in climate would likely reduce water levels in the lakes, produce new demands for Great Lakes water, and create major diversion controversies. Finally, controversies over the Chicago diversion, and other proposed diversions from the Great Lakes, seem a realistic forecast for the future, with or without a change in climate.","Climate change; Diversion; Lake Michigan water levels; Policy","Chicago Diversion; climate change; future prospect; water demand; water management; USA, Great Lakes, Lake Michigan",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030462384

In high recycling L-mode discharges the field reversal had a significant impact on density, temperature, radiated power, particle flux and Hα emission distribution between the strike zones. The in/out ratio of jsat, ne, Prad and Hα emission was reduced following the change from 'normal' to 'reversed' field configuration, while the Te in/out asymmetry was increased. This behaviour is consistent with previous observations and suggests the radial E x B drift as a possible candidate to explain the observed effects. In contrast with the L-mode discharges, a significantly weaker effect of the field reversal on the asymmetries was observed in high density ohmic discharges, which is consistent with the expected reduced drift contribution to plasma transport in low-temperature plasmas. In the L-mode series of discharges with reversed Bt, the previously reported q-dependence of power sharing between the strike zones, with more symmetric power deposition at low q95 was validated. Asymmetry in the power deposition to the target was strongly in favour of the outer strike zone for the series of L-mode discharges analysed, and could not be significantly altered by the inclusion of local strike point radiation. The shifts in the power asymmetry between the targets due to the Bt reversal agrees with previous observations on JET and elsewhere that power distribution between the sides is more symmetric in the 'reversed' toroidal field. © 1996 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electromagnetic wave propagation; Plasma density; Divertor asymmetries; High density ohmic discharges; Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak; Strike zone; Toroidal field reversal; Tokamak devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030230117

A partially premixed jet was used, operated under lift-off flame bifurcation condition in the hysteresis region. Results show that flame lifting and acoustic excitation are effective in reducing the emission index of NOx (EINOx). A lean premixed condition, achieved by the strong upstream mixing of the lifted flame base, can further reduce NOx formation without increasing CO emissions. The prompt NO mechanisms of super-equilibrium OH concentrations and three-body recombination through N2O intermediates dominate in the initial region close to the flame base of the lean premixed, lifted flame. A lower initial prompt NOx and shorter flame length with reduced flame temperature, caused by the enhanced upstream mixing due to flame lifting and acoustic excitation, result in the low NOx and CO emissions in the present loan premixed jet flame.","Acoustic excitation; Lifted flame; NOx emissions; Turbulent combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002545559

The sediments at the site are unconsolidated, fine to coarse beach sand and gravel. A Columbus Instruments Micro-Oxymax Respirometer was used to measure the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) production during the respiration of the sediment samples. The rate of respiration of the sediment samples ranged from 0.035-0.6 μL CO2/h/g of the sediment. The sediment samples showing maximum (0.6 μL CO2/h/g) and minimum (0.035 μL CO2/h/g) production of CO2 were selected to study the effect of micronutrient-yeast extract (0.5 and 1.0 μg/g of the sediment) and water (0.5 and 1.0 mL) on the rate of CO2 production. The rate of CO2 production increased with the addition of water, but increased approx 2 orders of magnitude (from 0.26 to an average of 23.5 μL CO2/h/g) when 1.0 g/g yeast extract was added to the sediment samples. In these coastal sediments, temperature, depth, and addition of water influenced microbial activity, but the addition of 1.0 μg/g yeast extract as a micronutrient rapidly increased the rate of CO2 production 2 orders of magnitude.

Predictions of these ecosystem responses require coupling of ecophysiological and ecosystem processes. Version GEM2 of the grassland ecosystem model linked biochemical, ecophysiological and ecosystem processes in a hierarchical approach. The model included biochemical level mechanisms of C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways to represent direct effects of CO2 on plant growth, mechanistically simulated biophysical processes which control interactions between the ecosystem and the atmosphere, and linked with detailed biogeochemical process submodels. The model was tested using two-year full factorial (CO2, temperature and precipitation) growth chamber data for the grasses Pascopyrum smithii (C3) and Bouteloua gracilis (C4). The C3-C4 photosynthesis submodels fitted the measured photosynthesis data from both the C3 and the C4 species subjected to different CO2, temperature and precipitation conditions. The whole GEM2 model accurately fitted plant biomass dynamics and plant N content data over a wide range of temperature, precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Both data and simulation results showed that elevated CO2 enhanced plant biomass production in both P. smithii (C3) and B. gracilis (C4). The enhancement of shoot production by elevated CO2 varied with temperature and precipitation. Doubling CO2 increased modeled annual net primary production (NPP) of P. smithii by 36% and 43% under normal and elevated temperature regimes, respectively, and increased NPP of B. gracilis by 29% and 24%. Doubling CO2 decreased modeled net N mineralization rate (N_min) of soil associated with P. smithii by 3% and 2% at normal and high temperatures, respectively. N_min of B. gracilis soil decreased with doubled CO2 by 5% and 6% at normal and high temperatures. NPP increased with precipitation. The average NPP and N_min of P. smithii across the treatments was greater than that of B. gracilis. In the C3 species the response of NPP to increased temperatures was negative under dry conditions with ambient CO2, but was positive under wet conditions or doubled CO2. The responses of NPP to elevated CO2 in the C4 species were positive under all temperature and precipitation treatments. N_min increased with precipitation in both the C3 and C4 species. Elevated CO2 decreased N_min in the C4 system. The effects of elevated CO2 on N_min in the C3 system varied with precipitation and temperature. Elevated temperature decreased N_min under dry conditions, but increased it under wet conditions. Thus, there are strong interactions among the effects of CO2 enrichment, precipitation, temperature and species on NPP and N_min. Interactions between ecophysiological processes and ecosystem processes were strong. GEM2 coupled these processes, and was able to represent the interactions and feedbacks that mediate ecological responses to CO2 enrichment and climate change. More information about the feedbacks between water and N cycling is required to further validate the model. More experimental and modeling efforts are needed to address the possible effects of CO2 enrichment and climate change on the competitive balance between different species in a plant community and the feedbacks to ecosystem function.","Carbon; Climate; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Primary; Production","C3; carbon dioxide enrichment; Bouteloua gracilis; Pascopyrum smithii; Poaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030484335

A mechanistic steady-state photosynthesis model for submerged aquatic macrophytes was developed to provide an analysis tool to investigate the responses of plant photosynthesis to CO2, temperature and light. The model was based upon a general simplified scheme for inorganic carbon assimilation of submerged aquatic macrophytes which integrated the knowledge about aquatic plant photosynthesis from previous research, mainly on Hydrilla. The model includes: (1) diffusion and/or active transfer of inorganic carbon (CO2 and/or HCO3-) in the bathing medium into the leaf mesophyll and cytosol; (2) diffusion and/or 'pumping' of CO2 through the PEPcase-related C4 pathway into the chloroplast; (3) inter-conversions between CO2 and HCO3- inside cells; (4) photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle (PCR) in the chloroplast. In the model, the PCR processes in the chloroplast were described using the widely accepted C3 photosynthesis model. The activity of the C4 cycle was related to environmental CO2 'stress'. In this way, the model can simulate the shift between C3-like and C4-like photosynthesis under different environmental conditions. The model was validated using gas exchange data from Hydrilla plants grown in ambient and elevated CO2. The model predicted quite well photosynthetic responses to incident PAR, temperature and ambient CO2 for both ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 treatments. Model predictions agreed well with measured Hydrilla gas exchange data. The simulated and measured CO2 compensation points of Hydrilla leaf photosynthesis were about 100 ppm. The light compensation point of photosynthesis was about 25 μmol m-2 s-1 (PAR), and photosynthesis rate was saturated at about 100 μmol m-2 s-1 (PAR). Higher pH slightly increased photosynthesis rates at ambient CO2 (∼ 350 ppm). There was no significant acclimation of Hydrilla photosynthesis to elevated CO2 within the experimental period. Simulated CO2 compensation point decreased with increasing activity of C4-cycle processes.","Aquatic ecosystems; Carbon; Hydrilla verticillata; Photosynthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012508126

Sci. and Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852, Japan","The effects of poisoning by methane and ethylene in hydrogen gas on the hydrogen permeation through Pd-rich Pd-Y(Gd)-Ag and Pd-Y-In(Sn,Pb) ternary solid solution alloys have been investigated using mixture gases of H2 + 10% CH4 and H2 + 10% C2H4 at temperatures between 523 and 723 K and input gas pressures between 400 and 667 kPa. In addition to these alloys, pure Pd, some Pd-Ag based alloys and Pd-8.0 at.% Y(Gd) alloys were also examined for comparison. The hydrogen permeabilities in these alloys under both the mixtures are reduced compared to that under pure hydrogen gas. The reduction in permeability through Pd-8.0 at. % Gd and Pd-Y(Gd)-Ag alloy series is larger than that for Pd-Y-In(Sn,Pb) alloys, and the reduction for the CH4-mixture gas is larger than that for the C2H4-mixture. In the former mixture gas, the reduction in permeability increases with an increase of temperature, although for pure Pd it decreases, while in the latter mixture gas the reduction decreases with increasing temperature, except for Pd-8.0 at.% Y alloy. The XPS analysis on the alloy surfaces before and after permeation experiments showed that the intensity of the C1s, spectrum observed for all the alloys decreased with an increase of Ar+ sputter etching time; after 5 min sputtering the peak intensity returned to that of the initial sample state. No spectra due to any carbides nor carbon deposition were observed. Thus, the reduction in hydrogen permeability through the alloys under both mixture gases can be attributed to the decrease in effective area due to the adsorption of the impurity gases for the dissociation process of hydrogen molecules.

The monomer reactivity ratios (MRRs) of M1 and M2 were estimated by the Fineman-Ross and Kelen-Tüdos methods, by analysing copolymer compositions which were determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectra. It was found that the MRRs are r1 = 0.45, r2 = 1.68 for M1-MMA; r1 = 2.16, r2 = 0.48 for M1-MA; r1 = 2.04, r2 = 0.42 for M1-EA; r1 = 1.82, r2 = 0.53 for M1-BA, respectively. The order of monomer reactivity estimated from 1/r1 values is MMA &gt; M1 &gt; BA &gt; EA &gt; MA. The higher reactivity of MMA can be attributed to its extra hyperconjugating stabilization by methyl groups in addition to C=O conjugation. Furthermore, from C n.m.r. spectra, it was found that π-electron density of the β-carbon is in the order of MA &gt; EA &gt; BA &gt; M1. The lower electron density of β-carbons in a monomer leads to easier electron transfer from propagating radical to the monomer and consequently a higher reactivity.

We find that the combined effects of the shears in the wind and in the disk itself produce anisotropic line emission, which solves several well-known problems connected with disk models of the broad-line region. In particular, the broadening of resonance lines such as C IV, Lyα, and N V can be attributed to orbital motion of the disk gas at radii as close as ∼1016 cm in Seyferts, without requiring unrealistically large emission regions in order to produce single-peaked profiles. Furthermore, the anisotropy of the line emission results in frequency-dependent response functions which are no longer red-blue symmetric, so that the time delays inferred for the various red and blue components of the line agree qualitatively with recent reverberation mapping observations of NGC 5548. © 1996.

This is in addition to traffic congestion and accidents which result in the loss of productive activity. While there is a close relationship between traffic volumes and levels of noise and air pollution, transport authorities often assume that solving traffic congestion would reduce noise and air pollutant levels. Tight control over automobile ownership and use in Singapore has contributed in improving traffic flows, travel speeds and air quality. The adoption of internationally accepted standards on automobile emissions and gasoline have been effective in reducing air pollution from motor vehicles. Demand management measures have largely focused on controlling the source of traffic congestion, i.e. private automobile ownership and its use especially within the Central Business District during the day. This paper reviews and analyzes the effectiveness of two measures which are instrumental in controlling congestion and automobile ownership, i.e. road pricing and the vehicle quota scheme (VQS). While these measures have been successful in achieving desired objectives, it has also led to the spreading of traffic externalities to other roads in the network, loss in consumer welfare and rent seeking by automobile traders.","Air pollution; Congestion pricing; Demand management; Private automobile ownership; Transport policy; Vehicle quota","gasoline; air pollution control; air quality; conference paper; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; policy; priority journal; Singapore; traffic; air pollution; traffic congestion; transport policy; Singapore",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029669403

Our theory is in accord with the approach of Evangelista and Barbero. This equation was solved for the case of multipoles of arbitrary order placed at the center of a spherical cavity in a quadrupolar fluid. Our solution indicates that the quadrupolar portion of the disturbance created by an electrostatic probe in a polarizable quadrupolar fluid is localized to a distance of about a bohr, while asymptotically the fluid behaves as a polarizable medium. Internal field corrections as well as internal field gradient corrections have been computed. Fairly good agreement is found between our theory and the experimentally determined dielectric constant for carbon dioxide. The cavity model solution has been applied toward understanding the solvation of ions and dipolar molecules in supercritical carbon dioxide. We have used our theory to show that ions do not dissolve in supercritical carbon dioxide. Our theory displays improving agreement with data on the solubility of water molecules in supercritical carbon dioxide as pressure and temperature are increased.

By following ignition and flame formation processes, it is shown that the flame stabilizes at a certain point due to the upstream propagation of a triple flame where the leading edge is at the stoichiometric surface and the combustion occurs both on the lean and on the rich side. Due to the evaporative cooling, large injection velocities, and the strong flame stretch, the stabilization distance is very large. This allows a considerable amount of air to enter the central part of the flame to feed the internal rich flame, and a large amount of fuel to escape combustion in the stoichiometric flame and support the external lean flame. Both soot and NOx emissions reduction are expected to follow for large liftoff distances (i.e., high pressure and small orifice injection). The flame stabilization mechanism is a result of complex physical and chemical interactions and cannot be described by a simplified theory but to the leading order is determined by the chemical reaction time at the leading edge, the turbulent diffusivity, and the flow velocity so that there exists a balance between the local convection velocity and the triple flame propagation speed. The unburned/burned gas density ratio determing the shape of the leading edge of the flame is important in this process. Due to fast evaporation, the spray properties have little effect on flame stabilization except for the heat of evaporation affecting the temperature at the stoichiometric surface and the combustion kinetics of the fuel. Liftoff trends are studied, and available data on liftoff distances are compared with the predictions. The accuracy achieved is good. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Chemical reactions; Chemistry; Combustion; Computer simulation; Cooling; Diesel engines; Flow interactions; Ignition; Jets; Numerical methods; Stabilization; Turbulence; Diesel spray; Flame liftoff; Flame research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030363163

In Korea, paleofloristic assemblages can be separated into the Carbopermian Pyeongan flora, Triassic-Jurassic Daedong flora, Upper Jurassic Myogok flora, Cretaceous Gyeongsang flora and Tertiary geoflora. The upper Paleozoic (Upper Carboniferous-Permian) Pyeongan flora is composed of six floral assemblages: (C21 - C31; C32 - P11; P11; P12; P21; and p22) according to floral compositions. The Triassic-Early Jurassic Daedong flora are characterized by their various gymno-spermous plant aspects. These assemblages indicate low/middle latitude with a swamp/lake lacustrine paleoenvironment according to composition. The Fililcinae is the most characteristic element in number of species and diversity. The ginkgoales and confierales are the sub-dominant elements. These plants are accompanied by non-marine Crustacea (Estheictes) and this aspect also indicate a shallow lake environment. The Upper Jurassic Myogok flora indicate the Tithonian (latest Jurassic) and probably earliest Cretaceous age by the palynomorphic character. These floral constituents are rather different from the lower Daedong and upper Gyengsang floras. The Cretaceous Gyeongsang flora represent the first appearance of the angiosperm plants in Korea. As mentioned, most of constitutants ofthe plant assemblages indicate lacustirne (swamp/lake) river deposits and a sub-tropical environment is suggested by some cycadeoides trunk fossils. During the Miocene, the eastern part of the Korean peninsular underwent local subsidence, and shallow non-marine sediments were deposited which contain warm/humid climatic plant fossils, coal-bearing formations and tuffaceous rocks. After the events, the marine environment invaded locally along the eastern coast of the peninsula up to the present.",,"coal; conference paper; Crustacea; environmental factor; flora; fossil; geology; Korea; lake; marine environment; plant; rock; sediment; species; time; Carboniferous; Crustacea; Ginkgoales; Magnoliophyta; Tithonia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030296258

Source hydrocarbon contributions determined from receptor modeling were input to the ozone model along with initial measured concentrations of CO, NOx, O3 and with measured temperature, uv, pressure and relative humidity data. Wind trajectories were used to compare the predicted ozone concentration maximums against measured ozone maximums at downwind ozone monitoring stations. The r2 value between observed and calculated downwind ozone was 0.38 and 0.52, for the 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. starting times, respectively, and the slopes of the least squares fit lines were 0.86 and 1.05, respectively, indicating unbiased results. These comparisons are well within the accuracy guidelines specified by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency for ozone prediction models, and are also within the accuracy of similar comparisons produced from Urban Airshed Model applications. Source sensitivity analysis was carried out to see the effect of reducing source emissions on ozone formation.

The perturbative series for the energy which results will be a function of a coupling constant which appears in the Hamiltonian. In this article, the perturbative series for the energy of a state of a cyclic polyene ring which are valid for the small and large coupling limit of the model are used to construct algebraic functions. These algebraic functions are defined in terms of polynomials which are given as a function of the energy variable and coupling parameter and can be solved to give the energy as a function of coupling. It is found that relatively small polynomials give very good agreement with the exact values and that the accuracy of the results increases rapidly as the degree of the polynomial increases. The final goal of this and subsequent articles is to study energy levels in PPP models of planar conjugated hydrocarbons. In this article, we test an interpolant technique on the case of the one-dimensional Hubbard model, where an exact solution can be obtained by solving a system of nonlinear equations. In the case of the Hubbard model, the correlation effects are overestimated.

Motor vehicle exhaust, specifically oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons, have been identified as major ozone precursors in urban areas. Past research has concentrated on assessing the impact of emissions from gasoline fueled light duty vehicles. However, little work has been done on identifying ozone precursors from medium and heavy duty diesel fueled vehicles. This paper presents the results of testing performed on a Navistar T 444E 190 horsepower diesel engine which is certified as a light/heavy-duty emissions classification and is used in medium duty trucks up to 11,800 kg (26,000 lb) GVW. Regulated emissions and speciated hydrocarbon emissions were collected using a filter, bag and Tenax adsorption cartridges for both steady state and transient engine operation.

The SCAQMD is the only region in the nation to be classified as having extreme non-attainment for ozone and consequently the Title V applicability thresholds are the lowest (10 tons per year (TPY) for both NOx and VOC). The SCAQMD was successful in negotiating an interim measure to base their Title V program on actual emissions (of both toxic and criteria pollutants) instead of potential emissions for the first three years, which reduced the number of Title V facilities from nearly 30,000 to 1,400. This information was available as part of the SCAQMD's comprehensive permitting system. In addition, there is currently an unprecedented level of cooperation between the EPA, SCAQMD, industry and environmental groups to incorporate federally enforceable variances from local rules into the SCAQMD Title V program. Many of these changes have resulted in increased flexibility and decreased burden for the Title V permitting of the City of Los Angeles Hyperion Treatment Plant (HTP). The HTP treats approximately 350 million gallons per day (MGD) of primarily domestic wastewater. In addition to the wastewater treatment processes, the plant also generates approximately xx MW of electricity from the combustion of digester gas and dried biosolids. With such diverse emission sources (approximately 120 individual air permits) coupled with the fact that the HTP is currently undergoing major construction with its conversion to full secondary treatment while continuing all operations, the plant faces a unique permitting challenge. With a permitting team involving engineering, operations and consultants, and working closely with the SCAQMD staff, the plant has reduced many of the burdensome permitting tasks, as well as increased their operational flexibility.",,"Air quality; Coastal zones; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Digester gas; Dried biosolids; Hyperion treatment plant; South coast air basin; Wastewater treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030313614

The concept is illustrated through description of an ongoing case study from Canada - the Mackenzie Basin Impact Study (MBIS). As part of the Government of Canada's Green Plan, the Global Warming Science Program includes a study of regional impacts of global warming scenarios in the Mackenzie Basin, located in northwestern Canada. The MBIS is a six-year program focussing on potential climate-induced changes in the land and water resource base, and the implications of four scenarios of global climatic change on land use and economic policies in this region. These policy issues include interjurisdictional water management, sustainability of native lifestyles, economic development opportunities (agriculture, forestry, tourism, etc.), sustainability of ecosystems and infrastructure maintenance. MBIS is due to be completed in 1997. MBIS represents an attempt to address regional impacts by incorporating a ""family of integrators"" into the study framework, and by directly involving stakeholders in planning and research activities.

Despite the observed correlations between these biogeographic patterns and plant traits, there is no quantitative model that accounts for them. We derive such a model from coupled ordinary differential equations of carbon balance and nitrogen uptake, comparing qualitative equilibrium predictions of correlations among plant traits with experimental findings. The model suggests that many of the experimentally observed correlations among plant traits (e.g., photosynthesis and nitrogen content) are best viewed as constraints on plant growth rather than cause and effect.

This paper describes the logic of the EFP identifying the origins of the data used to develop and run the EFP and any assumptions or decisions made in estimating the emissions. The EFP is designed to accept data from three sources. EPA uses the Utility Data Institute's (UDI)/Edison Electric institute. (EEI) Power Statistics database (1991 edition) for individual plant configurations. The second source is a database of trace element concentrations in coal, by State of coal origin compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

The third source is a series or 52 emission test reports from the ElectricPower Research Institute (EPRI), the Department of Energy (DOE), Primergy, Inc., and EPA. The basic component of the EFP is the emission modification factor (EMF). This factor was developed for EPA to address partitioning of the HAP stream through the combustion and particulate removal process. Emission modification factors are fractions of the amount of a HAP compound exiting device (boiler or air pollution control device) divided by the amount of the same HAP compound entering that device. These factors were averaged by taking the geometric mean of similar devices such as oil-fired tangential boilers. These geometric means were then applied to the mass feed rates entering the boiler, the effect of which either reduced or left unchanged the emissions that passed through them. Those EMFs calculated as being greater than 1.0 (i.e., more material exiting a device than entering it) were set to equal 1.0.",,"Air pollution control; Air pollution control equipment; Boilers; Fossil fuel power plants; Particulate emissions; Emission modification factor; Fossil fuel fired electric utility industry; Hazardous air pollutant; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030312851

This article identifies a number of explanatory factors. It argues that, first and foremost, the proposed strategy hinged on measures in two areas which have traditionally been the prerogative of the member states, namely energy and fiscal policy. In a general climate of subsidiarity, there has been little readiness (especially by some member states) to cede more sovereignty. Furthermore, other issues, such as lack of strong leadership, uncertainty about costs, economic concerns and heavy industrial lobbying, have also influenced policy developments. The lack of effective EU-level measures means that emission reductions will depend on action in the member states, at national, regional and local levels. However, the article finds relatively few incidences of effective policies being implemented at other levels of decision-making and a general lack of co-ordination between the different levels. It thus comes as no surprise that the achievement of the EU's CO2 stabilization target for 2000 now looks increasingly uncertain. The article concludes that, despite some positive signs, there appears to be a lack of political will to establish an effective EU-level response to the problem of climate change. © 1996 Routledge.","Carbon/energy tax; Climate change strategies; EU energy policy; EU environmental policy; Subsidiarity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344466025

Important observations include a decreasing N2O latitude gradient of approximately 0.4 parts per billion volumn (ppbv) from northern midlatitudes to the equator, a decreasing N2O longitude gradient of 0.4 ppbv from the western Pacific to the central Pacific at northern midlatitudes, and an enhancement of 0.2 ppbv in the boundary layer (altitudes below 0.5 km) relative to the rest of the tropospheric vertical profile. Other observations include increased N2O mixing ratios within both urban and biogenic affected air masses and reduced N2O mixing ratios in stratospheric intrusions. These relationships with air mass source characteristics are exhibited in me large-scale correlations between N2O and CO, CH4, and CO2 in the free troposphere.

Natural populations of T. pallidipennis (2n = 23. X0) polymorphic for 3-7 pencentric inversions in 4 medium-sized pairs - show altitudinal clines for 9 chromosome sequences over a wide area in Argentina. Joint analysis has shown correlations with latitude and longitude. In order to identify the climatic variables responsible for this clinal variation, 7 populations sited on an altitudinal gradient were scored for inversion frequency. Multiple regression analyses among chromosome frequencies and environmental variables do not only confirm the consistency of altitudmal gradients for all sequences but also identify minimum temperature (Tmin) as the main climatical variable responsible for this pattern, to such extent that populations with extreme Tmm values are monomorphic. In addition, some sequences are correlated with humidity. These results do not only reinforce the hypothesis of a selective origin for cline maintenance but are also a new example of monomorphism associated to marginal environments. Three inversions (4AI, 7SM2, 8SM4) correlate simultaneously with altitude, latitude, and minimum temperature; two other inversions (6M and 8SM4) correlated with longitude and humidity, because this variable decreases westard in Argentina.

The synoptic methodology employs high-pass filtering to enable comparisons of all seasons, and it uses modified multiple k means clustering to identify six characteristic circulation patterns. The climatology succinctly summarizes important spatial and temporal complexities of border region circulation, including various pressure configurations, the seasonality of those patterns, and associated weather conditions across the region. These results are linked with ozone data for four border-region cities, and the subsequent findings highlight systematic seasonal and region-wide variations in ozone pollution corresponding to patterns of controlling climatic factors. Three high-ozone scenarios are identified, each of which selectively affects a different area or time of year. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Correlations among demographic variables for individuals species - mortality, growth, and the tendency to colonize light gaps - were strong, and a single principal component (PC) accounted for a large fraction of the demographic variability. Most species - shade-tolerance - were clustered at the low end of the PC axis (low growth, low mortality), while the rest were continuously distributed over a wide range. Three demographic guilds could be defined from scores on this axis: we call these pioneer, building phase, and shade- tolerant trees, following earlier terminology. Leaf lifetime correlated negatively with the demographic axis, and there was a weak relationship between demography and moisture-preference: no species with high demographic scores also had high moisture requirements. There was no significant relationship between deciduousness and the demographic axis, but deciduousness was negatively correlated with leaf lifetime and moisture index. Altogether, 11 different combinations of demographic variables, deciduousness, moisture needs, and growth form (canopy vs. understory species) were identified. We evaluated how these functional types changed in abundance between 1982 and 1995. Because of a recent run of dry years and long dry seasons, we predicted that deciduous species, canopy species, pioneers, and drought-tolerant species would be increasing at the expense of their counterparts. Only one aspect of this prediction was borne out: moisture-demanding species declined sharply in abundance relative to drought- tolerant species. Neither deciduousness nor growth form was associated with populations change, and pioneer species declined in abundance more often than shade-tolerants. The overall structure of forest - the density of deciduous, pioneer, and understory species - did not change much, but the decline of the moisture-demanding guild indicates that a change in composition is preceding a structural change.","Demography; Growth form; Moisture requirement; Phenology; Tropical tree","climatic change; community composition; functional type; tropical forest; Panama",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660494

Soil microbial processes contribute substantially to the budgets of atmospheric trace gases. The flux of trace gases between soil and atmosphere is usually the result of simultaneously operating production and consumption processes in soil. The relevant processes are not yet proven with absolute certainty, but the following are likely for trace gas consumption: H2 oxidation by abiontic soil enzymes; CO cooxidation by the ammonium monooxygenase of nitrifying bacteria; CH4 oxidation by unknown methanotrophic bacteria that utilize CH4 for growth; OCS hydrolysis by bacteria containing carbonic anhydrase; N2O reduction to N2 by denitrifying bacteria; NO consumption by either reduction to N2O in denitrifiers or oxidation to nitrate in heterotrophic bacteria. Wetland soils, in contrast to upland soils are generally anoxic and thus support the production of trace gases (H2, CO, CH4, N2O, and NO) by anaerobic bacteria such as fermenters, methanogens, acetogens, sulfate reducers, and denitrifiers. Methane is the dominant gaseous product of anaerobic degradation of organic matter and is released into the atmosphere, whereas the other trace gases are only intermediates, which are mostly cycled within the anoxic habitat. A significant percentage of the produced methane is oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria at anoxic-oxic interfaces such as the soil surface and the root surface of aquatic plants that serve as conduits for O2 transport into and CH4 transport out of the wetland soils. The dominant production processes in upland soils are different from those in wetland soils and include H2 production by biological N2 fixation, CO production by chemical decomposition of soil organic matter, and NO and N2O production by nitrification and denitrification. The processes responsible for CH4 production in upland soils are completely unclear, as are the OCS production processes in general. A problem for future research is the attribution of trace gas metabolic processes not only to functional groups of microorganisms but also to particular taxa. Thus, it is completely unclear how important microbial diversity is for the control of trace gas flux at the ecosystem level. However, different microbial communities may be part of the reason for differences in trace gas metabolism, e.g. effects of nitrogen fertilizers on CH4 uptake by soil; decrease of CH4 production with decreasing temperature; or different rates and modes of NO and N2O and production in different soils and under different conditions.",,"atmosphere; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; ecosystem; gas; nonhuman; review; soil; soil microflora; vegetation; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029845048

Average emission factors for 20 light-weight hydrocarbons (C2-C6), 12 medium-weight hydrocarbons (C6-C12), 23 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), 7 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and hexachlorbenzene (HCB) were determined for a situation with varying engine loads and a short service route (MS Aurora, Helsingborg-Helsingor) and a case with a longer service route and more constant engine loads (Stena Danica, Göteborg-Fredrikshavn). In general, ethene, propene, isobutene, benzene and C9-C12 alkanes dominated the hydrocarbon compositions measured, although their relative proportions differed between the two ferries. The PCB emissions measured were relatively small which is probably a reflection of the low Cl content in the fuel and gas oils used. The levels of PAH detected appear, however, to be of significance; the total PAH group accounted for ca. 1% of the total hydrocarbon emission. It is roughly estimated that ferry traffic in the Skagerak-Kattegatt-Öresund region accounts for ca. 5 t PAH and ca. 1 kg PCB per year. In line with previous estimates of marine emissions, NOx emissions from the ferries were quite significant and this represents an important source in the study area. Since average hydrocarbon emission rates were only ca. 1% of the NOx emissions, tropospheric ozone formation will be more dependent on the NO, emissions irrespective of the composition of the emitted hydrocarbons. In addition, the low HC/NOx ratio in the emissions also indicates that the possible contribution of ferry traffic emissions to hydrocarbon measurements at coastal stations is not very significant.

In the present work, the experimental data have been, then, compared with the results of a numerical model developed to assess the influence of the original engine crevices geometry on HC emissions during gas fueled operation. In fact, under these particular conditions HC emissions are primarily affected by dimensions and overall geometry of crevices volume and ring pack arrangement, because the diffusion process of natural gas in the oil layer is unimportant. The crevice effects have been studied by means of a computational model obtained by linking a phenomenological cylinder approach and a 1-D model of the exhaust manifolds able to describe the main phenomena which influence the HC emissions such as flows inside and outside crevices volumes, the motion of the typical HC rich roll vortices scraped out by piston movement and, finally, the post-oxidation process in engine cylinders which significantly reduces the HC exhaust emissions. The comparison of the experimental results with the calculated ones outlines the model capability to describe the process with a good level of accuracy under different engine operating conditions.

This paper draws together the general trends emerging from these studies and identifies some clear messages for the future modelling of regional biodiversity in these forests. The studies on arboreal mammals (all are marsupials in these forests) reviewed here generally fall into two broad categories: those that conclude that the nutrient status of forests is the prime determinant of habitat quality for arboreal marsupials and those that put equal or greater emphasis on variables related to structural characteristics of forests. Recent studies suggest a hierarchical model that is consistent with both of these emphases. They postulate that a proportion of temperate eucalypt forests, regardless of their climatic or structural characteristics, cannot support permanent populations of arboreal marsupials, especially leaf-eating species, due to low food quality and/or high phytochemical toxicity. Above a postulated nutritional or phytotoxicological 'threshold', food quality is adequate and other variables, including climatic and structural ones, apparently interact to determine habitat quality. Hence, differences in the extent to which different studies sample regional environmental variability, the range of nutrient status and forest structure, are likely to greatly affect which variables appear most significant in models of habitat requirements. Structural characteristics (measured as habitat complexity) of the forest have emerged as explanatory variables for the ground-living mammals also. Variables such as nutrients, lithology, terrain and climate exhibit a different trend to that seen for arboreal marsupials. Relative abundance of small ground-dwelling mammals is negatively correlated with site nutrient status as indicated by nutrient concentrations in tree foliage. Small mammals are present at all measured nutrient levels, but their abundance falls substantially as habitat complexity decreases. The influence of nutrients is masked in habitats of high complexity, there being no relationship with nutrient status. Many ground-living mammals occur across the gradients of lithology, terrain and climate, although there is wide variation in relative abundance for some species. The importance of structural variables for explaining distributions of both arboreal and ground-living fauna in eucalypt forests indicates that adequate modelling of habitat requirements for these fauna can only be achieved if surveys obtain adequate data on forest structure to encompass gradients in seral stage and disturbance history. The present-day mammalian fauna of the southeastern Australian forests has been influenced strongly by the effects of urbanisation, clearing for farming forestry activities and fire on forest structural complexity and nutrient dynamics as well as by predation by introduced carnivores. While modelling with respect to broadly defined climatic and terrain variables might be useful for broad-scale spatial prediction of faunal distributions, such models are unlikely to provide descriptions of habitat requirements or predictions of impacts of forest management at a scale necessary for sustainable management of faunal biodiversity.","Australia; Chemical defences; Eucalypt; Forests; Habitat models; Marsupials; Phenolics","Eucalyptus; Mammalia; Metatheria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030236494

S7N 5A8, Canada","As a prerequisite for quantification of annual N2O emissions at a regional scale, this study was conducted to determine the landscape-scale patterns and seasonal fluctuations of N2O emission and to demonstrate the linking relationships between large-scale controllers and proximal factors of N2O emission. An area of the Black soil zone of central Saskatchewan, Canada, was stratified into three main textural areas: clay loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy. Within each textural area, representative sites were selected based on land use: unfertilized and fertilized cropland, fallow, pasture, and forest sites. A consistent landscape-scale pattern of N2O emission was observed; footslope positions had higher N2O fluxes than shoulder positions. The role of topography is attributed to its strong influence on the hydrologic and pedologic processes in the landscape, which, in turn, regulate the soil factors controlling N2O emission at the microscale level. The seasonal fluctuation of N2O emission was influenced by precipitation. Pulses of activity were observed during summer, after rainfall events following N fertilizer application, and during spring thaw. At the regional scale, the sandy area had lower N2O emissions than the fine-textured areas. The general order of N2O evolved among the land uses was forest pasture &lt; fallow ≃ unferlitized &lt; fertilized cropland. Our results showed the importance of developing spatially based, predictive relationships between N2O emission and its controlling factors. Linking these relationships with large-scale integrative variables, such as soil texture and land use, provides a means for extrapolating N2O fluxes from landscape to regional scale.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030498798

In particular previous attempts to detect molecular radio lines from the Jupiter atmosphere gave negative results. By using a new fast multichannel spectrometer (up to 128,000 channels), coupled with the 32 m dish of the Medicina Radiotelescope, three molecular lines observable in the available region of our system were searched for: water at 22.235 GHz, formaldehyde at 4.830 GHz and ammonia at 23.694 GHz. The detection of the 616→523 rotational transition of the 1.35 cm water line from blob E on July 19, 1994, 2 days after impact is reported. A possible detection of water emission from blobs A and C on the same day may be given only with a 3-sigma level. Emission from blob E was probably detected also on August 3 and September 9, i.e. up to 54 days after impact. The very narrow line width (40 kHz) and the high brightness temperature (20,000 K) of the water emission detected cannot be explained in terms of usual thermal emission when taking into account thermal and/or collisional broadening. In this paper it is shown that only a MASER effect could explain the observed values. This would be the first detection of a water MASER in the Solar System and the first evidence of masing effects induced by catastrophic impacts.

As a result of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), the interim guidelines of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment recommending `Low NOx' technology (1), and similar efforts by other countries, efforts to improve air quality have strengthened dramatically. In particular, fuel burning sources have come under increased scrutiny with more stringent limitations for compounds such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HC). Internal combustion engines (ICE) for transportation and in stationary power generation produce over 90% of all NOx emissions and these sources have become the focal point of many emissions control regulations. A state of the art technology, plasma combustion control (INOX), has been developed in support of ICE to reduce emissions and improve efficiency with significant savings in capital and operating costs. This paper presents a detailed description of the plasma combustion technology and a summary of the performance test results to date.

For this purpose, the emission rate threshold for determining whether a source is major is based on a facility's potential to emit (PTE). In practice, many facilities categorized as major based on PTE have actual emissions well below the major source threshold. Synthetic Minor Operating Permits (SMOPs) have been adopted in many states and local air districts as a mechanism to allow such facilities to accept federally-enforceable limits on their operations in order to avoid the requirement to obtain a full Title V permit. SMOPs must include restrictions on hours of operation, production throughput, material usage, or some other limit which effectively restricts air emissions from the facility to below the major source thresholds. These restrictions must be adopted as federally-enforceable and must be supported by record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance. While SMOPs offer the benefit of avoiding the expense and enforcement exposure of a full Title V permit, the disadvantage is that some element of a facility's operation is constrained to achieve the emission limit. If not carefully designed and implemented, an SMOP can adversely affect a facility's operational flexibility and reduce competitive advantage. This paper illustrates the use of a facility-wide VOC emission limit in an SMOP to preserve and actually improve the operational flexibility of a packaging facility operated by James River Corporation in San Leandro, California. This facility uses a variety of water-based and VOC-based inks and coatings for printing and laminating on flexible packaging substrates. The wide variety of substrate materials, customer-driven product appearance requirements, and frequent coating reformulations requires a large degree of flexibility in which printing lines are run in any given time period. Adopting a plant-wide VOC limit provided the required flexibility and allowed the required record keeping and reporting procedures to flow from existing practices at the plant.",,"Facilities; Laws and legislation; Operations research; Packaging; Volatile organic compounds; Flexible packaging facility; Hazardous air pollutants; Potential to emit; Synthetic minor operating permits; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030312856

The quantities of emissions depend on how the agricultural activities are conducted. The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to assemble information on the levels of activity and PM emissions generated by agricultural field operations (and associated wind erosion), so that the effects of conservation farming practices and conventional farming practices can be compared. The data analysis methodology was designed to provide a consistent comparison of the real emission impacts and costs of conservation and conventional farming practices. Twelve model farm pairs (conventional and conservation) for major crops in 12 areas of the United States were developed for estimation of emission reduction effectiveness and cost effectiveness by calculating tilling, harvesting, and wind erosion emissions, and farming costs of conservation farming practices as compared to conventional practices. The estimates of PM-10 emissions developed in this study account for the reductions in the number of tillage passes and the reductions in wind erosion that are afforded by conservation tillage as compared with conventional tillage practices. Cost effectiveness is calculated as annualized cost of control per unit of reduced PM-10 emissions. The resulting analysis demonstrates that cost savings rather than additional expenses usually accrue to the switching from conventional tillage to conservation tillage in major crop production throughout the country.",,"Agriculture; Cost effectiveness; Erosion; Wind effects; Wind erosion emissions; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030312683

Patterns of regional diversity are the result of differential speciation and extinction rates during the Quaternary.

These large emission rates indicated that most of the atomic oxygen produced through the photolysis of CO2 on the dayside of Venus eventually recombined to produce O2 in the excited (a1Δg) state. This result was initially surprising because available laboratory measurements indicated O2(a1 Δg) yields from atomic oxygen recombination reactions that were no larger than a few percent. More recent observations reveal even larger O2(a1Δg) airglow intensities as well as dramatic spatial and temporal variations in this airglow. High-resolution (0.3 cm-1) spectra of the Venus nightside taken with the Canada France Hawaii Telescope/Fourier transform spectrometer in 1991 show spectrally integrated O2(a1Δg) intensities as large as 1.1 mWm-2 sr-1. Once these values are corrected for viewing angle and reflection from the underlying clouds, they indicate emission rates near 3 MR. These spectra also yield rotational temperatures of 186 ± 6 K in the emitting layer (90 to 115 km). Spectral image cubes taken with the Anglo-Australian Telescope/infrared imaging spectrometer and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope/imaging Fourier transform spectrometer during 1991, 1993, and 1994 provide a more complete description of the spatial and temporal variability in this emission. Images extracted at wavelengths within the O2(a1Δg) Q-branch (1.269 μm) often show contrasts larger than 10 to 1 across the nightside. Even though the disk-averaged intensities are comparable to those seen in 1975, some localized regions have airglow emission rates larger than 5 MR. The brightest emission is often confined to 1000- to 2000-km- diameter regions. These bright regions have been detected over a broad range of latitudes and local times, but they are most often seen at low latitudes and at local times between midnight and 0300 on Venus. The intensity of the brightest spots can change by 20% in less than 1 hour, and they can vanish entirely in less than 1 day. These new observations are providing improved constraints on atmospheric chemical and dynamical models of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere of Venus.

However, respiratory activity during rehydration was more intensive and of longer duration at high CO2 and not CO2 assimilation first became apparent 12 h later than in the leaves rehydrated at present CO2. After reconstitution of the photosynthetic apparatus, the net CO2 assimilation rate was higher in the high CO2 leaves, however it rapidly declined to a value lower than that in the present CO2 plants due to acclimation. This acclimation to elevated CO2 occurred only after complete reconstitution of the photosynthetic apparatus. The downward acclimation of photosynthesis was accompanied by a decrease in content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a+b and carotenoids x+c) and stomatal conductance. The initial slope of the A/c(i) curve for the high C leaves was much lower and net CO2 assimilation rates were lower at all c(i)'s than in the present CO2 plants. The rate of respiration also decreased and the C-balance of the high CO2 leaves therefore remained similar to that of leaves in present CO2.","A/c(i) function; Acclimation; carotenoids; elevated CO2; net CO2 assimilation; respiration; stomatal conductance; variable chlorophyll fluorescence decrease ratio (Rfd value)","Xerophyta scabrida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029825369

Increases in computing power have made it possible to run climate simulations which start already during the last century. This opens up a whole range of new options: the simulations can be compared with present day climate, the cold start error can be minimized and the climate change can already now be detected using a statistical fingerprint analysis. The inclusion of sulphate aerosols adds to the realism of the simulations. In order to study the climate change in more detail, time-slice simulations with doubled horizontal resolution (T42) have been run. In this experimental technique the uncoupled atmosphere model is forced by the sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution calculated by the transient simulations with the coarse resolution globally coupled ocean-atmosphere model at the time of CO2 doubling and tripling, and by the corresponding changed greenhouse gas concentration. It can be found with this technique, which simulates the changed climate under equilibrium conditions that the near surface temperature changes significantly, the precipitation, however, not significantly under future enhanced greenhouse gas conditions.","Anthropogenic climate change; Detection; Sulphate aerosols; Time-slice experiments","anthropogenic effect; climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030357367

The lamproites are ultrapotassic (K2O/Na2O = 2.0-19.9), alkalic [molecular (K2O/Na2O)/Al2O3 = 1.3-2.8], enriched in mantle-incompatible elements (light REE, Ba, Rb, Sr, Th, Hf, Ta) and have nearly homogeneous initial Sr isotopic compositions (0.707764-0.708114). These lamproites could have formed by variable degrees of partial melting of harzburgite country rock and cross-cutting veins composed of phlogopite, K-Ti richterite, titanite, diopside, K-Ti silicates, or K-Ba-phosphate under high H2O/CO2 ratios and reducing conditions. Variability in melting of veins and wall rock and variable composition of the metasomatized veins could explain the significantly different composition of the Kansas lamproites. Least squares fractionation models preclude the derivation of the Kansas lamproites by fractional crystallization from magmas similar in composition to higher silica phlogopite-sanidine lamproites some believe to be primary lamproite melts found elsewhere. In all but one case, least squares fractionation models also preclude the derivation of magmas similar in composition to any of the Kansas lamproites from one another. A magma similar in composition to the average composition of the higher SiO2 Ecco Ranch lamproite (237.5-247.5 m depth) could, however, have marginally crystallized about 12% richterite, 12% sanidine, 7% diopside and 6% phlogopite to produce the average composition of the Guess lamproite (305-312 m depth). Lamproite from the Ecco Ranch core is internally fractionated in K2O, Al2O3, Ba, MgO, Fe2O3, Co and Cr most likely by crystal accumulation-removal of ferromagnesian minerals and sanidine. In contrast, the Guess core (305-312 m depth) has little fractionation throughout most of the sill except in several narrow zones. Lamproite in the Guess core has large enrichments in TiO2, Ba, REE, Th, Ta and Sc and depletions in MgO, Cr, Co and Rb possibly concentrated in these narrow zones during the last dregs of crystallization of this magma. The Ecco Ranch sill did not show any evidence of loss of volatiles or soluble elements into the country rock. This contrasts to the previously studied, shallow Silver City lamproite which did apparently lose H2O-rich fluid to the country rock. Perhaps a greater confining pressure and lesser amount of H2O-rich fluid prevented it from escaping.",,"fractionation; geochemistry; lamproite; petrogenesis; petrology; USA, Kansas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030483226

Important chemical conclusions include the following. There is little evidence for significant agostic interactions between Zr and C-H (or Nα-Hα) bonds. Replacement of small model ligands with bulkier, more realistic ligands causes the Zr coordination to pyramidalize in the putative CH activating species, which should facilitate coordination of hydrocarbon substrate. For substrates that have a π-system (ethylene, benzene, and acetylene), only acetylene showed evidence for interaction between Zr and the π-system on the leaving group in the elimination transition state, suggesting activation and elimination will be relatively insensitive to substituent effects for arenes or olefins. Following the intrinsic reaction coordinates for alkane elimination shows the substrate to remain in the coordination sphere of the d0 imido. Calculated energies for alkane binding to the d0 Zr-imido become more negative as the alkane becomes larger. In all cases, elimination of a hydrocarbon containing a π-system results in a π-complex in preference to a σ-complex. The correlation between calculated and experimental hydrocarbon elimination barriers is respectible given the approximations made in the computational models. © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748621717

The PVN has also been shown to be responsive to the effects of exogenous NPY on energy substrate utilization. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to further characterize and compare the effects of NPY on whole-body calorimetry and feeding after microinjection into either the PVN or the PFH. The metabolic effects of NPY (19.5-78 pmol) were determined using an open-circuit calorimeter by measuring the volumes of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide expired in order to compute respiratory quotients (RQs). Following NPY injection into the PVN (n = 10) or PFH (n = 10), RQs and locomotor activity were monitored over three hours. Additional groups of rats with PVN (n = 10) or PFH (n = 10) cannulae were tested for their feeding responses to these same doses of peptide. While NPY injections into the PVN evoked dose-dependent increases in RQ within 30-40 min of treatment, PFH NPY did not alter RQ at any of the doses tested. Locomotor activity was unaffected by NPY in either site. NPY administration into both the PVN and PFH stimulated eating, although the PFH was found to be the more sensitive in terms of absolute amount of food consumed. These findings support the hypothesis that the PVN may regulate metabolic processes that either produce or coincide with NPY-induced feeding. This contrasts with the PFH, which appears to mediate only the feeding-stimulatory actions of NPY.","Food intake; Indirect calorimetry; Metabolism; Neuropeptide Y; Paraventricular nucleus; Perifornical hypothalamus; Respiratory quotient","neuropeptide Y; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; calorimetry; controlled study; food intake; histology; hypothalamus; intracerebroventricular drug administration; locomotion; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; thalamus midline nucleus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030597076

However net sequestration in tropics is much less than actual CO2 assimilation as bulk of wood produced is primarily consumed as fuel. On the other hand, the use of wood for making durable products like paper, pulp, veneer, etc. does not return the absorbed CO2 back to the atmosphere immediately. Due to abundant avail ability of wood as an industrial raw material in the temperate belt, wood-based manufacturing industry is largely concentrated in the temperate region, mainly western Europe, Scandinavia and North America. Despite excellent conditions for tree growth and presence of vast tracts of significantly underutilized land, Asia, Africa and Latin America are net importers of wood products. The demand for these products is projected to rise at a significantly higher rate in the immediate future and beyond, due to a variety of reasons. Industrial plantations in the tropics can not only make developing countries emerge as the new manufacturing base to meet the global demand for wood-based products, they can prove to be efficient and economically viable means to bring about a net reduction in atmospheric CO2. However, this will require a reorientation of land-use policies as well as policies governing production of wood as a raw material, in order to stimulate the required level of investment in this sector.",,"afforestation; atmospheric carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; economic development; industrial plantation; tropics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029662952

The true stress σ versus true strain ε are approximated by σ = K1 + K2ε1/2. Except for 0.006 wt %C, the fitting displays two or three domains of strain characterized by higher values of the slope K2 at high deformations. For carbon content beyond ≈ 0.2 wt% C this slope increase is due to strain induced martensite. As a consequence transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect, confined to medium carbon contents, is observed. At the same time the stress-strain diagrams exhibit instabilities in the form of serrated yieldings. The critical stress and strain of their onset is correlated to the number of Frank-Read sources (FRS) activated by the plastic flow. In the case of higher carbon alloys and higher strains, the increased slope K2 is thought to be due to another strengthening mechanism involving carbon atoms in the solid solution, associated with Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect.

In this report, we show that the GDH1 gene requires the CCAAT box- binding activator (HAP complex) for optimal expression. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence: (i) overexpression of GDH1 can correct the growth defect of hap2 and hap3 mutants on ammonium sulfate as a nitrogen source, (ii) Northern (RNA) blot analysis shows that the steady-state level of GDH1 mRNA is strongly lowered in a hap2 mutant, (iii) expression of a GDH1-lacZ fusion is drastically reduced in hap mutants, (iv) NADP-GDH activity is several times lower in the hap mutants compared with that in the isogenic wild-type strain, and finally, (v) site-directed mutagenesis of two consensual HAP binding sites in the GDH1 promoter strongly reduces expression of GDH1 and makes it HAP independent. Expression of GDH1 is also regulated by the carbon source, i.e., expression is higher on lactate than on ethanol, glycerol, or galactose, with the lowest expression being found on glucose. Finally, we show that a hap2 mutation does not affect expression of other genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (GDH2, GLN1, and GLN3 encoding, respectively, the NAD-GDH, glutamine synthetase, and a general activator of several nitrogen catabolic genes). The HAP complex is known to regulate expression of several genes involved in carbon metabolism; its role in the control of GDH1 gene expression, therefore, provides evidence for a cross- pathway regulation between carbon and nitrogen metabolisms.",,"ammonia; glutamate ammonia ligase; glutamate dehydrogenase; article; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; carbon dioxide fixation; gene activation; gene expression; gene expression regulation; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; site directed mutagenesis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030010438

When tested on EPA certification fuel without an oxidation catalyst this engine does not appear to meet the 1994 emissions standards for heavy duty trucks, when operating at high altitude. An ultra-low (5 ppm) sulfur diesel base stock with 23% aromatics and 42.4 cetane number was used to examine the effect of fuel sulfur. Sulfur was adjusted above the 5 ppm level to 50, 100, 200, 315 and 500 ppm using tert-butyl disulfide. Current EPA regulations limit the sulfur content to 500 ppm for on highway fuel. A low Pt diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) was tested with all fuels and a high Pt diesel oxidation catalyst was tested with the 5 and 50 ppm sulfur fuels. It was found that without a catalyst, particulate matter (PM) emissions increased slightly more than 6% with increasing sulfur content from 0.068 g/kW-hr (0.092 g/bhp-hr) at 5 ppm to 0.073 g/kW-hr (0.098 g/bhp-hr) at 500 ppm. Sulfate emissions increased from essentially zero at 5 ppm fuel S to 0.0030 g/bhp-hr at 500 ppm and accounted for 3% of the total PM at the highest fuel sulfur level. Emissions of SOF were unaffected by fuel sulfur level and accounted for about 15% of the total PM, on average. Both the low and high Pt catalysts converted approximately 80% of the SOF and reduced total PM by about 25%, independent of fuel sulfur level. This is consistent with literature reports which indicate no effect of Pt loading of SOF conversion. Sulfur oxide species were adsorbed by this catalyst so there was no observed effect of fuel sulfur on sulfate emissions. The high Pt catalyst had a substantially higher activity for CO oxidation. Both catalysts virtually eliminated hydrocarbon emissions. The most important conclusion of this study is that a larger PM reduction results from the use of an oxidation catalyst at 500 ppm sulfur than from lowering the sulfur in the fuel to 5 ppm. Furthermore, the effect of using an oxidation catalyst and of reducing fuel sulfur content on PM emissions are not additive. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalyst supports; Catalytic converters; Oxidation; Particulate emissions; Platinum; Sulfur compounds; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Heavy duty trucks; Hydrocarbon emission; Oxidation catalysts; Particulate matter emissions; Regulated emissions; Sulfur contents; Transient emissions; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072449067

We studied N2O emissions from a sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) plantation on the Hawaiian island of Maul. Young cane fields that were routinely fertilized had &gt;15 mg NH4+-N and NO3--N kg-1 soil, whereas mature cane fields not being fertilized had &lt;2 mg NH4+-N and NO3--N kg-1 soil. Emissions of N:O were also ≃ 10 times higher in the young cane fields than in the mature cane. The highest nitrification potentials and N2O emissions occurred near buried irrigation lines and lowest values between plant rows. Added 15NH4+ was nitrified within 48 h in both young and mature cane fields. Hence, microbial populations exist in both young and mature cane fields that can rapidly produce NO3-, and production of N2O is controlled primarily by when and where fertilizer N is applied. In contrast to many temperate agricultural soils where mineralization-immobilization-turnover processes contribute significantly to the supply of crop N, rates of gross N mineralization were low, indicating that the cane crop N came primarily from applied fertilizer. In the mature cane, soil inorganic-N remains low because of high plant and microbial demand, but in the young cane, fertilizer applications exceed the plant and microbial sinks, and N2O emissions are large. Better fertilizer management in this early stage of the cane crop cycle might significantly reduce N2O emissions.",,"Arundinaria; Hawaiia; Saccharum hybrid cultivar; Saccharum officinarum; fertilizer; irrigation; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; sugar cane; USA, Hawaii, Maui; Agriculture; Gas emissions; Microorganisms; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Soil pollution control; Sugar cane; Tropics; Mineralization; Tropical regions; Tropical soils; Soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029664079

In 1990, the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere (as CO2) from Brazilian Amazon deforestation was 3.5 % to 4.9 % and 250 % to 360 % of the World and Brazilian annual emission from fossil fuels, respectively. In fact, the forest removal is a major contributor to local, regional and global environmental changes. Today, the deforested lands account for an amount superior to 430,000 Km2. In addition to increase of the greenhouse effect, the foreseeable consequences of deforestation are : losses of the soil nutrients, surface erosion, decline in water percolation, evapo-transpiration and the annual pluviosity, losses in the biodiversity, etc.. On the other hand, deforestation is halted and replaced with a rational forest management, a reuse of degraded lands for agro-forestry and biomass production for energy and industrial purposes, we can reduce the pressure on forests lands and the net carbon flux will be reversed. In this paper, we argue the possibilities to achieve a sustainable biomass valorisation in the forest and degraded lands in Brazilian Amazon, with a special interest in the job creation, the cost of these strategies and their carbon flow.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004914106

The data source is the gridded National Meteorological Center (NMC; now the National Centers for Environmental Prediction) analyses available on CD-ROM on the NMC operational octagonal grid (381-km resolution at 60°N) for the period September 1957 to May 1989. A total of 2152 (3053) merger (fracture) events are identified. Merger and fracture events tend to occur preferentially in the band of middle-latitude westerlies. Merger events exhibit a tendency to avoid major mountainous regions and show a somewhat higher frequency of occurrence downstream of these regions. Fracture events cluster somewhat over eastern ocean basins, the southwestern United States, and northwestern Africa while also avoiding major mountainous regions. On average, trough genesis events exceed trough lysis events in northerly 500-hPa flow with the reverse being true for southerly flow. Genesis events maximize downstream of major mountain barriers such as the Rockies and the Stanovoi and Altai-Sayan Mountains of Mongolia, east of Greenland, over western Europe, and across much of the North Pacific and North Atlantic.

We assign a prominent vibration that occurs at 204 cm-1 in the reduced enzyme to the heme Fe2+-proximal histidine stretching vibration. In the ·NO bound form of the enzyme, the heme Fe2+ retains a five-coordinate geometry. Assuming that ·NO binds to the distal side of the heme, this observation indicates that the weak Fe-His bond breaks when ·NO binds. Two isotope-sensitive vibrations are observed in the ·NO bound enzyme, one at 1677 cm-1, attributed to the N-O stretching vibration, and one at 525 cm-1, attributed to the Fe-NO stretching vibration. When CO is bound to the ferrous heme, the heme ligation is six-coordinate. From this, we conclude that the Fe-His bond is still intact and that, if cleavage of the Fe-proximal ligand bond is necessary for complete activation of sGC, then CO should only weakly activate the enzyme, which has been shown to be the case. In the carbonmonoxy enzyme, the Fe-CO stretching vibration is observed at 472 cm-1 and the Fe-C-O bending vibration is detected at 562 cm-1. These frequencies are the lowest yet observed for the Fe-CO stretching and Fe-C-O bending modes in heme proteins or model systems with imidazole as the proximal ligand and suggest that there is significant negative polarity in the distal pocket. The negative polarity and the low frequency of the Fe-His stretching vibration may account for the very low O2 affinity of sGC.",,"carbon monoxide; guanylate cyclase; heme; iron; nitric oxide; receptor protein; article; cell communication; enzyme isolation; priority journal; raman spectrometry; sequence homology; thrombocyte aggregation; vascular smooth muscle; Animals; Carbon Monoxide; Cattle; Ferrous Compounds; Guanylate Cyclase; Hemeproteins; Lung; Nitric Oxide; Solubility; Spectrum Analysis, Raman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030021905

Brown published his classic paleobotanical discoveries from the Tunica Hills of southeastern Louisiana, indicating ice-age plant migrations of more than 1100 km. Brown collected fossils of both boreal trees such as white spruce (Picea glauca) and southern coastal plain plants from deposits mapped as the Port Hickey (Prairie) river terrace by Harold N. Fisk. Subsequent revisions of terrace mapping, radiocarbon dating, and paleoecological analysis reconciled Brown's conceptual and stratigraphic ""mixing"" of these two ecologically incompatible fossil plant groups. An older Terrace 2 (of Sangamonian to Altonian age) contains the warm-temperate assemblage. A younger Terrace 1 (of Farmdalian, Woodfordian, and Holocene age) includes full-glacial and late-glacial remains of both boreal and cool-temperate plants; and a warm-temperate suite of plants dates from the Holocene interglacial. New plant fossil localities with radiocarbon chronologies are now available from within the Lower Mississippi Valley of Missouri and Arkansas as well as from the adjacent Ozark Plateaus, the Interior Low Plateaus of Kentucky and Tennessee, and the bordering Blufflands of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

In an effort to gain better understanding of these processes, an instrument was designed, built and tested which measured in sequence the ions, and then the neutrals coming from the surface of high temperature matrices. Switching between modes was rapid enough to follow changes. This instrument was applied to the study of ion formation from potassium and silver zeolites. It was shown that the only form in which potassium sublimes from potassium zeolite is as monatomic cations. This helps to explain the high alkali metal ion formation efficiency observed from zeolite matrices and supports the concept that alkali metal ions are subliming directly from the solid state into the gas phase. In contrast, silver sublimes from silver zeolite as a combination of monatomic cations and neutrals, with the ion emission intensity about 3 orders of magnitude less than the emission of ions from alkali metal impurities.

We discuss the Mg II line profile variability using various Gaussian emission profile models. No rotational modulation of the line profiles was observed, but there were several large flares. These flares produced enhanced emission in the extended line wings, radial velocity shifts, and asymmetries in some line profiles. Nearly continuous flaring for more than 24 hr, as indicated in the IUE data, represents the most energetic and long-lived chromospheric and transition region flare ever observed with a total energy much greater than 5 × 1035 ergs.

In all the cases, dual emission has been found with the low frequency band attributed to the excited state with intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and the high frequency one to a state without ESIPT. The relative intensities of these bands depend strongly on the temperature, excitation wavelength and the pK(a) value of the second acid molecule involved in a cyclic dimer. The dual emission of molecules like methyl salicylate is conventionally explained in terms of the ground state tautomeric equilibrium with the OH ··· OH intramolecularly hydrogen bonded isomer incapable of ESIPT. Since in the case of 2,6-dihydroxy benzoic acid the only stable isomer with two hydrogen bonds can exist, this explanation seems to be at least insufficient. Other explanations of the dual emission origin are discussed. An attempt is made to explain the available experimental data using the hypothesis involving double well potential surface of the cyclic dimer in the excited state. In the framework of this hypothesis, the barrier between two wells emerges from the reorganization of the whole hydrogen bonded system of a dimer.","2,6-Dihydroxy benzoic acid; Excited state proton transfer; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Hydrogen bonding; Salicyclic acid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030608145

Our analysis takes into account the balance between nitrogen additions from deposition, fixation, and fertilizer applications, and nitrogen losses from stemwood harvesting, regeneration burning, leaching and gaseous emissions. Using a plausible set of parameter values for Eucalyptus, we conclude that nitrogen loss through fire is the main factor limiting sustainable yield, defined as the maximum mean annual stemwood volume increment obtained in the steady state, if management practices are continued indefinitely. The sustainable yield is 30 m3 ha-1 year-1 with harvesting only, 15 m3 ha-1 year-1 with harvesting and regeneration burning, and 13 m3 ha-1 year-1 with harvesting, fire, leaching and gaseous emissions combined. Our approach uses a simple graphical analysis that provides a useful framework for examining the factors affecting sustainable yield.

A case study for the municipal solid waste management system for the city of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, was also conducted. Urban form was found to play a significant role in determining emission levels from a municipal solid waste collection and transport system. Urban forms with higher densities have considerably less pollutants generated from collection and transport due to the shorter travel distances. A methanol-fueled fleet for curbside collection provided the lowest air emissions.

Such patterns are attributable in large part to strong phylogenetic partitioning of ecological resource space at the level of higher taxa. Each of four major class-rank clades in tropical wetlands was centered in a physically distinct part of the lowland ecosystem. Once established in these physical settings clades tended to resist displacement until removed by physically driven extinction. Lycopsid trees were the principal dominants of the wettest habitats and had subpartitioned these environments along generic lines. Seed plants were the dominants on well to poorly drained clastic substrates, a diverse set of habitats reflected in high diversity of species and architectures. Sphenopsids were most abundant in aggradational environments subject to high levels of physical stress. Ferns initially were interstitial opportunists and colonizers of disturbed areas in a variety of environments. These ecological patterns were established in concert with the architectural radiation of the vascular plants, which occurred during the Devonian- Mississippian transition and established the major classes. Within the wetlands, the replacement of species by close relatives drawn from the same families or genera contributed significantly to persistence of communities and landscape gradients. Replacement was more likely to occur from within a clade where similar ecologies already existed, than from across major clades between which the basic ecologies were different. Possibly interacting with the phylogenetic factors were community and landscape level multispecies effects that may have placed limits on species replacement patterns. The existence of such emergent properties of multispecies assemblages is suggested by a breakdown of the system beginning with major, climatically induced extinctions at the Middle-Late Pennsylvanian transition. Following extinctions of the major Middle Pennsylvanian trees, opportunistic ferns gave rise to dominants in many parts of the wetlands, perhaps due to loss of some aspects of system self-regulation. As climatic drying continued seed plants began their largely passive rise to dominance in most kinds of habitats.","extinction; palaeobotany; palaeoecology; Pennsylvanian; tropical","palaeobotany; palaeoecology; Pennsylvanian; tropical environment; wetland community",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030595829

Here, we use two case studies - the Devono-Carboniferous vascular plant radiation and the largely coeval evolution of heterosporous from homosporous life histories - to examine the interface between phylogeny and ecology. Our observations challenge some tenets of the neo-Darwinian orthodoxy, notably the assumed role of competition mediated selection as an active driving force, rather than a passive filter, of evolution. The Devono-Carboniferous class-level radiation of vascular plants was prompted by attainment of a complexity threshold and delimited the morphological envelope that enclosed an apparently fractal pattern of subsequent, lower level radiations. The contrast of low speciation rates with exceptionally high rates of phenotypic divergence in the Devonian suggests a non-adaptive ""novelty"" radiation, perhaps reflecting saltational evolution via ""hopeful monsters"". Successive lower level radiations were more constrained by the ecological hierarchy that resulted from progressive niche differentiation and saturation. This in turn reflected increased speciation rates, thereby completing a well defined negative feedback loop in the coevolution of phenotypic and ecological differentiation. Heterosporous life histories evolved independently in at least ten lineages. Heterospory allows the sporophyte to impose, via differential development, a single fixed gender on each gametophyte prior to spore release. Although the resulting life history is less flexible than homospory, which on recent evidence includes a range of subtle and sophisticated strategies, it promotes the sporophyte as the primary target for selection. Gametophytes effectively perform the role of gametes and are released into the environment prior to fertilization, thus favoring aquatic-amphibious habitats resistant to occupation by homosporous pteridophytes; terrestrial heterospory requires apomixis. Although the profound iteration of heterospory implies a strong adaptive advantage, repeated gradual evolution via inferior intermediates exhibiting exosporous heterospory seems unlikely. Seed-plant success reflects economic efficiency and the subsequent evolution of effective pollination syndromes, rather than integumentation of the ovule. Major radiations of heterosporous lineages and subsequently of seed-plants required perturbation of pre-existing communities by extrinsic environmental changes rather than genuinely competitive displacement. This typical manifestation of ""home-field advantage"" further emphasizes the intimate relationship between phylogeny and ecology, and allows us to make predictions that can be tested by further paleobotanical research. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

A systematic study is made to show the variational behavior of the continuum contrast in dependence on different input parameters and different locations on the Sun. The results show that (1) a purely chromospheric temperature rise is not sufficient, under the assumed physical conditions, to produce a significant continuum enhancement, especially at visible wavelengths, except for some extreme cases when the chromospheric temperature is rather high and the event occurs near the disk limb, (2) a downward shift of the transition region would have some effect, if the top column mass density becomes sufficiently large, and (3) the effect of nonthermal electron beam bombardment is obvious only when the transition region has not suffered a great shift. For these three cases, the continuum contrast in the Balmer continuum is much larger than that beyond the Balmer continuum, implying there is a Balmer jump in the modeled spectra. In some special cases, the chromospheric temperature rise enhances the absorption of the photospheric radiation, thus producing a spurious negative continuum contrast. A case for possible temperature rises around the temperature minimum region is also considered. The continuum contrast in the case of enhanced temperature minimum is found to be much flatter than for the above cases, implying a significant emission process in the lower atmosphere.","Radiative transfer; Sun: Flares",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037796812

Substantial contribution of anthropogenic sources to the local reduced sulfur burden has been observed. As a result of this atmospheric sulfur burden average gas exchange between vegetated soils and the atmosphere shows net deposition. Based mainly on own field measurements a local budget for H2S, COS, and CS2 has been made up in order to calculate anthropogenic emissions. All major sources and sinks in the chosen atmospheric reservoir (24 x 20 x 1 km) have been taken into account. Due to the small reservoir size fluxes across its boundaries are dominant sources and sinks. The differences between outflux and influx therefore account for the unknown anthropogenic emissions which have been determined to be 80 ± 10 (H2S), 66 ± 15 (COS), and 29 ± 6 Mmol year-1 (CS2). Other sources and sinks like natural emissions, chemical conversion, and dry deposition turned out to be of minor importance on a local scale. In fact, inside the investigated reservoir natural emissions were below 0.5% of anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic emissions of H2S, COS, and CS2 quantified in this work have been compared with global emission estimates for these compounds made by other authors.

Studs., University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7005, Australia","Sulfur isotopes vary along strike and down-dip in the mid-Proterozoic Dugald River strata-bound shale-hosted zinc-lead ore deposit, Australia. Although the metal grade has been substantially increased at its southern end by tectonism, geological relationships indicate that mineralisation occurred during early diagenesis, probably in an organic-rich, shallow-water to evaporitic setting (Muir, 1983). Cu, Cu/(Cu + Pb + Zn) and Pb/(Pb + Zn) decrease in the mineralisation northwards independent of the main structural thickening, and so are likely to represent a pre-deformational primary geochemical dispersion. Average δ34S values in pyrite and sphalerite range from ∼ + 8‰ in the south, coincident with the highest copper content of the ores, to ~ + 8‰ in the north, accompanying deposit thinning. In contrast, adjacent footwall and hangingwall iron sulfide does not exhibit isotopic zonation, and has a δ34S peak between +3 and +4‰ (n = 33), with some values as light as -14.5‰, whereas overlying dolomites contain δ34Spy = +5.5 to + 17.5‰; each population is attributed to varying degrees of closed-system biogenic sulfate reduction. Two populations of carbonate carbon isotopes are present. The first (δ13C = - 11 to -5‰) mainly characterises graphitic Footwall Limestone of the Lady Clayre Dolomite, and is interpreted to reflect the metamorphic equilibration of carbonate and organic carbon isotopes. The second (δ13C = -25 to -15‰) characterises the sulphide lens and its immediate sedimentary host, and is most consistent with formation by the oxidation of organic carbon. Thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) by organic matter is preferred to account for the δ34S zonation, because of: (1) mass-balance calculations; (2) the δ13C values of ore and near-ore carbonate; (3) the high temperatures likely for ore formation (150-250°C), which would have prevented biogenic sulfur reduction but promoted TSR; and (4) the trend toward δ34Sseawater. The proposed mineralisation model involves an H2S - and metal-bearing fluid with δ34S = -3 to 0‰. This fluid ascended into the Dugald basin in the south, permeating laterally northward through carbonaceous sediments, below an evaporitic to shallow marine carbonate platform. During this migration, the hydrothermal fluid reacted with organic matter and sulfate to form 34S-rich sulfide (δ34S = +8 to +10‰) by TSR. Reaction was catalysed by deep sourced H2S, biogenic H2S and H2S that evolved by hydrothermal-cracking of organic matter. The sources of sulfate for the reaction were: (1) evaporites locally within the sequence; and (2) dissolved sulfate diffusing from surface waters into the diagenetic zone.",,"isotopic composition; mineralization; organic matter; reduction; stratabound deposit; sulphate; sulphur; Australia, Queensland, Dugald River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030467387

The pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants of CCl4 ranged from 0.0057 day-1 to 0.135 day-1, depending on the conditions of the electron donor and biomass supplemented. Furthermore, the addition of the electron donor in the batches amended with 0.56 mg volatile suspended solids (VSS)/l biomass had a higher enhanced efficiency than those with 1.7 mg VSS/l biomass. These results suggest that there is a potential for stimulating the dechlorinating capability of anaerobic consortia to remedy the chlorinated hydrocarbons in the oligotrophic environment if the conditions of the supplementing electron donor are properly selected.",,"acetic acid; carbon tetrachloride; chlorinated hydrocarbon; glucose; anaerobic bacterium; article; biodegradation; biomass; biotransformation; controlled study; dechlorination; nonhuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029742182

About once every 6 yr, the ice cover remains through the entire summer, creating a residual ice cover the following winter. Residual ice covers are more frequent in the last 10 yr (1986-1995) than in the 20 yr from 1959 to 1978, indicating a reduction in climate factors controlling ice decay. These factors are identified as the number of thawing degree-days, suggesting a tendency toward cooler summers over the last decade. We report year-round meteorology observations that indicate a mean annual temperature of about -15.2°C, with ~ 500 thawing degree-days in summer. Following a residual ice year, spring lake-water temperatures are significantly greater than they are following nonresidual years. The increased temperatures can be attributed to the stabilizing effect of the residual ice pan the previous fall. Without an ice pan, convection cools the entire water column before the surface freezes. When the lake has an ice pan at the start of freezing, the surface freezes over quickly, effectively trapping water heated during summer. The warmer spring water temperatures act as negative feedback, decreasing the potential for a second consecutive residual ice year.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029818314

Schweitzer, 33600 Pessac, France","The ordering properties of sn-1 and sn-2 dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) chains are investigated by NMR and neutron diffraction in order to relate membrane defects to bilayer thickness. First, the effect of temperature and 30 mol % cholesterol on DMPC membranes perdeuterated on the sn-1 acyl chain is studied by solid state 2H-NMR. Using the concept of C-C bond order parameters, SCC, a comparison is made between both lipid chains according to our previously published data on sn-2 chains (Douliez; et al. Biophys. J. 1995, 68, 1727-1739). An odd-even effect is observed when plotting SCC versus carbon position, k, the amplitude of which is constant when increasing temperature, in the presence or absence of cholesterol. Such an effect can be related to different dynamics of conformers used to describe C-C bond isomerization. It is also found that SoddCC &lt; SevenCC for sn-1 chains and SoddCC &gt; SevenCC for sn-2 chains. Such an inversion in parity is accounted for by the peculiar conformational dynamics occurring around C1-C2 in the sn-2 chain. Calculation of the carbonyl C1-C2 bond order parameter indicates that the beginning of the sn-1 chain tends to be perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer, i.e. conversely to what has been found for the C1-C2 bond of the sn-2 chain which orients parallel to the bilayer surface. The presence of cholesterol does not markedly modify the dynamics of the C1-C2 bond of the sn-2 chain, whereas it does restrict by 70% the conformational freedom of the beginning of the sn-1 chain. The number of gauche defects for the sn-1 chain increases from 3 to 4.3 on going from 25 to 60°C and is greater by 0.5-0.7 unit than that of the sn-2 chain, at corresponding temperatures. The average length of the sn-1 chain is found to be 12.7 Å at 25°C and 11.0 Å at 50°C, i.e. it is greater than that of the sn-2 chain by 0.7 Å close to the main transition temperature, TC, whereas both chains have the same length for T &gt; TC + 15°C. At corresponding temperatures, addition of cholesterol results in a 3.5 Å increase in the sn-1 chain length. Second, measurement of the peak-to-peak distance in the one-dimensional neutron-scattering amplitude density of the membrane leads to a bilayer hydrophobic thickness, dh, of 29.3 and 33.2 Å at 50°C, in the absence and presence of 30 mol % cholesterol, indicating a large apparent discrepancy between dh and twice the acyl chain length as calculated from NMR. However, comparison of chain length determination by NMR and neutron diffraction using deuterium labels at positions 5,15 and 4,14 on one of the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine acyl chains shows that both methods measure the same quantity within 0.4 Å. Hence, the marked differences observed between neutron diffraction and solid state NMR in bilayer hydrophobic thickness determination are interpreted in terms of protrusion of molecules above the average bilayer surface. This protrusion is estimated to be 2.1 Å for DMPC at 50°C and is reduced to 0.7 Å in the presence of 30 mol % cholesterol. © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748600386

Higher CAFE reduces safety, unless offsetting steps are taken. Should the public demand moderately higher fuel efficiency, the government should raise the CAFE standard and gasoline prices.

This phenomenon demonstrates the rapidity of freshwater carbonate diagenesis and explains, in part, why carbonate platforms preferentially shed unconsolidated sediment during highstands and not during lowstands when they are subaerially exposed. It further proves, contrary to what the Exxon conceptual sequence stratigraphic models imply, that carbonate deposits do, in fact, respond differently to subaerial exposure than siliciclastic deposits. Case hardening of unconsolidated carbonate sediment in response to subaerial exposure and early, near-surface freshwater diagenesis helps explain why shallow-water platform sediments are preferentially shed into adjacent basins during highstands of sea level and not during lowstands. During lowstands, rapid subaerial lithification of carbonate sediments retards their reworking by wind or water. Once lithified, these deposits are further stabilized by vegetation and karstification, inhibiting their transport as unconsolidated sediment into adjacent deeper-water basins. Observations from Eleuthera Island also document the reciprocal processes associated with freshwater carbonate diagenesis. Calcium carbonate released by partial dissolution of aragonitic ooids was locally reprecipitated as pore-filling, low-magnesian calcite cement. This reciprocity is confirmed by the confinement of freshwater dissolution and cementation to the upper 10-20 cm of the subaerially-exposed body of oolitic sand. Below this case-hardened surface, oolitic sands remained unconsolidated. Only very minor amounts of calcite cement were required for effective case hardening.","Carbonates; Cementation; Diagenesis; Holocene; Sequence stratigraphy; Solution","calcite; carbonate; cementation; diagenesis; freshwater; sequence stratigraphy; Bahamas, Eleuthera Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030435805

All compounds studied exhibit under pressure as well as under continuous irradiation a significant enhancement of the luminescence emission. In the case of substituted aldehydes, both the fluorescence and phosphorescence increase markedly when pressure increases. For B A only increasing phosphorescene is observed. These changes are explained in terms of a model which takes a mixing of the lowest triplet state character as a controlling factor of the pressure effect. Thus, the pressure-induced emission arises from a decrease of the n,;rcharacter of the lowest triplet state and as a result an increase of its radiative rate and decrease of the intersystem crossing. The lowest triplet state is also assumed to be a precursor for the light-induced effect. In this case, the emission is proposed to occur as a result of the triplet reactivity and consequently the creation of a light-emitting species. © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,"Electron energy levels; Irradiation; Luminescence; Phosphorescence; Photochemical reactions; Photoemission; Polymers; Pressure effects; Benzaldehyde; Dibutylamino benzaldehyde; Diethylamino benzaldehyde; Dimethylamino benzaldehyde; Light induced luminescence; Solid polymers; Aldehydes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030091612

CO2 evolution rate, O2 uptake rate and heat production rate varied by a factor of 2 for a continuous culture grown at a dilution rate of 0.10 h-1. Elemental analysis showed that the carbon mass fraction of biomass did not change. Since the reactor is not at steady state, the elemental and energy balances were calculated on cumulated quantities, i.e. the integral of the reaction rates. It was possible to show that carbon, degree of reduction and energy balances matched. Application of simple mass balance principles for non-steady state systems indicated that oscillations were basically characterized by changes in biomass production rate. In addition, the amount of intermediates, e.g. ethanol or acetate, produced or consumed was negligible. Growth rate was low during the S-phase (0.075 h-1) and high during the G2, M and G1 phases (0.125 h-1) for a constant dilution rate of 0.10 h-1. However, nitrogen, ash, sulfur and potassium content showed systematic increases during the S-phase (bud initiation). Cell component analyses showed that changes in cellular fractions during oscillations (storage carbohydrate content decreased during the S-phase) were due to changes in production rates, particularly for protein and carbohydrates. Nevertheless, using the data evaluation techniques for dynamic systems presented here, it was shown that storage carbohydrates are not consumed during the S-phase. Only the synthesis rate of the different cell components changed depending on position in cell cycle. The growth process may be divided into two phenomena: the formation of new cells during mitosis with a low yield, and size increase of new born cells with high yield. Both kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients varied with the position in the oscillation: the results showed that biomass structure changed and that specific growth rate, as well as biomass yield, varied by ± 25% during the oscillation.","Autonomous oscillation; Cell component; Cell cycle; Dynamic system; Growth rate; Mass balance","Bacteria; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Growth kinetics; Oscillations; Oxygen; Physiology; Proteins; Autonomous oscillation; Cell components; Cell cycles; Elemental analysis; Growth rate; Mass balance; Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells; Continuous cell culture; article; biomass; cell cycle; controlled study; fungus culture; fungus growth; growth rate; nonhuman; oscillation; physiology; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Fungi; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030592434

This periodicity was not directly related to variations in the environment, but was likely a result of the regulation of organic carbon flows in the microbial community, which was realized through changes in the rates of the production and consumption of different exometabolites.

Climate change adds a degree of uncertainty to future scenarios. As GCM predictions improve and regional predictions of climate change become more certain, the consequences to forests and water supplies must be comprehended and anticipated.

In the absence of spontaneous emission, our model reduces to the much studied quantum standard mapping. For a sample of atoms initially cooled to the Doppler limit, the momentum variance increases linearly with interaction time. A sample of atoms initially cooled to the recoil limit will display momentum diffusion at a rate that is determined by two numbers: the classical chaos parameter and a dimensionless Planck parameter. This diffusion ceases after the quantum-mechanical break time. Spontaneous emission will modify the diffusion rate of both Doppler- and recoil-cooled atoms. We show that one component of the new diffusion constant is due to spontaneous recoil and that there is a correction to the deterministic diffusion rate due to the destruction of correlations in the stroboscopic position. Spontaneous emission will destroy the dynamic localization of atoms cooled to the recoil limit. The new momentum diffusion constant can be related to the quasistationary state-decoherence rate. © 1996 The American Physical Society.",,"Atomic dynamics; Center of mass statistics; Doppler cooling; Laser cooling; Planck parameters; Recoil cooling; Spontaneous emissions; Standing waves; Wigner distribution; Atoms; Chaos theory; Diffusion; Electromagnetic field theory; Fourier transforms; Laser pulses; Mathematical models; Quantum theory; Random processes; Atomic physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030125606

It is found that the total (biogenic and anthropogenic) strength of CO2-C emission is around 100 TgCyr-1. 16-20% of this quantity is due to fossil fuel burning. This results in an annual anthropogenic emission of slightly less than 2 t per capita. The vegetation removes annually from the air over the country about half of the mass emitted, while a small part of carbon dioxide molecules goes to the stratosphere by diffusion. This means that our region is a net carbon source, even if combustion effects are neglected. The total methane release of the country lies around 500 GgCyr-1 with the predominance of anthropogenic sources like solid waste treatment, natural gas production and distribution as well as animal husbandry. Taking into account appropriate numerical values, a chemical removal of 233 GgCyr-1 can be calculated for the tropospheric air above the country. The sum of the magnitudes of the methane diffusion into the stratosphere and dry deposition is less nearly by an order of magnitude than the mass removed chemically. The comparison of sources and sinks indicates that the tropospheric box over the country is also a net source of carbon in reduced form.

In addition to the well-studied role of hemoproteins in participating in oxygen activation, there is increasing evidence that dinuclear iron centers in proteins also function in this role. Recent work on the interaction of the dinuclear iron centers found in ribonucleotide reductase and in methane monooxygenase with molecular oxygen is reviewed. Available spectroscopic data on reaction intermediates trapped by the rapid freeze quench kinetic technique allow insights into their structures and on the oxidation level of each Fe ion in the complex. These data suggest the initial intermediate formed on reaction of the diferrous center with oxygen is the formation of a diferric peroxo complex which undergoes further internal electron reorganization to form a diferryl-oxo complex termed intermediate Q. It is suggested that these intermediates are formed as initial steps in both methane monooxygenase and in ribonucleotide reductase activation of molecular oxygen. Further reaction steps of Q in each enzyme are distinguished by the source of the subsequent reducing equivalent. In the case of methane monooxygenase, the hydrocarbon substrate is the source of the required reducing equivalent to form a mixed valent ferryl/ferric complex which is proposed to donate a hydroxyl group to the hydrocarbon radical with resulting formation of a diferric 'resting' state and product. An external electron source supplies the single electron to the diferryl center in ribonucleotide reductase to form a mixed valent complex that is capable of oxidizing a proximal tyrosyl residue (122) to its stable radical form with formation of the 'resting' diferric form of the enzyme. This 'unified' scheme for the activation of molecular oxygen by dinuclear iron centers in these two enzymes may have applicability to other enzymes containing these centers.","Biological oxygen activation; Cluster complexes; Diiron complexes","Chemical activation; Enzymes; Hydrocarbons; Iron compounds; Methane; Reaction intermediates; Trapped ions; Cluster complexes; Diiron complex; External electron sources; Hydrocarbon substrates; Methane monooxygenase; Mixed-valent complexes; Oxygen activations; Ribonucleotide reductase; Molecular oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000656454

Predictions have been made for the bonds present in the alloys, with the case of ""chemical"" ordering at T = O K corresponding to phase separation into separate C (sp3) and C(sp2) regions. For T &gt; O K phase separation is eliminated and there is no evidence for the clustering of graphitic carbon, indicating the importance of the configurational entropy in influencing the bonding in the alloys. Hydrogen atoms are predicted to bond preferentially to C (sp3) atoms for all T. The sp3 /sp2 ratio is predicted to increase with increasing H content, as observed experimentally, and also with increasing T due to entropy effects. Predictions have been made for the distribution of bonds in tetrahedral C(sp3)- and planar C(sp2)=C(sp2)-centered units.

The a-CxH1-x alloys have been proposed to consist of five amorphous components: diamondlike, graphitic, polymeric, olefinic, and mixed diamond-graphitic (d-g) components. It is predicted that the polymeric and mixed d-g components dominate in typical plasma-deposited alloy films while the mixed d-g component dominates in hydrogen-free a-C films. ©1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000819111

The CcpA protein belongs to the Lacl/GalR family of bacterial regulators and is comprised of 329 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 36.3 kDa. It shows 56% identity with the CcpA proteins of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. Inactivation of the ccpA gene in the genome of S. xylosus relieved the activities of three enzymes, α-glucosidase, β-glucuronidase, and β-galactosidase, from catabolite repression by several carbohydrates. Concomitantly, transcription initiation of the maltose-utilization operon malRA, including the α-glucosidase gene malA, was no longer subject to glucose-specific control. Carbon source-dependent malRA regulation was also lost upon deletion of a palindromic sequence in the malRA promoter region resembling the catabolite-responsive elements essential for CcpA-dependent catabolite repression in Bacillus. These results strongly suggest that S. xylosus CcpA controls transcription of catabolite-repressible genes and operons by binding to catabolite-responsive operators when rapidly metabolizable carbohydrates are available. Accordingly, the cloned S. xylosus ccpA gene could complement the ccpA mutation in B. subtilis. The ccpA gene of S. xylosus is transcribed from two promoters, one of which is subject to autogenous repression by CcpA. Autoregulation results in a slight reduction of CcpA protein in glucose-grown cells. The characterization of the role of CcpA in carbon catabolite repression in S. xylosus demonstrates that a regulatory mechanism originally detected in Bacillus applies to another Gram-positive bacterium with low GC content.",,"bacterial protein; alpha glucosidase; beta galactosidase; beta glucuronidase; catabolite control protein A; article; Bacillus subtilis; catabolite repression; controlled study; nonhuman; priority journal; Staphylococcus; transcription regulation; Article; autoregulation; Bacillus; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; ccpA gene; DNA base composition; enzyme activity; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; gene inactivation; gene sequence; malA gene; malRA gene; nucleotide sequence; operon; promoter region; protein function; Staphylococcus xylosus; transcription initiation; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacterium subtilis; Posibacteria; Staphylococcus xylosus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029745668

We distinguish different metabolic states according to the extractable activities of enzymes (α-amylase [EC 3.2.1.1], ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase [AGP, EC 2.7.7.27], D-enzyme [EC 2.4.1.25], starch phosphorylase [STP, EC 2.4.1.1]), sucrose phosphate synthase [SPS, EC 2.4.1.14], sucrose synthase [SS, EC 2.4.1.13], acid invertase [AI, EC 3.2.1.26]) and pool sizes of related metabolites (starch, glucose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, fructose 6-phosphate [F6P], glucose 6-phosphate [G6P], fructose 2,6-bisphosphate [F26BP], and inorganic phosphate [Pi]). The period ending with bud break was characterized by high rates of net photosynthesis, a pronounced decrease in the amount of soluble sugars, and a steep rise in starch (from the detection limit to approximately 600 nmol glycosyl units [mg dry weight]-1). In parallel, the extractable activity of AGP increased, while D-enzyme was on a relative high level when compared with the period after bud break. With respect to sucrose metabolism, F26BP, an inhibitor of sucrose synthesis, decreased from 1 to 0.4 pmol (mg dry weight)-1. This was complemented by SPS activity, which was due to both increased protein levels shown by immunoblotting and activation under metabolite control (high levels of G6P and a low Pi/G6P ratio). This indicates a high capacity of synthesis of starch and sucrose in the period before bud break. These observations are in accordance with estimates of photosynthetic carbon gain, which indicate that in early spring large amounts of carbon from current photosynthesis are exported out of the needles. In addition, the content of nonstructural carbohydrates (expressed as hexoses) increased in the bark of the stem. This could also be a consequence of an enhanced carbon export from the needles. After the onset of bud break, starch concentration decreased in all tissues under investigation. In contrast, the level of total nonstructural carbohydrates in the outermost sapwood nearly doubled from bud break until the end of sampling. In the needles, net photosynthesis was reduced by about 75% and a decrease in SPS activity and protein level were found together with lower G6P concentration, and an increased Pi/G6P ratio. These results suggest that during that period sucrose synthesis was reduced in the older needles. In addition, under conditions of reduced photosynthesis, carbon demand of current year needles was in part ensured by the mobilization of starch in the older needles. Taken together our data show that before bud break carbon metabolism of mature leaves is related with the sink demands of storage organs. After bud break the accumulated assimilate pools in needles and stem, mainly the bark, are mobilized and support carbon supply to new tissues.","Acid invertase; ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; Carbon allocation/partitioning; D-enzyme; Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate; Hexose phosphates; Hexoses; Net photosynthesis; Norway spruce; Picea abies; Starch; Starch phosphorylase; Sucrose; α-amylase","Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030037971

The course of reduction was followed up by thermogravimetric technique. The structure of compacts were microscopically examined while the different phases were identified by X-ray diffraction analysis. Mercury pressure porosimeter was used to characterize the pore structures. The isothermal reduction curves obtained showed that MgO revealed different effects on the reduction behaviour of Fe2O3. At the initial stages up 25% extents, the doping of MgO showed no measurable influence on the reduction process. At the intermediate stages (25-85% extents), the doping of 0.5% MgO retarded the reduction while the presence of 1.0% MgO promoted the reduction of Fe2O3 The retardation and promotion effects were increased with the extent of reduction and decreased with rise in temperatures. At final stages of reduction, a slowing down in the rate due to the doping of MgO was observed which was attributed to the formation of hardly reducible magnesiowustite phase. The rate controlling step in the reduction process was determined from the values of apparent activation energy, gas-solid mathematical formulations and the microstructure of partially reduced compacts. It was found that the reduction was controlled by a combined effects of gaseous diffusion and interfacial chemical reaction at the initial stages. While at the latter stages, a solid-state diffusion is contributed to interfacial chemical reaction as the rate controlling mechanism depending on MgO content in compacts.","Carbon monoxide reduction; Direct reduction; Iron oxides; Magnesioferrite; Magnesiowustite; Magnesium oxide; Sponge iron","Carbon monoxide; Composition effects; Diffusion in gases; Iron ore pellets; Iron oxides; Magnesia; Porosimeters; Porosity; Reaction kinetics; Thermal effects; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction analysis; Carbon monoxide reduction; Magnesioferrite; Magnesiowustite; Mercury pressure porosimeter; Sponge iron; Iron ore reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030408291

Such is the case along the southern and eastern shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario in the northeastern region of the United States. Here a synoptic climatological approach is used to identify the synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns conducive to lake-induced snowfall to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario in the states of New York and Pennsylvania from November to March. The approach used in this study allows for a thorough investigation of the characteristics of each lake-effect synoptic type, including the intrannual and interannual variations in frequency and composite atmospheric fields of sea level pressures, 850-mb temperatures and heights, and 500-mb heights. By combining the lake-effect synoptic types with daily snowfall data for 159 stations across New York and Pennsylvania, direct associations are made between each synoptic type and the mean snowfall and snowfall frequency across that region. Five synoptic types are identified as producing significant lake-effect snowfall in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. The large-scale synoptic situation is similar for each lake-effect type; however, each can be clearly distinguished by its wind components, which are important factors in the spatial pattern and intensity of lake-effect snowfall. Variations in the sea level pressure patterns, 850-mb temperatures and heights, 500-mb heights, seasonality, and overtake fetch and strength of flow result in significant differences in the location, magnitude, and frequency of the snowfalls associated with these types. Three of the lake-effect types occur most often in midwinter, while two are most frequent near the beginning and/or end of the snowfall season. Additionally, the interannual frequencies of the midwinter types indicate an upward trend that coincides with evidence of a lake-effect snowfall increase during midseason over the past century. The authors believe that the differences in the lake-effect synoptic types outlined here can be used as additional guidance for more accurate extended forecasts of lake-effect snowfall in northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York.",,"atmosphere/lake interaction; cyclone; lake; lee cyclogenesis; snow fall; USA, Great Lakes, Lake Erie; USA, Great Lakes, Lake Ontario",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030436644

In the case where NO(x) emissions were doubled along with an increase in CO, CH4, and NMHC's, the middle troposphere showed an enhancement of 41% for O3 production relative to the 1985 case. For the reduction scenario, where NO(x) emissions were decreased by a factor of two, the O3 produced in the middle troposphere was reduced by 50%.

Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, United States","Lower-Middle Devonian carbonates (270-400 m thick) of the eastern Great Basin were deposited along a low-energy, west-ward-thickening carbonate platform. Six regional facies representing peritidal, shallow subtidal, stromatoporoid biostrome, deep subtidal, slope, and basin environments are recognized. Four third-order (≈1.5-2.5 m.y. durations), transgressive-regressive sequences are identified across the platform-to-basin transition based on deepening and shallowing patterns in regional facies, intensity and stratigraphic distribution of subaerial exposure features, and stacking patterns of fourth- to fifth-order, upward-shallowing peritidal and subtidal cycles. Transgressive systems tracts along the basin/slope are characterized by upward-deepening successions of proximal through distal turbidites overlain by fine-grained, hemipelagic deposits. Shallow-platform transgressive systems tracts are composed of stacks of thicker-than-average peritidal cycles overlain by subtidal cycles or noncyclic deep subtidal facies. Maximum flooding zones along the shallow platform are composed of stacked peritidal cycles dominated by subtidal facies, noncyclic deep subtidal facies, or distinct deeper subtidal units within successions of restricted shallow subtidal or peritidal facies. Highstand systems tracts along the basin/slope are composed of hemipelagic deposits overlain by distal through proximal turbidites. High-stand systems tracts along the shallow platform are characterized by upward-shallowing succession of cyclic peritidal through shallow subtidal facies. Sequence boundary zones (2-16 m thick) along the shallow platform are composed of exposure-capped peritidal and subtidal cycles that exhibit upsection increases in the proportion of tidal-flat subfacies and increases in the intensity of cycle-capping subaerial exposure features. Sequence boundary zones along the basin/slope (6-20 m thick) are composed of upward-shallowing successions of proximal turbidites or by platform-margin peloid shoal deposits; the absence of exposure features and meterscale cycles within basin/slope sequence boundary zones indicates that the combined rates of third- through fifth-order sea-level fall rates were less than tectonic subsidence rates. Sequence stratigraphic correlations between contrasting facies belts of the basin/slope (section NA) and the edge of the shallow platform (section TM) were independently verified with high-resolution conodont and brachiopod biostratigraphy. Correlation of sequences 1-4 with transgressive-regressive sequences of similar age in the western, midwestern, and eastern United States, western Canada, and Europe indicates they are eustatic in origin. Systems-tract scale correlations across the study area indicate that the platform evolved from a homoclinal ramp to a distally steepened ramp, then into a flattopped platform (sequences 1-2). An incipiently drowned, intraplatform basin developed during sequence 3 as the result of third-order sea-level rise and differential sediment accumulation rates between the platform margin and intraplatform basin. During deposition of highstand systems tract 3, progradation infilled the intraplatform basin, resulting in a flat-topped platform. A distally steepened ramp developed during transgressive systems tract/maximum flooding zone 4 and evolved into a flat-topped platform during highstand systems tract 4 deposition. The four sequences stack in an aggradational to slightly progradational pattern (""keep-up"" style sedimentation) and are bound by sequence boundary zones rather than unconformities, suggesting that greenhouse climate modes and second-order accommodation gains related to the lower portion of the second-order Kaskaskia sequence controlled sequencescale stacking patterns.",,"Carbonates; Deposits; Floods; Glacial geology; Sea level; Carbonate platforms; Greenhouse climates; Hemipelagic deposits; Highstand systems tract; Sediment accumulation; Sequence stratigraphy; Stratigraphic correlation; Transgressive systems tracts; Great Basin; Middle Devonian; Stacking patterns; Subtidal; Third order; Biostratigraphy; Stratigraphy; biostratigraphy; boundary condition; brachiopod; carbonate platform; Devonian; lithostratigraphy; sequence stratigraphy; Canada; Europe; Great Basin; United States; carbonate; Devonian; platform evolution; sequence stratigraphy; Great Basin; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029730797

We also demonstrated the presence of significant Ni-EPR signals when the enzyme was either reduced with the natural electron carrier NADH (5-10 mM) or carefully titrated with sodium dithionite to an intermediate, narrow redox potential range (-280 to -350 mV). Reduction with NADH under argon atmosphere led to a complex EPR spectrum at 80 K with g values at 2.28, 2.20, 2.14, 2.10, 2.05, 2.01 and 2.00. This spectrum could be differentiated by special light/dark treatments into three distinct signals: (1) the ""classical"" Ni-C signal with g values at 2.20, 2.14 and 2.01, observed with many hydrogenases in the reduced, active state; (2) the light-induced signal (Ni-L) with g values at 2.28, 2.10 and 2.05 and (3) a flavin radical (FMN semiquinone) signal at g = 2.00. The assignment of the Ni-EPR signal was clearly confirmed by EPR spectra of hydrogenase labeled with 61Ni (nuclear spin I = 3/2) yielding a broadening of the Ni spectra at all g values and a resolved 61Ni hyperfine splitting into four lines of the low field edge in the case of the light-induced Ni-EPR signal. The redox potentials determined at pH 7.0 for the described redox components were: for FMN -170 mV (midpoint potential, Em, for appearance), -200 mV (EPR signal intensity maximum) and -230 mV (Em, for disappearance); for the Ni centre (Ni-C), -290 mV (Em for appearance), -305 mV (signal intensity maximum) and -325 mV (Em for disappearance). Exposure of the NADH-reduced hydrogenase to carbon monoxide led to an apparent Ni-CO species indicated by a novel rhombic EPR signal with g values at 2.35, 2.08 and 2.01.","Alcaligenes eutrophus; EPR spectroscopy; Hydrogenase; Iron-sulfur cluster; Nickel centre","Alcaligenes; Wautersia eutropha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002151485

Examples of such instruments are taxes on output or on polluting inputs, called presumptive because their target is the pollution presumed to be associated with the activity. A recurring theme throughout the book is that taxation of fuel use can be a powerful indirect instrument for controlling air pollution because of the association between fuel use and emissions. Chapter 1 lays out the basic analytical framework. Chapter 2 treats the case of mobile-source pollution through an examination of gasoline taxes and regulatory policies in Mexico City. Chapter 3 addresses point-source pollution and the potential for altering the fuel mix in industries in Indonesia and Chile, based on firm-level data.

We explore how a self-compatible disturbance species. Nicotiana attenuata, copes with this potential dilemma by examining the changes in emission of chemicals from flowers in response to pollination and herbivory. We propose that chemical changes induced by herbivory and pollination reflect the function of the chemicals in the plant. The emission of a single compound, benzyl acetone (BA, 4-phenyl-2-butanone), by flowers increases dramatically (50x) in the evening, peaking just after dark a pattern of emission characteristic of moth-pollinated flowers. Pools of BA were found only in the outer lip of the corolla where pollinators come in contact with the flower, and diurnal changes in the size of the corolla pool closely paralleled the amount emitted by intact flowers throughout the day, as determined by headspace sampling. Pollination dramatically decreases both the pools of BA in the corolla and its emission from flowers. Similarly, nicotine, a broadly biocidal defense metabolite and an induced defense in vegetative and reproductive tissues, is also found in the headspace of flowers and is principally localized in the basal parts of the corolla below the attachment of the filaments trod the nectar reward. Moreover, the dynamics of the corolla pools of BA and nicotine throughout the day are consistent with their roles in advertisement and defense, respectively. The corolla pools of nicotine are stable throughout the day except during the period of peak BA production and emission when nicotine pools decrease significantly. The coordinated increase in BA emission and decline in nicotine pools are not inexorably linked, because herbivory or mechanical damage to corolla tissue rapidly increases corolla nicotine pools without affecting the increase in BA pools. Similarly, leaf damage results in a slower, systemic increase in corolla nicotine pools during reproductive growth but again does not affect BA pools. Excised flowers emitted BA in a manner similar to that of intact flowers, and excision of a majority of flowers from a plant did not alter the BA emission patterns of the remaining flowers. We conclude that although N. attenuata's defensive and advertisement chemistries respond synchronously to some environmental stimuli, the flowers' chemical responses to pollinators and herbivores are distinct and the differences reflect their ecological roles. We propose that the cost benefit framework of the optimal defense and apparency theories can be fruitfully applied to the allocation of defense metabolites and floral volatiles that function in pollinator attraction, and that this framework can be readily tested by manipulating the patterns of the emissions of plants in the field.","Apparency; Benzyl acetone; Floral volatiles; Nicotine; Plant defense","Corolla; Lepidoptera; Nicotiana attenuata; Nicotiana attenuata; Lepidoptera; Nicotiana attenuata; Solanaceae; apparency; chemical defence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661208

Texans consume 23 percent more energy per capita on transportation than the nation as a whole. The state's contribution to global climate stabilization and local environmental quality requires reexamination of its transportation system. In this study, four scenarios were constructed reflecting different energy strategies that Texas could pursue to address these issues. These alternative scenarios were measured against a reference scenario that reflects current trends in transport policy. The first alternative, a ""roll-back"" scenario, examined the consequences of revoking the current alternative fuels programs. Moderate, aggressive and visionary scenarios were also developed consisting of increasingly aggressive policies to reduce energy consumption and emissions. Included in the analyses are various transportation control measures, employee trip-reduction programs, broader use of telecommunications technologies, accelerated vehicle scrappage. ""feebates,"" mode shifts from automobile to various public transit alternatives and from truck to rail freight, and fuel taxes. The effects of these measures are discussed to identify the ones that have the greatest impact. Only if very aggressive policies are adopted - such as those modeled in the visionary scenario - will transport energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in Texas stabilize, let alone decline. The major stumbling block to implementing such an aggressive suite of transportation policies is the long time frame required for the impacts to come to fruition; the conclusion is political difficulties in taking a long-term perspective will need to be overcome.",,"Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Global warming; Motor transportation; Public policy; Strategic planning; Transportation charges; Transportation energy policies; Transportation sector; Highway administration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030182637

Given the sea surface temperature and specified surface wind field, the atmospheric model calculates the surface fields of air temperature, specific humidity, as well as heat and freshwater fluxes. The inclusion of the moisture balance in the atmospheric model allows the effects of latent heat transport to be included explicitly in the model. Under fixed climatological sea surface temperature (SST) and surface wind conditions, surface air temperatures, specific humidities, and surface fluxes are comparable to direct estimates. Precipitation compares less favorably with observations. As an extension to the climatological forcing case, we conduct a simple perturbation experiment in which the 1955-1959 pentad is compared to the 1970-1974 pentad by driving the model under the respective SST fields. The model exhibits a global air temperature decrease in the latter pentad of 0.27 °C (comparable to direct estimates) with cooling in the northern hemisphere and warming in the southern hemisphere. Such large-scale cooling in our atmospheric model is driven by equivalent local changes in the prescribed SST fields, subsequently smoothed by atmospheric diffusion of heat. The interpentadal modeled differences are shown to be quite robust through model experiments using parameters representative of several different unrealistic climatologies. The resulting interpentadal difference fields change remarkably little even when the background state has changed dramatically. This emphasizes the almost linear response of the atmospheric model to the imposed SST changes. The atmospheric model is also coupled to an ocean general circulation model without the need for flux adjustments. This coupled climate model faithfully represents deep water formation in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, with upwelling throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Water mass characteristics in the vertical compare very favorably with direct observations.",,"air temperature; air-sea interaction; atmospheric diffusion; atmospheric energy-moisture balance model; climate modelling; humidity; oceanic GCM; OGCM; sea surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030485388

At the peak load, the ozone nonattainment required NOx reduction from baseline levels necessary to meet the presumptive limit for cyclone boilers in this regulation is 56%. Eastman Kodak Company and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) are co-sponsoring this project. Chevron has supplied the natural gas. Equipment installation for the gas reburn system was performed in a September 1995 outage. Boiler No. 43's maximum continuous rating (MCR) is 550,000 pounds per hour of steam flow (or approximately equivalent to 60 MWe). Because of the compact boiler design, there is insufficient furnace residence time to use coal or oil as the reburn fuel, thus making it a prime candidate for gas reburn. Kodak currently has four cyclone boilers. Contingent upon successful completion of this gas reburn project, modification of Kodak's other cyclone boilers to include reburn technology will be considered. The paper will describe B&amp;W's gas reburn data from a cyclone-equipped pilot facility (B&amp;W's Small Boiler Simulator), gas reburn system design, manufacturing, and installation information specific to Kodak's Unit No. 43.

Using a simple dynamic model, it is shown how in the face of such externalities the static market-based policy instruments such as Pigouvian taxes should be modified. It is shown that even if for an initial period there is going to be no pollution stock damage, the optimal policy still requires that abatement begins immediately and at increasing rates. Simulation of the model for the case of fossil fuel burning and the consequent global warming shows that the optimal carbon tax, and therefore the optimal control strategy, is particularly sensitive to changes in the marginal abatement cost and the level of fossil fuel demand. Policy simulations contrast the optimal control policy with, and estimate the welfare losses from, alternative policies deriving from arbitrary tax paths. The latter include: (i) a no-tax policy, (ii) a constant carbon tax rate, (iii) the European Community's proposed carbon tax path, and (iv) a delayed optimal tax path.","Global warming; Optimal carbon tax; Stock externalities; Threshold effect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030268995

The thin slab concept has the advantage of high gain, reduced optical distortion by temperature gradients and high thermal fracture pump power. The configuration is attractive for Nd:glass lasers, countering the poor thermal conductivity and low gain cross-section, and reducing active material cost. This paper investigates the average power capabilities of thin Nd:glass slabs, for a range of cooling techniques, to assess thermal distortion problems and to determine the feasibility of true cw operation. The Nd:glass slabs are pumped using diode light injected into a high reflecting cavity through narrow slots that match the diodes emission area. The scheme uses either 10 diode bars pumping from one side of the slab, or 20 bars pumping from both sides. Each bar has a maximum (quasi-cw) peak power of 55W.

PPG's 'Grandfathered' facilities operated with few emission limits and no emission monitoring requirements. Only our facility in California had a truly rigorous emissions characterization requirement. The CAAA Title V Operating Permit requirements put the PPG Glass business on a rapid learning curve. A number of critical issues had to be addressed in order to meet Title V permit application requirements. Monitoring programs had to be planned and implemented in order to develop complete and detailed emission inventories. Detailed regulation and records reviews were required to determine applicable requirements and compliance with those requirements. All the data being developed had to be managed in an effective way within the available resources of the business. To meet this challenge, PPG's Glass business formed a variety of teams involving operations, maintenance, environmental, legal and outside consulting personnel.

Design.-Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Setting.-Gastric secretory research laboratory in a Veterans Affairs medical center. Participants.-Eighteen healthy volunteers (10 men and 8 women) aged 25 to 62 years with normal gastric acid secretion rates. Interventions.-The subjects received the histamine2-receptor antagonist famotidine (Pepcid AC, 10 mg), calcium carbonate antacid tablets (Turns, 1000 mg), or placebo medications 1 hour after a test meal. Two identical meals were taken 2.5 and 6.0 hours after the medication was given. Main Outcome Measures.-Intragastric pH was maintained at 4.0 by in vivo intragastric titration with 0.3N sodium bicarbonate for 10 hours (1 hour before and 9 hours after medication). Reduction in sodium bicarbonate titrant use in the 2 treatment groups compared with titrant use with placebo was reflective of acid secretion inhibited by famotidine or acid neutralized by calcium carbonate tablets. Results.-When evaluated in increments of 30 minutes, calcium carbonate had a rapid onset of action, neutralizing 6.7 mmol of acid in the first 30 minutes. However, its duration of effect was only 60 minutes. Famotidine had a delayed onset of action compared with antacid, beginning after 90 minutes. However, famotidine had a duration of effect of at least 540 minutes. At its peak effect, 210 minutes after administration, famotidine reduced acid secretion by 7.3 mmol per 30 minutes. Conclusions.-Recommended over-the-counter doses of famotidine and calcium carbonate tablets have different pharmacokinetic profiles when taken in the postprandial period. The antacid has a rapid onset and short duration of action, while the histamine2-receptor antagonist has a delayed onset and a prolonged duration.

The first one (called SANA-A) extends from 10 to 20 October 1990 and the second episode (SANA-B) extends from 28 August to 6 September 1991. Using the simulation results the budget of atmospheric sulfur for East Germany is analysed. In the vertical direction the planetary boundary layer and a part of the lower free troposphere are considered. Within the chosen domain local emissions and horizontal advection are the dominating factors for the accumulation of sulfur during both episodes. But the two differ with respect to deposition and conversion rates from sulfur-dioxide to sulfate. The sulfate fraction of the total sulfur is higher for the summer episode SANA-B. On the other hand the degree of pollution i.e. the total mass of sulfur is higher for the SANA-A episode. Reasons for this are: The reduction of emissions due to economical changes in East Germany and the seasonal differences of lignite coal firing (the main source of local emissions). In addition, the atmospheric flow pattern causes a strong inflow from the so-called ""Black Triangle"" during SANA-A. © by Gebrüder Borntraeger 1996.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9844226137

Both Mg2+ and O2- adsorption sites have been considered. The clusters were embedded in a large array of point charges to provide a representation of the Madelung potential. We found that the electrostatic potential in the adsorption region shows a marked dependence on the size of the cluster, in particular, for non-stoichiometric clusters where the number of cations and anions differs considerably. These oscillations are due to (a) the different contribution to the electrostatic potential given by a point charge or by an extended ion, and (b) by the polarization of the ions at the cluster border. The effect of the oscillations in the electrostatic potential on the chemisorption properties was investigated for the case of CO2 interacting with surface and defect O2- sites of the MgO surface. © 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000795362

The remaining potential is supposed to be related to subtle structural and stratigraphic traps. New developments in exploration geophysics like prestack depth migration integrating processing and interpretation form a powerful tool for improved development of existing oil fields and for identification of new oil fields. In general the processing comprises three phases (depending on the local validity/violation of the zero-offset (zo)-condkion, i. e. to which extent does the DMO-stack represent a zo - volume): - Phase A: Standard processing sequence up to final DMO stack and migration including calibration using elastic instead of plane-wave synthetic seismogram. The interpretation team generates a first macro model of the velocity field. - Phase B: Poststack depth-domain The velocity field is checked and updated using the wavefront method. The new macro model forms the basis for poststack depth migration, which is reinterpreted by the interpretation team in order to confirm/update the reflector geometry and to generate the final macro model required for - Phase C: Prestack depth-domain. The prestack depth migration is subject to final interpretation and - due to the irregular surface of the Shuaiba Fm. - should form the basis for AVO. Further steps are L-l-deconvolution followed by Bom inversion, which is essential for generation of a high resolution lithological model. The procedure is presented using a 2D seismic line, which was subject to a detailed interpretation (seismic sequence and facies analysis) of the Shuaiba Fm. The final result is a detailed lithological model which is verified by applying elastic forward modeling (""verification loop"").

In situ infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the surface of the catalyst. Exposure of the catalyst to CO or CO2 produced very similar infrared spectra in which the principal features are those for linearly and bridge-bonded CO. In the case of CO2 adsorption, a band for weakly adsorbed CO2 could also be observed. For identical reaction conditions the rate of CO2 hydrogenation to methane is higher than that for CO hydrogenation. The activation energy for CO hydrogenation is 23.2 kcal/mol and that for CO2 hydrogenation is 16.6 kcal/mol. The partial pressure dependances on H2 and COz (z = 1,2) are 0.67 and -0.80, respectively, for CO hydrogenation, and 0.53 and -0.46, respectively, for CO2 hydrogenation. Infrared spectroscopy reveals that under reaction conditions the catalyst surface is nearly saturated by adsorbed CO. The spectra observed during CO and CO2 hydrogenation are similar, the principal difference being that the CO coverage during CO hydrogenation is somewhat higher than that during CO2 hydrogenation. The CO coverage is insensitive to H2 partial pressure, but increases slightly with increasing COz partial pressure. Transient-response experiments demonstrate that the adsorbed CO is a critical intermediate in both reaction systems. It is proposed that the rate determining step in the formation of methane is the dissociation of H2CO, produced by the stepwise hydrogenation of adsorbed CO. A rate expression derived from the proposed mechanism properly describes the experimentally observed reaction kinetics both under steady-state and transient-response conditions. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003133699

The first four drain predominantly catchments with Phanerozoic siliciclastic rocks, while the latter two dewater Cretaceous carbonate basins. Together, the rivers account for ∼11 percent of the Rhine water, and they reflect various stages of pollution, from a moderately polluted Sieg and Ruhr to the heavily damaged Emscher. The δ18OH2O of -8.5 ± 1.5 permil SMOW suggests that summer recharge into local aquifers is the main source of water in these rivers. Down-stream, the water becomes enriched in 18O, by ∼2 permil, due to low altitude precipitation and because of evaporation, particularly in artificial lakes. However, thermal fractionation, when water is utilized for cooling in power stations and smelters, also contributes to this trend. State-wide, and down-stream within rivers, the increasing pollution levels are characterized by rising salt concentrations (from normal riverine values up to a third of seawater), by up to two orders of magnitude CO2 overpressures, oxygen depletion, and enhanced nutrient concentrations. The δ13CDIC demonstrate that microbial respiration of Corg in soil/groundwater systems accounts for about 50 to 100 percent of the entire DIC, with the higher values typical of more polluted ecosystems. Evasion of gaseous CO2 into the atmosphere and microbial nitrification are the most important processes for the riverine aquatic cycles of carbon and nitrogen, resulting in more advanced dissipation of CO2 and NH+4 in the less polluted ecosystems. Denitrification may fuel generation of some ""excess"" CO2 only in the highly polluted ecosystems, such as the Emscher.",,"anthropogenic impact; oxygen depletion; river pollution; salinity; Germany, North Rhine Westphalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030442269

This approach has been used to show that during the late Early Permian at Allan Hills, south Victoria Land, Transantarctic Mountains, Glossopteris floras thrived under cool wet conditions with warm summers during which the trees grew well in the long hours of polar sunlight but became dormant to survive sub-freezing winter temperatures. During the Late Cretaceous-Tertiary in the Antarctic Peninsula region a change from frost-free temperate conditions during the early Late Cretaceous to cooler climates in the Tertiary is reflected in the growth rings in fossil trees and a change from conifer-dominated vegetation to floras with a greater portion of cool climate angiosperms.

Anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are mostly associated with fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation, both of which are intimately associated with diverse economically important activities. This circumstance will make it difficult for society to rapidly achieve large reductions in the emissions of CO2. The extensive planting of trees can contribute to offsetting a portion of the anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other radiatively active gases (RAGs). Growing plants fix atmospheric CO2 into organic carbon of their accumulating biomass, and ecological budgets suggest that substantial carbon credits can be achieved by planting large numbers of trees, in both urban and rural environments. Moreover, many additional noncarbon environmental benefits are achieved by planting trees over extensive areas. A tree-planting strategy could not, however, be practically used to offset more than a relatively small portion of the RAGs emitted through human activities. This limitation is mostly due to the immense areas of land that would have to be afforested to achieve more substantial offsets. Ultimately, effectively dealing with an anthropogenic enhancement of Earth's greenhouse effect will require a comprehensive integrated strategy, the major component of which will be reduced emissions. However, carbon offsets associated with the planting of trees will also be an important element of that integrated strategy. This review discusses issues involved in the planting of trees to offset emissions of CO2 and other RAGs. Forest-carbon offsets are discussed in the contexts of the greenhouse effect and climate change, options for reducing emissions of CO2, and the feasibility and environmental benefits of achieving CO2 offsets by extensively planting trees. Attention is paid to both carbon and noncarbon benefits, in the contexts of industrial and nonindustrial forests, both urban and rural.","Afforestation; Carbon credits; Forest-carbon offsets; Rural forest; Urban forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002933390

Although a measured attenuation correction can potentially provide an exact correction for attenuation, it introduces noise into the attenuation-corrected emission scan. Transmission smoothing reduces this noise but can introduce errors of its own. This study investigates these errors in absolute and relative quantitation and estimates their magnitude in a clinical setting. Methods: Fluorodeoxyglucose cardiac PET scans of 24 subjects were processed using measured attenuation correction with different levels of transmission smoothing. Mean activity concentrations were determined in septal, anterior and lateral regions of the left ventricle at each level of transmission smoothing. A theoretical derivation of the effects of transmission smoothing is presented, so that the observed effects could be compared with theory-based predictions. Results: In addition to the reduction of noise, transmission smoothing produced two further effects: (a) a previously unreported reduction in noise-induced bias, which is beneficial and (b) introduction of errors due to bad estimates of attenuation correction factors resulting from smoothing over regions where attenuation changes. The first effect was observed over all regions of the left ventricle, whereas the second reduced counts primarily in the lateral wall. Twenty-millimeter smoothing reduced noise-induced bias by an average of 4% (compared with 6-mm smoothing). This same smoothing caused an additional 9% decrease in the lateral wall as a result of the adjacent lung-lateral wall boundary. Conclusion: Transmission smoothing reduces both noise and noise-induced bias, but near transitions between differently attenuating media (e.g., lung-myocardial borders) may produce errors in absolute and relative quantitation. The data presented here document the magnitudes of these effects, permitting one to ensure that artifactually introduced inhomogeneities are kept small.","Cardiac studies; PET; Transmission smoothing","deoxyglucose; diagnostic agent; drug derivative; fluorine; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; article; artifact; case control study; comparative study; computer assisted emission tomography; heart; heart muscle; human; image processing; metabolism; methodology; scintiscanning; Artifacts; Case-Control Studies; Deoxyglucose; Fluorine Radioisotopes; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Heart; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Myocardium; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030115990

Grazing was estimated at 22 stations in summer and at 15 stations in winter by employing the sequential dilution technique. Nano-heterotrophic flagellates (< 20 μm) and ciliates (aloricate ciliates and tintinnids) dominated the protozooplankton assemblages along both transects. Densities in winter were, however, nearly an order of magnitude lower than in summer. Microzooplankton grazing removed between 0 and 28% (mean = 13.2%) of the initial phytoplankton stock in summer and, between 24 and 51% of the initial stock (mean = 37.6%) in winter. The potential primary production removed during summer ranged between 0 and 46% (mean = 22.0%) compared with the winter range of 56-83% (mean = 67.2%). Size selectivity grazing experiments conducted during both studies suggest that microzooplankton preferentially graze on the nano- (20-2.0 μm) and picophytoplankton (2.0-0.2 μm) size fractions. These results nave important implications for the efficiency of the carbon pump in the Southern Ocean. During summer when the larger cells dominate phytoplankton biomass, the bulk of the photosynthetically fixed carbon appears to be channelled to the meso- and macrozooplankton fractions. This results in a rapid transfer of organic carbon out of the zone of regeneration to the deep ocean via vertical migration and large faecal pellet production. During winter, however, an increase in the contribution of the smaller size fractions to total phytoplankton biomass results in a greater proportion of the photosynthetically fixed carbon being channelled to the microzooplankton fraction. The efficiency of the carbon pump is, therefore, reduced in that the transfer of carbon below the zone of regeneration is reduced as carbon is recycled mostly within the microbial loop in the upper mixed layer.","Carbon cycling; Microzooplankton grazing; Protozooplankton","Ciliophora; Mastigophora (flagellates); Tintinnidae; carbon cycle; community structure; grazing; microzooplankton; zooplankton; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030485408

Optical measurements indicate that enhancements occurring in the 630.0-nm emission line are correlated with these ionization patches. The present study examines data from the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) on the Dynamics Explorer 2 spacecraft to determine if patches can be observed optically from space. Since the FPI scanned the forward horizon, it was able to observe the vertical profile of airglow emissions associated with patches, thus giving information about the vertical structure. FPI measurements have been correlated with data from several in situ instruments on the spacecraft. These in situ measurements include electron density, atomic oxygen density, electron temperature, neutral temperature, and electron energy flux. Three polar cap patches have been detected both by the FPI and the in situ instruments. The red line emission patches are enhancements in the 630.0-nm red line in a specific altitude region which create an irregular altitude profile. The red line emission region associated with polar cap ionization patches varies from patch to patch and occurs in the altitude range from below 300 km to 400 km.",,"Atmospheric ionization; Electron density measurement; Fabry-Perot interferometers; In situ processing; Light emission; Satellites; Scanning; Temperature measurement; Atomic oxygen density; Dynamics Explorer 2 satellite; Electron energy flux; Electron temperature; In situ instruments; Neutral temperature; Oxygen red line signature; Polar cap ionization patch; Optical variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030146661

On the fresh, non-pretreated catalyst, a NO uptake can be observed without any formation of N2. Reacting the pretreated catalyst with NO + O2 leads to transient formation of N2 and CO2 with the following efficiency of the hydrocarbons: propene &gt; propane. The pretreatment in HC + NO is significantly better than in HC alone and leads to formation of nitrogen-containing species which are further decomposed into N2 and CO2, but only in the presence of O2.

Plant regenerants producing foreign PEPC were identified by Western blot analysis. Maximum PEPC activities measured in eppc and fppc plants grown in the greenhouse were doubled compared to control plants. For cppc a transgenic plant line could be selected which exhibited a fourfold increase in PEPC activity. In the presence of acetyl-CoA, a known activator of the procaryotic PEPC, a sixfold higher activity level was observed. In cppc plants grown in axenic culture PEPC activities were even higher. There was a 6-fold or 12-fold increase in the PEPC activities compared to the controls measured in the absence or presence of acetyl-CoA, respectively. Comparable results were obtained by transient expression in Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts. PEPC of C. glutamicum (PEPC C.g.) in S. tuberosum leaf extracts displays its characteristic K(m) (PEP) value. Plant growth was examined with plants showing high expression of PEPC and, moreover, with a plant cell line expressing an antisense S. tuberosum (anti- sppc) gene. In axenic culture the growth rate of a cppc plant cell line was appreciably diminished, whereas growth rates of an anti-sppc line were similar or slightly higher than in controls. Malate levels were increased in cppc plants and decreased in antisense plants. There were no significant differences in photosynthetic electron transport or steady state CO2 assimilation between control plants and transformants overexpressing PEPC C.g. or anti-sppc plants. However, a prolonged dark treatment resulted in a delayed induction of photosynthetic electron transport in plants with less PEPC. Rates of CO2 release in the dark determined after a 45 min illumination period at a high proton flux density were considerably enhanced in cppc plants and slightly diminished in anti-sppc plants. When CO2 assimilation rates were corrected for estimated rates of mitochondrial respiration in the light, the electron requirement for CO2 assimilation determined in low CO2 was slightly lower in transformants with higher PEPC, whereas transformants with decreased PEPC exhibited an appreciably elevated electron requirement. The CO2 compensation point remained unchanged in plants (cppc) with high PEPC activity, but might be increased in an antisense plant cell line. Stomatal opening was delayed in antisense plants, but was accelerated in plants overexpressing PEPC C.g. compared to the controls.",,"Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030460924

In this context, engine manufacturers have developed a number of techniques to reduce emission vehicle levels and in particular are turning their attention to the use of clean fuels. One example is the Liquid Petroleum Gas, roughly a mixture of propane and butane, which gives a benefit in terms of toxic hydrocarbons emissions and ozone formation due to its composition (mainly alcanes and olefines from C2 to C5) and CO2 emission levels. The aim of this study was to provide a quick and low cost solution for downtown emissions of motor vehicle. In order to maintain a good autonomy, the development work was focused on a dual fuel vehicle using LPG as well as gasoline. For this purpose, a RENAULT CLIO vehicle powered by a 1.4 liter single-point gasoline engine (commercially available in 1996), was chosen and the technology used for the LPG conversion was based on conventional equipments such as a gas induction system. The use of pre-heated catalyst, secondary air injection and even air gap insulated exhaust pipes were banished to ensure a low cost and reliable solution, and no engine efficiency deterioration for increasing exhaust temperature was permitted. To achieve the ULEV target, the whole LPG engine mapping was optimized on a test bed in terms of spark timing advance and equivalence ratio for the best catalytic conversion efficiency and control of exhaust temperature. On the vehicle, several catalytic layouts were tested to derive the best solution for fast light-off, high catalytic conversion and engine performances. The results after optimisation on the test bed showed almost the same engine torque curve with a loss of less than 3 % between gasoline and LPG, and a good fuel distribution cylinder to cylinder with LPG. Finally, the vehicle passes the ULEV and the corresponding European emissions levels with a significant margin using a 5 000 km aged catalyst. The study also plans a 80 000 km endurance running test on the dynamometer and a cold start (-7 °C) characterization. A specific analysis of the N2O, hydrocarbons and aldehydes emissions confirm the very low toxicity of this solution combined with an ozone reactivity of about one half the gasoline one. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air pollution; Automobile manufacture; Catalysts; Dual fuel engines; Efficiency; Equipment testing; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Ozone; Vehicles; Catalytic conversion; Catalytic conversion efficiencies; Conventional equipment; Engine manufacturers; Liquid-petroleum gas; Low cost and reliable; Secondary air injection; Substantial reduction; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072459083

Prefolding magnetizations were isolated in each case. The Late Carboniferous-Permian and early Tertiary poles lie at 64.6°N, 166.5°E, A95-6.3° and 58.1°N, 202.0°E, A95=12.7°, respectively. The Late Jurassic to early Tertiary (J3-E1) paleolatitudes of Tarim and several basins throughout central Asia are similar, yet significantly (10° to 20°) shallower than those predicted by the Eurasian apparent polar wander path. Resolving this discrepancy remains a major problem in Asian paleomagnetism. Discordance of the late Paleozoic poles from Tarim and Siberia suggest that Tarim has rotated about 30° counterclockwise with respect to Siberia since the Permian. Where paleomagnetic samples of both Late Carboniferous to Early Triassic (C3-T1) and J3-E1 ages were collected from the same area of Tarim, a great circle passes through the means of the poles and the sampling locality. This suggests that (1) only a difference in inclination (and not declination) distinguishes the two data sets, and (2) vertical axis block rotations of the C3-E1 strata occurred after E1. Although based on data of lesser quality, the mean Early to Middle Jurassic (J1-2) pole from Tarim differs significantly from the Eurasian reference pole, requiring radical tectonic solutions to resolve them. The Tarim J1-2 pole is indistinguishable from both the mean J3-E1 and C3-T1 poles.

The method uses a set of approximations for Coulomb, resonance, and overlap integrals very similar to those employed in the familiar 2-dimensional Hückel theory for the π electrons of planar conjugated hydrocarbons. The method can be adapted to heteroatomic clusters by introducing heteroatomic Coulomb integrals, (αyy = αx + hβ, where h is a parameter for heteroatom Y. In this paper, we use the 3-dimensional Hückel method to study the properties of the closo- carboranes. C2Bn-2Hn. We calibrate the method by choosing a value of the heteroatomic parameter h that distinguishes positional isomers by energy and gives them relative energies in rough agreement with those established by observation and ab initia calculations. We obtain modest improvement in matching ab initio relative energies of isomers by means of a three-parameter, first-order perturbation treatment. We use the calibrated method to evaluate various mechanisms proposed for the isomerizations of C2B4H6, C2B5H7, and C2B6H8, all of which have been observed to undergo intramolecular isomerizations. Rearrangements of C2B6H8 have been satisfactorily explained by a single-DSD (diamond-square-diamond) process. Those for C2B5H7 require at least two DSD processes, concerted, consecutive, or overlapping. Several different mechanisms have been proposed for the rearrangement of C2B4H6. In evaluating intermediate and transition state structures, the 3-dimensional Hückel method gives higher energies to those structures with a larger number of nontriangular faces, a plausible conclusion except that occasionally it is wrong. In comparison with ab initio results, the 3-dimensional Hückel method fails to give low energies for classical structures.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000416902

The most widely used 5-HT1D agonist is sumatriptan; however, this agent reportedly displays little selectivity for 5-HT1D versus 5-HT1A receptors. To identify novel serotonergic agents with enhanced 5-HT1D versus 5-HT1A selectivity, we attempted to take advantage of possible differences in the regions of bulk tolerance associated with the 5-position of the 5-HT binding sites for these two populations of receptors. Examination of a series of 5-(alkyloxy)tryptamine derivatives demonstrated that compounds with unbranched alkyl groups of up to eight carbon atoms bind with high affinity at human 5-HT1Dβ receptors (K(i) < 5 nM) but demonstrate less than 50-fold selectivity relative to 5-HT(1A) receptors. Alkyl groups longer than eight carbon atoms impart reduced affinity for 5-HT(1A) receptors whereas groups longer than nine carbon atoms lead to compounds with reduced affinity at 5- HT1Dβ receptors. 5-(Nonyloxy)tryptamine (10) represents a compound with optimal 5-HT1Dβ affinity (K(i) = 1 nM) and selectivity (>300-fold). Branching of the alkyl chain, to 5-[(7,7-dimethylheptyl)oxy]tryptamine (15), results in an agent with somewhat lower affinity (5-HT1Dβ K(i) = 2.3 nM) but with greater (i.e., 400-fold) 5-HT1D versus 5-HT1A selectivity. Replacement of the oxygen atom of 10 with a methylene group (i.e., 20), replacement of the O-proximate methylene with a carbonyl group (i.e., ester 26), or cyclization of the aminoethyl moiety to a carbazole (e.g., 34, 36) or β- carboline (i.e., 37), result in reduced affinity and/or selectivity. None of the compounds examined displayed significant selectivity for 5-HT1Dβ versus 5-HT1Dα sites; nevertheless, compounds 10 (recently shown to behave as a 5- HT1D agonist) and 15 represent the most 5-HT1D versus 5-HT1A selective agents reported to date.",,"5 (nonyloxy)tryptamine; 5 [(7,7 dimethylheptyl)oxy]tryptamine; alkyl group; carbonyl derivative; oxygen; serotonin 1A receptor; serotonin 1D receptor; serotonin derivative; sumatriptan; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; binding site; CHO cell; drug receptor binding; human; human cell; migraine; monkey; nonhuman; receptor affinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13344282760

We sought to determine whether hypoxic stimulation of neurons of the rostral ventrolateral reticular nucleus (RVL) would elevate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBP) in anaesthetized paralysed rats. 2. Microinjection of sodium cyanide (NaCN; 150-450 pmol) into the RVL rapidly (within 1-2 s), transiently dose-dependently and site-specifically elevated rCBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry, by 61.3 ± 22.1% (P &lt; 0.01), increased arterial pressure (AP; +30 ± 8 mmHg; P &lt; 0.01), and triggered a synchronized 6 Hz rhythm of EEG activity. 3. Following cervical spinal cord transection, NaCN and also dinitrophenol (DNP) significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated rCBP and synchronized the EEG; but did not elevate AP; the response to NaCN was attenuated by hyperoxia and deepening of anaesthesia. 4. Electrical stimulation of NaCN-sensitive sites in the RVL in spinalized rats increased rCBF measured autoradiographically with 14C-iodoantipyrine (Kety method) in the mid-line thalamus (by 182.3 ± 17.2%; P &lt; 0.05) and cerebral cortex (by 172.6 ± 15.6%; P &lt; 0.05) regions, respectively, directly or indirectly innervated by RVL neurons, and in the remainder of the brain. In contrast regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCGU), measured autoradiographically with 14C-2-deoxyglucose (Sokoloff method), was increased in proportion to rCBF in the mid-line thalamus (165.6 ± 17.8%, P &lt; 0.05) but was unchanged in the cortex. 5. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of NaCN-sensitive sites of RVL, while not altering resting rCBF or the elevation elicited by hypercarbia (arterial CO2 pressure, P(a,CO2) ~ 69 mmHg), reduced the vasodilatation elicited by normocapnic hypoxaemia (arterial O2 pressure, P(a,O2), ~ 27 mmHg) by 67% (P &lt; 0.01) and flattened the slope of the P(a,O2)-rCBF response curve. 6.

India's mean surface air temperature has increased significanitly about 0.4°C over the past century. Neither monsoon nor annual rainfall shows any significant trend. On average, there has been a rise in sea levels around India over recent decades, though considerable uncertainties exist in the accuracy and interpretation of the available data. Carbon emissions from the energy sector amount to 71 MT a year, equivalent to all other sectors combined. From land-use data, a marginal net sequestration of 5.25 million tonnes of carbon occurred during 1986. Following the IPCC guidelines, methane emissions from rice and livestock are estimated at 17.4 and 12.8 Tg/year, respectively. According lo recent climate model projections. India may experience a further rise in temperature of 1°C by the year 2050, about four times the rate of warming experienced over the past 100 years. A modest increase in precipitation amounts might occur. Cereals production is estimated to decrease and the nutrition security of the population-rich but land-hungry region of India might be hampered. An increase in local tropical cyclone activity may occur over the next century, posing added problems as large areas in the coastal regions have a dense population. About 70% of the electricity generation in India is from coal-based power stations. Altering this dependence significantly to reduce emissions would imply a substantial change in the present energy policy of India. There is great potential for improving energy efficiency and conservation. The adoption of cleaner coal-technologies should be considered, as must the development of renewable, non-conventional energy sources. In all cases, serious institulional barriers and resource limitations need to be addressed. The scope for carbon sequestration is limiled by land availabilily and other factors. It is argued that any response to global warming must be located firmly in the framework of sustainable development.",,"agricultural impact; agricultural implication; air temperature; climate change; cyclone activity; developing country; emission; energy policy; greenhouse gas; man-environment relations; policy implication; precipitation; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342350572

These plants were of immediate concern due to largescale production and use of phosgene at one of the sites. Even though Dow has considerable experience in the handling of chlorine, they had limited experience with phosgene in Europe. After the impact of the acquisition was assessed, a high-level transition team was appointed by the Vice President of Manufacturing in Europe to evaluate and manage risk factors in the acquired units. Safety in manufacturing was the first item on their agenda. In many cases the activities of the transition team were driven by the principles of Inherently Safer Process Design (Substitute, Minimize or Intensify, Moderate or Attenuate and finally Simplify). The net effect of the work done since acquisition is that risk exposure to the public in the adjacent village has been considerably reduced. In addition, fugitive emissions of toxic materials have been eliminated. Economic evaluation since the projects were enacted has demonstrated that many of the activities could have been justified purely on the basis of return on investment.",,"Carbon dioxide; Chemical plants; Chlorine; Codes (standards); Hazardous materials; Installation; Particulate emissions; Public risks; Risk assessment; Inherently safer concepts; Phosgene; Phosgene plant acquisition; Return on investment; Transition team; Accident prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030104228

This paper presents a framework to assess the potential soil, water, and biodiversity impacts that may result from the large-scale production of dedicated energy crops. The framework incorporates producer economic decision models with environmental models to assess changes in land use patterns and to quantify the consequent environmental impacts. Economic and policy issues that will affect decisions to produce energy crops are discussed. The framework is used to evaluate erosion and chemical runoff in two Tennessee regions. The analysis shows that production of dedicated energy crops in place of conventional crops will significantly reduce erosion and chemical runoff.","Assessment; Biomass; Biomass model; Energy crops; Environmental impacts","Biomass model; Chemical runoff; Energy crops; Biomass; Crops; Economic and social effects; Erosion; Greenhouses; Land use; Models; Runoff; Environmental impact; air quality; article; crop; decision making; energy; environmental impact assessment; erosion; greenhouse effect; land use; pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030200392

A source of geologic PM10 has been areas of the desert that were disturbed for agricultural purposes, and subsequently abandoned due to rising irrigation costs. Natural revegetation processes are very slow and only successful in occasional years. We have demonstrated successful mitigation of fugitive dust emissions, in the short term, with direct seeding of native shrub species in an exceptionally wet year. We have also demonstrated the complete failure of the same planting protocol in the same area during normal (not drought) years along with revegetation successes utilizing alternative seeding methods. We are now investigating the practice of revegetation by transplanting nursery grown seedlings of native shrub species. The goal is to develop a practice with high probability of success that can be recommended to landowners in the area, should drought periods with high particulate emissions return. Micrometeorological evaluation of plots in which seedlings of mesquite were planted is underway, providing information on planting densities and geometries, as well as on the effectiveness of these desert shrubs in reducing emissions of fugitive dust, particularly during windy periods.

The latter is located energetically below the interband luminescence and therefore does not compete with the stimulated emission.

Landscape average hydrocarbon emissions were estimated by characterizing plant species composition and foliar density at each site, identifying and characterizing NMHC emissions of the most abundant plant species, and identifying and characterizing NMHC emissions of plant species with the highest NMHC emission rates. A hand-held portable analyzer proved to be a useful tool for identifying plants with high emission rates. A branch enclosure system, with gas chromatography and flame ionization detector, was used to quantify isoprene and monoterpene emission rates. Emission rates were species-specific and several genera had both high and low emitters. At least some species with high emission rates were identified in most savanna types. High and low emitters were found on both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. Landscape average emission capacities for the five savanna types range from 0.6 to 9 mg C m-2 h-1 for isoprene and about 0.05 to 3 mg C m-2 h-1 for monoterpenes. The savanna emission rates predicted by existing global models are within the range estimated for these five savanna types.",,"biogenic emission; isoprene; monoterpene; nonmethane hydrocarbon; savanna; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030326385

New data for substrate/washcoat interaction, intumescent mat performance in dry and wet states, and high temperature strength and oxidation resistance of stainless steels, and canning techniques insensitive to tolerance stack-up are reviewed which help optimize packaging durability. Factors contributing to robustness of converter components are identified and methods to quantify their impact on design optimization are described. CERAMIC FLOW-THROUGH catalysts for diesel exhaust aftertreatment have met with much success since their Introduction in 1993. Both performance and durability requirements have been met via optimization of engine management, substrate design, washcoat formulation, catalyst selection, and packaging robustness [1, 2, 3 and 4] Further tightening of emissions regulation, notably particulate matter and NOx, and continued growth of natural gas technology will impose additional demands on converter durability due to more severe operating conditions. For example, the exhaust temperature and relative humidity will be3 significantly higher for natural gas engines and result in higher stresses and fatigue than those for diesel engines. The key objective of this paper is to review new advances in packaging design which have a great bearing on converter durability. Indeed, such advances have been instrumental in meeting the 100K mile durability requirement for automotive catalysts [5,6], while at the same time they have helped enhance the durability of motorcycle catalysts [7,8]. More recently, robust packaging designs have proven their effectiveness in close-coupled light-off applications with much more demanding operating conditions [9, 10 and 11]. Specifically, the paper will focus on substrate/washcoat interaction as it impacts the mechanical and thermal properties which, in turn, bear heavily on converter durability. Next, the variation of mount density and mounting pressure on ceramic substrate is examined as a function of canning technique. Such variation can have an adverse effect on both the mat integrity and substrate durability. Factors responsible for variation of mount density and ways to minimize it are discussed. Performance trade-offs associated with the cell geometry of diesel oxidation catalyst support are also addressed. Finally, the value of the axial push-out test on fresh and aged converters, as a quality control test, is demonstrated by examining changes in mounting pressure with aging. In this manner, packaging durability may be ascertained by requiring the push-out force to meet a certain minimum value even after aging. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalysts; Ceramic materials; Diesel engines; Durability; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Mountings; Natural gas; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Packaging; Packaging machines; Automotive catalysts; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Emissions regulations; High temperature strength; Mechanical and thermal properties; Natural Gas Technology; Performance trade-off; Quality control tests; Chip scale packages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072416743

High permeability aquifers are not necessarily required for CO2 disposal. Injectivity of CO2 can be maximized by siting disposal wells in targeted or ""sweet"" zones of locally high permeability surrounded by a low regional scale permeability [1-2]. The low regional permeability forms a ""hydrodynamic"" or ""time"" trap for CO2 [1], where the residence time of CO2 in the aquifer is of the order of 105 to 106 years. Another type of hydrodynamic trapping in sedimentary basins is produced by the ""sponge"" or ""sink"" effect of rebounding shales [3-4]. On a smaller time scale, over hundreds of years, ""mineral"" or ""inert"" trapping [5-6] by reaction of the CO2 with basic aluminosilicate minerals will occur in siliciclastic aquifers. Consequently, stratigraphic traps may not be necessary for safe disposal of CO2 in the subsurface. Aquifer disposal of CO2 is expensive, on the order of $52/tonne. Although there are many possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions that are more economically attractive, aquifer disposal remains as one of the largest sinks available for CO2 in landlocked areas of the world; and may be utilized if other less expensive options are exhausted.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000081021

In some but not all studies the analgesic properties of N2O can be attenuated by opiate receptor antagonists. The purported mechanism for the opiate antagonistic effect relates to the finding that N2O increases supraisal levels of endogenous opiates, although this finding has been disputed. Based on the observations that (1) N2O promotes the release of catecholamines, including the endogenous α2 adrenergic agonist norepinephrine, and (2) that descending noradrenergic inhibitory pathways are activated by opioid analgesics, this study sought to determine whether α2 adrenergic receptors are involved in the antinociceptive action of nitrous oxide. Methods: Institutional approval was obtained for the study. Rats breathed 70% N2O and 30% O2 in an enclosed chamber. After a 30-min exposure, significant antinociception was indicated by an increase in the latency response to a noxious stimulus (tail-flick latency). The tail-Flick latency was tested in rats exposed to 70% N2O after either systemic or regional (intrathecal or intracerebroventricular) injections with either competitive (atipamezole; yohimbine) or noncompetitive (N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline) α2 adrenoceptor antagonists, or the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone. Results: When administered systematically, both the opiate (naloxone) and α2 adrenoceptor antagonists (atipamezole, yohimbine, and N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2- dihydroquinoline) blocked the enhanced tail-flick latency response to N2O. Naloxone administered intracerebroventricularly, but not intrathecally, blocked the enhanced tail-flick latency response to N2O. Conversely, atipamezole administered intrathecally but not intracerebroventricularly, blocked the enhanced tail-flick latency response to N2O. Conclusions: These data suggest that both supraspinal opiate and spinal α2 adrenoceptors play a mediating role in the antinociceptive response to N2O in rats. A possible mechanism may involve a descending inhibitory noradrenergic pathway that may be activated by opiate receptors in the periaqueductal gray region of the brain stem in rat after exposure to N2O.","Alpha 2; Analgesic; Nitrous oxide receptors; Opiate adrenergic receptors","2 ethoxy 1(2h) quinolinecarboxylic acid ethyl ester; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor; atipamezole; nitrous oxide; opiate receptor; yohimbine; anesthesia induction; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antinociception; article; catecholamine blood level; catecholamine release; dose response; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; receptor binding; spinal anesthesia; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Analgesics; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Animals; Imidazoles; Male; Naloxone; Narcotic Antagonists; Nitrous Oxide; Nociceptors; Quinolines; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2; Receptors, Opioid; Spinal Cord; Yohimbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029858303

The old practice of direct landfilling and storage is receiving greater public resistance and is attributing to the search for alternative disposal methods. The ever-growing problem of solid wastes requires environmentally benign and good public acceptance for the safe and ultimate disposal of the various kinds of solid wastes. Incineration and various kinds of mass burn-type systems have been used to reduce the volume and mass of the wastes, which can be characterized by their operational temperature. In all types of incineration systems, different kinds of gas clean-up devices are used to meet the local, state, and federal regulations for the ga.ies before being released into the environment. A major concern over these systems have been in the by-products produced from these systems during their normal design and off-design point of operation. Indeed, the by-products generated from some incineration systems, under certain operational conditions, can he a health hazard and the solid residue may be leachable. Recent trends in advanced thermal destruction systems are described which can destroy the solid waste to the molecular level. Advanced systems can be designed to meet almost any emission standards. The use of oxygen enriched air in place of air for the combustion of gases released from the solid waste reduces the amount of effluent gas, and, hence, the reduced size and cost of the gas clean-up system. The use of an excess enthalpy system offers attractive benefits in which the energy released from the waste is recycled back into the system under controlled conditions with the final desired objectives of reduced emissions, higher efficiency, and lower costs. Thermal destruction of solid wastes using advanced techniques makes good technical, environmental, economical, and human health and safety. The issues concerning recyclability, life cycle integration, and health effects from incineration are only expected to grow in the future. © 1996 by ASME.",,"Combustion; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Health hazards; Laws and legislation; Management; Plasma applications; Solids; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Excess enthalpy system; Gas clean up; Life cycle integration; Molecular level; Plasma assisted advanced thermal destruction; Thermal destruction; Waste volume reduction; Wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030242957

For a given scenario of surface sources and corresponding δ13C values of individual CH4 sources, the KIE due to soil uptake enriched δ13C by 1.18‰ in the model's northern hemisphere (NH) (40°N) and 1.16‰ in the southern hemisphere (SH) (40°S) under steady state conditions in January. The KIE due to CH4 oxidation by stratospheric Cl radicals further enriched these δ13C values at the surface by 0.99‰ and 1.03‰, respectively. In the vertical direction, during January at 50°N, inclusion of a KIE due to Cl enriched δ13C at 18 km by 0.95‰ compared to the corresponding surface value, whereas the enrichment was only 0.31‰ when this KIE was omitted. These results suggest that modeling of δ13C distributions should include KIEs due to CH4 oxidation by soil and stratospheric chlorine radicals. It is shown that possible oxidation of CH4 in marine boundary layer by Cl radicals can significantly enrich δ13C. However, if a recent theoretical value for the KIE of the Cl and CH4 reaction is correct, then the impact of this reaction is less than the figures quoted above. In the model, monthly variations in OH concentration and interhemispheric exchange transport cannot reproduce the observed seasonal amplitude variation of δ13C in either the NH or SH. It is argued that seasonal variations in individual CH4 fluxes are primarily responsible for this discrepancy. We show that increasing Cl radical concentrations due to continued release of anthropogenic chlorocarbons enrich the δ13C values. The effects of an increase in tropospheric OH concentration due to stratospheric ozone depletion and a cooling of the troposphere due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, with a lowering of water vapor concentration and reduction in isoprene emissions, on δ13C and surface CH4 mixing ratios are investigated. Other model simulations with adjusted surface CH4 fluxes have been performed to study the postulated explanations for recent changes in CH4 surface mixing ratios and δ13C values.

Elected officials and citizens in Maryland were drawn into the fray as surrounding states, which historically operated test-and-repair programs, struggled to balance local pressures with federal requirements. New federal regulatory 'flexibility' on I/M came after Maryland had made large capital investments and built new inspection stations, forcing the State to defend stricter I/M program while other states appeared to be doing much less. Citizens logged complaint letters logged by the hundreds, circulated petitions to wipe out the I/M program altogether, and encouraged dozens of legislators to support bills to change Maryland's I/M law.

For concentrations that were about 3 orders of magnitude less, emissions were negligible.","Chlorinated hydrocarbons; Mass flux; Mass transfer coefficients; Sewage; Sewer gas; VOC; VOC-emission; Volatilization","Chlorination; Hydrocarbons; Mass transfer; Sewage; Volatile organic compounds; Mass flux; Mass transfer coefficients; Sewer gas; Volatilization; Sewers; alkane; aromatic compound; chlorinated hydrocarbon; chloroform; tetrachloroethylene; trichloroethylene; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; city; pollution transport; sewage; volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029827609

Unfortunately, mechanisms which control the temporal pattern of laminations in this basin are poorly understood. In addition, this laminated sediment record has been underutilized in paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic studies. In an attempt to identify mechanisms which control lamination formation and in order to obtain paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic records from this region, a sediment core from this basin was analysed using a suite of geochemical, sedimentary, and micropaleontologic techniques. This box-core (core DOE 26) was collected from the centre of the basin and was vertically sub-sampled at one millimetre increments, providing a temporal resolution of 1-3 years per sample. A variety of paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic records were constructed via analysis of these samples and include proxy records of: (a) regional rainfall - as expressed by gross variations in downcore density profiles; (b) relative contribution of terrestrial and marine organic carbon to the basin - as expressed by downcore variations in the isotopic composition of total organic carbon (TOC); © Primary productivity - as expressed in downcore variations in the carbon isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera; (d) changes in sea surface temperatures - reflected in downcore variations in the oxygen isotopic composition of N. pachyderma (dextral); (e) large-scale changes in bottom-water oxygen conditions - as expressed by downcore changes in abundance of oxygen- sensitive benthic foraminifera. To extract additional information from these proxy records, spectral analysis was also employed in this study. Although ENSO-length signals are present in several records, decadal-length signals appear to dominate records from this basin. This dominance suggests the presence of a longer-term forcing function (other than the ENSO phenomena) which strongly influences this region. Considered together, preliminary results suggest that the flux of organic carbon is a dominant factor affecting lamination variability in Santa Monica Basin. Organic carbon fluxes in this basin are mainly affected by primary productivity, and to a lesser extent, by terrestrial input. Variations in bottom oxygen conditions may not control lamination variability; rather, long-term depression of oxygen levels appears to allow preservation of this organic matter as laminated sediments. © 1996 The Geological Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053377699

One important contribution of this study is to highlight the importance of considering transition issues in assessing the cost of alternative fuels. A second contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how the cost-effectiveness of methanol and M85 depends on how a methanol-based strategy is implemented. The analysis of the costs and effectiveness of methanol and gasoline leads to the following conclusions: (1) transition issues are critical in evaluating the cost and cost-effectiveness of methanol-based fuels; (2) M85 and M100 are likely to be expensive relative to conventional gasoline, particularly in the near term and short term; (3) cost-effectiveness varies dramatically by region, with Los Angeles and New York substantially better than Houston; and (4) widespread introduction of methanol is not likely to be a cost-effective approach for improving urban air quality. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27144537816

Until recently, NOx emissions from biogenic sources in soils were not considered in simulations of air quality and emissions reductions scenarios, yet they may be significant, especially in agricultural regions where nitrogen fertilizers are applied. Soil NOx is produced primarily by microbial processes; production and emissions from soils are controlled by a suite of environmental variables, including inorganic nitrogen availability, water-filled pore space, and soil temperature. Agricultural management practices such as fertilization and irrigation affect these environmental variables and thus have the potential to dramatically alter soil NOx emissions. Although current models incorporate some of these variables, accurate regional estimation of soil NOx emissions requires modeling approaches that explicitly incorporate the spatial and temporal patterns of management practices, especially fertilization, as well as other environmental controlling variables such as water-filled pore space and soil temperature.","Agricultural management; Biogenic nitric oxide; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen cycling; Tropospheric ozone","Agriculture; Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Soils; Agricultural management; Biogenic nitric oxide; Nitrogen fertilizer; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030406314

In order to understand the mechanism of emissions reduction, multidimensional computations were carried out for a heavy-duty diesel engine with multiple injections. Different injection schemes were considered, and the predicted cylinder pressure, heat release rate and soot and NOx emissions were compared with measured data. Excellent agreements between predictions and measurements were achieved after improvements in the models were made. The improvements include using a RNG k-ε turbulence model, adopting a new wall heat transfer model and introducing the nozzle discharge coefficient to account for the contraction of fuel jet at the nozzle exit. The present computations confirm that split injection allows significant soot reduction with out a NOx penalty. Based on the computations, it is found that multiple injections have a similar NOx reduction mechanism as single injections with retarded injection timings. Regarding soot reduction, it is shown that reduced soot formation is due to the fact that the soot producing rich regions at the spray tip are not replenished when the injection is terminated and then restarted. With split injections, the subsequently injected fuel burns rapidly and does not contribute significantly to soot production. The present work also demonstrates the usefulness of multidimensional modeling of diesel combustion to reveal combustion mechanisms and to provide design insights for low emission engines. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Combustion; Dust; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Fuel injection; Gas emissions; Heat transfer; Nitrogen oxides; Nozzles; Soot; Turbulence models; Combustion mechanism; Discharge coefficients; Emissions reduction; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Heavy-duty diesel engine; Low emission engines; Multi-dimensional model; Single-pulse injection; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072413799

To assure a fair comparison, the models were run on the same domain and grid size, with the same inputs of source emissions, diagnostic meteorology, and initial and boundary conditions. In addition, UAM-V was run in nested-grid mode with input meteorology taken from a prognostic model (CALRAMS), and UAM-IV was run in regulatory mode with boundary conditions taken from ROM. Little difference was found between the UAM-IV and UAM-V daily peak ozone predictions, which showed mean relative biases of ± 5 to 10%. The use of diagnostic vs prognostic meteorological model inputs had little effect on UAM-V performance statistics, although the spatial location of the broad regional ozone plume was better with the prognostic meteorological model. The ROM/UAM-IV couple tended to consistently underpredict peak ozone by about 20%, primarily due to ROM underpredictions of ozone on the upwind domain boundaries. It was found that all models tended to underpredict ozone precursors (VOCs and NO(χ)) by as much as a factor of two, although the UAM-V underpredictions were not as large. Furthermore, all models consistently underpredicted ozone and precursors at large distances (200-500 km) from the source regions, where relatively high ozone concentrations (150-180 ppb) were sometimes observed. The relative responses of the models to 50% reductions in anthropogenic VOC and NO(χ) emissions were also evaluated. The directions and magnitudes of the predicted ozone changes were roughly consistent for the models. The best agreement occurred for the 50% anthropogenic VOC emissions reductions, where all models predicted about a 15% decrease in peak ozone concentrations. When a 50% anthropogenic NO(χ) emissions reduction was imposed, UAM-IV and UAM-V/CALRAMS predicted about a 3 or 4% increase in peak ozone concentration and UAM-V/CALMET and the ROM/UAM-IV couple predicted about a 5-20% increase in peak ozone.","Effects of emissions controls; Model evaluation; Photochemical grid models","nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; article; data analysis; lake; meteorology; model; photochemistry; prediction; priority journal; United States; Air pollution control; Boundary conditions; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Standards; Diagnostic meteorology; Initial conditions; Photochemical grid models; Air quality; LMOS; model evaluation; nitrous oxide; photochemical grid model; ROM/UAM-IV; UAM-IV; VOC; USA, Great Lakes, Lake Michigan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030251165

The approach highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to altered environmental conditions. The mechanistic nature of the models allows some confidence to be placed in the results that are produced under climate change scenarios. Two crop models have been constructed and applied across a large European region: EuroWheat (winter wheat) and EuroSunfl (sunflower). Model results were compared with observed phenology and yield across a variety of scales and found to capture the current spatial variability in wheat and sunflower productivity. Climate change scenarios from both equilibrium and transient general circulation model experiments were applied to each crop model. Wheat yields are predicted to increase throughout Europe for all climate change scenarios. Conversely, water-limited sunflower yields decrease in most regions and scenarios. More positive effects are predicted for winter wheat than sunflower due to a lower sensitivity to increased temperature and a higher sensitivity to elevated concentrations of CO2 The lowest yield increases for wheat and the largest yield decreases for sunflower are found in western Europe, whilst the most positive responses for both crops occur in central and eastern Europe. Predictions for southern Europe are highly sensitive both within the region and between the scenarios. The old generation of equilibrium climate change scenarios gives the worst predictions (lowest yield increases or highest yield decreases). More beneficial responses are observed for the new generation of transient scenarios for both wheat and sunflower. Area averaged results for Europe, based on the United Kingdom Meterorological Office transient experiment (UKTR), indicate a rate of increase in winter wheat yields of 0.2 t ha-1 decade-1 up to the 2020s and 0.361 ha-1 decade-1 beyond.

In a flow cytometric study, we examined the effect of bicarbonate on boar spermatozoa using merocyanine, an impermeant lipophilic probe which binds to plasma membranes with increasing affinity as their lipid components become more disordered. We found that bicarbonate causes a rapid increase in the ability of live boar spermatozoa to bind merocyanine. First detected about 100 sec after exposure to bicarbonate and largely complete by 300 sec, this increase appears to result from individual cells within the sperm population switching from a low merocyanine-binding state to a high binding state. The majority of live spermatozoa are capable of responding in this way, and do so in proportion to bicarbonate concentration, half-maximal response being induced by about 3 mM bicarbonate; however, overall population response varies greatly between ejaculates. Increased merocyanine stainability is observed over the whole surface area of the cell, and is reversible both with respect to temperature (it is only manifested above 30°C) and with respect to presence of bicarbonate. A similar effect can be induced by phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as isobutylmethylxanthine, and enhanced by a permeant cyclic nucleotide analogue.

However, our understanding of it is still far from satisfactory. Several factors conspire to obfuscate studies of capacitation mechanisms: the inherent functional heterogeneity of sperm populations, the range of functions used as parameters of capacitation (whence the endpoint of the process has become conceptually uncertain), and the several profound differences between model in vitro fertilization (IVF) systems and the situation in vivo in the female reproductive tract. Recent investigations in the author's laboratory have shown that bicarbonate/CO2, an essential component for successful IVF, causes rapid changes in lipid architecture of the sperm plasma membrane and slower changes in surface coating. These changes are accompanied by membrane destabilization and cell death. Evidence suggests that bicarbonate's actions are mediated through cyclic nucleotide signalling. Of particular note is the heterogeneity in rate of response to bicarbonate shown by individual cells in the sperm populations. Taken together with other observations, the findings suggest that capacitation is a series of positive destabilizing events that eventually lead to cell death. The 'capacitated' state would then be a window of destabilization within which spermatozoa can undergo a zona-induced acrosome reaction and display hyperactivated motility. Further along the destabilization pathway, spontaneous acrosome reactions would occur before total membrane degeneration. In vivo, capacitation would be a conflict between destabilization and sperm survival. Concentrations of bicarbonate are maintained low in the cauda epididymidis, where sperm survive for long periods, and one may speculate that hormonal control of local bicarbonate/CO2 in oviducal 'storage' sites in the female tract could allow 'safe' sequestering of live spermatozoa until around the time of ovulation; the environment may then change to produce a 'capacitating' effect, whence, due to the inherent functional heterogeneity of the sequestered population, small numbers of capacitated spermatozoa are released sequentially. In this way, a succession of spermatozoa in the correct physiological state may be provided for the freshly ovulated egg.",,"bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; cyclic nucleotide; lipid; acrosome reaction; animal cell; cell death; cell membrane; conference paper; epididymis tail; female genital system; fertilization; fertilization in vitro; hormonal regulation; male; mammal; nonhuman; ovulation; seminal plasma; signal transduction; sperm preservation; spermatozoon; spermatozoon capacitation; spermatozoon motility; survival; Animalia; Eutheria; Mammalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029849116

M5S 3G3, Canada","This paper is Part II of a two-part series in which the risks associated with unrestrained greenhouse-gas emissions, and with measures to limit emissions, are reviewed. A sustained limitation of global CO2 emissions requires global population stabilization, a reduction in per capita emissions in the developed world, and a limitation of the increase in per capita emissions in the developing world. Reducing or limiting per capita emissions requires a major effort to improve the efficiency with which energy is transformed and used; urban development which minimizes the need for the private automobile and facilitates district heating, cooling, and cogeneration systems; and accelerated development of renewable energy. The following risks associated with these efforts to limit CO2 emissions are reviewed here: (i) resources might be diverted from other urgent needs; (ii) economic growth might be reduced; (iii) reduction measures might cost more than expected; (iv) early action might cost more than later action; (v) reduction measures might have undesired side effects; (vi) reduction measures might require heavy-handed government intervention; and (vii) reduction measures might not work. With gradual implementation of a diversified portfolio of measures, these risks can be greatly reduced. Net risk is further reduced by the fact that a number of non-climatic benefits would result from measures to limit CO2 emissions. Based on the review of risks associated with measures to limit emissions here, and the review of the risks associated with unrestrained emissions presented in Part I, it is concluded that a reasonable near-term (20-30 year) risk hedging strategy is one which seeks to stabilize global fossil CO2 emissions at the present (early 1990's) level. This in turn implies an emission reduction of 26% for industrialized countries as a whole and 40-50% for Canada and the USA if developing country emissions are to increase by no more than 60%, which in itself would require major assistance from the industrialized countries. The effectiveness of global CO2-emission stabilization in slowing down the buildup of atmospheric CO2 is enhanced by the fact that the airborne fraction (ratio of annual atmospheric CO2 increase to total annual anthropogenic emissions) decreases if emissions are stabilized, whereas it increases if emissions continue to grow exponentially. The framework and conclusions presented here are critically compared with so-called optimization frameworks.",,"air pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emissions; climate change; emission; global strategy; greenhouse gas; hedging; policy making; pollution policy; risk assessment; risk hedging",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660607

Given the existence of reducible uncertainties in estimating these risks, and the possibility that an emission target thought to minimize total risk is later found to be not strict enough, a risk-hedging strategy is a more realistic policy objective. This paper is Part I of a two-part series in which these risks are reviewed and an interim risk-hedging emission level is proposed. Here, the risks associated with unrestrained greenhouse-gas emissions are reviewed. In particular, the carbon-cycle response to continuing CO2 emissions; the heat trapping of projected greenhouse gas increases in comparison to other anthropogenic and natural heating or cooling perturbations; the climatic response to heating perturbations; and the impacts of projected climatic change on global agriculture, forests, coastal regions, coral reefs, water resources, terrestrial species, stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, and human comfort and welfare are critically examined. It is concluded that unrestrained emissions of greenhouse gases pose real and substantial risks to human societies and to ecosystems, and that these risks are likely to grow substantially if the climate warms beyond that associated with a CO2 doubling. These risks clearly justify some action to limit emissions. The magnitude of emission restraint that is justified depends not only on the risks reviewed here, but also on the risks associated with measures to limit greenhouse-gas emissions, which are reviewed in Part II.",,"Anthozoa; Anthozoa; air pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emissions; climate change; emission; global strategy; greenhouse gas; hedging; policy making; pollution policy; risk assessment; risk hedging",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660606

The structure and complexity of the models vary and often depends on the scope of the applications. For example long term (monthly and annual) operational models require much simpler formulations short term episodic models in order to be applicable on todays computers. The models participating in this intercomparison study cover this broad range of model formulation as the EMEP acidity/oxidant models (MSCW, Oslo) are one-layer Lagrangian concepts, whereas the EURAD model (University of Cologne), the LOTOS (TNO, Delft) and the REM3 model (FU Berlin) are multi-level Eulerian formulations. In analyzing the results from these models for an episode in July 1990 it is possible to investigate a possible improvement in model performance as a result of a more refined description of important processes. Another important aspect of this intercomparison is the investigation of the emission reduction response obtained from the models when certain reduction scenarios are applied. Among the general findings of this comparison are: ozone is predicted reasonable by all models although frontal processes affecting the ozone fields seem to be a problem for two models. The partitioning among the N-species is very different in the models and specially for PAN there is even no common daily variation. The sensitivity of the models to emission reductions is strongly dependent on the ozone level itself and seems to be highest for the most comprehensive model.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Gas emissions; Ozone; Air quality models; Europe; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030312868

Clones of these species formed the ground cover in nine 0.7 m2 model ecosystems with 5-year-old Picea abies trees (leaf area index of approx. 2.2). Communities grew on natural forest soil in a simulated montane climate. Independently of N deposition, the rate of light-saturated net photosynthesis of leaves grown and measured at 420 μl CO2 l-1 was higher in Oxalis and in Homogyne, but was not significantly different in Rubus compared to leaves grown and measured at the pre-industrial CO2 concentration of 280 μl l-1. Remarkably, further CO2 enrichment to 560 μl l-1 caused no additional increase of CO2 uptake. With increasing CO2 supply concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates in leaves increased and N concentrations decreased in all species, whereas N deposition had no significant effect on these traits. Above-ground biomass and leaf area production were not significantly affected by elevated CO2 in the more vigorously growing species O. acetosella and R. hirtus, but the ""slow growing"" H. alpina produced almost twice as much biomass and 50% more leaf area per plant under 420 μl CO2 l-1 compared to 280 μl l-1 (again no further stimulation at 560 μl l-1). In contrast, increased N addition stimulated growth in Oxalis and Rubus but had no effect on Homogyne. In Oxalis (only) biomass per plant was positively correlated with microhabitat quantum flux density at low CO2, but not at high CO2 indicating carbon saturation. On the other hand, the less shade-tolerant Homogyne profited from CO, enrichment at all understory light levels facilitating its spread into more shady micro-habitats under elevated CO2.

The X-ray spectrum was well fitted with an absorbed power-law plus iron K emission-line model, in which no significant reflection component was required. Using ASCA data we confirmed the previous detection of extra soft X-ray emission and a K-shell emission line from ""cold"" iron in the simple absorbed power-law spectrum. For the first time we detected a K-shell absorption edge of ""cold"" iron. This edge feature, combined with the Ginga results, indicates that the reflection process is not dominant in NGC 2110.

It was found that the fluorescence of surface-attached CB groups is quite different from that of corresponding solutions. A marked red shift was observed at the interface of a quartz plate and a nonpolar solvent like cyclohexane, reflecting a polar microenvironment surrounding the fluorophore residues owing to surface silanols and/or adsorbed water molecules, and a new fluorescent band possibly ascribable to an excimer of CB was also observed on the silica surface in cyclohexane. In contrast to these, the fluorescence from CB units bound on a quartz plate wetted with a nonpolar nematic liquid crystal showed that its red shift was much reduced and the emission band in the longer wavelength region was not observed. On the contrary, no alteration of the fluorescence of a pyrene photoprobe covalently attached to a silica surface was induced by contact with a nematic liquid crystal.

Understanding personal exposures, particularly to susceptible groups, is important in interpreting results of those studies and drawing inferences about concentration-response relationships. PM epidemiological studies assume that environmental exposures can be adequately characterized by ambient concentrations measured at fixed-site community monitors. Concentrations measured by personal exposure monitors (PEMs), however, may not correlate well with PM measured by community monitors, nor do exposures of subjects wearing PEMs necessarily reflect personal exposures of the most susceptible groups (e.g., elderly persons with respiratory illness or children). This paper describes initial development of a methodology for estimating PM personal exposure. The methodology incorporates an indoor air quality model to calculate PM levels indoors, accounting for PM infiltration from outdoors and PM emitted by indoor sources. A range of microenvironments is considered, including different building types (e.g., typical and energy-efficient) and configurations (e.g., windows open, windows closed, and air conditioned). Results are presented describing the effect of building type and configuration differences and indoor sources on personal exposure. The relative effectiveness of reductions in emissions from outdoor and indoor sources in reducing PM personal exposure is compared, with implications for the setting of PM NAAQS discussed.",,"Calculations; Epidemiology; Estimation; Health risks; Mathematical models; Particles (particulate matter); Air quality model; Airborne particulate matter; Emission control; Health effects; Personal exposure monitors; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030315361

Two short-term (4 and 3 day) deployments of free-floating sediment traps were combined with water column sampling and rate process measurements as the ship followed the traps. For a period of 36 h between trap deployments, a hydrographic section was run along 31°30'N as part of a larger scale survey being carried out simultaneously on the R.V.A. von Humboldt. The first trap deployment was near the eastern margin of the eddy and the traps moved to the north and west in a frontal jet associated with its northern boundary. After the second deployment, which was at the recovery point of the first, the traps moved to the west and then to the southwest. Throughout the study, chlorophyll concentrations varied between 27 and 125 mg m-2 (0-100 m), with highest concentrations in the upwelled water nearest the coast and in upwelled water generated within the cyclonic eddy. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) concentrations were relatively uniform (13.6±1.8 and 1.63±0.28 g m-2), with phytoplankton carbon accounting for 16-85% of total POC. Bacterial carbon was ~5% of total POC and mesozooplankton carbon concentrations were equivalent to ~9% of total POC. Microzooplankton biomass was not assessed but POC:PON ratios in the water column were often high, suggesting there was sometimes a large detrital component in the POC. Primary production rates varied between 1.0 and 2.5 g C m-2day-1. Bacterial consumption accounted for ~50% of primary production. Metabolic rates suggested that copepods were ingesting more than 0.4 g C m-2day-1 while filtration rates suggested that ingestion of phytoplankton carbon was only ~0.2 g C m-2day-1, even when phytoplankton constituted ~85% of the POC.f-ratios (based on uptake rates for 15N-nitrate and ammonia) were between 0.1 and 0.4, and excretion by mesozooplankton could account for ~40% of the daily ammonium uptake by phytoplankton. HPLC pigment analysis showed that when chlorophyll biomass was high, diatoms were dominant, whereas when it was low, small prymnesiophytes, chlorophytes and diatoms were all important. The composition of the fluorescent pigments in material in the sediment traps indicated that intact phytoplankton and copepod faecal pellets were the main sources but the relative rates of sedimentation of pigment, POC and PON for the two trapping periods did not reflect differences that were observed in the overlying water column. This was likely to be the result of spatial heterogeneity and strong horizontal currents within the euphotic zone. Thus, material collected at 100 m probably did not originate in the water column immediately overlying the traps and trapping efficiencies might also have been variable.",,"carbon cycle; carbon flux; flux; plankton; upwelling; Atlantic, (Northeast)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030292185

The Marine Corps performed a study to identify potential base contribution to this non-attainment problem. The objectives of this investigation included development of a proactive particulate matter emissions management strategy and preparation for potential base realignment. In order to meet these study objectives, several tasks were performed. Both current and potential regulations and air permitting requirements for potential new sources were identified. Existing ambient particulate matter and wind data were obtained and analyzed, but it was determined that current monitoring locations were not adequate to resolve the emissions contribution of the MCAGCC. A PM10 emission inventory was developed, including research to identify appropriate emission factors. Inventoried source types included desert training exercises involving both ground vehicles and aircraft, ordnance disposal, abrasive blasting and welding, a landfill, and both paved road and unpaved road/open area travel. The highest uncertainties associated with the emission inventory were associated with uncommon source types (tanks, helicopters, ordnance), insufficient operations data, and emissions from wind erosion. Abatement measures were evaluated for feasibility and cost-effectiveness for control of PM10 emissions. The evaluation focused on measures to control fugitive dust from traffic on unpaved areas since this source category dominated the inventory. As a result of this investigation, the MCAGCC is working closely with local, state, and federal regulatory agencies regarding this issues. Additional PM10 modeling and monitoring are being done in order to evaluate potential redesignation of the area. Some voluntary control measures have been implemented such as narrowing the main supply routes and surface modification (wood chips, crushed rock, revegetation, etc.) of some unpaved areas.",,"Air quality; Dust abatement; Laws and legislation; Monitoring; Standards; Emission inventory; Marine corps air ground combat center; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17344380907

With an electrical capacity of 116 MW and a thermal capacity of 110 MW, the Linz-Sued district heating plant covers the rapidly growing heat demand of the city of Linz (the heat generated is adequate for 20,000 dwellings) while also increasing the own power generation quota of the ESG from 35 to 80%. Equipped with latest technology and first-rate environmental installations, the Linz-Sued plant-based on a steam/gas combi-process-achieves degrees of efficiency up to 86% and negligible emissions. For example, the legal border value for NOx is undercut by the factor 10. The chosen fuel natural gas ensures SO2-free flue gases and low CO2 emission in comparison with other fossil fuels. Thanks to Linz-Sued, the extension of district heating in the city can be accelerated and thus a considerable potential for the reduction of emissions from individual heating systems (by switching to district heat) can be realized. This applies especially to CO2 emissions, but also to those of NOx, CO, SO2, CxHy, dust and heavy metals. The use of environment-friendly and highly efficient cogeneration for power generation also leads to a substantial reduction in pollutants, especially CO2. Surveys show that the year-round operation of the plant is justified, not only from an economic but also from an ecological viewpoint. Due to the accelerated extension of district heating and the extensive use of cogeneration, the ESG will not just reach the CO2 reduction goal of Toronto, but undercut it by 100%.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Combined cycle power plants; Ecology; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; District heating accelerated extension; District heating plant; Emission reduction; Heat demand; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030172554

This could be achieved by, inter alia, incorporating climate change risk assessment into development planning processes i.e. relating climatic change to issues of habitability and sustainability. Adaptation is an ubiquitous and beneficial natural and human strategy. Future adaptation (or, better, adjustment) to climate is inevitable at the least to decrease the vulnerability to current climatic impacts. The urgent issue is the mismatch between the predictions of global climatic change and the need for information on local to regional change in order to develop adaptation strategies. Mitigation efforts are essential since the more successful mitigation activities are, the less need there will be for adaptation responses. Moreover, mitigation responses can be global (e.g. a uniform percentage reduction in greenhouse gas emissions) while adaptation responses will be local to regional in character and therefore depend upon confident predictions of regional climatic change. The dilemma facing policymakers is that scientists have considerable confidence in likely global climatic changes but virtually zero confidence in regional changes. Mitigation and adaptation strategies relevant to climatic change can most usefully be developed in the context of sound understanding of climate, especially the near-surface continental climate, permitting discussion of societally relevant issues. Unfortunately, climate models cannot yet deliver this type of regionally and locationally specific prediction and some aspects of current research even seem to indicate increased uncertainty. These topics are explored in this paper using the specific example of the prediction of land-surface climate changes. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Climate modelling; Global mitigation; Greenhouse gas emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000381845

Well-watered plants of these yemenitic species, which are found primarily with other succulents at altitudes up to 2 600 m, exhibit a nocturnal accumulation of malic acid, and, to a much smaller extent, citric acid as well as night-time CO2 uptake under controlled-environment conditions. While the semi-succulent P. cyrpiculoides utilises the CAM-cycling mode, the semi-succulent species, P. barbatus, P. purpuratus, P. zatarhendi, and P. zatarhendi var. tomentosus, are typical C3 plants. Thus, the ability to perform CAM was well correlated with succulence. Neither CAM nor succulence was, however, directly related to maximum dessication resistance in these species. Increasing day-time temperatures from 20 to 35 °C reduces net daily carbon gain in all, leading to CO2 losses in most of the C3 species. In the CAM species, nocturnal CO2 uptake in succulent plant communities in high mountain habitats (up to 3 000 m), was also relatively insensitive to high day-time temperatures. This is the first extensive description of CAM and CAM-cycling in the Lamiaceae. The presence of CAM in Plectranthus correlated with habitat aridity in situ.","C3; CAM; CAM cycling; Lamiaceae; mode of photosynthesis; Plectranthus; succulence","Lamiaceae; Magnoliophyta; Plectranthus; Plectranthus; Plectranthus barbatus; Plectranthus hadiensis; Plectranthus marrubioides; Plectranthus purpuratus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030461881

Conceptually, this is a direct evolution of more traditional techniques in synoptic climatology; however, the downscaling approach was developed specifically to address present needs in global environmental change research, and the need for more detailed temporal and spatial information from Global Climate Models (GCMs). Two general categories exist for downscaling techniques: process based techniques focused on nested models, and empirical techniques using one form or another of transfer function between scales. While in the long term nested models hold the greatest promise for regional-scale analysis, this approach is still in development, requires detailed surface climate data, and is dependent on high end computer availability. Conversely, empirical relationships offer a more immediate solution and significantly lower computing requirements, consequently offering an approach that can be rapidly adopted by a wider community of scientists. In this paper, an application of empirical downscaling of regional precipitation is implemented to demonstrate its effectiveness for evaluating GCM simulations and developing regional climate change scenarios. Gridded analyses of synoptic-scale circulation fields are related to regional precipitation using neural nets. Comparable GCM circulation fields are then used with the derived relationships to investigate control simulation and doubled atmospheric CO2 simulation synoptic-scale forcing on regional climates.","Artificial Neural Nets; Climate change; Downscaling","climate change; downscaling; neural network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030417301

More than 25 years ago, Friedlander and his associates began attempts to characterize the detailed chemistry of smog particles, and to interpret these results in terms of source emissions. Source apportionment was formalized using a ""model"", called the chemical mass balance (CMB). The method has been applied periodically since 1968, with major attempts reported in 1975 and 1994, based on large field studies. Despite improvements in particulate sampling and chemical characterization, data availability and major emissions changes, the CMB results qualitatively remain similar. Only broad source categories are identifiable, but they generally make up more than 75% of the total mass concentration. These include primary motor vehicle emissions, suspended (earth) crustal material, and secondary species of ammonium nitrate and sulfate salts. The decoupling of source components in the ambient aerosols suggests that extreme PM10 events are significantly influenced by factors other than simple mixing and dispersion. Carbonaceous material from combustion emissions and secondary atmospheric production also represent a significant fraction of southern California airborne particles. The carbon fraction includes a complex mixture of soot or black carbon, oxygenated compounds, as well as traces of polycyclic aromatics. The last group has been of particular interest because of its apparent common origins and its carcinogenic activity. The major contributor to primary carbonaceous material is motor vehicles. The observations also indicate that a significant fraction of carbon derives from contemporary sources such as vegetation or cooking of meat. The CMB has been used to guide regulatory strategies for particulate emissions management. The method could be improved substantially with more extensive source profile development, as well as improved knowledge about the origins of the organic fraction.","Chemical mass balance; Particle sources; Southern California","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Characterization; Chemical analysis; Estimation; Fog; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Sampling; Smoke; Chemical mass balance; Mass concentration; Particulate emission management; Southern California; Atmospheric aerosols; atmospheric pollution; chemical mass balance; particle source; smog; source emission; USA, California, Los Angeles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030422433

One type of source thought to be significant for VOC emissions is chip piles. State agencies have been adamant in their requirement for emission information from this source. Mills and consultants have therefore been using turpentine loss studies conducted in the 1960's in order to make a rough calculation of these emissions. Without direct measurement of VOC's, it is difficult to ascertain a proper estimate of emissions, and emission estimates have varied from 9 to 400 TPY of VOC per pile. This paper presents a procedure on how to estimate emissions from chip piles. This procedure can be used as an interim method before more comprehensive studies can be completed.

In the first method, phosphoryl chloride was reacted directly with oxides on the glassy carbon surface. Oxidative and reductive pretreatment of the polished surface improved the phosphate site density, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In the second method, the carbon surface was modified with an ω-aminoalcohol by electrochemical oxidation, prior to phosphorylation, yielding similiar phosphate site densities. Zirconium 1,10-decanediylbis(phosphonic acid) (Zr-DBP) multilayers were deposited upon these modified glassy carbon substrates.

Higher than ideal zirconium-to-phosphorus ratios are attributed to deposition kinetics, signal attenuation, and the random character of the glassy carbon surface. Zr-DBP layers exhibited ellipsometric thickness of 17 Å or higher, plausibly due to adsorption of excess ionic species into disordered regions or pockets of the film.

The buses tested were equipped with 1994 Detroit Diesel Engine Corporation 6V92-TA engines, and some included after treatment devices on the exhaust. Instantaneous, time-resolved measurements of CO2 and amorphous carbon concentrations were obtained using an optical extinction technique and compared to simultaneous results obtained using conventional dilution tunnel sampling methods. Good agreement was obtained between the real-time extinction measurements and the diluted CO2 and cycle-integrated filter measurements. The instantaneous measurements revealed that acceleration transients accounted for roughly 80% of the particulate mass emitted during the cycle but only about 45% of the fuel consumption. More detailed examination of the acceleration periods revealed that in fact, fuel injection transients created the majority of the soot not simply high load conditions. Sometimes particulates were stored in the exhaust systems for a short time (on the order of one second), which delayed their emissions. Hence, tighter control of fueling rates during transients may significantly reduce vehicle particulate emissions without reduction in peak torque. Finally, the time-resolved measurements of particulate emissions from a bus equipped with a particulate trap demonstrated the need for transient warm-up procedures rather than extended steady-state warm-up intervals prior to the conduction of dilution tunnel tests. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Amorphous carbon; Buses; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Light absorption; After treatment devices; Carbon concentrations; Central business districts; Extinction measurements; Instantaneous measurement; Optical extinction; Particulate traps; Time resolved measurement; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072438648

Because of the delicate balance of the mucous membranes and special sensory organs of these passages with respect to mucocillary activity, local and recruited immune responses, rapid uptake of chemicals, and carcinogenic potential, the ingestion or inhalation of pollutants in the air can be harmful to these internal body borders. The particular target organs for air pollution effects on the upper aerodigestive tract include the mucosa, olfactory epithelium, auditory receptor cells, glottic epithelium, and adjacent neural and muscular tissues. Hearing loss caused by noise exposure may be aggravated by the concomitant inhalation of solvents. The strongest evidence for the carcinogenic effect of occupational inhalants in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is seen with exposure to hardwood dust, tobacco smoke, furniture making, and leather tanning. With the exception of tobacco smoke, which produces squamous cell carcinomas, the majority of the occupationally related cancers are adenocarcinomas, usually of the intestinal variety. Tobacco smoke, passive or active, may lead to end- artery obliteration at the level of the otic end organ, causing a progressive sensorineural heating loss.

Carbonate reefs are an obvious example to illustrate major skeleal production, and fossil associations of reef building organisms have seen successful application of the ecological concept of community succession. The stratigraphic context of any given accumulation indicates a geological time period with its specific palaeontological associations, major climatic features and the palaeogeography as determined by plate tectonics. Dynamic and sequence stratigraphic analysisof the strata reveal changes in sea-level and positions of shoreline with displacements of facies tracts, transgressions and regressions. In this paper, the analysis of carbonate depositional systems, using high resoulation sequence stratigraphy, studies the ratio between change in accommodation space and skeletal carbonate production. This approach establishes the concurrent change in nature of facies belts (expansion, retraction and type) and fossil communities, within the detailed time frame of change in accommodation. Carbonate production is generally considered to be a fairly simple funcion of environmental conditions such as climate and water depth. However, data form several case studies also show a covariance between change in stratigraphic achitecture of catbonate system (the seaward or landward stepping stacking patterns of stratigraphic units) and change in facies. Case studies include Carboniferous algal mound development in the Paradox Basal (USA), Devonian stromatoporoid reef development in Alberta (Canada), and Cenomanian rudistid shoal development i Oman. The hypothesese are tested on cases taken from the literature, including Oxfordian reefal development in the Jura, and nummulite population change in the Carbières (France). Facies changes record significant modification in the type and amounts of carbonate skeletal material produced in shallower water environments by prevalent communities within the ecosystem. The analysis of carbonate system within the hierarchical framework and detailed time frame of high resolution (genetic) stratigraphy suggests that a causal link exists between changes in stratigraphic accommodation and changes in ecosystem, the two being linked with the carbonate factory. The causal link is deduced to be a complex feedback system within a given climate and palaeogeographic setting. The feedback system would involve nutrients, reproductive strategies, ecosystem and production of carbonate or organic matter. The concept of a carbonate feedback system, involoving the parameters listed above, may help to explain paradoxes such as the drowning of carbonate platform and the vulnerability of mature or climax communiteis. It should also allow to improve prediction of carbonate reservoir distribution and properies for hydrocarbon exploration, and to lay the ground for improved algorithms of carbonate sediment production to be used in stratigraphic forward modelling.","Accommodation; Carbonates; Community succession; Fossil Ecosystem; Sedimentology; Stratigraphy","carbonate; feedback mechanism; sedimentology; sequence stratigraphy; stratigraphy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030424975

One scenario is the use of straw as a fuel in commercial scale power only, heat only and combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Overall, CHP production provides the most favourable energy and CO2 balances.

An exploratory study of a sheep grazing system at Hamilton, in western Victoria, indicates that reducing emissions from some sheep grazing systems in temperate Australia by 20% over the next 15 years will require a similar (i.e. 18%) reduction in stock numbers providing that no other management or technology is used to reduce emissions. This reduction in stock numbers will reduce both farm operating surplus and net cash income by about 15.5 to 17%. The reduction in net cash income represents a direct reduction in the general welfare of the farmer. However, economically viable reductions in emissions may be able to be achieved through changing the time of lambing. Spring lambing resulted in returns per unit emissions which were 15 to 20% greater than those for autumn lambing. Surveys suggest that about two-thirds of all flocks in the area lamb in autumn. Therefore, there exists an opportunity to reduce emissions by the order of 15 to 20% from the region without substantial economic penalties. Overstocking resulted in both increased net methane and nitrous oxide emissions and reduced profitability. The relatively small reductions in stocking rate needed in such situations will reduce greenhouse emissions significantly and also may have the effect of reducing soil and vegetation degradation, thereby improving the sustainability of these enterprises. Implementation of these stocking rate recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could thus be achieved as part of overall sustainable farming.","Grazing systems; Greenhouse gases","agricultural economics; grazing system; livestock; sheep; Australia, Victoria, Hamilton; Ovis aries; Victoria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030469117

The interest has been directed by the needs of industry to develop high performance radiant heaters while complying with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. This paper reviews the processes associated with non-catalytic combustion within porous media, and describes related experimental and modeling research. Experimental measurements in porous media are difficult because of the physical limitations caused for both optical and mechanical probes by the presence of a solid matrix. Modeling is challenging because of the limited knowledge of the fundamentals of the thermal, radiative, and fluid mechanical processes within porous media, and how these participate in the combustion process. Much of the recent interest in the field has followed the commercial availability of reticulated ceramic foams. This paper describes the structural properties of these materials, and their heat transfer properties including convective, conduction, and radiative behavior. The fluid mechanics of porous materials, relating to pressure drop and turbulence flow characteristics are presented. Flames stabilized within the matrix of a porous media have higher burning speeds and leaner flammability limits than open flames. This is due to the internal feedback of heat from the burned gases to the unburned gases through radiation and conduction through the porous medium. This ability to operate at very lean equivalence ratios also contributes to their characteristically low NO emissions. In this paper, we present experimental measurements which show the effects of the porous matrix on reaction rates, flammability limits, and flame stabilization. Exhaust emissions and radiant output from porous media burners are presented for both single-stage and multi-stage burners. The use of liquid fuels in a non-premixed mode of combustion is also discussed. Modeling the combustion process within porous media is quite complex because it requires coupled solution of the energy transfer and chemical kinetics occurring locally in the medium. We present approaches of varying sophistication which predict flame speeds, temperature and concentration profiles, and radiative efficiency.

The model is based on the water budget in the soil and uses monthly temperature and monthly precipitation as input. The data are for 344 U.S. climate divisions during the period of 1931-1993. The main goals of this paper, are 1) to improve our understanding of soil moisture and its effects on the atmosphere and 2) to apply the calculated soil moisture toward long-range temperature forecasts. In this study, the model parameters are estimated using observed precipitation, temperature, and runoff in Oklahoma (1960-1989) and applied to the entire United States. The comparison with the 8-yr (1984-1991) observed soil moisture in Illinois indicates that the model gives a reasonable simulation of soil moisture with both climatology and interannual variability. The analyses of the calculated soil moisture show that the climatological soil moisture is high in the east and low in the west (except the West Coast), which is determined by the climatological precipitation amounts. The annual cycle of soil moisture, however, is determined largely by evaporation. Anomalies in soil moisture are driven by precipitation anomalies, but their timescales are to first order determined by both climatological temperature (through evaporation) and climatological precipitation. The soil moisture anomaly persistence is higher where normal temperature and precipitation are low, which is the case in the west in summer. The spatial scale of soil moisture anomalies has been analyzed and found to be larger than that of precipitation but smaller than that of temperature. Authors found that generally in the U.S. evaporation anomalies are much smaller in magnitude than precipitation anomalies. Furthermore, observed and calculated soil moisture anomalies have a broad frequency distribution but not the strongly bimodal distribution indicative of water recycling. Compared to antecedent precipitation, soil moisture is a better predictor for future monthly temperature. Soil moisture can provide extra skill in predicting temperature in large areas of interior continent in summer, particularly at longer leads. The predictive skill of soil moisture is even higher when the predictand is daily maximum temperature instead of daily mean temperature.",,"evaporation; long range forecast; precipitation; soil moisture; temperature forecast; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030434716

Measurements were made at approximately monthly intervals between August 1993 and August 1995. A marked seasonal change in emission rates was noted. Peaks of methane emission were observed in August 1993 (6.2 mg m-2 d-1), September 1994 (6.0 mg m-2 d-1) and June 1995 (5.5 mg m-2 d-1). Minimum emission rates were recorded in March 1994 (0.8 mg m-2 d-1) and March 1995 (1.4 mg m-2 d-1). Nitrogen, in the form of ammonium and/or nitrate, was applied to plots on the mire surface. Between August 1993 and July 1994 application rates were equivalent to a 50 or 100% increase in N deposition. From August 1994 to August 1995 the application rates were equivalent to a 500 or 1000% increase in N deposition. These applications of nitrogen had no effect on the methane emission rates at any date, with the exception of the measurement from November 1994. No correlation was found between methane flux and either soil temperature or water table. We suggest that the state of the vegetation at the site may be important, either through the role of the plants in transport of methane, or as the source of the organic carbon that is the substrate for methanogenesis.","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Wetlands","ammonia; ground water; methane; nitrate; nitrogen; article; greenhouse effect; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil; temperature; United Kingdom; ammonium; greenhouse gas; methane emission; nitrogen; ombrotrophic mire; soil temperature; wetlands; UK, England, Snowdonia, Migneint; Climate change; Denitrification; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen; Soils; Temperature; Ammonium; Greenhouse gases; Methane emission rates; Methane flux measurement; Methanogenesis; Ombrotrophic mire; Seasonality; Vegetation; Water table; Wetlands; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029662948

On the reducing side of PSII, the addition of bicarbonate to bicarbonate-depleted (or formate-treated) membranes accelerates, especially, Q(A)-→Q(B)- electron transfer kinetics. The site(s) at which bicarbonate binds is unknown. It is evident, however, from several spectroscopic studies that the bicarbonate binding site on the reducing side of PSII includes the non-heme iron located between the Q(A) and Q(B) sites. Since small anions may displace bicarbonate (Good, N.E. (1963) Plant Physiol. 38, 298-304), it is apparent that the bicarbonate binding site is electrostatic in nature, presumably also involving positively charged amino acid residues. Previously, it had been predicted that residue arginine 269 of the PSII D1 protein may participate in bicarbonate binding. To test this hypothesis, we have generated a non-conservative mutation in the psbA gene of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii which converts residue R269 to a glycine (R269G). The R269G mutant was unable to grow photosynthetically or evolve oxygen. This phenotype is associated with a lack of the tetra-manganese water splitting complex and a reduced capacity to form a stabilized charge separated state (defined as Tyr(D)+/Q(A)- under the experimental conditions measured). In addition, the mutant cells have a less stable PSII complex than wild-type cells, particularly when grown in the light. It is apparent from analyses of the effect of formate on the magnitude of the Q(A)-Fe+2 EPR signal, however, that the bicarbonate or formate binding site is not substantially affected by the R269G mutation. Although our results do not substantiate that residue R269 is the site at which bicarbonate is bound, they demonstrate the importance of R269 in the structure and function of PSII. It is apparent from analysis of the photosynthetic phenotype, that the structural perturbations on the stromal side of the D1 protein are transduced to the lumenal side of the membrane altering charge accumulating processes on the electron donor side of PSII.","Bicarbonate; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chloroplast; Formate; Membrane protein; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II; Site-directed mutagenesis","bicarbonate; membrane protein; article; binding site; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; cytochemistry; electron spin resonance; gene construct; mutagenesis; phenotype; photosystem II; priority journal; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029860354

Estimates take into account (a) uncertainty in the level of climate change expected, using a range of climate change scenarios; (b) physiological effects of carbon dioxide on the crops; and (c) different adaptive responses. In all cases, the effects of climate change induced by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide depended on the counteracting effects among higher daily evapotranspiration rates, shortening of crop growth duration, and changes in precipitation patterns, as well as the effects of carbon dioxide on crop growth and water-use efficiency. Although results varied depending on the geographical locations of the regions tested, the production of rice (the main food crop in the region) generally did not benefit from climate change. In South and Southeast Asia, there is concern about how climate change may affect El Nino/Southern Oscillation events, since these play a key role in determining agricultural production. Furthermore, problems arising from variability of water availability and soil degradation are currently major challenges to agriculture in the region. These problems may be exacerbated in the future if global climate change projections are realized. Many studies have considered strategies for improving agricultural management, based on the optimization of crop management decisions. Climate change analyses could be further strengthened by economic studies that integrate the potential use of natural resources across sectors.","agriculture; Asia; El Nino","agriculture; air pollution; Asia; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; meteorology; nonhuman; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Evapotranspiration; Optimization; Precipitation (meteorology); Public policy; Strategic planning; Climate change vulnerability; Crop management; Crop production; El Nino phenomenon; Southern Oscillation phenomenon; Climate change; adaptation; agricultural impact; climate change; crop production; El Nino/Southern Oscillation; Asia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030462154

The combustion and emissions characteristics of this ceramic low heat rejection (LHR) methanol ATAC engine were investigated. Combustion performance was compared between operation with methanol and gasoline. When methanol was used, it was seen that the ATAC operation region was widened considerably. Also, a reduction in aldehyde emissions was achieved, due to the high-temperature operation of the combustion chamber. However, efficiency deteriorated at times due to early selfignition timing. This was overcome by the use of lean fuel-air ratios, which resulted in both a reduction of NOx and an improvement in fuel consumption. With a premixed fuel supply system, wall surface ignition was unavoidable for combustion chamber surface temperatures greater than 800 K (527°C). Wall surface temperature swing and instantaneous heat flux increased substantially with ATAC operation under these conditions.","ATAC; Ceramics; Combustion; Internal Combustion Engine; Low Heat Rejection Engine; Methanol; NOx; Two-Stroke Engine","Ceramic materials; Combustion; Fuel consumption; Gas emissions; Heat flux; High temperature operations; Methanol; Nitrogen oxides; Active thermo-atmosphere combustion; Low heat rejection ceramic methanol engine; Two stroke engine; Internal combustion engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030082693

However, model predictions based on input data sets with low spatial resolution may not accurately reflect transport processes occurring in situ. The goal of the current study was to compare several modeling approaches that might be applicable for classifying soil mapping units (1:24 000) according to their leaching potential to (i) model results based on detailed site-specific measurements and (ii) observed data collected at a field site (Borollic Calciorthid) in southwestern Montana. Data from a 2-yr field study of pentafluorobenzoic acid (PFBA), 2,6- difluorobenzoic acid (DFBA) and dicamba (3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid) transport in fallow and cropped systems under two water application levels were compared to simulations obtained using the Chemical Movement in Layered Soils (CMLS) and Leaching and Chemistry Estimation (LEACHM) models. The resolution of model input parameters was varied based on sources of data. In Case 1, model inputs were obtained primarily from detailed soil profile characterization and site-specific measurements of precipitation, irrigation, and pan evaporation. LEACHM predictions were also generated using estimated conductivity and retentivity functions from textural data obtained from the USDA-NRCS Soil Survey (SSURGO) database (Cases 2 and 3). CMLS predictions were generated using (i) detailed site-specific measurements (Case 1) and (ii) estimated volumetric water contents from textural data (SSURGO) and estimated daily precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) from the Weather Generator (WGEN) and Montana Agricultural Potentials (MAPS) climate database (Cases 2 and 3). Comparison of observed and simulated mean solute travel times showed that (i) LEACHM and CMLS performed adequately with high- resolution model inputs, (ii) model performance declined when field conditions were conducive to preferential flow, (iii) estimated K(s) values from regression equations based on textural data were problematic for generating adequate predictions using LEACHM, and (iv) CMLS predictions were less sensitive to data input resolution, due in part to the fact that CMLS provides an oversimplified description of transport processes.",,"Computer simulation; Database systems; Diffusion; Evaporation; Irrigation; Leaching; Mapping; Mathematical models; Organic acids; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil surveys; Soils; Dicamba; Difluorobenzoic acid; Pentafluorobenzoic acid; Solute transport; Groundwater pollution; 2,6 difluorobenzoic acid; benzoic acid derivative; dicamba; pentafluorobenzoic acid; unclassified drug; agriculture; computer model; conference paper; leaching; pollution transport; precipitation; soil pollutant; transport kinetics; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030152565

It is difficult to reduce HC emissions during engine warm-up because the catalysts do not work well at low temperatures. The sources of unburned HCs from spark-ignition engines seem to be crevices in the combustion chamber, oil layer, deposits, and quench layer on the cylinder wall surfaces. Single-surface and two-surface flame quenching (crevice) play a large role in generating unburned HCs. Two-surface flame quenching distances (quenching crevice width) in the combustion chamber of a sparkignition engine were investigated using an ion probe capable of detecting flame arrival at a narrow width. The crevice width could be controlled precisely. Because engine combustion has cycle-by-cycle fluctuations, quenching crevice widths were estimated by the statistical analysis. It was defined as the width when the ion detector could detect flame arrival in 50 of 100 cycles. The effects of the mixture equivalence ratio, exhaust gas recycle (EGR) rate, ignition timing, charging efficiency, and combustion chamber wall temperature on the quenching crevice width were investigated. HC emissions in the exhaust port, cycle-by-cycle combustion fluctuation, and temperature of a quenching plate of the ion probe in the combustion chamber were also estimated in the experiments. The quenching crevice width was relatively uniform at the surface of the combustion chamber except in the area close to the ignition spark plug and end gas. The quenching crevice width increased with leaner mixture ratio, larger EGR rate, lower charging efficiency, greater ignition timing, and lower wall temperature. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Combustion chambers; Engine cylinders; Hydrocarbons; Particulate emissions; Pressure; Probes; Quenching; Statistical methods; Temperature; Ion current detector; Maximum cylinder pressure; Quenching crevice widths; Spark ignition engine; Wall temperature; Ignition systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030362572

Mechanisms for acquiring additional soil resources include increased root allocation and changes in root morphology or physiology. CO2 research to date has focused almost exclusively on changes in biomass and allocation. We examined physiological changes in nitrate and ammonium uptake in elevated CO2, hypothesizing that uptake rates would increase with the amount of available CO2. We combined our physiological estimates of nitrogen uptake with measurements of root biomass to assess whole root-system rates of nitrogen uptake. Surprisingly, physiological rates of ammonium uptake were unchanged with CO2, and rates of nitrate uptake actually decreased significantly (P&lt;0.005). Root biomass increased 23% in elevated CO2 (P&lt;0.005), but almost all of this increase came in fertilized replicates. Rates of root-system nitrogen uptake in elevated CO2 increased for ammonium in nutrient-rich soil (P&lt;0.05) and were unchanged for nitrate (P&gt;0.80). Root-system rates of nitrogen uptake were more strongly correlated with physiological uptake rates than with root biomass in unamended soil, but the reverse was true in fertilized replicates. We discuss nitrogen uptake and changes in root biomass in the context of root nutrient concentrations (which were generally unchanged with CO2) and standing pools of belowground plant nitrogen. In research to date, there appears to be a fairly general increase in root biomass with elevated CO2, and little evidence of up-regulation in root physiology.","Carbon:nitrogen ratios; Elevated CO2; Nitrogen uptake kinetics; Nutrient relations; Roots; Soil; Whole root-system rates of nitrogen uptake",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030020127

This is the assumption that a system involving a multitude of rational actors operating on interdependent markets has only one possible equilibrium. The global economic system may, in fact, be able to attain several different equilibria. This leads to a becullar kind of uncertainty, which so far has been studied mainly in quantum mechanics. The possibility of multiple equilibria implies that large reductions of carbon emissions could be feasible without massive long-run increases of fossil fuel prices.

Astrophysik, Karl-Schwarzschild-Str. 1, D-85740 Garching, Germany","The role of neutrino heating and convective processes in the explosion mechanism of Type-II supernovae is investigated by one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the long-time evolution of the collapsed stellar core after the bounce at nuclear matter density and after the associated formation of the supernova shock. The parameters describing the neutrino emission from the collapsed stellar core are systematically varied. The possibility to obtain explosions turns out to be very sensitive to the physical conditions in and at the protoneutron star, in particular to its contraction and to the neutrino cooling inside of the gain radius. Yet, above a certain threshold for the core neutrino luminosity, stable and energetic explosions can be obtained in spherical symmetry, provided the energy deposition by neutrinos remains strong for a sufficiently long period. The explosion energy and time scale critically depend on the neutrino fluxes during the shock revival phase and on their temporal decay during the first few 100 ms after shock formation. The threshold luminosity is a very sensitive function of the shock stagnation radius, because small radii of the stalled prompt shock lead to significantly higher neutrino loss from the hot and compact postshock layers, cause the region of neutrino heating to be very narrow, and reduce the heating time scale of the matter due to the high infall velocity. Repeating the simulations in two dimensions we find that strong convective processes occur in the collapsed stellar core in two spatially separate regions. One region of convection lies inside the neutrinosphere and another one is located in the neutrino-heated layer below the shock front. The convective mixing around the neutrinosphere is mainly driven by the negative lepton gradient, which is maintained by rapid loss of leptons from the semitransparent layers at the neutrinosphere. This considerably speeds up the deleptonization of the outer layers of the collapsed stellar core. Even 0.5 seconds after bounce a quasi-stationary pattern of convective motion is still present in the protoneutron star. Three-dimensional simulations reveal that rising and sinking convective elements have about half the size as in two dimensions with angular diameters between 10° and 15°, which causes corresponding anisotropies of the neutrino emission from the core. The large-scale convective overturn that takes place between the shock and the position of maximum neutrino heating is able to efficiently transport energy from the heated layer into the postshock region. This helps to stabilize the shock revival during the critical phase. It also leads to a faster increase and earlier saturation of the explosion energy, both because neutrino-heated material quickly moves out of the heating region and energy loss by the re-emission of neutrinos is reduced. The overturn pattern shows downflows of matter in narrow flux tubes and rising bubbles with typical angular extensions of 30° to 60° (in two dimensions). The material falling towards the neutron star loses lepton number, but readily absorbs energy in the neutrino-heated region, before it rises again. When the explosion gains momentum, this matter is not accreted onto the cooler, neutron-rich protoneutron star any more. After about 200-300 ms the convective shell gets decoupled from the heating region and starts to move away from the neutron star to expand in an essentially self-similar way as a thick layer behind the outward propagating shock. The nearly spherically symmetrical ""hot-bubble"" region begins to develop and turbulence around the protoneutron star ceases. When the supernova shock passes the entropy step of the Si-O-interface about 400-500 ms after bounce, the density inversion between the low-density hot-bubble region and the inhomogeneous shell steepens into a strong reverse shock that forms a sharp discontinuity in the neutrino wind from the nascent neutron star. The supernova shock is significantly deformed and velocity, density, temperature, and entropy in the postshock region exhibit large-scale variations with a contrast of up to a factor of 3. This must have consequences for the formation and spatial distribution of nucleosynthesis products and might help to explain the dumpiness, anisotropies, envelope and mantle mixing, and large velocities of iron group nuclei which were observed in the ejecta of SN 1987A and other supernovae. Although in this respect of essential importance, convection in the postshock region does not seem to be indispensable to get successful Type-11 explosions via the neutrino-heating mechanism, nor do our simulations allow for the conclusion that its presence inevitably makes the mechanism successful and the explosions very energetic. As in spherical symmetry, the explosion energy and time scale are influenced by the contraction of the cooling neutron star and are very sensitive to the neutrino energy deposition and the size of the neutrino fluxes during a period of several hundred milliseconds after core bounce.","Convection; Elementary particles: neutrinos; Supernovae: general; Supernovae: individual: SN 1987A; Turbulence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243251975

To accomplish this goal the biogenic fluxes (CaCO3, opal, and organic carbon), lithologic fluxes, and geochemical records contained in the cores were, and will continue to be, analyzed in order to reconstruct the temporal and spatial variability of the oceanic heat budget, the history of intermediate and deep water formation, and the history of glaciation on the surrounding land masses on millennial, Milankovitch, and tectonic time scales. In addition, because of the very high sedimentation rates (10-20 cm/ky) at some of the drilled sites, we will be able to analyze the sediments on century (Dansgaard-Oeschger events) time scales. Perhaps more importantly, these paleoceanographic reconstructions will span millions of years instead of the 100,000-year time-spans typical of piston cores. Before generating time scales for these sedimentary sequences, composite records were constructed at each site based on continuous data obtained by the multisensor track (including magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma radiation, and gamma-ray attenuation, or GRAPE, which measures bulk density), as well as on color spectral reflectance measurements.

The problem with a usually large relative error in J(ωH) is eliminated since the generally more precise J(ωH - ωC) and J(ωH + ωC) determined at other fields appear at nearly the same frequencies. The fitting of dynamic models to the points of spectral density was made with error weighting, and the influence of J(ωH) was found to be negligible. Therefore, the high-frequency part of the spectral-density function is determined essentially without influence from the two transverse-type relaxation rates. In the case of a carbon-proton vector, the relaxation is mainly determined by dipolar interaction and is only weakly influenced by other relaxation mechanisms, which makes it particularly suitable for the spectral-density mapping technique. The measured relaxation rates in the time domain are transformed into the frequency domain by spectral-density mapping, and the slopes in different frequency regions are important parameters when comparing experimental data with theoretical models of motion. Using an adjustable internuclear distance reff, combined with the model-free approach, it is possible to obtain a reasonable fit to measured spectral-density points at 7(0) and around J(ωC). At the same time, however, the high-frequency slope of the spectral-density function defined by J(ωH - ωC) and J(ωH + ωC) could not be reproduced. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002530134

This nitrogen oxide is transported into the calciner with the rotary kiln gases where further nitrogen oxide is produced by the combustion of secondary fuels, with the result that NO concentrations equivalent to about 1.0 to 1.7 g NO2/m3 are found at the end of the system. It can be assumed that this value will have to reduced significantly in the future. A reduction can be obtained by optimization of the primary firing system in the rotary tube kiln and of the secondary firing system in the calciner. This article investigates the optimization of the combustion in the calciner by using multi-stage process control with stepped supply of fuel and air - which is state of the art in combustion processes for power generation or in waste incineration. In a first step the mutual effects of the rotary tube kiln and calciner on each other are investigated with the aid of partial and complete balances. This also shows how the fuel is divided between the primary and secondary firing systems. The combustion in the calciner is then optimized, for which it is subdivided into stages which are each considered as ideal stirred vessels. The effect of the stepped supply of fuel, kiln feed and air on the NO emissions is examined. A reduction rate for NO of about 65% is achieved when the calciner is divided into two stages with a substoichiometric first zone. The temperature in the second stage is relatively low, so increased emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are to be expected. As a result a three-stage variant is therefore examined which contains in addition a super-stoichiometric zone with high temperatures for complete burn-out. The temperature in this zone is adjusted through the proportion of raw meal supplied. This has only a very slight effect on the NO concentrations measured at the end of the system. The NO reduction drops in comparison with the two-stage variant to about 52%. However, there is a gain in the degree of freedom in relation to possible ways of influencing the burn-out. The theoretical investigations tend to show good agreement with experiments carried out in parallel in a downpipe reactor.",,"Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Firing (of materials); Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Optimization; Process control; Rotary kilns; Temperature; Calciner; Sub stoichiometric first zone; Super stoichiometric zone; Cement plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030171791

In conjunction with the fluid inclusion and isotope data, it is suggested that the ore forming fluid was derived mainly from a deep source characterized by CO2, enrichment and reduction in nature. It is also suggested that the oreforming materials come largely from a deep source, although the contribution of the country rocks should not be ruled out. It is also found that some hydrothermal minerals are possessed of MREE-enrichment patterns. It is deduced that the REEs in the deep-source ore fluid were transported in the form of CO32 complexes and were deposited in a continental basin (or a hot spring basin).","Element geochemistry; Material source; MREE enrichment; Ore-forming fluid; Sedimentary origin","copper; geochemistry; hydrothermal activity; mineralization; mineralizing fluid; vein deposit; China, Yunnan, Jinman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030468723

Under ambient CO2 and O2 conditions, photosynthesis and export rates were similar at 15 and 25°C, but both declined as leaf temperature was raised from 25 to 40°C. Suppressing photorespiration between 15 and 40°C by manipulating CO2 and O2 levels resulted in higher rates of leaf photosynthesis, total sugar synthesis, and export. There was a linear relationship between the rate of photosynthesis and the rate of export between 15 and 35°C. At these temperatures, 60 to 80% of the carbon fixed was readily exported with sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose, which together constituted over 90% of phloem mobile assimilates. Above 35°C, however, export during photosynthesis was inhibited both in photorespiratory conditions, which inhibited photosynthesis, and in nonphotorespiratory conditions, which did not inhibit photosynthesis. Sucrose and raffinose but not stachyose accumulated in the leaf at 40°C. When leaves were preincubated at 40°C and then cooled to 35°C, export recovered more slowly than photosynthesis. These data are consistent with the view that impairment of export processes, rather than photosynthetic processes associated with light trapping, carbon reduction, and sucrose synthesis, accounted for the marked reduction in export between 35 and 40°C. Taken together, the data indicated that temperature changes between 15 and 40°C had two effects on photosynthesis and concurrent export. At all temperatures, suppressing photorespiration increased both photosynthesis and export, but above 35°C, export processes were more directly inhibited independent of changes in photorespiration and photosynthesis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000024693

MSG-EE is an applied general equilibrium model including the link between economic activity, energy demand and emissions to air. MSG-EE has a theory consistent description of the link between income, prices and energy demand, but the representation of technological improvements is simple. MARKAL has a sophisticated description of future energy technology options, but includes no feedback to the general economy. A project for studying the potential for a coordinated use of these two models was initiated and funded by the Norwegian Research Council (NFR). This paper gives a brief presentation of the two models. Results from independent model calculations show that MARKAL gives a signficant lower residential energy demand than MSG-EE does. This is explained by major differences in modelling approach. A first attempt of coordinating the residential energy demand in the models is reported. This attempt shows that implementing results from MARKAL in MSG-EE for the residential sector alone gives little impact on the general economy. A further development of an iteration procedure between the models should include all energy using sectors.","Economy; Energy; General equilibrium model; Linear programming model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5244358445

The addition of nitrogen to the ocean surface waters has the potential to recycle the carbon released by burning fossil fuels. It is possible to predict the nitrogen needed by phytoplankton to absorb the carbon dioxide for, say, the IPCC emission scenario B. We have used a Redfield ratio of C:N:P of 130:16:1 and an efficiency of 70%. It is of interest to compare the increase of carbon uptake due to the nitrogen nourishment required for greenhouse gas mitigation with the new primary production of the world's oceans.

This is in contrast with terrestrial regions where some modellers estimate that, in order to feed the population increases predicted by the United Nations, the new primary production on land will need to double by 2020. The addition of nitrogen to the upper ocean, as well as sequestering CO2 can be expected to increase the fish landings.

In light incubated microcosms, negligible fluxes of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and trace metals were observed. A substantial sediment water flux of reduced Fe (Fe2+) and Mn (Mn2+) was observed in microcosms incubated under continuous darkness; highest fluxes were observed in molybdate-amended microcosms.

Both microbial mat communities exhibited similar rates of gross photosynthetic oxygen (O2) production, but dramatically different rates of net benthic O2 flux. Distinct patterns of net O2 production and trace metal cycling arose from differences in either trace metal oxide availability or reactivity (mineralogy), organic carbon mineralization rates, or sediment characteristics (porosity). Variations in the microbial community responsible for trace metal cycling could have also contributed to the pattern. The present data illustrate that chemically-mediated redox reactions between metal oxides and reduced S complicate interpretation of Fe and Mn fluxes, underscoring the need to separate chemical and biological reactions when attempting to determine the role of biological trace metal reduction in organic carbon oxidation.","California coast; elemental cycling; microbial metabolism; trace metal reduction","biogeochemical cycle; iron; manganese; metabolism; microbial mat; microbial mats; nutrients; reduction; trace metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302953

Summer rainfall time series are formulated for South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe areas and correlated with global indices and with field variables: sea-surface temperature (SST), outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and tropospheric winds at 200 and 700 hPa levels. Linear regression correlations are performed using monthly standardized departures at various lags before and during the summer season. The SSTs in the central equatorial Indian Ocean (CEI) are identified as significant predictors/modulators of southern African rainfall. The SSTs at the CEI are best correlated with South Africa rainfall at r < -0·6 at lags -2 and 0 months and are associated with the El Niño. The SSTs of the CEI modulate the overlying monsoon trough, as indicated by the OLR correlation maps. A centre of convective action alternates between southern Africa and the south-west Indian Ocean from year-to-year. A useful circulation index that emerges in the statistical analysis is spring-time zonal upper wind anomalies over the equatorial central Atlantic. This index is correlated with South Africa rainfall at r < -0·8 at lags -4 and -2 months. Westerly (easterly) 200 hPa anomalies in spring are followed by a summer of below (above) normal rainfall. Other patterns that have a bearing on summer rainfall include a circulation gyre identified in 700 hPa wind correlations off the coast of south-east Africa. This circulation feature controls the flux of moisture between southern Africa and the northern Mozambique Channel. The correlation patterns offer statistical guidance in long-range forecasts and insights to climatic processes that govern the interannual variability of summer rainfall over southern Africa.","Circulation index; Correlation patterns; Inter-annual climatic fluctuations; Linear regression; Predictability; Rainfall index; Southern Africa; Statistical teleconnections; Summer rainfall","circulation gyre; climate statistical analysis; longwave radiation; rainfall prediction; regional correlation pattern; sea surface temperature; Namibia; South Africa; Zimbabwe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029753671

In a few conglomerate localities in the hilly region of Galilee, northern Israel, a large number of the pebbles have internal cavities. This puzzling phenomenon has not been documented previously in Israel or elsewhere. The studied conglomerates occur as lithified, calcite-cemented lenticular beds, which alternate with reddish-brown argillaceous mudstones. The hollow pebbles constitute, in fact, only a special case of a wider range of related features. The most relevant observations related to these occurrences are the following. (1) The clasts are polymictic, consisting of various limestones, dolomites, and minor cherts. The hollow pebbles and related features, however, occur only in porous dolomites. (2) Calcitized, dedolomitic hard rims characterize all the affected pebbles. The thickness of these rims varies between a few mm and 1-2 cm. (3) In part of the affected pebbles, the dolomitic core (inside the calcitic rims) is preserved intact. In others, only the hard rim is preserved, and the core is empty. These are the hollow pebbles sensu stricto. (4) Late-stage calcite spar occurs in some of the voids and in veins that cross the groundmass of the conglomerates. The first step in the sequence of events leading to the production of the described occurrences is inferred to be the calcitization of porous dolomite pebbles, resulting in the formation of dense rims around porous cores. The next step involved the dissolution of the inner core of the pebble by acidic solutions, leaving the calcitic rims almost intact. The restriction of hollow pebbles (and related features) occurrences to conglomerate strata which are interbedded with argillaceous mudstones points to a causal relationship between the two. Accordingly, the precipitation of calcite during the first step is attributed to the establishment of anoxic microenvironments within the porewater soon after the accumulation of the argillaceous material. The reversal of conditions from carbonate precipitation to dissolution (during the second step) seems to be related to a change from reducing to oxidizing microenvironments, following the emergence of the fluviatile sediments from the aquatic environments. The critical requirements for obtaining the hollow pebbles seem, therefore, to be the presence of a 'suitable' lithological type of pebble, namely, porous dolomite, combined with a special sequence of depositional and diagenetic environments. The apparent rarity of this combination seems to account for the lack of documentation on this phenomenon to this date.",,"calcitization; carbonate; conglomerate; dolomite; hollow pebble; porosity; Israel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029730909

The chemical characteristics of the crude oil, soils, and rat livers were compared. Fingerprinting by gas chromatography mass spectrometry and quantitative evaluation of metabolized petroleum hydrocarbons was performed on oil, soil extracts, and rat livers. A liver from a domestically raised rabbit was used as an experimental control. The results show that compared to background values for control samples and procedural blanks, there is no significant incorporation of PAHs or low molecular weight n-alkanes (C13-C23) into the liver tissues. The C25 to C15 n-alkane range for all soil samples, kangaroo rat livers, and rabbit liver, is dominated by a high abundance of C27, C29, C31, and C33 hydrocarbons typical of epicuticular plant waxes. In all liver tissue samples, squalene, the cholesterol precursor, is the dominant hydrocarbon. Although evidence is lacking for metabolism of PAHs and paraffinic petroleum hydrocarbons, very strong evidence is available for incorporation of a set of polycyclic hydrocarbons (biomarkers) belonging to the terpane, sterane, and monoaromatic and triaromatic sterane families, identified by ion monitoring at 191, 217, 253, and 231 m/z, respectively. Because these hydrocarbons are not known to exist in the biosphere, but are only synthesized during oil- and coal-forming processes, their presence in the liver samples constitutes proof for crude oil incorporation into tissues. This conclusion is further substantiated by the selective incorporation of only the 20S enantiomer of C28 and C29 steranes and aromatic steranes into the livers, with the exclusion of the 20R enantiomer. The results from the study conclusively demonstrate that polycyclic hydrocarbon biomarkers provide excellent indices for proof of petroleum exposure and metabolism in some terrestrial herbivores.","Aromatic steranes; Hydrocarbon fingerprinting; Kangaroo rats; Oil well blow out; Terpanes","alkane; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic hydrocarbon; animal tissue; conference paper; controlled study; gas chromatography; liver homogenate; male; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; offshore oil industry; oil spill; priority journal; rodent; sampling; soil; soil pollution; united states; Animalia; Dipodomys; Dipodomys heermanni; Macropus sp.; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Rodentia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030000423

Sphagnum mosses disappeared from Niinsaare bog during the 1970s in the period of the highest air pollution. Their disappearance was probably caused mainly by the combination of high pH values and an increased concentration of calcium in the bog water. In Niinsaare bog, the present mean pH value of bog water is 5.3 ± 0.6 and the mean calcium concentration 11.6 ± 1.6mg 1-1, compared with 3.7 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.2 mg 1-1 in the uncontaminated Nigula bog respectively.

We detected 23 PNs, including 11 first-time detections. Adding from the literature 48 PNs previously searched for H2, we find that ∼40% of the combined sample displays H2 emission. The detections are dominated by objects that possess bipolar morphology (i.e., those that display well-defined polar lobes and/or equatorial regions in optical images). All seven H2-emitting PNs that are not considered bipolar (based on Hα images) are rings or disks, which strongly suggests that these objects are in fact bipolar PNs viewed at large inclinations. This interpretation also follows from the fact that the brightest H2 emission is typically located along the equatorial plane (waist) of a bipolar nebula and that several nebulae that are bipolar in optical emission lines appear ringlike in H2. We therefore confirm the validity of Galley's rule: the detection of H2 emission from a PN confirms the bipolar structure of that PN. The H2-bright waist (or torus, in the case of a Ring-like PN) is presumably the remnant of a molecule-rich circumstellar disk that predates the production of a PN. We confirm and strengthen the claim that PNs detected in H2 are confined to lower Galactic latitudes, and therefore had larger progenitor masses, than PNs without detectable emission. These results therefore reinforce the connection between PN progenitor mass, PN morphology, and the presence or absence of 2.122 μm H2 emission. © 1996. The American Astronomical Society.

Three different types of wastewater treatment plant sludges (primary, thickened activated, and digested) were commingled with a simulated biodegradable organic fraction of municipal solid waste and used as a feedstock. Digester performance was evaluated for each feedstock under similar retention times, a constant total solids content, and a constant C:N ratio. Additional aspects of the process which have been analyzed include volume reduction, air emission, and humus characteristics. Results obtained indicate that stable and robust digestion was achieved using organic loading rates of 6.5-8 g biodegradable volatile solids per kilogram active reactor mass per day. Under these organic loading rates, methane gas production rates as high as 0.36 m3/kg biodegradable volatile solids added per day were obtained, gassifying approximately half the dry mass of the feedstock. Substrate volume reduction through the process was ~65-69% as compared with the same quantities of sludge and MSW in a well-compacted landfill. The emissions produced from anaerobic digestion and aerobic biodrying are found to have no adverse effect on human heath and the environment.

The Maar-lake fill contains clastic, chemical and organic deposits, including high-calorific peats formed in the Lake Holocene. The main (host) sediments of the infill are tuffaceous sandy mudstones. The other accessory facies, controlled mainly by climate, are peats and plant-bearing mudstones, brecciate mudstones, limestones and also travertines originated by thermal waters at the top of the succession.

It is thought that the lake was primarily dependent on climate; and deposition was further controlled by the hydrothermal system. The associated heat flow played an important role in sedimentation by creating a micro-climatic niche, where late-Quaternary (cold regional climate) vegetation could flourish and form substantial peat deposits.

Hospital, Sapporo, Japan","Background and Purpose: The aim of this study was to corn pare the effect of vasodilative stimuli for the measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity obtained by acetazolamide and hypercapnia in patients with chronic occlusive major cerebral artery disease. Methods: We examined 24 patients with unilateral occlusive lesions of a major cerebral artery using the 333Xe inhalation technique and single-photon emission CT. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured during a resting state, during inhalation of 5% CO2, and 15 minutes after the administration of acetazolamide consecutively in the same patients. Normative values of resting CBF and acetazolamide reactivity were obtained in 21 normal subjects. Results: All patients with the exception of 1 showed an increase in CBF during hypercapnia ipsilateral to the occlusive lesion. Ipsilateral acetazolamide reactivity was preserved in 13 patients. Conversely, 11 patients showed an absent response or paradoxical CBF reduction. Ipsilateral CO2 reactivity did not correlate with acetazolamide reactivity when all 24 patients were, considered. However, there was a significant correlation between acetazolamide and CO2 in the 13 patients who showed preserved acetazolamide reactivity (r = .60, P&lt;.05). No significant correlation was present in the remaining 11 patients with reduced acetazolamide reactivity. Although significant blood pressure augmentation was observed in hypercapnia, we could not find a correlation between change of blood pressure and CO2 reactivity.

The environmental model is a description of the physical and social systems affected by the policy decision. The preference model is a description of the preferences of the decision maker for the outcomes predicted by the environmental model. In many technical policy making processes, the development of the environmental model is delegated to technical experts. In these processes, efforts to involve stakeholders tend to focus on characterizing the stakeholders' preferences for various outcomes. Such efforts fail to recognize that stakeholders differ in their description of the problem as well as in their preferences. This paper presents techniques for characterizing differences in stakeholder's analytical perspectives, for exploring the effect of these differences on the structure and content of environmental models, and for estimating the impact of these differences on policy decisions. By illuminating these relationships, these techniques will contribute to a better understanding of the role of experts and other stakeholders in addressing complex policy issues. The application of these techniques in the context of air pollution and transportation planning in Los Angeles will be discussed.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Automobiles; Decision making; Environmental protection; Public policy; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Technology; Transportation; Urban planning; Democracy; Environmental policy; Experts; Policy decision; Smog; Stakeholders; Environmental engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029699074

In the far north the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, peak to trough, is between 15 and 20 parts per million by volume. The annual amplitude diminishes southwards to about 3 p.p.m. near the Equator, owing to the diminishing seasonality of plant activity towards the tropics. In spite of atmospheric mixing processes, enough spatial variability is retained in the seasonal cycle of CO2 to reveal considerable regional detail in seasonal plant activity. Here we report that the annual amplitude of the seasonal CO2 cycle has increased by 20%, as measured in Hawaii, and by 40% in the Arctic, since the early 1960s. These increases are accompanied by phase advances of about 7 days during the declining phase of the cycle, suggesting a lengthening of the growing season. In addition, the annual amplitudes show maxima which appear to reflect a sensitivity to global warming episodes that peaked in 1981 and 1990. We propose that the amplitude increases reflect increasing assimilation of CO2 by land plants in response to climate changes accompanying recent rapid increases in temperature.",,"carbon dioxide; air temperature; arctic climate; article; atmosphere; carbon dioxide fixation; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; plant growth; priority journal; seasonal variation; vegetation; Embryophyta; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climatic change; global change; growing season; Arctic; USA, Hawaii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663013

Measurements of ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were taken at a variety of sites in Provo and Salt Lake City (as a control site) for three five-day work-weeks (phases): one before, one during, and one after the 1994-95 oxygenated fuel season. Our results show that nearly all the observed ambient CO at the study sites can be attributed to mobile sources. Using five separate numerical techniques, we have investigated the change in background-corrected CO/CO2 concentration ratios from Provo, after normalization by the Salt Lake City control site concentration ratios. Two methods show no consistent pattern of CO reductions at all Provo sites during oxygenated fuel season. Three of the methods show a consistent pattern; however, no CO reduction is significant at the 95 percent confidence level for any one site using more than one numerical technique, and only at a confidence level of approx.80 percent does an upper limit of a 9-10 percent mean reduction in the observed CO/CO2 ratios become significant for morning rush-hour samples. For cold-start samples taken in a parking garage, two methods show upper limits of 15 percent and 35 percent reductions at confidence levels of 82 percent and 91 percent, respectively.

The problem was approached by modeling the time development of the gas phase sulfuric acid concentration during the plume transport, and thereby identifying the meteorological, source-related, and environmental variables governing the behavior of this system. The development of the plume nucleation probability was shown to be dictated by a complicated and nonlinear interaction between the plume dispersion, chemistry, and condensation of sulfuric acid from the gas phase. For all the simulated plumes, those originating from stronger sources and dispersing at slower rates, or having higher SO2 to fine paniculate matter ratios, or higher SO2 to NOx concentration ratios, showed greater nucleation probabilities indicative of a higher capability for producing new particles. Nucleation was also favored by cool and humid ambient conditions, greater actinic flux, and higher background hydrocarbon concentrations. The most effective way to decrease the plume nucleation probability was to decrease SO2 emissions alone. Reducing NOx or particle emissions may decrease the total paniculate mass but leads to higher plume nucleation probabilities, which is likely to increase particle number concentrations farther downwind of the source.",,"gas phase sulphuric acid; plume nucleation probability; plume transport; sulphur dioxide emission; sulphuric acid/water nucleation; urban acid source",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750254

Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, United States","There is a significant public and scientific concern over the potential risks of air pollution emissions from municipal waste combustors (MWCs). The primary pollutants of concern are polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs/PCDFs), and mercury (Hg). Depending on the composition of the waste and the technologies used, PCDD/PCDF emissions may range from less than 1.0 to more than 20 000 ng/dscm. Hg concentrations in MWC flue gas may range from less than 200 to more than 1000 μg/dscm. Trace organic emissions are dependent on the combustion and flue gas cleaning technologies employed and the conditions at which they are operated. Good combustion practice and dry scrubbing techniques employing fabric filter (FF) bag houses can be used to reduce average PCDD/PCDF emissions to less than 20 ng/dscm. Dry scrubbers in combination with electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are less effective, resulting in typical PCDD/PCDF emissions of less than 75 ng/dscm. Powdered activated carbon can be injected into the flue gas to reduce Hg emissions from spray dryer (SD)/FF and SD/ESP systems to less than 0.08 mg/dscm. It can also be used to improve PCDD/PCDF capture in these systems. This article provides an overview of MWC air pollution control technologies and applicable Federal air emission control requirements. Knowledge concerning PCDD/PCDF formation is summarized, and data are provided on the performance of combustion and flue gas cleaning techniques used to control PCDD/PCDF emissions. The fundamental Hg properties which affect capture in flue gas cleaning equipment are discussed, and the results of carbon injection control tests are summarized.This article provides an overview of municipal waste combustor air pollution control technologies and applicable Federal air emission control requirement for dioxin, furan, and mercury emissions.

A large fraction (≃ 38%) of the 75 keV deuterium ions counter-injected into a IOW-Ip plasma (≃ 0.4 MA) suffers prompt orbit loss, which forces an inward ion current to maintain charge neutrality. Monte Carlo guiding-centre orbit calculations predict a radial current of 80 A at the last closed flux surface. In these discharges, Er is negative everywhere, owing to the counter-going toroidal rotation, and exhibits a double-bump shape, in contrast to the usual positive parabolic shape for the co-injection case. The measured carbon impurity ion toroidal rotation profile shows a pedestal over the outer region where fast ions are lost, possibly due to the effect of Jrorbit x B torque. The momentum diffusion process tends to slow down and to spatially spread the Jrorbit x B torque effect.

Petroleum refiners need to be especially sensitive to these new regulations. The industry will have to pay special attention to the following programs, promulgated under the Act: Title V Operating Permit Program; Oxygenated and Reformulated Gasoline Program; Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Emission Limitations for Refinery Wastewater Treatment Systems (Subpart QQQ); Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Requirements for Refineries and the Hazardous Organic NESHAP (HON) Rule; Benzene National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP); and the Early Reduction Program. Enterprising refinery owners and operators are learning to use the regulations to be cost competitive in a highly regulated environment. Many of these requirements and the associated deadlines will come into effect during the next five years. The Clean Air Act (CAA) is only one of several laws that will significantly impact petroleum refiners throughout the next twenty years. Recently promulgated Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations are already affecting refinery operations. This paper will review the impact of recently promulgated regulations on refinery operations and future expansions and the need to address these issues in the Title V Operating Permit Application.

Transport of sucrose from the mesophyll cells to the phloem might involve an apoplastic step or be entirely symplastic, depending on species. Acid invertase occurs as both soluble and cell-wall-bound forms and has been detected in mature leaves. However, the ability of this enzyme to act as a regulator of carbon export and storage depends on whether it occurs either in the sucrose transport path (which could decrease export), or is located within the mesophyll cells (potentially resulting in intracellular futile cycling between sucrose synthesis in the cytoplasm and hydrolysis in the vacuole). Tissue-level localization of acid invertase was investigated by tissue printing, which establishes protein distribution within a leaf. Antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a region close to the active site of acid invertase. Tissue prints from Pisum sativum L. and Hordeum vulgare L. showed invertase to be located in the vascular regions, which was not observed in Fuchsia hybrida L. This corresponds to differences in the presence of oligosaccharides in leaf extracts and in the pattern of plasmodesmatal connections between mesophyll cells and the vasculature. We hypothesize that the location of acid invertase activity is implicated in species-specific differences in sucrose and oligosaccharide metabolism.","Acid invertase; Compartmentation; Localization; Oligosaccharide; Sucrose","Fuchsia hybrid cultivar; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Pisum sativum; Sativum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000059406

Products based on EPS find application in industries as diverse as food service, packaging, and commercial and residential construction. Production of EPS is forecast to increase as new applications are exploited in the construction industry. In the processing of EPS, pentane is released, causing volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Control of VOC emissions from EPS operations is essential for compliance with Federal, state, and local air quality regulations. However, EPS applications pose an emissions control challenge due to the need for 99+% destruction efficiency, and the presence of intermittent releases, high humidity ineffluent streams, and variable pentane concentrations. KSE's AIR Process a photocatalytic oxidation technology, effectively manages VOC emissions for the EPS industry. The process has been demonstrated to effect complete destruction of pentane emissions without formation of unwanted by-products, even at the elevated concentrations encountered in the EPS industry. Simple control of ultraviolet (UV) light enables effective management of intermittent operations and the highly variable VOC concentrations. Unique system features provide excellent reliability and enable economic control of emissions at strategic locations within the EPS plant.

These depend on the perceived risks of climate change, socioeconomic and cultural characteristics of the nations and regions involved, and the technical feasibility of policy measures. Scientific and technological research supports the policy making process about these issues. The perspectives of the scientific community and the policy makers differ and as a consequence communication is often troublesome. The construction and utilization of knowledge under such circumstances can only be effective if all parties involved engage in a continuous dialogue about causes, effects, impacts and responses. This paper describes a project carried out in the Netherlands. It has as its major objective the articulation of a variety of perceptions and positions related to climate change. As a result of the project, policy actors produced five policy options and formulated research questions. The policy options are linked in the framework of a policy life cycle.

Soil microbes are fed primarily by root-derived substrates, fulfil functions such as mineralization, immobilization, decomposition, pathogeneity and improvement of plant nutrition, and form the basis of the below-ground food web. Hitherto, below-ground processes have generally been monitored using a 'black-box' approach, thereby ignoring effects of global change at a finer level of resolution. We describe shifts in the activity between microbial functional groups associated with roots of Artemisia tridentata, and the influence of this change on higher trophic levels. 2. We tested the hypothesis that elevated atmospheric CO2 causes the soil community to change qualitatively. We measured the responses of several soil microbe and soil microfaunal parameters to a double-ambient CO2 concentration and nutrient additions. The soil community, as measured by those parameters, showed great changes in response to the treatments. There was a very strong interaction between elevated CO2 and the nutrient addition. 3. Under low nutrient conditions, total microbial biomass did not change under elevated atmospheric CO2, but doubled under conditions of elevated CO2 and added nutrients. As we increased the resolution of our analysis, however, results shifted. Under low nutrient conditions, mycorrhizal fungi responded positively to elevated CO2, whereas with added soil nutrients they responded negatively to the same elevated CO2 concentration. Bacteria and non-mycorrhizal fungi did not respond under the former conditions but more than doubled in biomass under conditions of elevated CO2 and added nutrients. Soil fauna was also affected by the treatments. Overall, elevated CO2 shifted carbon flow in the plant-soil system to a more mutualistic-closed, mycorrhizal-dominated system, whereas the combination of elevated CO2 and nutrient addition shifted carbon flow to a more opportunistic-open, saprobe/pathogen-dominated one. 4. This indicates that elevated atmospheric CO2 may lead to far less predictable feedback patterns than previously thought and that qualitative shifts in the soil community may be far more important than mere changes in total C sink strength.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; food web; global change; microarthropod; microbial biomass; nematode","Artemisia tridentata; Artemisia tridentata; Asteraceae; fungi; microbial biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030304865

In particular, high concentrations of 20β-HSD were detected in the testis, followed by the kidney and liver, by the [125I]-protein A binding method. Immunohistochemical localization of the enzyme was achieved in paraffin sections of the testis, kidney, liver, epididymis, and vas deferens by the streptoavidin-biotin complex method.

Eng., Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States","The impacts of home-based telecommuting on travel behavior and personal vehicle emissions for participants in the State of California Telecommuting Pilot Project are analyzed using the most advanced emissions modeling tools currently available. A comparison of participants' telecommuting day travel behavior with their before-telecommuting behavior shows a 27% reduction in the number of personal vehicle trips, a 77% decrease in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), and 39% (and 4%) decreases in the number of cold (and hot) engine starts. These decreases in travel translate into emissions reductions of: 48% for total organic gases (TOG), 64% for carbon monoxide (CO), 69% for nitrogen oxide (NOx), and 78% for paniculate matter (PM). Although the authors developed the methodology to investigate the emissions impacts of telecommuting, the analysis technique can be applied to any demand management or other transportation strategy where all of the necessary model inputs are available. An analysis of the number of personal vehicle trips and VMT partitioned into commute-related and non-commute-related purposes revealed that non-commute personal vehicle trips increased by 0.5 trips per person-day on average, whereas the non-commute VMT decreased by 5.3 miles. This important finding supports (for one indicator, the number of trips) the hypothesis that non-commute travel generation is a potential negative impact of telecommuting. This finding demonstrates the need to monitor these changes as telecommuting moves into the mainstream. In this study, however, the small increase in non-commute trips has a negligible impact compared to the overall travel and emissions savings.

Telecommuting has the potential to reduce the number of daily trips and miles traveled with personal vehicles and, consequently, the overall emissions resulting from vehicle activity. This search studies the emissions impacts of telecommuting for the participants of the Puget Sound Telecommuting Demonstration Project (PSTDP). The California Air Resources Board's emissions models, EMFAC7F and BURDEN7F, are used to estimate the emissions on telecommuting days and non-telecommuting days, based on travel diaries completed by program participants. This study, among the first of its kind, represents the most sophisticated application of emissions models to travel diary data. Analysis of the travel diary data and the emissions model output supports the hypothesis that telecommuting has beneficial transportation and air quality impacts. The most important results are that telecommuting decreases the number of daily trips (by 30%), the vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) (by 63%), and the number of cold starts (by 44%), especially those taking place in early morning. These reductions are shown to have a large effect on daily emissions, with a 50% to 60% decrease in pollutants generated by a telecommuter's personal vehicle use on a telecommuting day. These net savings are almost entirely due to the elimination of commute trips, as non-commute trips increased by 0.33 trips per person-day (9% of the total trips), and the non-commute VMT increased by 2.2 miles. Overall reduc- tions in travel and emissions of this magnitude are observed because the telecommuters in this sample are long-distance commuters, with commutes twice as long as the regional average. However, even as telecommuting adoption moves into the mainstream, its net impacts are still expected to be beneficial— a reduction in VMT and in emissions. It is important to note that when the level of telecommuting is considered (that is, the percentage of work days that employees actually telecommute), the weekly savings are a much smaller proportion of total weekday travel. Also, these findings represent average per-capita reductions; the aggregate (or overall, regionwide) impacts are determined by scaling these reductions by the number of program participants. Thus, the aggregate effectiveness of telecommuting must take into account the number of people likely to participate as telecommuters and how often they telecommute, not just the per-capita, peroccasion impacts. © 1996 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Air quality; Environmental impact; Highway traffic control; Management; Mathematical models; Motor transportation; Telecommunication; Vehicles; Environmental benefits; Policy makers; Telecommuting; Transportation demand management; Gas emissions; air pollution; article; aviation; exhaust gas; priority journal; traffic and transport; travel; working time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030065734

The CO2 emitted per unit of electrical energy generated by the power station in Indonesia is less than that of the analogous Japanese station because solar energy is available in larger quantities. However, due to the present relative inefficiency of Indonesian thermal power plants, CO2 emissions per unit electrical energy grows larger than that using Japanese-manufactured modules if Indonesian-manufactured modules are used.

It became necessary to raise the fuel economy rate to control oil resources consumption and their preservation for the future and to prevent global warming by CO2. A reduction in friction-caused losses in an engine exerts a strong effect on an increase of the fuel economy rate. In the case of diesel automatics, it is necessary to reduce the oil consumption to decrease the content of particulate matter in their exhaust. Automobile makers performed measurements of friction losses in each part of an engine, measured the thickness of lubricating oil film and completed the analysis of each sliding component operating under elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) conditions, which allowed them to develop engines that would offer a reduced weight, a higher efficiency, and a higher reliability.

While the primary concern in the 1970s and 80s was the criteria pollutants and the nonmethane volatile organics which contribute to ozone formation, concern in the late 1980s was directed to air toxics as well. Major changes in regulatory legislation occurred in the early 1990s resulting in increased demand for emissions reductions. Air toxics in combustion emissions include volatile and semivolatile organics such as benzene, dioxins, and furans, as well as inorganic species such as HCl, many metals (including metal oxides and chlorides), and aerosols with particles less than 10 μm in diameter. Air toxic are of concern for their potential to impact both human and ecosystem health. While carcinogenic potential was of greatest concern initially, other health impacts including reproductive effects and endocrine system disruption are receiving increasing attention. Within the combustion community, research efforts focused initially on air toxics emissions from incinerators. More recently, air toxics emissions from other combustion processes have come under scrutiny. The relationships among the feedstock, the combustion process, and postcombustion processes all influence the emissions of air toxics and the distribution or transfer of pollutant species among environmental media. This paper reviews impacts by air toxics from combustion on human health and ecosystem health, reviews the factors that contribute to the formation of air toxics, and considers how the impacts can guide combustion research to focus on those factors most crucial to control of air toxics. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Air pollution control; Combustion; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Health; Impurities; Toxicity; Volatile organic compounds; Air toxics; Pollutants; Air pollution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030350133

INTRODUCTION The use of rapeseed oil fuels in diesel engines has been intensively investigated since the beginning of the on-going energy crisis. In the beginning, the emphasis was placed on the technical possibilities associated with the use of rapeseed oil as a fuel. However, research has shown that pure rapeseed oil can only be used in specially designed engines. Research that followed indicated that rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) was a suitable replacement for petroleum diesel fuel (DF) (Vellguth, [1]) After this discovery, research has focused on the engine exhaust emissions that result when fueling with both unmodified rapeseed oil and RME. Initially, research concentrated on the federally regulated hydrocarbons (HC), carbon moNOxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) exhaust gas emissions (Vellguth, [2]). These components, and occasionally particulate matter (PM), have been investigated in a large number of studies and reports involving engine exhaust emissions testing. In addition, a series of current publications compare the environmentally important but non-regulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), aldehydes, ketones and in some cases, the aromatic compounds. According to the United States Clean Air Act (Gorse et al, [3]), butadiene, benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and polycyclic organic material are the principal toxic airborne exhaust gas components found in engine exhaust gas emissions. Butadiene, however, has not been reported when examining the exhaust gases of engines fueled with rapeseed oil and RME. Likewise, the influence of rapeseed oil fuels on the formation of photochemical smog, whose main component is ozone, is unknown. The undisputed advantages of rapeseed oil fuels, however, lie in their sulfur free emissions and the reduced atmospheric CO2, emissions. An estimation of the environmental effects caused by emissions from engines fueled with rapeseed oil and rapeseed oil methyl ester fuels can be made by a relative comparison with DF. An evaluation of the potential health effects, as presented recently for gasoline and diesel-powered engines in an environmental assessment of the ""Sachverständigenrates für Umweltfragen"" [4] (German Authority Council for Environmental Issues), must be replicated for RME and rapeseed oil fuels. The goal of this review is to summarize the published emissions measurements from different authors, to compare these results and, where possible, identify trends that may exist. In order to classify and evaluate the conclusions, it is necessary to begin with a description of the experimental conditions applied, or in other words, the engine testing procedures (section 2). The current state of knowledge concerning the environmental effects of the components of exhaust gas are discussed, in order to assess the environmental relevance of the test results. Section 4 contains a summary of the measured values, that are discussed under conclusions in section 5 regarding their environmental importance, whereby also some standing problems, whose research needs exist, are examined. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air pollution; Butadiene; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Energy policy; Esters; Exhaust gases; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuels; Ketones; Lubricating oils; Nitrogen oxides; Oilseeds; Petroleum research; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Vegetable oils; Emissions measurements; Environmental assessment; Environmental issues; Experimental conditions; Particulate Matter; Petroleum diesel fuels; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Rapeseed oil methyl ester; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073136100

The phenol feed concentrations were between 500 and 1,000 mg/L, while oxygen was fed into the reactor at 50 to 1,000% of the stoichiometric amount needed to oxidize phenol completely to carbon dioxide. Phenol conversions from 16 to 96% were attained as the reactor residence times varied from 15 to 203 s. The oxidation obeys a parallel-consecutive reaction scheme that involves multiring, intermediate products such as phenoxy-phenol, biphenol, dibenzo-dioxin, maleic acid, and succinic acid. Experimental results showed that the phenol disappearance rate is represented well by a power-law kinetic model in which the rate is proportional to the 0.4 power of the oxygen mole fraction and roughly linearly proportional to the phenol mole fraction. The pressure effect on the disappearance rate was appropriately accounted for by introducing the molar volume of the reaction mixture, which was readily calculated by an equation of state. Total organic carbon reduction can be estimated by a lumped kinetic equation.

In examining mitigation cost studies for Western Europe, this paper finds this interpretation to be flawed. The paper expands the analytical framework for interpreting mitigation cost studies, evaluates the treatment of no regrets options and other input assumptions in the various studies, and includes findings from recent integrated top-down/bottom-up modeling assessments not covered in the IPCC report. Based on these new elements, it is found that mitigation costs tend to be overestimated not only in top-down studies, but also in bottom-up studies. Given this pervasive bias toward pessimism, the body of existing mitigation cost assessments for Western Europe can be read as follows. Over the next three to four decades, a combination of tax shifts, market transformation instruments and policies to reform subsidies and internalize non-climatic externalities could cut carbon emissions in Western Europe by 40-50% relative to the base year, at no loss or at a gain in GDP. Averaged over the medium term and including a phase-in period, an economically optimal rate of implementing Western Europe's no regrets potentials is found to be in the neighborhood of 2% per year relative to base year levels.

Design options evaluated included low and high cell densities (160 cpsi vs. 400 cpsi, a non-straight flow channel geometry (160 cpsi), and several low-power, zoned heating strategies (all with 160 cpsi). Cold-start hydrocarbon emission performance for the aged low cell density, high cell density, and non-straight channel designs (all with full face heating strategies) were found to be equivalent in the under-floor location used on the test vehicle in this program. Zoned heating strategies offered significant power reductions (0.75-1.0 kW compared to 2.0-2.5 kW) at the expense of reduced cold-start hydrocarbon emission performance versus full face heating strategies (ca a 50% NMHC cold-start emission reduction for zoned heating options vs. a 65% NMHC reduction for full face heating, both relative to unheated operation without secondary air injection). Electrical and mechanical durability of integrated EHC cascades were found acceptable in a severe combined hot vibration/thermal cycling protocol. Tighter tailpipe emission standards (in-place and proposed) for both the U.S. and Europe for the late 1990s and beyond continue to focus attention on cold-start emission events especially with respect to hydrocarbon emissions. In the past five years a variety of technologies have evolved or been developed aimed at reducing cold-start hydrocarbon emissions by accelerating the heat-up of catalytic converters after engine start. A significant fraction of this technology development has been associated with electrically heated catalytic converters (EHCs). The SAE literature on EHC development/performance during this decade is substantial, as are the resources dedicated to both the evaluation of the technology by automobile manufacturers and the EHC development effort by suppliers. Recent EHC activities have focused efforts on electrical energy reductions and product/system durability (1-4). This work addresses both of these EHC technology themes. With respect to EHC energy requirements, the performance of several metal foil-based Cam-E-Lite™ EHC/light-off converter cascades (5) were evaluated in this study for FTP emission performance. This comparative study includes EHC design options offering several different heating patterns (covering a range of EHC power levels from 0.75 kW to 2.5 kW) for the front heated zone of these cascade converters. On the high power end of the spectrum are EHC designs that utilize a full frontal inlet face heating strategy, while the low end of the power range utilizes designs offering several zoned heating options. Zoned heating strategies (first introduced by Toyota as their front face heated EHC (6) and later explored by W.R. Grace (7)) reduce EHC energy consumption by concentrating heated elements in small regions of the inlet face. This type of heating strategy attempts to provide sufficient reaction ignition zones distributed on the inlet cascade converter face which provide local oxidation catalysis and subsequent release and transfer of chemical energy. Three different zoned heating options have been evaluated as a part of this program including a hot spot design that makes use of nodal-type resistively heated features. Among the full heated face designs are Cam-E-Lites™ configured with low and high cell density straight flow channels and a low cell density design incorporating a more tortuous herringbone corrugation pattern. These last three design options allow for observations on the impact of cascade geometric area, core weight, and flow geometry on cold-start emission performance. Finally the electrical and mechanical durability of these EHC design options is reviewed. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobile manufacture; Cams; Catalytic converters; Cells; Channel flow; Cytology; Durability; Emission control; Energy utilization; Geometry; Hydrocarbons; Internet protocols; Software testing; Vehicle performance; Vibrations (mechanical); Automobile manufacturers; Comparative studies; Emission performance; Flow channel geometries; Hydrocarbon emission; Mechanical durability; Secondary air injection; Technology development; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072440541

The results of the three-day base case simulation showed good to excellent agreement across the region not only for ozone, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, but also for other pollutants such as peroxyacetyl nitrate and hydrogen peroxide. The effect of the boundary and initial conditions were found to be negligible. The next step was to determine quantitatively the effects of differing levels of ROG and NO(x) controls on O3 and other photo-oxidant levels. Twelve calculations combining different precursor emission levels were performed in order to simulate the effects of controls on ozone peaks, as well as exposure to the various pollutants. The results suggest that reducing NO, emissions, on a percentage basis, is more effective for lowering both ozone peaks and exposure than is reducing ROG. PAN responds in a similar fashion to ozone. Given the model performance, and the fewer limitations involved in using three-dimensional Eulerian models than other methods, this is a powerful tool for conducting further control strategy evaluations.","Air pollution; Control strategies; Ozone; Photochemical modeling","carbon monoxide; hydrogen peroxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; peroxyacetylnitrate; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution control; article; model; photochemical smog; pollution control; priority journal; Switzerland; control strategy; Eulerian photochemical model; nitrogen oxide; ozone evolution; PAN; pollutant concentration; Switzerland, Swiss Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667255

This paper explores the process Cinergy used to develop a greenhouse gas data assembling, tracking, and reporting accounting system. It presents alternative systems explored, a description of the system chosen for implementation, and a review of what worked and what did not work. It presents the current state of the accounting system and Cinergy's long range goals. Cinergy evaluated both external and internal resources for developing a data system which would satisfy its reporting requirements. Various data management software tools were evaluated which included packaged and custom products. Data collection interviews were conducted with all involved departments. Reported data was analyzed for gaps and inconstancies. Plans are to continue to evaluate potential data management systems and to develop a system which will allow remote data input and data analysis for both internal and external reporting.

Subfossil wood fragments underneath living subalpine clonal groups and in a tree-less mire in the Scandes Mountains of Sweden now firmly demonstrate that spruce grew here as early as c. 8000 BP. That is more than 5000 years before inferences of local presence have been made from pollen data. Recurrent speculation of migrational lags can now be refuted in favour of a climate-plant equilibrium prevailing throughout much of the Holocene.

Particularly with buses used in urban areas, reduction methods in black smoke emissions are being researched in addition to the efforts to satisfy the aforementioned PM regulations. The system described in this paper was developed for use mainly with buses in large urban concentrations. The system described in this paper mainly consists of both wall-flow monolith filters for filtration of PM emissions and electric heaters for regeneration. A key feature of this system is that exhaust gas is used for effective combustion of PM during regeneration. With conventional systems, airpumps have been used to feed air for PM combustion during regeneration. With the new system, however, the use of an air pump was discontinued due to durability and cost considerations. Rather, optimization of the exhaust gas flow rate drawn into the filter under regeneration has resulted in regeneration efficiency comparable with those achieved using air pumps. The new system is already in commercial operation with the Yokohama City Transport Bureau. The difficulty of putting DPF systems to practical use has been due to cracking and melting of filters caused by excessive PM accumulation and subsequent increases in temperature in excess of tolerable levels. To prevent these problems, some means of controlling the accumulated PM mass was required. Since bus routes in large urban concentrations follow common patterns, the mass of PM accumulated over a given time period is more or less constant. Thus, the amount of PM accumulated over a given time period can be estimated easily and filter damage can be prevented. Nevertheless, application of the new system to buses in cities with different route patterns from those in large urban concentrations was problematic. To overcome the difficulty of applying the system to buses running on more varied route patterns, a means of sensing the PM accumulation mass with an accuracy of 10% was developed. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Buses; Combustion; Flow of gases; Gases; Mines; Particulate emissions; Wall flow; Commercial operation; Conventional systems; Diesel particulate filters; Electric heater; Particulate matter emissions; Reduction method; Regeneration efficiency; Wall-flow monoliths; Air filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072441925

The model is based on the Gaussian model description of the dispersion of NOx emissions from the power plants. Detailed inorganic and, if desired, organic atmospheric chemistry is included in the model. The plume model has been interfaced with the Urban and Regional Multiscale (URM) model and has been used to quantify the impact of subgrid-scale plume modeling on evolution of ozone and other species in the Northeast. Various simulations were performed in the northeastern United States where there are a large number of power plants over the domain. First, a case was chosen where only one large point source was followed using the subgrid plume model to better identify the local impacts of subgrid treatment. Two simulations were performed for this case; the first included a detailed inorganic chemistry in the plume, whereas the second included only simple NO-NO2-O3 chemistry. A second case was chosen where all point sources emitting more than 25 tons NOx per day were followed independently using the plume model to study the regionwide impact on predicted ozone. In addition to the two plume treatments used in the test above, a third was added that followed the plume chemistry using a full organic plus inorganic mechanism. In this case, the limited-NOx, detailed inorganic and detailed inorganic plus organic chemistry, are compared with the base case where the power plant emissions were injected directly into the airshed grid. Using the subgrid-scale plume model for large point sources had significant local impacts on predicted ozone concentrations, but regionwide impact was very small (less than 2%). Results from the simulation with the detailed organic chemistry found little difference than the detailed inorganic chemistry, though significant local differences were found between those and the simplified NOx chemistry or the calculation without the subgrid-scale treatment.",,"emissions; plumes; air quality; emission source; nitric oxide; plume model; power plant; urban/regional multiscale model; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6144276329

The model was applied to a multiday ozone episode extending from 2 July 1988 to 8 July 1988. The URM model is particularly suitable for application to the Northeast as there is a dense network of urban centers along with large rural areas, and the model allows the use of variable grid sizes to effectively capture the pollutant dynamics while being computationally efficient. This study particularly concentrates on how spatial grid resolution affects results, particularly in the Northeast Corridor, a string of urban centers extending from Washington D.C. to Boston. Three different grid systems are employed in the model simulations to examine this issue. The most dynamic grid system uses grid sizes varying from 4.625 to 74 km, with the finest grids concentrated in the Northeast Corridor. The uniform grid system uses a uniform grid size of 18.5 km similar to that used in the regional oxidant model (ROM). The intermediate grid system uses grid sizes varying from 4.625 to 18.5 km. When finer grids are used over the urban areas, as in the intermediate and the most dynamic grid systems, the model predicted higher peak ozone concentrations with greater detail. Sensitivity calculations were performed to quantify the effect of various inputs on the predicted ozone. Effects of zeroing the initial conditions persisted until 7 July 1988. When using background levels of species concentrations as initial conditions, the effect lasted only for two days of simulation. Boundary conditions impacted the ozone concentrations near the boundary cells only. Emission inputs were the major factor in producing the large concentrations of ozone predicted in the Northeast Corridor. The URM model was also used to study ozone control strategy issues in the Northeast Corridor. A suite of simulations was performed where anthropogenic NOx and VOC emission levels were reduced uniformly over the whole domain to determine the impact on ozone. Both VOC and NOx controls reduced the peak ozone in the Corridor, with NOx control working better than VOC control at high levels of control.","Control strategy; Multiscale modeling; Ozone; Regional modeling","nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; article; model; pollution control; priority journal; rural area; united states; urban area; air quality; multiscale grid resolution; multiscale modelling; ozone level; regional oxidant model; urban/regional multiscale model; USA, (Northeast)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029668226

The simulations were based on ozone concentration estimates made on the basis of data released by the California Air Resources Board concerning projected quantities of emissions from various sources in 2010. Analyses were made of three scenarios. One assumed that LEV, ULEV and ZEV regulations were enforced as planned, a second assumed that these planned regulations were modified; and a third assumed that emission levels from various sources were reduced in line with the goals of the Air Quality Management Plan formulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The results indicate that: (1)the quantity of reactive organic gases (ROG) emitted by vehicles would be cut in half by 2010 by the replacement of older model year vehicles even without the enforcement of the LEV regulations; the LEV regulations would lower the ROG level by another 50%, with the result that the contribution of vehicular emissions to the atmospheric ozone concentration would be reduced to approximately 25%, as compared with 50% in 1987; (2)scaling back the ULEV and ZEV regulations to the LEV level would not seriously affect the projected reduction in the ozone concentration, as the rate of reduction would decrease by less than 1%. The results also show that lowering the ROG level of vehicular emissions has a large effect on reducing the ozone concentration. In contrast, a reduction in NOx emissions has a smaller effect, and some of the data suggest that the ozone concentration might conversely increase under certain conditions. In 2010, when the contribution of vehicular emissions to the ozone level will be smaller, the simulation results suggest that a further reduction in the ozone concentration will most likely require a substantial decrease in the ROG level from non-vehicular emission sources. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Quality management; Vehicles; Air quality improvement; California Air Resources Board; Low emission vehicles; Ozone concentration; Rate of reduction; Simulation studies; South Coast Air Quality Management District; Vehicular emission; Ozone",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072453449

FPL's contract requirements included consideration of unit performance and boiler component life impacts in addition to the traditional emission parameter guarantees. In striving to simultaneously meet all contract requirements, various burner design adjustments were implemented. As the project progressed, much was learned about LNBs and their effects on utility boilers as well as the effects of boiler equipment design and boiler conditions on NOx emission rates.",,"Combustion; Contracts; Gas fired boilers; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Oil fired boilers; Retrofitting; Service life; Low nitrogen oxide burners; Fuel burners",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030407370

In woody plants, the significance of this (species-specific) physiological response to changing CO2 regimes is now repeatedly confirmed, both experimentally and from historical sequences of leaves collected since the onset of industrialization. A corollary of this relationship is that analysis of stomatal parameters on fossil leaves has the potential of determining changes in paleoatmospheric CO2 levels at different time scales. Well-preserved cuticle remains of oak leaves from late Miocene, Pliocene and early Pleistocene sediments of the Lower Rhine Embayment (Germany, The Netherlands) give promise of extending the record of stomatal frequency response to the last 10 Ma. During intervals with warm-temperate to subtropical climatic conditions, oak leaves are characterized by a high stomatal resistance (or low conductance) to CO2 diffusion and low stomatal frequencies; during cooler intervals we observe an opposite picture. Comparison with historical relations between CO2 concentration and stomatal properties suggests that paleoatmospheric CO2 concentrations were not significantly higher than during the last 200 years and fluctuated several times between 280 and 370 ppmv in covariation with contrasting regional climatic conditions. On a global scale, intervals with reduced CO2 levels match glacial pulses characterized by the occurrence of ice-rafted detritus in high-latitude oceanic sediments. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

For both targets, the CH (A2Δ → X2Π) emission, the so-called CH ""4300 Å"" band, was found to have the largest emission cross section with values (at 100 eV) of 5.5×10-19cm2 and 6.1×10-19 cm2 for TMS and HMDSO, respectively.

Studies with the electron microscope provide insight into development of mucilage (slime) by the cells of the root cap and its function during geotropic growth. Additional field work was carried out mainly in the Kalahari of South Africa and in Namibia. The first function of the root is to utilise the temporary overproduction of carbohydrate by the shoot. Therefore, any shoot damage which decreases its carbohydrate production also decreases root development. The most important role of the root cap or the root pocket is to protect the root body against external water uptake. Therefore, water roots have the largest root cap or a large root pocket. The mucilage of the root cap increases its protection of the root body against premature water uptake and loss of substances supplied by the shoot. An intensive and rapid cell division in the rhizodermis takes place near the end of the mucilage covered root cap before the external water uptake takes place. In general, every passive or active bending of the root tip is accompanied or caused by an asymmetry of the root cap and/or its mucilage. Without storage water and without water uptake from the outside, no passive bending or active positive geotropic bending takes place. Consequently water is the decesive substance during the key phases of root development - exploiting the environment for nutrients stabilising the whole plant-soil-development and ensuring plant protection.","Climatic condition; Geotropism; Root cap; Rooting form",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644391332

To clarify this issue, we measured the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia in hypertensive patients with various degrees of leukoaraiosis. The subjects consisted of 7 normotensive normal controls and 17 hypertensive patients. The hypertensive patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of white matter lesions (leukoaraiosis) on MRI and the presence of dementia, namely, (1) negative or mild leukoaraiosis without dementia, (2) moderate to severe leukoaraiosis without dementia and (3) severe leukoaraiosis with dementia. Both the rCBF and the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia were measured by the O-15 H2O bolus-injection method and positron emission tomography. The rCBF in hypertensive patients without dementia did not decrease when compared with the normotensive controls, but the rCBF in hypertensive patients with dementia markedly decreased in the cerebral cortices and white matter. On the other hand, the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia declined with the severity of leukoaraiosis, and it decreased most severely in patients with severe leukoaraiosis and dementia. Our results indicate that the reduction in the cerebral hemodynamic reserve capacity has a close relationship with the severity of leukoaraiosis in hypertensive patients, although the rCBF is maintained in hypertensive patients without dementia, and suggest that arteriosclerotic change reduces cerebrovascular CO2 response and causes a leukoaraiosis in hypertensive patients.","cerebral blood flow; cerebrovascular response; hypercapnia; hypertension; leukoaraiosis; positron emission tomography","adult; aged; article; brain blood flow; cardiovascular autoregulation; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; hypercapnia; hypertension; leukoaraiosis; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029842055

The purpose of the present study therefore was to access whether CO is capable of regulating the secretion of the hypothalamic releasing factor, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). To this end, medial basal hypothalami were obtained from estrogen-primed ovariectomized adult rats and incubated in vitro for a 1 hour preincubation period followed by a 30 minute incubation with either vehicle or test compounds. The media was then collected for GnRH determination by RIA. Hematin, a heme molecule cleaved by hems oxygenase (HO) to yield CO, dose- dependently stimulated GnRH release with 50 μM being the lowest effective dose. The effect of hematin was not due to a toxic effect as all groups responded to KCL stimulation at the end of the experiment. The effect of hematin required HO cleavage as evidenced by the fact that the HO inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), blocked the effect of hematin on GnRH release. The effect of hematin appeared to be due to its conversion to CO, as the CO scavenger molecule, hemoglobin, completely reversed the effect of hematin. Finally, the effect of hematin did not appear to be due to the generation of the other HO-generated product (biliverdin) since biliverdin dose-dependently inhibited GnRH release.

Because of the integral relationship between photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a genetic defect in the RPE could lead to structural changes in rod outer segment (ROS) membranes. To detect such changes we examined a series of samples consisting of purified ROS membranes, their extracted lipids, and rhodopsin derived from the normal and RCS rats. Methods. FTIR spectroscopy was employed to deduce structural information from ROS membranes. Results. ROS membranes from normal and RCS rats contain predominantly glycero-phospholipids, whereas sphingo-lipids are present as a minor component. The phospholipid composition of the dystrophic rat ROS was altered probably from debris accumulation. These changes are localized primarily to the phospholipid structure of the ROS membrane. Similar changes in phospholipids were observed in bovine ROS membranes when subjected to oxidative damage. The retinal dystrophy also induced numerous other changes to ROS membranes i.e. change in hydrocarbon order and membrane fluidity, altered phase transition temperature (∼ +7°C in ROS and ∼ -15°C in ROS devoid of rhodopsin), faster H-D exchange, decreased carbonyl and tyrosine hydrogen-bonding which may diminish lipid-rhodopsin contacts contributing to ROS dysfunction. However, retinal dystrophy has little or no effect on rhodopsin structure. It's major topographical feature i.e. seven α-helical configuration remains largely intact even under conditions of photobleaching, thermal and chemical insults. Conclusions. Altered ROS membrane structure localized primarily to phospholipids seen under pathological conditions of retinal dystrophy may be triggered by the oxidation of the lipid hydrocarbon chain double bonds.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750194488

Density-independent weather effects can have important consequences for the demography of terrestrial herbivores because precipitation, temperature and insolation influence plant phenology, forage quality and biomass production, which in turn affects the habitat carrying capacity. Since forage digestibility influences intake and weight gain, life-history traits of young, growing animals are likely to reflect variation in the prevailing weather. 2. This paper specifically investigates spatial and temporal variation in age at maturation in female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway in relation to climate variables known to influence primary production. Our findings are corroborated by analysing differences in age at maturation in 21 cohorts of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland. 3. In Norway the majority of females ovulated as yearlings and calved for the first time as 2-year-olds. The proportion calving for the first time at two years varied from 0.23 to 0.67 between regions and fluctuated from 0.46 to 0.76 between cohorts. On Rum, where age of maturation wits delayed at least a year, the proportion calving for the first tithe as 3-year-olds varied between cohorts from 0.0 to 0.89. 4. In a subset of yearlings culled in Norway at the time of conception, the spatial and temporal differences in ovulation rates were related to the geographical and annual variation in body weight. 5. Both the spatial and temporal variation in the proportion of 2-year-olds calving in Norway, and cohort differences in the proportion calving as 3-year-olds on Rum, were negatively related to variation in May-June degree days 12 months earlier. 6. Although primary production on the preferred herb-rich Agrostis Festuca grasslands was positively correlated with temperature in May and June on Rum, the proportion of females calving as three years old, was negatively correlated with annual differences in May-June primary production. 7. We argue that retarded phenological development, during periods of cooler weather, enhances diet quality because leaf:stem ratios and digestibility of plant parts decline more slowly. Thus, weight gain during the early summer growth spurt should be rapid during cool May June weather, increasing the probability of conception in the autumn. 8. Since density-independent variation in food availability also influences fitness components which commonly have a more pronounced influence on population demography, for example offspring survival, we argue that our results highlight the potential importance of variation in weather on herbivore abundance.","climate; diet quality; plant phenology; red deer; reproduction","breeding; primary production; Norway; UK, Scotland, Inner Hebrides, Rhum; Agrostis; Cervus elaphus; Festuca; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030304594

A number of coal-based power plants (total capacity of more than 4000 MW) are located near Lake Wabamun in central Alberta, Canada. A hydrogeological study of the sedimentary succession at the site was undertaken to identify and select aquifers which meet various requirements for CO2 disposal, particularly with respect to depth and confinement. The multi-phase, multi-component numerical model STARS was used to study the ability of the selected aquifers to accept and retain for long periods of time large quantities of CO2 injected in a supercritical state. The CO2 injectivity of the selected aquifers was examined for a whole series of parameters, including aquifer depth and thickness, rock and formation water properties, and injection characteristics. The numerical simulations indicate that even generally low-permeability aquifers can accept and retain large quantities of CO2, showing that injection of CO2 in a supercritical state into deep aquifers in sedimentary basins is a viable option and may be the best short-to-medium term solution for reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The CO2 injectivity is enhanced by the existence of 'sweet' zones of high permeability.","Aquifers; CO2 disposal; Hydrogeological; Numerical simulations; Sedimentary basins",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000081020

There is no global long-term trend in any rainfall change over the period of instrumental record (c. 150 years), but there has been an increase of 0.5°C in global temperature over the past 100 years. This increase seems partly due to urbanization, as there is no evidence of it resulting from atmospheric pollution by CO2 and other warming gases (SO2, NO2, CH4, CFH etc.). On the other hand, the thermal increase is uneven, increasing with latitudes above 40°N and S. The increase is only slight or non-existent in subtropical and inter-tropical latitudes where most arid and semi-arid lands lie. This, incidently, is consistent with Global Circulation Models (GCM) - derived scenarios. The study of tree-rings, lake level fluctuations and pollen analysis confirm the existence of climatic fluctuations, but with no long-term trends over the past 2000 years. A possible increase of 1-3°C in arid lands over the next 50 years due to a doubling of the CO2 content of the lower atmosphere to 700 p.p.m., as assumed by most scenarios stemming from GCM, would increase global potential evapo-transpiration (PET) by some 75-225 mm year-1. The ratio of mean annual precipitation to PET would then decrease by about 4-5%, assuming that no substantial changes in rainfall took place in arid and semiarid lands. However, the impact of CO2 on plants would boost photosynthesis and, therefore, primary productivity; it would also increase water-use efficiency via the reduction of stomatal conductance. It is therefore at present difficult to predict the net balance of these two opposite consequences or to prophesy which phenomenon would prevail: increased aridity or higher productivity and more efficient water use. At all events, the possible effect of a climatic fluctuation (or change) of the magnitude envisaged would have a trivial consequence on arid environments, as compared with the past and present impact of humans and their livestock. Drought has always been a normal recurrent event in arid and semi-arid lands. Strategies and tactics to mitigate its consequences via improved land-use and management practices are analysed.","arid lands; bioclimatology; desertization; drought mitigation; erosion; land degradation; land management; range management; vegetation depletion","arid land; arid lands; arid region; climate change; climatic change; desertification; drought; evapotranspiration",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030251329

Because of its societal importance, snowfall is a logical variable to be used as an indicator of potential global environmental change. This study investigates the mechanisms responsible for large observed snowfall increases across the eastern Great Lakes region of the USA. Results indicate that mean snowfall amounts across sections of western New York and north-western Pennsylvania have increased by up to 100 cm over the 60-year period encompassing the snowfall seasons 1930-1931 through to 1989-1990. A synoptic climatological approach is utilized to identify consistent synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns responsible for snowfall across the region. Nine synoptic types are identified as producing significant snowfall in the study area; five with synoptic characteristics indicative of lake-effect snowfall and four evidencing characteristics of snowfall associated with cyclonic influence. An examination of the seasonal frequency of the nine synoptic types indicates a substantial increase in the frequency of the five lake-effect synoptic types and a long-term decrease in the numbers of cyclone synoptic types over the period 1950-1951 through to 1981-1982. Information concerning trends in the frequency and the intensity of each of the nine snowfall-producing synoptic types was combined to produce a modelled snowfall change due to frequency and intensity variations over the period. Trends in the frequency and intensity of the synoptic patterns associated with lake-effect snowfall explain the majority of the observed snowfall increase across the region. Variations in the synoptic types associated with cyclonically induced snowfall are shown to be unimportant to snowfall changes across the eastern Great Lakes area. Possible reasons for increases in the frequency and the intensity of the lake-effect synoptic types are discussed.","Great Lakes; Lake-effects; North-east USA; Snowfall; Synoptic typing","cyclone; lake effect; snowfall; synoptic typing; USA, Great Lakes, Lake Erie; USA, Great Lakes, Lake Ontario",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030408166

Academy of Sciences of Ukraine","Lebedev, A.V., E.O.Paton Electric Welding Institute, Natl. Academy of Sciences of Ukraine","The review starts with a brief description of the general concepts of arc welding. The most frequent weld defects are considered and the main causes of these defects are indicated. Next, various disturbances are described which influence the welding process and cause most of the defects. It is stated that defect formation is most probable in the case of the simultaneous action of several, albeit relatively small, disturbances. The disturbances which develop in the arc power circuit are considered. These are caused by unstable feeding of the electrode wire, the speed of the arc displacement, and the deviation of the electrode wire from the butt axis. Special attention is paid to the disturbances caused by the involuntary movements of the welder's hand in semi-automatic welding. Filming was used to study the changes of the electrode stick-out H and the welding speed v in the downhand and vertical positions. Change of H changes the speed of the wire moving to the workpiece by -dH/dt. When downhand welding is performed by a qualified welder, this value can be equal to 30-50 % of the wire feed rate. The welding speed varies over about the same range. When making the vertical welds, the welder moves the electrode along quite complex trajectories, in order to prevent the molten metal from pouring down. The resultant deviations of the welding current and voltage from the optimum values drastically impair the metal transfer conditions and lead to two or three times greater losses of metal for spatter. Various methods have been proposed for controlling the wire feed rate and the welding stresses, in order to reduce the metal losses and lower operator fatigue. The instability of the dimensions of the electrode metal drops is also a destabilizing factor. The disturbances, caused by the poor quality of the surface preparation and the assembly of the parts to be joined, can only partially be compensated for by means of the automatic control. Serf-regulation of the arc is next considered. It is shown that the nature of this phenomenon strongly depends on the type of electrode metal transfer. A block diagram is given of the serf-regulation process which responds to the influence of the change of electrode stick-out length and the heat evolution in it. Special consideration is given to the short-circuiting transfer. The mathematical models of the self-regulation process which are required for analysis and synthesis of the automatic control systems are presented. Systems with non-linear welding circuit inductance and resistance, which depend on the value of the welding current, are being introduced for CO2 welding in order to reduce spatter and widen the lower range of the welding current. Their properties have been studied and the effectiveness of their application is shown. Systems with one control action, more perfect systems with two control actions, and 'single-button' systems are considered. The conditions of stability of these systems and their rational applications are determined analytically. Systems designed for application under conditions when variation of electrode stick-out over a wide range is inevitable are also analyzed. It is shown that the use of control action on the wire feed rate in such systems enables the region of stable operation to be expanded and metal losses to be reduced. The next two sections are devoted to systems of automatic control of the transfer of the electrode metal into the weld pool. The physical principles of the phenomenon of transfer are described, both with and without short-circuiting of the arc gap. In particular, the conditions are determined for the formation of a molten metal bridge between the electrode and the pool and for its breaking up under the action of the electromagnetic forces. The control algorithms for various types of transfer have been formulated. The developed mathematical model was used to study the CO2 welding process, in which the energy spent for electrode wire melting is metered out. The powering of the arc by pulses of current with constant amplitude and duration promotes the formation of drops of constant mass. This prevents the formation of large drops which can be projected beyond the weld pool by the electrodynamic forces and plasma flows. Information on the high effectiveness of applying the automatic control systems is given. The influence of the inductance, L, and ohmic resistance, R, of the welding circuit is considered for two kinds of metal transfer, namely, with and without short-circuiting. It is shown that even in the case of a fine-drop transfer the resistance and inductance quantities play a very important role in the processes of metal melting and transfer. The features of nonconsumable electrode welding process control are described. Information on the effective methods of controlling the weld solidification is given. In butt welding it is often necessary to stabilize the through penetration. The principles of the construction of automatic stabilization systems are described. A separate section is devoted to automation of the guidance of the electrode along the butt and to sensors of the electrode position relative to the butt. The arc making transverse oscillations is also considered as such a sensor. A method of calculation for determination of the optimum frequency of oscillations is given. In conclusion, the general issues of technological adaptation of the automatic welding machines, including those incorporated into industrial robots, are considered. The Appendix gives, in reference form, the fundamentals of those sections of the automatic control theory which deal with the transfer functions and block diagrams, the information on which is used in this review. A considerable number of papers dealing with the subject being reviewed here have been published in journals in recent years. There are also the summing-up monographs and manuals, which, to a certain extent, cover the subject of automatic control of arc welding. However, the most recent of these were published eight to ten years ago in Russian and are little known outside the CIS countries.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9144265930

The hypothesis states that DMS is transferred to the atmosphere and is oxidised to form airborne particles. Some of these grow large enough to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) which help determine cloud droplet concentration. The latter has a strong influence on cloud albedo and hence on the radiation balance of the area affected. In summer, the central Arctic is a specially favourable region for studying the natural sulfur cycle in that the open waters surrounding the pack ice are the only significant sources of DMS and there are almost no anthropogenic particle sources. Concentrations of seawater and atmospheric DMS decreased at about the same rate during the period of measurements, (1 August to 6 October, latitudes 75° N to 90°N) spanning about three orders of magnitude. Methane sulfonate and non-sea salt sulfate in the submicrometer particles, which may be derived from atmospheric DMS. also decreased similarly, suggesting that the first part of the hypothesis under test was true. Influences on cloud droplet concentration and radiation balance could not be measured. Size-resolved aerosol chemistry showed a much lower proportion of methane sulfonate to be associated with supermicrometer particles than has been found elsewhere. Its molar ratio to non-sea salt sulfate suggested that the processes controlling the particulate chemistry do not exhibit a net temperature dependence. Elemental analysis of the aerosol also revealed the interesting possibility that debris from Siberian rivers transported on the moving ice represent a fairly widespread source of supermicrometer crustal material within the pack ice. Highly resolved measurements of aerosol number size distributions were made in the diameter range 3 nm to 500 nm. 3 distinct modal sizes were usually present, the ""ultrafine"", ""Aitken"" and ""accumulation"" modes centred on 14, 45 and 170nm diameter, respectively. The presence of ultrafine particles, implying recent production, was more frequent than has been found in lower latitude remote marine areas. Evidence suggests that they were mixed to the surface from higher levels. Sudden and often drastic changes in aerosol concentration and size distribution were surprisingly frequent in view of the relatively slowly changing meteorology of the central Arctic during the study period and the absence of strong pollution sources. They were most common in particles likely to have taken part in cloud formation (> 80 nm diameter). 2 factors appear to have been involved in these sudden changes. The 1st was the formation of vertical gradients in aerosol concentration due to interactions between particles and clouds or favoured regions for new particle production during periods of stability. The 2nd was sporadic localised breakdowns of the stability, bringing changed particle concentrations to the measurement level. Probable reasons for these sporadic mixing events were indicated by the structure of the Marine Boundary-Layer (MBL) investigated with high resolution rawinsondes. Low level jets were present about 60% of the time, producing conditions conductive to turbulence and shear-induced waves. It is concluded that an even more detailed study of meteorological processes in the MBL in conjunction with more highly time-resolved measurements of gas-aerosol physics and chemistry appears to be essential in any future research aimed at studying the indirect, cloud mediated, effect of aerosol particles.",,"aerosols; atmospheric particulates; atmospheric research programme; cloud albedo; cloud condensation nuclei; condensation nuclei; dimethyl/sulphide; dimethylsulphide; global sulphur cycle; IAOE-91; International Arctic Ocean Expedition; research programmes; Arctic Ocean",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750862

If a combustor is not well designed and operated, it may emit too high a level of TCBs. Categories of TCBs and some example constituents are as follows: 1. Acid gas: HCl, NO(χ) and SO2; 2. Organics: Hydrocarbons such as dioxins and furans (PCDDs and PCDFs); 3. Particulates: Trace metals (conventional metals and radioactive metals) and soots; 4. Contaminants in ash; and 5. Contaminants in spent wastewater. Pollutants in Category (2) above are generally considered to be the products of incomplete combustion (PICs) in the field of hazardous waste incineration. TCBs has been one of the major technical and sociological issues surrounding the use of incineration as a waste treatment alternative. Because of the complexity and controversy, the U.S. EPA issued a draft 'Combustion Strategy' on May 18, 1993. The objective of the 'Combustion Strategy' was to address the needs of and to outline the approaches for upgrading the existing incineration standards to better control TCB emissions. This article lists those chemicals and metals which are regulated by two major U.S. environmental laws, namely, the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. The CAAA is to regulate the air emissions from major sources, and the RCRA is to protect human health and the environment from the management of solid wastes, particularly from waste incineration.

The Climate Change Action Plan commits the USA to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 106 x 106 Mg C yr-1 by the year 2000. One suggestion for reducing net emissions is to convert marginal grass pastures to pine (Pinus spp.) plantations in the South-Central USA. We used the Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model to estimate the amount of atmospheric C that could be sequestered by this suggested change in land use. Carbon flow dynamics at each of 100 randomly selected sites were simulated for 50 yr under two assumptions: (i) continuous pasture for 50 yr or (ii) pine plantations harvested every 25 yr. Carbon sequestered by conversion to pine plantations was calculated as the net change in off-site storage (i.e., in long-lived products and landfills), plus the change in soil organic C, plus (for the first harvest period) stand establishment. Average C-sequestration (±SE) was 40 ±2 and 18 ± 2 Mg C ha-1 for the first and second 25-yr harvest periods, respectively. In contrast, sequestration would have been 8.3 ± 0.6 Mg C ha-1 as soil organic C if the sites had been left in continuous pasture for 50 yr, or 3 Mg C ha-1 after correcting for release of C during manufacture of N-fertilizer. Extrapolated to the region, conversion of 3.6 x 106 ha of marginal grass pasture to pine plantations could sequester 5.6 x 106 C yr-1 for the first 25 yr and 1.1 x 106 Mg for the second 25 yr. If all types of marginal agricultural land in the region (4.6 x 106 ha) were converted to forestry, the corresponding sequestration rates would be 7.4 x 106 and 1.4 x 106 Mg C yr-1. In contrast, maintaining the land in continuous pasture would sequester 0.3 x 106 Mg C yr-1.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029790014

The computations have supplied a complete description of the seven isolated-pentagon-rule (IPR) isomers of C80 (i.e., a system not yet observed) at the semiempirical AM1 and SAM1 levels; their energetics was also evaluated at ab initio Hartree-Fock level in small basis sets. The ground-state structure of the system possesses a D5d symmetry, but at supposed synthetic conditions a structure of D2 symmetry is the most populated, i.e. temperature represents an important factor in the stability relationships. One of the IPR isomers exhibits an Ih topological symmetry, but it undergoes a Jahn-Teller distortion and its symmetry is actually reduced to D2, The C59 serves as an example of odd-numbered carbon clusters, and new rules are reported for the pentagon/hexagon pattern in the odd clusters, yielding a variable number of the pentagons. Moreover, other rings are considered and the computed ground state of the system in fact contains an eight-membered ring (while the next lowest species exhibits a nine-membered ring). Their relative stabilities are not very sensitive to temperature. Altogether 19 isomers of C59 are treated at the AMI level. In contrast to even-numbered fullerenes, with odd fullerenes the cages cannot be built from three-coordinated carbon atoms only. Hence, we have to allow for two- or even four-coordinated atoms. For example, if we consider one two-coordinated carbon atom (and the rest three-coordinated) the number of pentagons drops to 10. If we allow for just one four-coordinated atom, the number of pentagons changes to 14. Let the number of two-coordinated carbon atoms be p, and the number of four-coordinated q. If we still allow only for pentagons and hexagons, it holds for the number of pentagons n5 = -2p + 2q + 12. © 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3743066424

In this paper we assess the impacts of large-scale global utilization of biomass on regional and grid scale land cover, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon cycle. We have implemented in the global environmental change model IMAGE the LESS biomass intensive scenario, which was developed for the Second Assessment Report of IPCC. This scenario illustrates the potential for reducing energy related emission by different sets of fuel mixes and a higher energy efficiency. Our analysis especially covers different consequences involved with such modern biomass scenarios. We emphasize influences of CO2 concentrations and climate change on biomass crop yield, land use, competition between food and biomass crops, and the different interregional trade patterns for modern biomass based energy. Our simulations show that the original LESS scenario is rather optimistic on the land requirements for large-scale biomass plantations. Our simulations show that 797 Mha is required while the original LESS scenario is based on 550 Mha. Such expansion of agricultural land will influence deforestation patterns and have significant consequences for environmental issues, such as biodiversity. Altering modern biomass requirements and the locations where they are grown in the scenario shows that the outcome is sensitive for regional emissions and feedbacks in the C cycle and that competition between food and modern biomass can be significant. We conclude that the cultivation of large quantities of modern biomass is feasible, but that its effectiveness to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases has to be evaluated in combination with many other environmental land use and socioeconomic factors.",,"alternative energy; biomass; biomass power; carbon cycle; carbon emissions; emission; energy source; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; land cover; landcover impact; modelling approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301219

Graphitization was complete by the lowest grade of metamorphism attained in the area (∼ 450°C and 450 MPa). In low-grade rocks, graphite occurs as inclusions within calcite and along grain boundaries, and in medium-grade rocks, it concentrates near porphyroblasts. In neither suite does graphite form interconnected networks. Average reduced carbon abundances are 4400 and 2800 ppm for the low- and medium-grade rocks, respectively. High-grade rocks are almost void of graphite, except for one specimen. The δ13C values were determined for graphite and' carbonates and δ18O values were determined for the carbonates and silicate residues. There is no change in isotopic values between low- and medium-grade rocks. In contrast, high-grade rocks show marked decreases in δ13C and δ18O values of ∼4 % compared to low- and medium-grade rocks. Both isotopic analyses and graphite depletion in high-grade rocks were caused by influx of large quantities of magmatic water during peak metamorphism. Electrical conductivity was measured in the laboratory on representative specimens. Rocks with high carbon content (&gt; 7000 ppm) from both the low- and high-grade zones display almost an order of magnitude higher electrical conductivity than expected from their fluid content alone. Graphite does not form an interconnected network in these rocks, yet it combines with the saline fluids to significantly increase electrical conductivities.

The cost for abatement of these emissions to comply with state and federal requirements was estimated at $12 to $15 million. Management refused to accept these costs. All opportunities for source reduction were studied to reduce the cost of compliance. Significant compliance problems were anticipated from topcoats, primers, clean-up solvents and spray gun cleaning. A multi-discipline R&D team, technology sharing among aerospace industries and installation of new process equipment were utilized to achieve cost effective solutions to the VOC emissions problem and avoid the cost penalties of abatement. The VOC reduction program utilized the knowledge of materials and process researchers; paint/coating engineers; environmental engineers; production management; and outside consultants. Advances were made in both air emissions reduction and solid waste generation. Opportunities for recycle of solvents and paint removal materials were identified.

The model constructors are facing a lot of uncertainties which limit the evidence of these models. The support of climate policy decision-making is only possible in a semi-quantitative way, as presented by a Fuzzy model. The model design is based on an optimization approach, integrated in a bounded risk decision-making framework. Given some regional emission-related and impact-related restrictions, optimal emission paths can be calculated. The focus is not only on carbon dioxide but on other greenhouse gases too. In the paper, the components of the model will be described. Cost coefficients, emission boundaries and impact boundaries are represented as Fuzzy parameters. The Fuzzy model will be transformed into a computational one by using an approach of Rommelfanger. In the second part, some problems of applying the model to computations will be discussed. This includes discussions on the data situation and the presentation, as well as interpretation of results of sensitivity analyses. The advantage of the Fuzzy approach is that the requirements regarding data precision are not so strong. Hence, the effort for data acquisition can be reduced and computations can be started earlier. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Climate policy-making; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Decision-making; Fuzzy logic; Global warming; Modelling; Risk aversion","environmental policy; fuzzy logic; fuzzy optimization model; global warming; modelling approach; policy making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667888

In this study, we construct a large uncertainty space that includes the possibility of large and/or abrupt climate changes and/or of technology breakthroughs that radically reduce projected abatement costs. We use computational experiments on a linked system of climate and economic models to compare the performance of a simple adaptive strategy - one that can make midcourse corrections based on observations of the climate and economic systems - and two commonly advocated 'best-estimate' policies based on different expectations about the long-term consequences of climate change. We find that the 'Do-a- Little' and 'Emissions-Stabilization' best-estimate policies perform well in the respective regions of the uncertainty space where their estimates are valid, but can fail severely in those regions where their estimates are wrong. In contrast, the adaptive strategy can make midcourse corrections and avoid significant errors. While its success is no surprise, the adaptive- strategy approach provides an analytic framework to examine important policy and research issues that will likely arise as society adapts to climate change, which cannot be easily addressed in studies using best-estimate approaches.",,"abatement cost; climate change; climate policy; cost-benefit analysis; modelling approach; policy analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029662964

This research program, known as CRYSYS (CRYospheric SYStem), is focussing on monitoring surface snow and ice conditions in order to monitor climate-driven processes that influence the cryosphere. One component of the cryosphere that is of particular interest is permafrost. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate three supervised classification schemes (maximum likelihood, evidential reasoning, and a neural network) in the prediction and mapping of depth to late-summer frozen ground (DTFG) in the widespread discontinuous permafrost zone of the boreal forest of central Yukon. Source imagery used in the classifications was composed of TM- and DEM-derived data known to be correlated with DTFG. Results of a two-class DTFG experiment indicate that all tested classifiers are suitable for generating two-class correlative DTFG data products in the Mayo region. The neural network classifier was found to be most successful, producing a two-class DTFG image with a 93% agreement rate between predicted and field-measured DTFG classes. Land cover and equivalent latitude were consistently found to be especially useful sources for use in the classifications. When three DTFG classes were used, agreement rates greatly decreased for all classifiers, supporting field observations that suggest that only two DTFG classes exist in the study area. © 1996 Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing/Journal canadien de télédétection.",,"Climatology; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Permafrost; Snow; Statistical methods; Cryospheric System research program; Depth to late summer frozen ground classification; Remote sensing; classification; cryosphere; DEM; neural netowrk; permafrost; research programme; supervised classification; TM data; Canada, Yukon Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030157232

I and Streblospio benedicti are infaunal, deposit-feeding polychaetes that occur in estuaries and littoral wetlands throughout much of the United States. Life table response experiments (sensu Caswell 1989a) were carried out in the laboratory to compare the demographic responses of these species to three common sources of estuarine contamination or enrichment: sewage (Milorganite), blue-green algae (Spirulina sp.), and hydrocarbons (No. 2 fuel oil). Life table data were used to generate two population projection models (a fully age-classified model and a simple two-stage model) for each species in each treatment and in a salt marsh sediment control. These models were used to quantify the effects of treatments on survival, reproduction, and age at maturity, and hence on population growth rate. For both species, survival was high in all treatments except the blue-green algae treatment, where oxygen depletion (to <1 mL/L) occurred. Treatments had dramatic effects on age at maturity, fertility, and generation time, which differed between species and among contaminants. Population growth rates (λ) were higher in Capitella sp. I than in S. benedicti for all treatments, primarily due to earlier maturation and a fertility advantage exhibited by Capitella during the first few weeks of reproduction. In Capitella sp. I, explosive increases in λ were seen in the sewage (λ = 5.31) and algae (λ = 2.81) enrichments relative to the control (λ = 1.86) and the hydrocarbon treatments (λ - 1.67). Reduced maturation time and increases in age-specific fertility associated with rapid growth and large body size were responsible. Hydrocarbons reduced λ primarily through delayed maturation and reduced age-specific fertility. Population growth rates of S. benedicti in the hydrocarbon treatment (λ - 1.11) and algae treatment (λ - 1.09) were reduced relative to the control (λ = 1.46) and sewage treatments (λ - 1.41). The hydrocarbon reduction resulted from delayed maturity and reduced fertility, whereas the algal effects were caused by reductions in both juvenile survival and fertility. Our analyses revealed that Capitella sp I's population growth rate was less sensitive than that of S. benedicti to these three common forms of estuarine contamination, that different sources of organic enrichment (sewage and blue-green algae) introduced at the same C and N levels could have varying demographic effects and that when two contaminants (hydrocarbons and blue-green algae) caused similar reductions in population growth rate in a species (Streblospio), the underlying mechanisms may have differed. For both species all demographically important effects of contaminants occurred early in life, suggesting a need to focus on juveniles and young adults in field and laboratory testing The experiments performed here demonstrated the sensitivity of polychaete demographic properties to the condition of estuarine sediments. This sensitivity may be exploited to evaluate organic enrichment and hydrocarbon contamination in field settings.","Age at maturity; Capitella sp.

Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States","Between 1971 and 1992, growth in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from buildings varied widely by region, ranging from 0.9% per year in the industrialized countries to 0.7% per year in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and 5.9% per year in developing countries. This paper outlines energy efficiency improvements for buildings and the overall technical potential to reduce CO2 emissions by cutting growth in energy consumption in buildings. Three scenarios of future buildings CO2 emissions in 2020 were developed. Under the business as usual scenario, buildings emissions increase 90% over 1990 levels. A scenario that involves adopting more efficient energy using practices and technologies is estimated to produce CO2 emissions 50% above 1990 levels. A scenario with powerful incentives for energy efficiency could lead to CO2 emissions 28% above 1990 levels. Much of the CO2 growth is the result of population growth and growth in energy services, especially in developing countries. Policy instruments to reduce energy use and related CO2 emissions include real increases in energy prices, aggressive use of energy efficiency policies, major programs to transfer knowledge, technology, and tools for transforming markets to the developing world and continued efforts to pursue research and development in technologies and practices to increase energy efficiency in buildings.

To examine how seasonal changes in the environment affect the response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2, we grew Pinus taeda L. seedlings for three growing seasons in open-top chambers continuously maintained at either ambient or ambient + 30 Pa CO2. Seedlings were grown in the ground, under natural conditions of light, temperature and nutrient and water availability. Photosynthetic capacity was measured bimonthly using net photosynthetic rate vs. intercellular CO2 partial pressure (A-Ci) curves. Maximum Rubisco activity (Vcmax) and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration capacity mediated by electron transport (Jmax) and phosphate regeneration (PiRC) were calculated from A-Ci curves using a biochemically based model. Rubisco activity, activation state and content, and leaf carbohydrate, chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations were measured concurrently with photosynthesis measurements. This paper presents results from the second and third years of treatment. Mean leaf nitrogen concentrations ranged from 13.7 to 23.8 mg g-1, indicating that seedlings were not nitrogen deficient. Relative to ambient CO2 seedlings, elevated CO2 increased light-saturated net photosynthetic rates 60-110% during the summer, but &lt; 30% during the winter. A relatively strong correlation between leaf temperature and the relative response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2 suggests a strong effect of leaf temperature. During the third growing season, elevated CO2 reduced Rubisco activity 30% relative to ambient CO2 seedlings, nearly completely balancing Rubisco and RuBP-regeneration regulation of photosynthesis. However, reductions in Rubisco activity did not eliminate the seasonal pattern in the relative response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2. These results indicate that seasonal differences in the relative response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2 are likely to occur in natural systems. © 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd.","Elevated carbon dioxide; Field study; Net photosynthetic rate; Pinus taeda; Seasonal response",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000101792

In addition to excitation wavelength, molecular weight, and polystyrene concentration dependencies, CO2 density also strongly affects the emission spectral contours. A major increase in the steady-state fluorescence intensity and a significant decrease in the polystyrene 320- to 365-nm fluorescence intensity ratio are observed when CO2 density is increased. Concentration and conformational changes in the polystyrene molecules are used to explain the observations, and these results are proposed to arise from changes in the plasticization power of supercritical CO2 over the density range studied. A theoretical model is proposed that is based on the assumption that, at low CO2 densities and low polymer concentrations, polystyrene intermolecular interactions are negligible. The proposed model is able to fit our observed fluorescence data from a CO2 reduced density of 0.3 to 1.4.","Conformational changes; Fluorescence; Polystyrene; Supercritical fluids","Carbon dioxide; Composition effects; Conformations; Density (specific gravity); Emission spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Mathematical models; Molecular structure; Molecular weight; Plasticizers; Intermolecular interactions; Plasticization; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Polystyrenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030156592

Engine exhaust emissions of NOx, HC, CO, CO2 and particulates were measured at two different injection timings. The results show that the single cylinder engine behaves similarly as a number of multi-cylinder production engines. The 8-mode simulation was also shown to produce exhaust emissions close to those obtained from the EPA transient test procedure. The cetane number response of the research engine indicates that an increase in cetane number of the fuel with cetane improvers reduced NOx emissions but increased particulate emissions. The response of the research engine to different aromatic contents suggests that cetane number, total aromatic content and the sum of the di-aromatic and the poly-aromatic contents are the major fuel properties affecting NOx emissions. For particulate emissions, the sum of the di-aromatic content and the poly-aromatic content is the major factor.

Some of the possible consequences of elevated temperature on malaria transmission are examined in the present review. A simple mathematical model is first used to examine the effect of temperature on the ability of Anopheles maculipennis to transmit vivax malaria. This indicates that small increases in temperature at low temperatures may increase the risk of transmission substantially. This is important, since vulnerable communities, poorly protected by health services, in areas of unstable or no malaria are likely to be at increased risk of future outbreaks. In contrast, areas of stable transmission may be little affected by rising temperature. It is thought that global warming will lead to coastal flooding, changes in precipitation and, indirectly, changes in land use. Just how these changes will effect transmission at a regional level requires an understanding of the ecology of local vectors, since environmental changes which favour malaria transmission in one vector species may reduce it in another. Methods for predicting future changes in malaria in different regions are discussed, highlighting the need for further research in this area. Most importantly, there is a need for researchers to validate the accuracy of the models used for predicting malaria and to confirm the assumptions on which the models are based.",,"Anopheles; climate; disease transmission; greenhouse effect; land use; malaria; mathematical model; parasite vector; Plasmodium vivax; precipitation; review; temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030466019

Provincial data were also used to assess the relation between climatic factors and synchrony in the population fluctuations. To enable the statistical analysis, the number of the 12 climate variables was reduced to three non-correlating principal components. A bootstrap method was used both for parameter estimation and for assessing statistical significance level when comparing the tetraonid synchrony with the climate data. For all three species we found large-scale synchrony in population fluctuations. The level of synchrony decreased, however, with geographical distance among the provinces. When a partial correlation analysis is done correcting for the weather-derived principal components, correlations with synchrony and distance remained with two of the three principal components. When corrected for distance, there is correlation between synchrony and climate for capercaillie and black grouse.

In this case, based on established theories of the avalanche process, it is shown that ohmic breakdown in ITER is only possible over a narrow range of pressure and magnetic error field. Therefore, ECRH may be necessary to provide robust and reliable start-up. ECRH can ensure prompt breakdown over a wide range of prefill pressure and error field and can also give control over the initial time and location of breakdown. For ECRH-assisted start-up in ITER, the power and pulse length requirements are essentially determined by the need to ensure burnthrough, i.e. complete ionization of hydrogen and the transition to high ionization states of impurities. A zero-dimensional (OD) code (with inclusion of some 1D effects) has been developed to analyse burnthrough in ITER. The 0D simulations indicate that control of the deuterium density is the key factor for ensuring successful start-up in ITER, where the effects of neutral screening and dynamic fuelling by the ex-plasma volume are also crucial. It is concluded that without ECRH, successful start-up will only be possible over a very restricted range of parameters but 3 MW of absorbed ECRH power will ensure reasonably robust start-up for a broad range of conditions with beryllium impurity. In the case of carbon impurity, even with an absorbed ECRH power of 5 MW one may be restricted to low prefill pressure and/or low carbon concentration for successful start-up. © 1996 UKAEA Fusion.",,"Deuterium; Electric fields; Electron cyclotron resonance; Experimental reactors; Fusion reactions; Hydrogen; Impurities; Ionization of gases; Plasma heating; Plasma simulation; Deuterium density; Electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH); International thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER); Plasma current; Zero dimensional code; Reactor startup",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030231055

A set of representative preconverter systems, with respect to back pressure and surface area, ceramic and metal substrate material was exposed to a 100 hour engine aging cycle, which is equivalent to approximately 80,000 kilometers under European driving conditions. This aging cycle is used by the German Autoconsortium (ZDAKW). In order to address the high thermal load in a close-coupled position, the preconverter inlet gas temperature has been elevated to a maximum of 950°C at stoichiometry. Maximum preconverter midbed temperature has been found close to 1000°C. State-of-the-art catalytic coatings were used on the preconverters (Pd-only) and main converters (Trimetal). Emission tests using the new European test cycle (EDC 99), as well as the FTP 75 test cycle have been used to evaluate the catalytic performance. These tests were done during the aging at 20, 60 and 100 hours on the preconverters alone and on the combination of pre-and main converters.

The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Office of Field Project Support [UCAR/OFPS (recently combined with the UCAR/Joint International Climate Projects Planning Office and renamed the Joint Office for Science Support)] was given the responsibility of processing, quality controlling, and archiving the dataset. OFPS, in consultation with the TOGA COARE scientific community, developed a four-stage process to provide the community with a thoroughly quality controlled dataset. The TOGA COARE sounding dataset includes over 14 000 soundings, collected from 14 countries, in over 20 different original formats. The first OFPS processing step was the conversion of all soundings to a single, easy to use format, the OFPS quality control format. The second stage was a series of automated internal consistency checks on each sounding. This stage was particularly important as it directly led to the improvement of several of the datasets. The third step was a visual examination of each sounding to provide another layer of internal consistency checks, for dewpoint and wind in particular. The final process used spatial quality control checks to put each station into context with its neighboring stations as well as the network as a whole. These checks provided statistics from which both systematic and individual sounding problems could be determined. Finally, some derived sounding parameters such as convective available potential energy (CAPE) were calculated for each sounding. The CAPE calculations provided a quick method to qualitatively examine the high-resolution sounding data for low-level humidity problems. A composite dataset of all soundings at a uniform vertical resolution of 5 hPa was created to provide the community with a sounding dataset that has been found to be useful in certain modeling studies. The processed TOGA COARE sounding data, as well as statistical output from the OFPS spatial quality control procedures, are available on-line via the Internet using the World Wide Web (WWW) through the OFPS data management system.

Species-specific and treatment-specific differences in leaf temperature, high-temperature tolerance and chlorophyll a fluorescence from photosystem II were compared, to test the hypothesis that plants at ecosystem borders will exhibit species-specific responses to climate change. Measurements were made for plants exposed to a climate change warming manipulation on a major ecosystem border at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, Colorado, United States, in July and August 1995. In July, daily maximal leaf temperatures were significantly higher for P gracilis than for A. tridentata. Leaf temperatures were slightly lower in August than July for leaves of both species, on control and heated plots, despite the fact that daily maximum air temperatures were not significantly different for the two months. High temperature tolerance was determined for leaves treated for I h at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 65°C. LT50 was approximately 46°C for both species on control plots, but was 43°C for leaves of both species from heated plots, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis. No shift in LT50 (acclimation) was apparent between July and August. Changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence from photosystem II (F(v)/F(M)) were used to characterize the photosynthetic response to high temperatures. For both A. tridentata and P. gracilis in July, F(V)/F(M) was about 0.7, but decreased for temperatures above 40°C. The results suggest that plant responses to global warming at ecosystem borders may be influenced by factors other than leaf-level physiological tolerance to elevated temperatures.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Climate change; Electrolyte leakage; Rocky Mountains; Sagebrush","Artemisia tridentata; Artemisia tridentata; Asteraceae; Potentilia; Potentilla gracilis; Potentilla gracilis; Rosaceae; Tridentata; Artemisia tridentata; Asteraceae; Potentilla gracilis; Rosaceae; big sagebrush; cinquefoil; temperature tolerance; USA, Colorado Plateau; USA, Great Basin; USA, Rocky Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659288

Since ozone levels tend to be highest during the summer months, seasonal controls of precursors have been suggested as a means of reducing the costs of decreasing ozone concentrations to acceptable levels. This paper attempts to quantify what the potential savings if seasonal control were instituted for coal-fired power plants, assuming that only commercially available NOx control technologies are used. Cost savings through seasonal control is measured by calculating the total annualized cost of NOx removal at a given amount of seasonal control for different target levels of annual control. For this study, it is assumed that trading of NOx emissions will be allowed, as has been proposed by the Ozone Transportation Commission (OTC). The problem has been posed as a binary integer linear programming problem, with decision variables being which control to use at each power plant. The results indicate that requiring annual limits which are lower than seasonal limits can substantially reduce compliance costs. For instance, at the 65% seasonal reduction target from 1990 levels proposed by the OTC, specifying an annual reduction of 50% versus 55% decreases annual compliance costs for the thirteen boilers modeled by almost one-fourth, a savings of about $6 million. These savings occur because requiring stringent compliance only on a seasonal basis allows power plants to use control methods for which the variable costs are paid for only part of the year, and through the use of gas-based controls, which are much cheaper to operate in the summer months.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243083431

In the case of adsorbed acetylene, the shifts were attributed to lateral interactions between adsorbed C2H2 molecules. No induced absorptions were found. In the cases of adsorbed methanol and deuteriated methanol, three absorption regions were distinguished in the spectrum. The frequency of the O-H stretching vibration band found at 3320 cm-1 is similar to the absorption of liquid methanol, suggesting that CH3OH is adsorbed as clusters. In the C-H stretching region (3000-2700 cm-1), frequency shifts as compared to the gas (Δv = 20-40 cm-1) and liquid phases (Δv = 6-7 cm-1) were measured. The band at 1028 cm-1, which is assigned to the C-O stretching vibration, persisted in part and was shifted to 1024 cm-1 at higher temperatures and on evacuation. From this result it is inferred that a small fraction of methanol is either chemisorbed or physisorbed on high-energy sites such as voids between C60 molecules. Similar results were found when deuteriated methanol (CH3OD) was adsorbed on C60.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748589989

New methods are combined to yield a laser diagnostic method that allows a more intelligent design of the fuel/air injection system. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) in combination with intensified 12-bit CCD camera technology is used to find positions in the mixing device in which small protions of exhaust gas are guided directly to localized hot areas in the flame where NO formation is highly enhanced to achieve a spatially selective cooling of the flame. All PLIF measurements are carried out by averaging over several hundred laser shots using a pulsed tunable KrF6 excimer laser operating at 248 nm. These averaged data offer the possibility to interpolate between different two-dimensional images to obtain three-dimensional results of the qualitative distribution of OH, pyrolized fuel, and NO. Spatially selective NO-tracer seeding is applied in order to follow the gas flow across the flame front. By pulsing the NO gas tracer, the flow velocity is determined. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Air pollution control; Cameras; Charge coupled devices; Combustion; Cooling; Excimer lasers; Fluorescence; Furnaces; Gas emissions; Laser diagnostics; Nitrogen oxides; Three dimensional; Fuel air injection system; Oil burning furnaces; Planar laser induced fluorescence; Tracer activated chemistry control; Chemical variables control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030374206

Hudson Generating Station Unit 1, a gas and oil cyclone-fired, 400 MW, once-through supercritical unit with twin reheat, was selected as a site for advancing this objective. The installation of a water injection system was determined to be the most promising technique for reducing NOx emissions from this unit. This system, conceived, engineered, and installed by PSE&G, reduces NOx formation by automatically adding spray water to the combustion air supplying the eight cyclones. The existing Bailey Distributed Control System (DCS) had sufficient spare capacity to add all the controls required for implementing this strategy.

The analysis indicates that the theory of stability and ecological balance as the ultimate state of developments is a myth.

It is a liquid, which is advantageous in terms of storage, delivery, and infrastructural compatability. Ethanol burns relatively cleanly, especially as the amount of gasoline with which it is blended decreases. Evaporative and toxicity-weighted air toxics emissions are consistently lower for ethanol than for gasoline. It is likely that vehicles can be configured so that exhaust emissions of priority pollutants are very low for ethanol-burning engines, although the same can probably be said for most other fuels under consideration. Recent work suggests that ethanol may be more compatible with fuel cell - powered vehicles than has generally been assumed. Research and development - driven advances have clear potential to lower the price of cellulosic ethanol to a level competitive with bulk fuels. Process areas with particular potential for large cost reductions include biological processing (with consolidated bioprocessing particularly notable in this context), pretreatment, and incorporation of an advanced power cycle for cogeneration of electricity from process residues. The cellulosic ethanol fuel cycle has a high thermodynamic efficiency (useful energy/high heating value = from 50% to over 65% on a first law basis, depending on the configuration), and a decidedly positive net energy balance (ratio of useful energy output to energy input). Cellulosic ethanol is one of the most promising technogical options available to reduce transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. It may well be possible to develop biomass-based energy on a very large scale in the United States with acceptable and in some cases positive environmental impacts. To do so will however require responsible management and increased understanding of relevant technological and natural systems. The potential biomass resource is large, but so is demand for transportation fuels as well as other uses. The following hypotheses are offered as tentative hypotheses pertaining to biomass supply and demand in the United States: There will probably not be enough suitable land available to meet transportation demand if total vehicle miles traveled increase relative to current levels, and vehicle efficiency and animal protein utilization are unchanged. There probably is enough suitable land to meet transportation demand, even given some increase in vehicle miles traveled, given large but probably possible increases in vehicle efficiency, or large but probably possible decreases in reliance on animal protein, or a combination of less aggressive changes in both of these factors. The policy debate concerning fuel ethanol has tended to ignore cellulosic ethanol. It is suggested that an appropriate policy objective is to foster a transition to cellulosic feedstocks at a pace such that opportunities for ethanol producers and the farmers that supply them are expanded rather than contracted.","Biomass; Environment; Ethanol; Fuel","Biomass; Cellulose; Ecology; Economics; Evaluation; Cellulosic biomass; Cellulosic ethanol fuel cycle; Gas emissions; Ethanol fuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030378473

The new data show that the structure consists of an irregular spherical shell about 5°.6 in diameter, which extends 9°.5 below the Galactic plane, and of a well-defined, massive cone at low latitudes, which connects to a molecular cloud in the Galactic plane through a narrow (20 pc wide) channel of reduced H I emission. The system probably lies at a distance of ∼3.3 kpc, which implies that the shell has a diameter of ∼320 pc and extends at least 550 pc into the Galactic halo. We estimate that the swept-up mass in the shell is 6.0 × 104 M⊙ and the mass in the cone is 1.8 × 105 M⊙. The concentration of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and H II regions in this direction implies that the Aquila Supershell is a remnant of multiple supernovae and that star formation activity persists in this region of the Galaxy.

Box 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany","As part of the Southern Africa Fire-Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI-92), size-fractionated aerosol samples were collected during September-October 1992 at three fixed ground-based sites in the eastern Transvaal, i.e., at two sites within the Kruger National Park (KNP) and at a third site on the Transvaal highveld (about 150 km WSW of the KNP sites), and near a number of prescribed fires in the KNP. The collection devices consisted of stacked filter units, which separate the aerosol into a coarse (2-10 μm equivalent aerodynamic diameter (EAD)) and a fine (<2 μm EAD) size fraction, and of eight-stage cascade impactors, which provide more detailed size fractionation. The samples were analyzed for particulate mass (PM), black carbon (BC), and up to 47 elements. The prescribed fires gave rise to high levels of airborne soil dust, but several species (elements) were particularly enriched in the pyrogenic emissions. This was the case for BC, P, K, Ca, Mn, Zn, Sr, and I in the coarse fraction, and for BC, the halogens (Cl, Br, I), K, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sb, Cs, and Pb (and in the flaming phase also Na and S) in the fine fraction. The aerosol concentrations, compositions, and time trends at the two KNP sites were quite similar, suggesting that regionally representative samples were collected. Receptor modeling calculations, using both absolute principal component analysis and chemical mass balance, indicated that the KNP coarse PM was essentially attributable to mineral dust and sea salt, with average relative apportionments of 75% and 25%, respectively. At the highveld site, mineral dust and sea salt contributed in a 99-to-1 ratio to the coarse PM. In the fine size fraction at all three fixed sites, four components were identified, i.e., mineral dust, sea salt, biomass burning products, and sulfate. The pyrogenic component was the dominant contributor to the atmospheric concentrations of BC, K, Zn, and I, a major source for PM, Cl, Cu, Br, and Cs, but only a minor source for S. About 40% of the fine PM was, on the average, attributed to the pyrogenic particles, and about one third of it to the sulfate component. Relation of the time trends of the various components with three-dimensional air mass back trajectories indicated that elevated levels of pyrogenic products were mostly found in air masses arriving from the north. The levels of the sulfate component tended to be higher at the highveld site than at the two KNP sites, and this component was generally associated with continental air. It was concluded that the major contribution to this fine sulfate came from fossil fuel burning and various industrial activities on the Transvaal highveld.",,"aerosol composition; aerosol source; biomass burning; particulate matter; savanna ecosystem; South Africa, Mpumalanga Province, Kruger National Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0742303915

The antibody, either an anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or an antichromogranin A (CgA) biotinylated monoclonal antibody (MAb) or a cocktail of the two biotinylated MAbs was first injected. After 24 h, avidin was administrated i.v., followed by 111In-labelled biotin 24 h later. Fifty-two lesions were visualised. Six primary tumours, diagnosed by increased calcitonin levels, were all correctly diagnosed; 47 recurrences, also suspected by blood tumour markers, were detected and confirmed by cytology or histology. In one case, single photon emission tomography allowed the detection of small lymph nodes with a diameter of 4-7 mm. These lesions, not judged neoplastic by ultrasound, were confirmed to be neoplastic by fine needle aspiration. Pretargeted ISG correctly localises primary rumours and recurrences in MTC patients, when the only marker of relapse is serum elevation of calcitonin. With this three-step pretargeting method, cocktails of potentially useful MAbs can be used, avoiding false-negative studies that may occur when CEA or CgA are not expressed.","Avidin-biotin; Medullary thyroid carcinoma; Monoclonal antibody","avidin; biotin; calcitonin; carcinoembryonic antibody; chromogranin A; indium 111; monoclonal antibody; adult; aged; article; aspiration biopsy; blood level; cancer diagnosis; cancer recurrence; clinical article; clinical trial; cytology; diagnostic value; female; follow up; histology; human; immunoscintigraphy; isotope labeling; lymph node; male; photon emission tomography; priority journal; thyroid medullary carcinoma; tumor localization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029758041

The gradients were then immobilized by drying and cooling the film while retaining the inter-electrode bias (2.6 V).The resulting dried and cooled films responded rapidly to changes in voltage bias and exhibited diode-like characteristics, conducting and emitting light at biases ≤2.6 V and undergoing a reverse bias breakdown current, unassociated with light emission, at ca. -5.5 V.

C. nodosa, Z. noltii, and Z. marina showed comparable growth patterns as indicated by significant correlations of growth across species (cross correlation, r > 0.54, p < 0.05). This result provided evidence of a similarity in the response of these species to seasonal forcing. The seasonal pattern of P. oceanica resembled that of the other species in shoot weight, shoot elongation, and ramet recruitment, whereas it differed in internode weight and rhizome elongation. Despite some similarities in seasonal growth patterns, the patterns were lagged by 1 to 2 mo across species, and the magnitude of seasonal growth fluctuations was species-dependent. Species-specific responses of seagrasses to climate forcing should be related to differences in the capacity of the plants to store resources and to the extent of ramet integration among species, both processes being closely related to plant size. Large seagrasses [e.g. P. oceanica), with thick and long-living rhizomes, should be able to store more photoassimilates and to transport them over longer distances than small plants (e.g. C. nodosa), with thinner and shorter-living rhizomes. Large species should, therefore, be able to grow more independently of environmental conditions than small ones. Moreover, C. nodosa showed the greatest response to temperature fluctuations whereas Z. marina growth was strongly coupled to seasonal light conditions, indicating different plant sensitivity to climate fluctuations among species. This study confirms the great variability in seagrass seasonality possible under similar seasonal forcing, and demonstrates that seagrass seasonality has both an extrinsic component, dependent on seasonal forcing of light and temperature, and an intrinsic component. The intrinsic component of seagrass seasonality likely involves a differential capacity of the species to regulate the internal resource economy which may buffer, or amplify, the external seasonal forcing.","Cymodocea nodosa; Flowering; Module appearance rate; Module growth; Module size; Posidonia oceanica; Ramet recruitment; Seasonality; Zostera marina; Zostera noltii","growth; sea grass; seasonal variations; Spain, Girona, Cala Jonquet; Cymodocea nodosa; Posidonia oceanica; Zostera marina; Zostera noltii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667193

In the work reported here the four-electron reduction of nitrobenzene in alkaline (pH 13) aqueous media was studied as a model system. The electrochemical reduction is known to follow a complex mechanism [E. Laviron, A. Vallat and R. Meunier-Prest, J. Electroanal. Chem., 379 (1994) 427], involving protonations as well as a dehydration step; both surface and solution pathways for this reduction may be observed [C. Nishihara and H. Shindo, J. Electroanal. Chem., 221 (1987) 245], depending on the nature and state of the electrode. Both under silent and ultrasonic conditions nitrobenzene is reduced on glassy carbon electrodes in a chemically reversible one-electron process followed by an irreversible three-electron reduction. At sufficiently negative potentials the reduction process remains overall four-electron, with phenylhydroxylamine as the major product even at the high current densities obtained with intense ultrasound. Glassy carbon electrodes are shown to be suitable for kinetic studies, although damage, as endorsed by an increase in roughness and capacitance and probably initiated by mechanical damage at very short electrode-horn distances, was detected by a.c. impedance, voltammetric and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. On gold electrodes a more complicated mechanism due to a surface reaction pathway arises. A comparison of sonovoltammetric and rotating disk voltammetric results gives evidence for the homogeneous pathway being dominant under applied ultrasound conditions. The transition between surface and solution pathways is mass flux as well as concentration dependent, and an estimate for the rate of the surface catalyzed reaction for a concentration of 1.44 mM nitrobenzene (k = 4 ± 2 × 10-2 cm s-1), attributed to protonation of the nitrobenzene radical anion, is obtained from combined rotating disk and sonovoltammetric data. Damage to the gold surface as monitored by various techniques is small, but manifests itself by an interesting decrease in double layer capacitance.","Electrocatalysis; Nitrobenzene; Sonovoltammetry; Ultrasound","Atomic force microscopy; Benzene; Catalysis; Electric variables measurement; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; pH; Phase transitions; Solutions; Surface treatment; Ultrasonics; Electrocatalysis; Glassy carbon electrodes; Gold electrodes; Irreversible three electron reduction; Nitrobenzene; Power ultrasound; Sonovoltammetry; Cyclic voltammetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030258312

Special emphasis is placed on the regions where three countries meet within the area covered by the survey. In the countries participating, samples of Pleurozium schreberi, Scleropodium purum, Hypnum cupressiforme and Hylocomium splendens, Polytrichum formosum and Dicranum scoparium were collected at a total of 831 sampling points and analyzed for the elements Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn. The results were then presented in the form of coloured contour maps using the geographic information system (GIS) ARC-Info. The values found for heavy metals document the level of technical development in the countries concerned, which is generally characterized by a low standard in respect of emission-reducing systems. Moreover, the heavy-metal concentrations reflect the sources of emissions characteristic of the areas in which they occur. Above all, these are the primary use of coal (both hard coal and lignite) as an energy source, the chemical industry and ferrous- and non-ferrous metal working, which produce considerable emissions of particulate and fly ash, and also the use of leaded petrol. In most cases the moss method made it possible to identify the areas affected by the various industrial locations. The results show an increase in heavy-metal concentrations and higher average levels in the eastern parts of the countries compared. The paper also discusses the possibility of including the 'three-country triangle' further east in studies of Eastern Europe on the grounds that it constitutes another 'Black Triangle' in addition to the already familiar one.","bioindication; biomonitoring; Black Triangle; heavy-metal pollution; mosses","heavy metal; article; chemical analysis; geographic distribution; monitoring; moss; pollution; priority journal; sampling; biomonitoring; Black Triangle; contour map; deposition; GIS; heavy metal; heavy metals; moss; moss monitoring method; pollution deposition; pollution monitoring; Europe, (Central); Europe, (East); Bryophyta; Dicranum scoparium; Hylocomium splendens; Hypnum cupressiforme; Pleurozium schreberi; Polytrichum formosum; Scleropodium purum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301109

Beginning in 1982, the concentrations of major ions in precipitation at initially 3 sites are described in total as well as arrival sectors. For regions with specific geographical or emission features, 5 to 7 sectors for every sampling site are established, e.g., Scandinavia, or the centres of brown coal combustion in the former GDR. Particulary from the sectors of the former GDR, the precipitation was over-averaged contaminated anthropogenically in the years before the political change. Some components were significantly raised in comparison to other sectors. However, acidity remained on the level of the other sectors in the 80s. In the early 90s, anthropogenic emissions were systematically reduced partly by substitution of brown coal of inferior quality, better flue gas cleaning and partly by closing down industries. The effect of such steps on the wet deposition is being studied in a national German SANA research project (SANA: scientific program of rehabilitation of the atmosphere). In this project, the sampling sites were extended to 7 while maintaining the sampling procedure and the recording of relevant meteorological input-data. As a result, there now exists a homogeneous long-term data base allowing us to study the effects of emissions on wet deposition by the rehabilitation of the atmosphere in the former GDR. The paper focusses on changes in sulphate, nitrate, calcium, acidity, chloride and potassium concentrations in precipitation at the 3 so-called long-term sites. There are conspicuous decreases of some ions on one hand, but there is also an increase of nitrate and acidity, especially in recent years.",,"acidity; air quality; anthropogenic emission; atmospheric remediation; precipitation quality; SANA; wet deposition; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030430909

The mechanisms of sucrose and sorbitol transport were investigated in plasma membrane vesicles isolated from peach tree leaves. The maximum uptake was obtained for sucrose (2.5 times higher than sorbitol uptake). Active absorption of sucrose was completely inhibited by a non-permeant thiol reagent, PCMBS, contrary to sorbitol absorption. These results suggested that sucrose and sorbitol were transported at least by two different carriers. The absorption of exogenous sucrose and sorbitol in the bud and the underlying territories of the bud and their distribution in the single node cuttings were evaluated during the vegetative rest period. The utilization of PCMBS, an inhibitor of sucrose transporter, allowed for the estimation of the active absorption of sucrose in different isolated territories. It was assumed that the sink capacities of tissues depend on their potentialities to absorb carbohydrates by H+/symport. The presence of unlabelled sucrose during PCMBS pretreatment decreased the inhibition exerted by PCMBS: it suggested that the inhibitor was bound specifically on the sucrose transporter. The &lt;&lt;active&gt;&gt; absorption related to the transporter could therefore be distinguished from the total absorption, including diffusion. The evolution of exogenous sucrose and sorbitol was evaluated during the vegetative rest period, in isolated territories and in single node cuttings. In natural conditions, three periods were disclosed: 1) from September to October, the bud, intrinsically able to grow, was inhibited by the stem; 2) from November to December the bud was in a state of deep dormancy, and it was intrinsically unable to absorb nutrients; and 3) January was characterized by the reacquisition of bud growth potential and bud burst. Concerning sorbitol, a similar evolution was observed but it seemed that sorbitol was principally utilized a low days before budburst.","absorption potentialities; dormancy; Prunus persica; sorbitol; sucrose",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029744290

The emission standards used for incinerators is not projected as applying to alternatives - Auto-clave/landfill, Micro-wave/landfill, Chemical treatment etc. These have significant emissions. (2) The MACT standard does not address the real health risks from RBW's many toxic chemicals. These are not destroyed and often exacerbated by alternative treatments. The health risk perceived by the public and promoted by special interests of RBW's special 'infectivity' is not supported by medical experience, medical texts or CDC.

Although assimilate is partitioned according to the relative strength of sinks, in many species there is also a very close relationship between partitioning and shoot phyllotaxy, giving rise to sectorial patterns of allocation whereby only certain sinks are supported by any source leaf. Essentially these sinks are in the same orthostichy as the source leaf. This constraint of the vascular architecture on assimilate distribution to developing sinks such as leaves, flowers and fruits is not always absolute, as following the loss of their principal source leaves these sinks can in many cases be supplied with assimilate by other leaves via new inter-orthostichy pathways. The supply of assimilate to major sinks such as developing fruits becomes more and more localised with time so that a fruit in an axillary position becomes largely supported by its subtending leaf: the reproductive node-a metamer-can thus be regarded as a relatively autonomous unit of the plant (an IPU). Similarly, once established after a developmental phase of assimilate import, tiller ramets and branches in unitary plants tend to become physiologically autonomous modules. However, the functional autonomy of tillers is reversed following defoliation or shading as they are then sustained by the import of assimilate, subject to its availability, from unaffected tillers. Consequently the plant becomes physiologically integrated by the flow of assimilate from one part to another. The mainly autonomous ramets of many stoloniferous and rhizomatous species display a similar pattern of physiological integration in response to source manipulation, but in some species the ramets appear to maintain their independent functioning as a normal feature of the carbon allocation within the clone. In other clonal species, as the clone develops and becomes more structurally complex, vascular constraints start to restrict the movement of resources, and the clone becomes composed of a number of semi-autonomous IPUs. In unitary plants branches appear to remain very physiologically isolated in terms of their carbon economy once they become established, irrespective of a range of source-sink manipulations. These different patterns of physiological integration and organisation are discussed in relation to different strategies of assimilate utilisation and conservation.","Assimilate partitioning; Branches; IPU; Physiological integration; Ramets; Sectoriality; Source-sink relations",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030443006

The Glenshaw Formation is about 70 m thick and consists predominantly of trough cross-stratified fine-coarse channel sandstones and interbedded very fine sandstone and mudrocks deposited in alluvial channel and overbank settings. Paludal and lacustrine facies occur in interfluvial portions of the coastal plain and are represented by relatively thin coal, carbonaceous shale and micritic limestone. Paleosols are represented by red, green, and gray hackly mudstone with horizonization and, in some cases, pedogenic carbonate. Shallow marine facies consist of claystone, mudstone, biomicrite, and thinly interbedded siltstone and sandstone representing the Lower Brush Creek, Upper Brush Creek, Cambridge, and Ames marine units. The marine fauna includes brachiopods (productids, chonetids, spiriferids, and lingulids), fenestrate and dendroid bryozoans, gastropods, crinoids, bivalves (nuculids and pectenids), trilobites, fusulinid foraminifera, ostracodes, sponges, and algae. Trace fossils include Teichichnus and Aulichnites. A delta front facies is well developed in the Lower Brush Creek marine zone and is comprised of a coarsening and thickening upward sequence of parallel laminated and ripple bedded sandstone with interbedded siltstone and shale. Previous stratigraphic analyses in this part of Wayne County are very limited. The results of this study 1) extend the known geographic distribution of marine units in the southern Dunkard Basin, 2) demarcate the southern limb of the Parkersburg-Huntington Syncline through the Wayne-Prichard area, 3) demonstrate that transgressive-regressive packages of strata recognized further north have considerable lateral continuity. This study should have important consequences for past and future stratigraphic work and geologic mapping in Wayne County and vicinity.",,"Carboniferous; depositional environment; Glenshaw Formation; lithostratigraphy; Pennsylvanian; USA, West Virginia, Wayne County",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030424653

Calculations are based on a model that uses literature information on termite population size in primary forest and pasture 1 to 10 years after forest conversion, wood consumption and methane emission rates of termites. We use two scenarios based on low- and high-end parameters based on data from rain forests in Brazilian Amazonia. In the low-end scenario, termite population biomass is 25 kg·ha-1 in primary forest; 4 kg·ha-1 in year 1 after forest clearing, 51 kg·ha-1 in a six-year-old pasture, and 4 kg·ha-1 in a ten-year-old pasture. In the high-end scenario, all values are doubled and the initial breakdown in year 1 is omitted. Wood consumption rates are 49 and 270 mg wood g termite-1·day-1, and methane emission rates are 0.0023 and 0.0079 t of carbon released as methane per ton of carbon consumed, in the low- and the high-end scenario, respectively. In the low-end scenario no significant difference exists between the average termite population size in primary forest and pasture modeled over a ten-year period. In the high-end scenario the average population size of years 1-10 after clearing is only 31% over that of primary forest. The population model data combined with the wood consumption rates allow for only 2.3-32.3% of the wood biomass left from forest bum to be consumed by termites within 10 years. The changes in methane emissions from termite population change after deforestation were calculated using two approaches: 'Cumulative net emissions' for the region, which measure the 10-year impact of a year's forest clearing (e.g. 1.38·106 ha in 1990), increase by 0.0001 to 0.11 Tg CH4 in the 10 year-period in both scenarios, a negligible contribution to the increase of atmospheric methane concentrations of 45 Tg·yr-1. The 'annual balance of net methane emissions' from termites in all the different landscapes existing in the whole region in a single year (1990) increases by only 0.004 to 0.33 Tg CH4 (low- and high-end scenario) because of the large proportion of old clearings (&gt; 10 years old) with low methane emission rates. Termite populations do not tend to increase as a function of the available wood mass only and therefore methane emissions from termites in cleared areas of former rain forest do not make a significant contribution to the increase of the global methane concentrations in the atmosphere.",,"methane; agriculture; article; biomass; deforestation; food intake; forest; insect; population model; population research; tropics; wood; Insecta; Isoptera; Isoptera; deforestation; methane emission; rainforest; termite; Brazil, Amazonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663109

Six scenarios which have different damage costs per unit volume of pollutant with/without afforestation program are assumed, and then the carbon emission, net consumption and gross consumption are calculated in the optimization throughout the 21st centuiy. The scenarios, in which damage costs are counted in the global economic welfare, have more reduced emission of pollutants and less consumption of natural resources than in the reference scenario with the conventional account system. The sum of the discounted net incomes introduced in the environmental account system is more than the one in the conventional account system.

The latitudinal distribution of methane mixing ratio showed a north-to-south gradient from mid-latitudes to the equator every year. A sharp mixing ratio gradient often appeared at the boundary between the winter monsoon and the trade wind regions around 20°N. No significant longitudinal gradient was found during the winter season, although methane levels along the equator showed a large difference between the western and eastern Pacific. The overall methane increase rate in the western Pacific was estimated to be 13 ppb/yr on the basis of the long-term record for 15 years from 1978 to 1993. This record indicates that the methane growth rate over this Pacific region was gradually slowing down until 1990, followed by no significant increase in the 1990's. The overall deceleration of the growth rate was more rapid in the middle latitudinal zone (20°N-30°N) than in the lower latitudinal zone (3°N-20°N). This latitudinal difference suggests a rapid reduction of methane emissions from the continental regions. The methane growth rate showed an interannual variation with an increasing trend around 1983 and 1987, which was roughly related to the El Niño events. It is suggested that the methane growth rate was affected by a change of interhemispheric transport due to the ENSO events.",,"atmospheric chemistry; growth rate; methane; mixing ratio; Pacific, (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750861

N2O oxynitridation reduces electron trapping due to the high barrier height for electron injection. N2O oxynitridation has little effect on electron and hole energies for interface trap creation. For drain avalanche hot electron injection, the role of a nitrogen-rich region as the diffusion barrier of hydrogen species is to reduce interface trap generation by chemical reaction between hydrogen atoms and Si3≡Si-H precursors at the Si/SiO2 interface. However, interface trap generation is enhanced by the existence of nitrogen atoms near the Si/SiO2 interface for channel hot hole injection. The enhancement of hole trapping may be due to a decrease in the compressive stress near the Si/SiO2 interface by nitrogen incorporation.","Channel hot hole injection; Drain avalanche hot electron injection; Hot-carrier-induced degradation; N2O oxynitridation; Surface-channel PMOSFETs","Degradation; Electron energy levels; Electrons; Hot carriers; Hydrogen; Nitriding; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Semiconducting silicon; Silica; Silicon wafers; Electron trapping; Hole energies; Hot electron injection; Interface trap generation; Oxynitridation; Silicon silica interface; MOSFET devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030083077

By using a data bank of pure substances and binary mixtures of linear hydrocarbons, four different schemes of fitting the parameters of alkane groups (CH3 and CH2) are presented. Consistent with the genesis of the proposed equation, we have found that the interaction energy and hard core volume parameters are not strongly temperature dependent functions. The results show that, with any parameter set obtained from different schemes, the GC-EOS describes vapor pressures of pure linear alkanes up to C12 with less than 4.5% deviation from experimental values. The GC-EOS is also able to describe bubble pressures of binary mixtures of linear alkanes with less than 5% deviation.

Due to the difficulty of describing daily global radiation by common probability distributions, a nonparametric technique, the Abramson kernel estimator, is used. The space-time climatological model of daily global radiation consists of a transformed multivariate autoregressive (AR) process conditioned on large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. The transformation is necessary to establish a relationship between the probability distribution of global radiation and a normal variable used in the AR model. In order to check the stochastic model a simulation study was performed for 7 locations in Nebraska, USA. Although a split sampling approach could not be used due to the relatively small sample size the simulated probability distributions reproduced the empirical distributions quite correctly. Also, the space-time dependency was maintained.

Results showed that hydrogen addition into a steam-injected diffusion combustor at hydrogen/fuel molar ratios of approximately 20 percent was associated with somewhat increased NOx production and reduced CO emissions. Both effects are attributed to an increase in the local stoichiometric flame temperature. However, the decrease in CO was greater than the increase in NOx, resulting in a net emissions benefit, or a shifting of the NOx-CO curve toward the origin. Consequently, a greater range of NOx/CO emissions targets could be achieved when hydrogen was available. Additional experiments on premixed systems with hydrogen injection showed a significant increase in operability. Cost estimates for producing hydrogen with a conventional fired steam reformer suggested high capital costs unless ample steam, is already available. Hence, the technology is particularly well suited for turbines that use steam for power augmentation. Alternate reforming technology, such as catalytic partial oxidation, offers the potential for reduced capital costs. © 1996 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5544244887

District Energy Association, Amer. Soc. Heat., Refrigerating A., Amer. Soc. of Mechanical Engineers","The future of district heating and cooling, also known as district energy, will be a function of economic and regulatory forces in the United States. Typically a district energy system provides thermal energy in the form of steam, hot water, or chilled water from a central plant, and distributes the energy through pipes to two or more buildings. At the present time, district energy is under-utilized and serves only 1.3 percent of U.S. energy needs, providing a total of 1.1 quadrillion Btu of energy annually. A brief review of the historical development of district energy, the status of the technology in the United States, and a few basics on world energy consumption lead in to the economic and environmental advantages of district energy. District energy systems have been retrofitted to comply with the regulations of the Clean Air Act (CAA); presently emissions of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, are not regulated by the CAA. If the results of ongoing investigation on global climate change determine that regulation is warranted, several strategies exist for district energy systems to offer significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Projections of district energy's reaction to the ongoing forces are possible with the use of energy consumption forecasts through the year 2015, and a discussion of trend setting concepts being applied involving: gas turbines, cogeneration, fuel cells, chillers, advanced transmission fluids, renewable energies, and CO2 capture. District energy has potential to be an important part of the evolving strategies for global climate change. For this reason, combined with technology advancements and a supportive economic climate, a new era in district energy has begun.

Follow-up investigations were conducted at two of these workplaces where full-shift carbon monoxide exposure and end-exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations were measured to estimate carboxyhemoglobin concentrations. Draeger dataloggers equipped with carbon monoxide sensors were used to measure full-shift personal exposure and area airborne carbon monoxide concentrations. The dataloggers were also used to measure preshifi and postshift endexhaled carbon monoxide concentrations, which were then used to calculate carboxyhemoglobin concentrations. At the first workplace, a beverage distributing warehouse using two propane-fueled Nissan forklifts, carbon monoxide exposures ranged from 25 to 68 pprn (mean = 44 ppm) as work shift time-weighted averages (TWAs), with peaks ranging from 43 to 639 ppm. The range of increase in end-exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations of the tested nonsmoking employees was 17 to 65 pprn (average increase was 42 ppm) through the work shift. Following forklift maintenance and a reduction in the use of forklifts, employee exposures were reduced (range ofTWAs was 16 to 33 ppm; mean = 25 ppm), but were still in excess of recommended limits. The range of increase in end-exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations for nonsmokers after maintenance was 13 to 40 ppm (average increase was 26 ppm), again indicating that maintenance was not adequate. At the second workplace, a sugar packaging company also using two propane-fueled Nissan forklifts, carbon monoxide exposures measured after forklift repairs and related reduction in carbon monoxide emissions were low (1 to 10 ppm over a 7-hour work shift). The increases in end-exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations for the two nonsmokers at this workplace were 2 and 3 ppm. Area concentrations of carbon monoxide measured at the third workplace were as high as 300 ppm. The data from these workplaces combined with data related to 57 other propane-fueled forkliftrelated carbon monoxide poisoning cases found through CDPHE record reviews and literature searches demonstrate that the use of propane forklifts indoors without diligent monitoring of carbon monoxide emissions, and without subsequent maintenance aimed at reducing these emissions, can result in carbon monoxide poisoning. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

For these experiments, the naphthalene-like ring distortion modes of both perylene (1375 cm-1) and 1-methylperylene (1370 cm-1) were excited selectively using a stimulated emission population scheme, and the efficiency of depopulation of these modes was measured in each solvent. For these systems, there is an IR-active acceptor vibrational mode at the same frequency and the order of the dominant intermolecular vibrational energy transfer process depends on the identity of the solute. For 1-methylperylene, dipole-dipole coupling is operative, and for perylene, quadrupole-dipole coupling mediates the transfer. The importance of solvent organization about the solute can be evaluated by comparing solute T1 times in the two solvents. In the limit of fast solvent cage exchange, the solute T1 relaxation times should increase with increasing order of the polar coupling process and decrease with increasing intermolecular alignment. Our experimental data indicate that the T1 times are similar for all systems studied, implying the importance of persistent intermolecular interactions in determining the efficiency of vibrational population exchange in solution. © 1996 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000945481

As natural gas fueled vehicles become more prevalent, future regulations may restrict these emissions. Preliminary reports indicated that conventional, precious metal oxidation catalysts rapidly deactivate (in less than 50 hours) in lean-burn natural gas engine exhaust. This investigation is directed at quantifying this catalyst deactivation and understanding its cause. The results may also be relevant to oxidation of lean-burn propane and gasoline engine exhaust. A platinum/palladium on alumina catalyst and a palladium on alumina catalyst were aged in the exhaust of a lean-burn natural gas engine (Cummins B5.9G). The engine was fueled with compressed natural gas. Catalyst aging was accomplished through a series of steady state cycles and heavy-duty transient tests (CFR 40 Part 86 Subpart N) lasting 10 hours. Hydrocarbons in the exhaust were speciated by gas chromatography. Catalysts were compared on the basis of conversion and first order rate constants for conversion of specific hydrocarbon species. CO and ethylene conversions were nearly 100% at all conditions and did not decrease over time. Steady state and transient data show significant catalyst deactivation for methane oxidation over both catalysts tested. The global rate constant for methane conversions declined by more than 60% over the 10 hour experiment. Rate constants for ethane and propane oxidation declined by roughly 40 and 20%, respectively. No decrease in activity was observed for heavier hydrocarbons but their concentration in the fuel and in the exhaust was very low. Preliminary characterization of both the fresh and used catalysts was performed by X-ray diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. XRD indicated no bulk structural changes in the catalysts. Auger electron spectra indicate the presence of only PdO in the fresh catalyst but two distinct chemical forms of Pd in the used catalyst samples. Auger also indicated the presence of a phosphate coating on the monolith external surface. XPS confirmed the presence of reduced pd in the aged samples. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Auger electron spectroscopy; Augers; Catalyst deactivation; Ethylene; Exhaust systems (engine); Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Methane; Natural gas vehicles; Oxidation; Palladium compounds; Phosphate coatings; Propane; Rate constants; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Auger-electron spectra; Ethylene conversions; First-order rate constants; Global rate constant; Hydrocarbon species; Oxidation catalysts; Palladium on alumina; Steady state and transients; Compressed natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072465204

In 1992, EPRI initiated a strategic analysis of biomass and waste fuels and power technologies, both to develop consistent performance and cost data for the reading fuels and technologies and to identify the conditions which favor and create market pull for biomass and waste fuel energy. Using the final results of the EPRI project, this paper compares the relative performance and cost of power generation from coal, natural gas, and biomass and waste fuels The range of fuels includes wood, agricultural wastes, municipal solid waste, refuse-derived fuel, scrap tires and tire-derived fuel. The power technologies include pulverized coal and natural gas/combined cycle power plants, cofiring with coal in coal-fired utility boilers, direct combustion in dedicated mass burn, stoker and fluidized bed boilers, and wood gasification/combined cycle power plants. The analysis suggests that, in the near term, the highest-efficiency, lowest-cost, lowest-risk technology is cofiring with coal in industrial and utility boilers. However, this approach is economically feasible only when the fuel is delivered at a deep discount relative to fossil fuel, or the fuel user receives a tipping fee, subsidy, or emissions credit. In order to increase future use of biomass and waste fuels, a joint initiative, involving government, industry, and fuel suppliers, transporters and users, is needed to develop low-cost and efficient energy crop production and power technology.In 1992, EPRI initiated a strategic analysis of biomass and waste fuels and power technologies both to develop consistent performance and cost data for the leading fuels and technologies and to identify the conditions which favor and create market pull for biomass and waste fuel energy.

The second order trajectories in putative global sea level, in oceanic δ18O (a proxy for climate change) and δ13C (a proxy for major change in nutrient regime), are punctuated by third order changes, including the Mi glacials. Southern-temperate foraminiferal assemblages provide a profile of neritic biofacies through the oscillation. Plankton and benthos fit the second order and third order scenarios well: there are numerous resonances from the global ocean in this regional neritic realm. The cycle TB2 is a biofacies entity as well as a physical entity, and so too are most of its third order components. The influence of the Monterey carbon excursion and the climatic optimum are visible in this biotic succession. We corroborate the prediction that a trophic resource continuum expands in a warming and transgressive trend and, at the same time, responding more strongly to environmental fluctuations. We cannot corroborate the notion of coherent biofacies recurring through the succession as the environment shifts from warming to upwelling and back.

These factors include the type wood, the use of recycled water, the type of digesters and washers being used, bleaching sequence and number of stages, and external chemicals introduced to the processes (such as hydrogen peroxide or chlorine dioxide). Some woodyard VOC emissions can be determined graphical correlations reflective of storage time and rate of volatilization. Mass balances should consider the in-plant water sources (as well as recycle potential), condensate streams, and relationships between the various chemical compounds, especially the chlorinated organics. These chemical mass balances can be carried through the process as long as initial assumptions remain unchanged. The ability to use these methods and analyses can provide a significant amount of information to the mill regarding emissions as well as operations.",,"Boilers; Chemicals; Combustion; Estimation; Hazardous materials; Kilns; Paper and pulp mills; Societies and institutions; Chemical relationship; Emission factor; Graphical correlation; Mass balances; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030314568

All three images show different morphologies. In order to investigate these spatial differences and the mechanisms of dust emission in IC 418, we compare our data to two radiative transfer models with different radial density distributions. Model 1 has a thin shell that drops off as r-3, resulting in a high density ionized region surrounded by an ionized halo. While, model 2 has a thicker shell that drops off as r-2 resulting in the ionization front stopping in the thick shell and a high density ionized region immediately surrounded by a neutral shell. Both models use a mixture of silicon carbide (SiC) and amorphous carbon (AC) dust grains with dust to gas ratios of ∼ 2 × 10-5 and ∼ 6 × 10-4, respectively and the standard power law distribution in sizes (a-3.5; 0.005 μm &lt; a &lt; 0.25 μm). Both models reproduce our mid-IR images and mid-IR spectra well suggesting that, while IC 418 has emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the SiC feature and not the PAH feature probably dominates the 11.3 μm emission. Comparison of our images with broad-band J, H and K images of IC 418 by Hora et al. (1993), suggest that dust emission processes may contribute more near-IR emission than previously thought and that this near-IR ""dust"" emission is contained within the ionized gas region. Both models reproduce the observed spatial distributions of the 11.3 μm, [Ne II], and 6 cm emissions which differ because they have different radial excitation gradients in the nebula. However, model 1 better explains all of the many previous observations of IC 418 at different wavelengths. We suggest a three layer onion model for IC 418: a ∼ 6″ radius high density ionized region surrounded by a ∼20″ radius low density ionized halo, enclosed by a completely photodissociated neutral halo extended beyond a ∼ 80″ radius. This structure may suggest a mass loss history for IC 418 in which its progenitor AGB star experienced a supenvind (Ṁ ∼ 4 × 10-5 M⊙ yr-1, v∼ 11 km s-1) just before departing the AGB.","Infrared: ISM: lines and bands; ISM: dust; Planetary nebulae: individual: IC 418; Stars: mass-loss",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005285341

I investigate the phase stability of CO2-bearing polar ices and place limits on the quantity of CO2 that can be sequestered. The magnitude of this limitation follows from CO2-bearing ices having thermal conductivities on the order of 5 to 6 times smaller than that of water ice, producing a higher geothermal gradient. Results indicate that only under favorable, and probably unrealistic, conditions an upper limit of 112 mbar of CO2 can be sequestered as CO2 clathrate or 254 mbar as CO2 ice in the north polar deposit. More realistic conditions will limit CO2 to no more than a few 10s of mbar. In either case, less CO2 is also allowed and none is required by existing observations. The south polar deposit probably consists of a similar composition, but thinner deposits make placing limits difficult. Limited quantities of CO2 in the polar regions primarily implies that large amounts of CO2 are not released at high obliquity, reducing the magnitude of periodic climate change. In addition, climate-evolution models that predict large CO2-bearing caps at present should be rejected, favoring models that do not predict extensive CO2-bearing ice deposits. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030295110

To mitigate this problem one of the most promising solutions is the fitting the in use cars with catalysts (so called retrofitting). In this way the technical potential is given, on the one hand, by the large availability of unleaded petrol in Hungary and on the other hand, by the large share of the home car fleet (about 80%) which can be fueled with unleaded petrol. The field test aimed at the evaluation of large scale use of retrofit catalysts (in real life), especially in the case of two-stroke engined cars. During the tests, first of all the useful life-time expectation and the alteration of the reducing efficiency of CO, HC and NOx were investigated. Beside these, the light-off temperatures and thermal load of the catalysts and their impact on the fuel consumption and dynamic features of the cars were also examined. The test catalysts were purchased from seven well known European manufacturers and equipped on 70 cars typical of the home car fleet. The efficiency of the emission reduction was evaluated by the European driving cycle tests carried out before and after the installation of the catalysts as well as at several mileages. The results justified the governmental support of retrofit catalysts and their large scale application. The average efficiency regarding CO, HC and NOx was in all cases over 50%, and no definitive deterioration had been experienced up to 50-60.000 km, in the case of four stroke engined cars and up to 20-30.000 km, in the case of two stroke engined ones. The NOx efficiency suggests that the use of TWC without closed loop control should be preferred over oxidation catalysts. Only technically qualified catalysts having high technological level should be recommended for retrofit installation. A nationally accepted test method was determined for this purpose. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalysts; Efficiency; Emission control; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Retrofitting; Average efficiencies; Closed-loop control; European driving cycle; European manufacturers; Large-scale applications; Light-off temperatures; Technical potential; Technological level; Automobile manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072437361

Organic carbon concentrations average ca. 0.7% in sediments from Sites 897 and 898 and ca. 0.4% at Sites 899 and 900. Headspace concentrations of interstitial methane exceed 100,000 ppm in sediments from Sites 897 and 898 but are essentially zero in those from Sites 899 and 900. Methane concentrations do not rise until interstitial sulfate concentrations are virtually depleted, suggesting the presence of deep in situ methanogenic bacterial activity at Sites 897 and 898 and its absence at Sites 899 and 900. Two factors associated with the turbidity flows that created the sedimentary sequence evidently influenced post-depositional diagenesis at these sites. The principal factor is that the rapidly deposited turbidite sequences at Sites 897 and 898 protected organic matter from early oxic degradation and thereby permitted subsequent anoxic degradation to proceed. In contrast, organic matter in the more slowly deposited turbidites at Sites 899 and 900 was oxidized soon after deposition and was therefore not available for later microbial utilization. A lesser factor is that the turbidity flows may have obtained their entrained organic matter from different environments and consequently delivered organic matter with different characteristics. Both factors contributed to heterogeneity of the types and amounts of organic matter that accumulated in these deep-sea sediments, and this variability has influenced subsequent sulfate reduction and methanogenesis.","bulk δ13C values; C/N ratios; Iberia abyssal plain; interstitial sulfate; methanogenesis; organic matter preservation; Rock-Eval hydrogen indices; turbidites","abyssal plain; abyssal plains; deep-sea sediments; methanogenesis; organic matter; sulphate; turbidite; turbidity currents; Atlantic, Iberia Abyssal Plain; Biodegradation; Composition effects; Methanogens; Paraffin sedimentation; Organic matter preservation; Rock Eval hydrogen indices; Turbidities; Sediments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030395155

We report now on the kinetics of propane and propylene oxidations over this catalyst. The partial oxidations of propane and propylene and zero-order in oxygen, whereas deep oxidations of both hydrocarbons are half-order. This difference in reaction order indicates that different forms of reactive oxygen are involved in the partial and deep oxidation reactions. Presumably, nucleophilic lattice oxygen partakes in the partial oxidation, while electrophilic dissociatively adsorbed oxygen is involved in deep oxidation. A single activated surface adsorbed state of the hydrocarbons is thought to be involved in both the partial and deep oxidation reactions. An interpretation of the observed reaction kinetics in context of the Mg4V2Sb2Ox solid state chemistry, and the partial oxidation literature in general, suggests that selective oxydehydrogenation of propane occurs on isolated (Sb-O-V-O-Sb) sites, deep oxidation on multiple vicinal vanadium sites (Sb-O-V-O-V-O-Sb), and partial oxidation of propylene to acrolein on subsurface V-promoted antimony sites (Sb-O-Sb). Therefore, improved selectivity of desired intermediates (propylene/acrolein) should be achieved by further lowering the vanadium concentration and/or through key solid state positioning of the vanadium in the catalyst lattice. Alternatively, selective doping to electronically decrease the electrophilicity of the waste forming sites and its appended oxygen should also help depress the waste forming reaction channels in favor of the desired partial oxidation channels. Finally it is anticipated that higher useful product yields would be attained with a compositionally optimized Mg-V-Sb-oxide catalyst by opting for a more stable, isolatable intermediate, e.g., acrylonitrile, by reacting propane in the presence of ammonia and oxygen (air) over this catalyst.","Mechanism; Mg-V-Sb-oxide catalyst; Oxydehydrogenation; Propane; Propylene; Reaction kinetics; Site isolation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001156114

While Titan's L-band Reltron tubes have achieved 250 J/pulse, we have also observed pulse-shortening phenomena in both the modulating cavity and output cavity regions. We have examined the effects of construction materials, fabrication techniques, vacuum pressure, and conditioning. We will present data from these experiments and discuss a plausible pulse-shortening hypothesis involving electric-field-induced gas evolution and subsequent ionization. We believe that our energy-per-pulse limitations are the result of our current tube construction approach which uses explosive emission cathodes, plastic insulators, and grids to define cavity boundaries. While some simple extensions of this approach offer some hope for increasing the energy per pulse to perhaps 500 joules in L-band, we believe that achieving ≥1 id/pulse will require the use of conventional microwave tube construction techniques, including thermionic cathodes, ceramic insulators, and brazed joining with high-temperature bakeout. We will present the design of an L-band Reltron tube having these features. © 1996 SPIE.

The pathways were identified by radioisotope analysis of the SCFA and CO2 obtained after incubation of fecal suspensions with glucose under 20% CO2 with [1-14C]glucose, [3,4- 14C]glucose, or 14CO2. Acetate was chemically degraded to learn the labeling of the methyl and carboxyl carbons. The labeling of CO2 and acetate showed that the major route of glucose catabolism was the Embden-Meyerhof- Parnas pathway, with production of CO2 from pyruvate carboxyl carbon. Labeling of the methyl and carboxyl carbons of acetate by 14CO2 or [3,4- 14C]glucose proved that acetate was formed from CO2 by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. CO2 reduction accounted for about one-third of the acetate formed by suspensions from subject 1 and about one-fourth of the acetate formed by suspensions from subject 2. Propionate was formed by a CO2 fixation pathway, and butyrate was formed by classical routes of acetyl-S coenzyme A condensation. The amount of CO2 formed from [1-14C] glucose and acetate labeling patterns obtained with the other 14C precursors indicated that the Entner-Doudoroff, transketolase-transaldolase, and heterolactic pathways were not significant.

The absorption spectra, attributed to high molecular mass structures, are interpreted in the framework of the optical properties of solid state matter, according to the Tauc band-gap model. This is a powerful approach to characterize carbonaceous material; in fact, theoretical computations on carbon structures containing conjugated π bonds indicate that the extension of aromatic clusters or islands in side the structures can be obtained from the measured optical band-gap energies. The absorption measurements, performed both in the soot-preinception and soot-inception regions, give a clear indication that a spread of structures, with a different degree of aromatization, is present, since at least three optical band gaps are identified. The soot inception itself is characterized by a sharp decrease of the band gap caused by the progressive aromatization of the structures. This process takes place before the particles grow by surface reactions. Finally, the extinction spectra of fully grown soot particles, so far expressed by an empirical dispersion law, are reinterpreted in terms of the optical band gap, thus allowing a more rational correlation between the optical and chemical properties of the particles. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Air; Benzene; Calculations; Energy gap; Fluorescence; Laser applications; Light extinction; Light scattering; Mathematical models; Molecular structure; Soot; Optical band gap model; Premixed flames; Tauc band gap model; Flame research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030361851

Their primary business is to provide clean textiles such as floor mats, uniforms and shop towels to industrial and commercial clients. Historically, the industry has had very limited involvement with air pollution control regulations and associated permits with the exception of on-premise boilers. With the implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 the industry has focused its attention on potential volatile organic compound (VOC) and Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAPs) emissions from the wet laundering of shop towels, printer towels and furniture refinisher towels (generically called wipers). The focus of this study is to develop wiper VOC Loading Factors to be used as future industry standards by retrospectively analyzing selected individual facility emissions estimates. Results based on four diverse testing protocols including mass balance approaches, Method 25A and Method 8240 analysis indicate that an industrial launderer processing mainly wipers from the printer industry will average 0.135 pounds of VOCs per pound of soiled wipers. Industrial Launderers that service other industries or follow aggressive wiper management practices will have a lower average VOC Loading Factor. Taking into account VOCs that exit industrial laundries via other waste streams, this extrapolates to a 'standard' industrial laundering facility having an unrestricted potential to emit below major source thresholds in all but extreme ozone nonattainment areas. Due to the diversity of industries to which wipers are supplied it is difficult to established standardized wiper loading factors for HAPs.",,"Facilities; Gas emissions; Hazardous materials; Laws and legislation; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Hazardous air pollutant; Industrial launderer; Loading factor; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030314638

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) detected decreases of melting entropies (ΔS(m)) by the incorporation of cholesterol into both anhydrous and hydrated equimolar mixture of pseudoceramide (SLE) and stearic acid. Moreover, there was a linear relationship between the cholesterol content and the melting entropies in the region of 0-33 mol% cholesterol for both the anhydrous and hydrate lipids. In addition, as the concentration of cholesterol increased, a liquid lateral packing (4.5 Å) appeared in the wide-angle X-ray diffraction and the intensity of a hexagonal packing(4.15 Å) decreased.

A climatology of month to month changes in precipitation, using data from 4027 stations, illustrates how different climatic controls govern the annual cycle of precipitation response and explains the spatial distribution of the seasonal precipitation maximum. These results particularly indicate that smaller-scale climatic controls must be considered along with larger-scale ones in order to explain patterns of spatial climate heterogeneity over mountainous areas. The examination of seasonal precipitation maxima during years characterized by abnormally low winter Pacific-North American teleconnection (PNA) patterns and abnormally strong summer monsoons reveal few changes spatially as compared to normal. The lack of changes illustrate that spatial heterogeneity of precipitation seasonality is the rule rather than the exception for much of the mountainous West.

These sophisticated ECUs (Electronic Control Units) have been primarily driven by the need to meet Government regulations on emissions and fuel economy and partially by market pressures for differentiation. The result has been a proliferation of independent, self supporting electronic modules with complex wiring interconnects, and, in many cases, redundant features. This ""add a function, add a module"" approach coupled with traditional design methodologies has created new challenges for the automotive industry in the areas of costs, diagnostics and more recently design cycle time. With up-integration to reduce costs, the design and development cycle times for some of these ECU is starting to exceed the vehicle development times, causing the automotive design community to take a fresh look at their design methodologies and tools. The engineers are also discovering that electronic design can no longer be an independent activity but it needs to be seamlessly integrated into the design of the vehicle and it's mechanical/electromechanical systems. This paper will describe some new system level approaches that are being applied and also discuss some future technology developments that will improve the system design methodology for vehicle systems. In addition, emerging standards will be discussed that will provide a foundation for future automotive electronic performance and reliability improvements, as well as cycle time and cost reduction. © 1996 SAE International.

To determine the temporal pattern of nebulin assembly into the myofibrils of differentiating skeletal muscle cells, myofibril assembly was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The distribution of nebulin was compared to other myofibrillar and cytoskeletal proteins (myosin, titin, actin, desmin, tubulin). At the onset of differentiation, we observed that nebulin is first seen in a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm. At this time, muscle specific myosin and titin are also distributed in this manner. Myosin and titin become associated with the nascent myofibrils prior to the addition of nebulin. The mature striated pattern of myosin and titin also preceded the development of striations with nebulin. After nebulin becomes organized into a striated pattern, actin filaments separate across the A-band and form thin filaments of uniform length. These patterns of assembly suggest that nebulin is required for restricting the lengths of the thin filaments. We have employed the strategy of using ethyl methane sulfonate and taxol to perturb myofibril assembly to examine interactions critical for the addition of nebulin to the developing sarcomeres. The same temporal pattern of assembly seen in the normal cultures was observed in the ethyl methane sulfonate treated cultures, but at a much slower rate. In cultures treated with the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol, the amount of stress fibers and nascent I-bands was greatly diminished as previously reported by others; however, nebulin was found associated with myofibrils in a mature striated distribution. In addition, our results indicate that the taxol treated cultures contain remnants of the Z-line. These results suggest that nebulin assembly into the myofibril requires interactions or anchorage at the Z-line and within the A-band.","actin; myofibrillogenesis; myosin; protein ruler; titin","actin; connectin; desmin; myosin; nebulin; paclitaxel; tubulin; actin filament; animal cell; article; fowl; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence microscopy; microtubule; muscle development; muscle fibril; nonhuman; priority journal; protein assembly; protein localization; protein polymorphism; protein synthesis; sarcomere; skeletal muscle; Animals; Chickens; Humans; Immunoblotting; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Myofibrils; Sarcomeres; Animalia; Aves; Galliformes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029908544

The study area includes regions in Russia where Scots pine is a stand-forming species: from European Russia (33°E) to Yakutia (130°E) in eastern Siberia.

Stand phytomass data were obtained from numerous regional and local phytomass studies, and supplemented with additional unpublished data. This is the first comprehensive study synthesizing stand level phytomass relations for P. sylvestris for most of its range in Russia.

The structure of the city and its location at the hub of the Spanish road network means it has high traffic densities which have a negative effect on the environment. The atmospheric pollution is particularly serious as a result of the difficulty of dispersing the pollutants owing to long periods of atmospheric stability, inversion, etc. One strategy to improve the situation has been to build orbital motorways to reduce the traffic pressure in the most densely populated central zones and to stop heavy traffic passing through the center. In view of the opposition of certain collectives to the completion of the northern section of the M-40 Ring Road, an environmental impact study was made on the distribution of global emissions with and without its construction. After designing models for the traffic behaviour under the two scenarios for 1995, traffic speed and density loads were obtained for each stretch of the network. Based on the results, pollutant emission was determined for each zone involved. The results show that the new infrastructure will improve traffic conditions, providing significant reductions in journey times and will also reduce the global emission of pollutants in the short term.","pollution; regional impact; traffic","conference paper; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; pollution control; priority journal; traffic; urban area",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644442844

These features are interpreted by us as diagnostic of exogenic degradation due to the loss of a volatile rock-forming matrix or cement. In this study we propose that sublimation degradation is a plausible Solar System-wide geological process. Candidate examples have been identified on Mars, Io, and Triton, and possibly Europa and Ganymede. We envision this process as having two end-member expressions (pits and scarps), for which we hypothesize two end-member mechanisms (massive localized lenses and areally extensive basal layers). In this study we focus on the role this process may play on the surfaces of the galilean satellites. Our principle modeling results are that for these satellites, H2S, CO2, and NH3 are the only viable candidate volatiles for sublimation degradation of landforms, in light of galilean satellite cosmochemistry. For Io's polar regions only H2S, and then only from slopes that face the Sun and have thin lags, is volatile enough to cause the observed sublimation-induced erosion at those latitudes. SO2 is not a viable candidate as an agent of erosion, especially for these polar landforms. In the case of Europa, only CO2 and H2S are viable candidates (given surface age constraints). Both species could be efficient eroders in nonpolar regions. H2S could generate erosion within the polar regions if the deposition and erosion conditions were essentially identical as those we invoked for Io's polar regions. For Ganymede (and Callisto) NH3 might be an agent of erosion in equatorial terrains of great age. The sublimation of CO2 and H2S is much more robust than NH3. The much slower rate of sublimation degradation from NH3 might be detectable by Galileo and used as a compositional indicator. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030194474

We found that activities of extracellular enzymes associated with cellulose decay and phosphorus mineralization in soils were inversely proportional to dust loading along the Dalton Highway, Alaska. Overall, endocellulase, exocellulase, and phosphatase activities within 5 m of this gravel road were reduced by 88, 74, and 45%, respectively, of activity levels at 500 m. Detailed examinations of soil components showed that phosphatase enzyme activities were displaced from organic matter complexes by dust inputs and became adsorbed onto mineral materials. This decreased the rate of enzyme-mediated reactions. Mathematical models incorporating these reduced levels of enzyme activities projected substantial reductions in carbon (from cellulose) and phosphorus mineralization. Moreover, reduced carbon utilization by decomposer microbiota, resulting from shower cellulose decay, also decreased microbial immobilization of nitrogen, thus increasing simulated net nitrogen mineralization. Such changes in soil nutrient dynamics would be expected to affect the structure of plant communities, as has been reported for vegetation adjacent to the Dalton Highway. However, concurrent changes in other environmental characteristics of the soil environment near this road (e.g., drainage) limit our ability to establish causal relationships.",,"enzyme; road dust; tundra soil; USA, Alaska, Dalton Highway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660927

Large blocks of brecciated bed rock are a primary component of these avalanche deposits and are potentially excellent oil and gas reservoirs. Our work provides further insight into the emplacement and economic potential of these deposits. Exposed large-rock avalanche deposits of the Miocene Oak City Formation on the western margin of the Canyon Range, Utah, contain coherent breccia blocks up to 3.5 km long, 1 km wide, and 200 m thick. These deposits were derived from the near-vertical dipping bed rock of the adjacent Canyon Range and now are exposed as much as 5.5 km from the range front within the Sevier Desert basin. Emplacement was relatively rapid, as indicated by three well-developed breccia facies within the carbonate breccia blocks. Stratigraphically, from the base the facies include (1) matrix-rich breccia, (2) jigsaw breccia, and (3) crackle breccia. The deposits were cut and segmented by a series of syndepositional normal faults that developed during late Miocene and post-Miocene extension. Primary porosity was reduced by cement soon after burial. Cathodoluminescence cement patterns indicate that initially the basinward breccia blocks were more deeply buried relative to the water table than the breccia blocks proximal to the Canyon Range. After initial cementation, the basinward blocks were uplifted relative to the water table. Secondary porosity approaches 8% in the carbonate blocks and is greater than 14% within the jigsaw breccia. The size and porosity of these breccia blocks indicate their potential as reservoir targets.",,"breccia; diagenesis; Miocene; porosity; reservoir potential; rock avalanche deposit; USA, Utah, Canyon Range; Petroleum prospecting; Porosity; Sedimentary rocks; Stratigraphy; Tectonics; Breccia; Large rock avalanche deposits; Syndepositional normal faults; Petroleum geology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302364

First, we present an appraisal of N2O emissions from agricultural soils (Assessment). Secondly, we discuss some recent efforts to improve N2O flux estimates in agricultural fields (Measurement), and finally, we relate recent studies which use nitrification inhibitors to decrease N2O emissions from N-fertilized fields (Mitigation). To assess the global emission of N2O from agricultural soils, the total flux should represent N2O from all possible sources; native soil N, N from recent atmospheric deposition, past years fertilization, N from crop residues, N2O from subsurface aquifers below the study area, and current N fertilization. Of these N sources only synthetic fertilizer and animal manures and the area of fields cropped with legumes have sufficient global data to estimate their input for N2O production. The assessment of direct and indirect N2O emissions we present was made by multiplying the amount of fertilizer N applied to agricultural lands by 2% and the area of land cropped to legumes by 4 kg N2O-N ha-1. No regard to method of N application, type of N, crop, climate or soil was given in these calculations, because the data are not available to include these variables in large scale assessments. Improved assessments should include these variables and should be used to drive process models for field, area, region and global scales. Several N2O flux measurement techniques have been used in recent field studies which utilize small and ultralarge chambers and micrometeorological along with new analytical techniques to measure N2O fluxes. These studies reveal that it is not the measurement technique that is providing much of the uncertainty in N2O flux values found in the literature but rather the diverse combinations of physical and biological factors which control gas fluxes. A careful comparison of published literature narrows the range of observed fluxes as noted in the section on assessment. An array of careful field studies which compare a series of crops, fertilizer sources, and management techniques in controlled parallel experiments throughout the calendar year are needed to improve flux estimates and decrease uncertainty in prediction capability. There are a variety of management techniques which should conserve N and decrease the amount of N application needed to grow crops and to limit N2O emissions. Using nitrification inhibitors is an option for decreasing fertilizer N use and additionally directly mitigating N2O emissions. Case studies are presented which demonstrate the potential for using nitrification inhibitors to limit N2O emissions from agricultural soils. Inhibitors may be selected for climatic conditions and type of cropping system as well as the type of nitrogen (solid mineral N, mineral N in solution, or organic waste materials) and applied with the fertilizers.","dentrification; N2O; nitrification; nitrification inhibitors","denitrification; fertilizer; mitigation; nitrification inhibitor; nitrous oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660928

Mesophyll chloroplasts displayed a distended shape with most grana of their central region disarranged. Aluminium induced reductions in photosynthesis can be partly associated with stomatal closure, though the reduced stomatal conductance did not reduce in the same extent intercellular CO2 concentration. However, the reductions in PS II electron transport suggest an appreciable non-stomatal limitation to photosynthesis. Moreover, aluminium decreased the efficiency of excitation energy capture by open PS II reaction centres, the photochemical quenching coefficient of PS II fluorescence and the in vivo quantum yield of PS II photochemistry, and increased the non-photochemical dissipation of excitation energy. These changes at PS II are characteristic of a saturation of photosynthetic metabolic activity and could be expected since Al-stress slowed down photosynthetic metabolism and closed stomata. Since, aluminium concentration in the leaves was undetectable, all the changes in the photosynthetic performance are therefore considered as indirect effects. The photosynthetic rate was reduced at Al-treatment, but the electron transport was tightly down-regulated by carbon metabolism and there was no evidence of alternative electron sinks. Consequently, this suggests a tight linkage between PS II activity and CO2 fixation under the 48 h Al-treatment. We can suggest that Al-treatment resulted in an impaired membrane permeability which affected carbon metabolism and stomatal regulation and, thereby, increased ΔpH and qE.","Aluminium stress; carbon assimilation; chlorophyll fluorescence; chloroplast ultrastructure; electron transport; gas exchange; photosynthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029759363

This difference can be explained by the difference in solubility between hydrogen and oxygen.","Hydrogen Oxidation; Meniscus; Molten Carbonate; Oxygen Reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042301062

The distribution of the electrolyte among electrodes and matrix in the MCFC is dominated by the pore characteristics and wetting properties of these components. However, data on wetting, especially under load (current passage), are limited. In this study, the behavior of the meniscus at a metal is used to obtain information on wet-ting and electrochemical reactions. Meniscus height and current were measured under varioius atmopsheres. The contact angle was calculated from the meniscus height. The electrolyte distribution in the MCFC was estimated using contact angles thus obtained in oxidant and reducing atmospheres. The results suggest that upon applicatioin of load the electrolyte moves from the anode to the cathode and that capillary effects can worsen the performance of a cell, especially if it is in an unbalanced state of electrolyte filling.",,"Carbonates; Composition; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric current measurement; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Metals; Molten materials; Oxides; Reaction kinetics; Wetting; Cyclic voltammograms; Digital oscilloscope; Meniscus behavior; Oxidant; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030212214

The structure and content of Title permit applications demands much more than an inventory- focused view of facility air emissions. Electronic information management for Title V now requires access to complex information, addressing aspects such as actual and potential emissions for regulated and state pollutants; multiple Operating Scenarios for operational flexibility; tracking of Applicable Requirements (and non-applicable requirements) and methods of compliance; detailed operational and materials usage information; and compliance demonstrations and reporting. In addition, the information management system needs the ability to generate custom reports to match the format and content of the state Title V application; and of convenient report modification to meet changes in the application forms. This paper describes the implementation of a facility-customizable electronic air information management system for Title V permit development and management, named A*I*M*S-Title V, developed by ERM- Northeast and customized in this work to support Title V permit development efforts for two separate Rohm and Haas Company chemical manufacturing facilities located in Bristol, Pennsylvania (Bristol Plant) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Philadelphia Plant). The two facilities had Title V permit application submission dates in November 1995, with the application content for both facilities governed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Title V Operating Permit Program. The A*I*M*S-Title V database was customized for the Pennsylvania Title V program by ERM-Northeast over the period June through August, 1995, following which the database was implemented by the two facilities and supported the successful completion and timely submission in November 1995 of their individual Title V applications. The advantages of implementing an information management system for Title V permitting and the facility commitment required to make it a truly functional tool will also be presented.",,"Database systems; Gas emissions; Industrial plants; Laws and legislation; Management; Management information systems; Air information management system; Title V permit development and management; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030315357

Radiocarbon dating of detrital peat and wood from a progradational sequence (basal unit) defines a lateral younging trend in the direction of progradation. A progradation rate is calculated to be ∼4 cm yr-1, consistent with rapid deposition during stage (1) above. The nonuniform nature of the trend is attributed to episodic influxes of old organic material by slumping and reworking by waves and currents. In comparison with thermokarst-lake-basin sequences previously described in Alaska, Canada and Siberia, the middle unit of those in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands is similar, whereas the basal unit is generally thicker and, by contrast, often contains diamicton. These differences are attributed, respectively, to larger-scale resedimentation of upland sediments by retrogressive thaw slumping and debris-flow deposition in thermokarst lakes in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands. Compared with the sediments within supraglacial lakes in areas of moderate to high relief, the middle unit of thermokarst-lake-basin sequences in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands lacks clastic varves and the basal unit is much thinner and texturally less variable. These differences are attributed to higher relief and larger volumes of meltwater and glacigenic sediment in supraglacial lakes, which promote more suspension settling and resedimentation of glacigenic sediment than in thermokarst lakes in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands. It may be impossible to distinguish glacial and periglacial thermokarst-lake-basin sediments in permafrost areas of incomplete deglaciation. Not only is it often difficult to distinguish intrasedimental and buried glacier ice, but the depositional processes associated with thaw of both ice types are presumably the same and the host sediments very similar.",,"diamicton; glacial sediment; lake sediment; sand; sediment deposition; thermokarst lake basin; Canada, Northwest Territories, Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029768590

Box 43, Blindern, N-0313 Oslo, Norway","A historical emission inventory for sulphur dioxide has been compiled for Europe covering the period 1880-1991. The estimated emissions have been used as input to the sulphur module of the EMEP/MSC-W acid deposition model. The aim was to show the way and the extent to which the historical development of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide emissions alone has affected the concentration and deposition fields of oxidised sulphur in Europe. Although acknowledged, effects exerted by the meteorological variability and the changing oxidising capacity of the atmosphere over the years have not been taken into consideration. Long-term emission estimates reveal that combustion of coal was the dominant emission source before World War II in all countries and combustion of liquid fuels thereafter in most. Releases from industrial processes were relatively small. National sulphur dioxide emissions peaked mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, whilst emission control measures resulted in gradual reductions in most countries in the 1980s. In Europe as a whole, coal combustion remained the major emission source throughout the century. Total anthropogenic releases increased by a factor of 10 between the 1880s and 1970s when they peaked at approximately 55 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, followed by a 30% decline in the 1980s. Uncertainties in national emission estimates due to uncertain sulphur contents in fossil fuels are within ±30% for 22 out of 28 countries and ±45% for the rest. The location of emission sources in Europe has shown over the years a progressive detachment from the coalfields towards a widespread distribution, accompanied in the last decades by considerable emission reductions over north-western and parts of central Europe and substantial increases in the south and south-east. Modelled air concentrations and depositions reflect to a great extent the emission pattern, revealing two- to six-fold increases between the 1880s and 1970s. Maximum sulphur loadings are confined over parts of north-western and central Europe. Accumulated depositions over the period 1880-1991 in these areas reach 600 g (S) m-2. Emissions are principally in the form of sulphur dioxide, so that comparable concentrations of particulate sulphate in low emission regions indicate the importance of long range transport. Assuming a constant ecosystem sensitivity throughout the period, depositions sufficient to cause ecosystem damage may have occurred before 1880 in many areas of north-western and central Europe. Nevertheless, in large parts of eastern and southern Europe depositions are still below these critical loads.",,"acid depositon; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; coal combustion; emission; sulphur dioxide; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030375399

Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial. Setting: Outpatient hysteroscopy clinic in a university hospital. Patients: One hundred fifty-seven patients undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy. Interventions: Outpatient hysteroscopy was performed with carbon dioxide or normal saline with endometrial biopsy when indicated. Main Outcome Measures: Need for local anesthesia, cervical dilatation, view of uterine cavity, need to change from carbon dioxide to normal saline distension, procedure time, patient discomfort (lower abdominal pain, shoulder tip pain, nausea) and complications. Results: Carbon dioxide was used for uterine distension in 79 women and normal saline was used in 78. Cervical dilatation was required more often with carbon dioxide hysteroscopy, although there was no increased requirement for local anesthesia. Hysteroscopic vision was similar between the two media, but eight carbon dioxide cases had be to converted to liquid distension. Procedure times were significantly longer for carbon dioxide hysteroscopy as was the occurrence of bubbles during the procedure. Lower abdominal pain and shoulder tip pain were significantly worse with carbon dioxide distension. Although the incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher with the use of carbon dioxide, the differences did not achieve statistical significance. Conclusion: The use of normal saline for uterine distension had no adverse affects on the hysteroscopic view. It provided a shorter operating time and was well accepted by patients. Because of its easy availability and low cost, normal saline is an excellent alternative to carbon dioxide in women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy.","distension media; Outpatient hysteroscopy; patient acceptance","carbon dioxide; sodium chloride; abdominal pain; adult; aged; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; endometrium biopsy; female; human; hysteroscopy; local anesthesia; major clinical study; menorrhagia; nausea; outpatient care; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; shoulder pain; uterine cervix dilatation; uterus bleeding; vomiting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030023168

Atrazine residues were largely confined to the 0-20cm layers over a 12 month period. Atrazine degraded to the dealkylated metabolites deisopropylatrazine and deethylatrazine, but the major metabolite was hydroxyatrazine, mainly in the Gley Humic soil.

Uptake of the radiocarbon by maize plants after 14-days growth was equivalent to a herbicide concentration of 3.9μg/g fresh tissue and was similar in both soils. High atrazine degradation to hydroxyatrazine was detected by tic of maize extracts. After maize harvest, when beans were sown the Gley Humic soil contained an atrazine concentration of 0.29 μg/g soil and the Deep Red Latosol, 0.13 μg/g soil in the 030 cm layer.

However, such complex models require super-computers and extensive hours of computational time for a single attempt at reproducing long term climate change. An alternative approach is to make simplifying assumptions that retain the essential physics for the desired simulation. Energy balance and Radiative-convective models are examples of such models. The model in this study follows the simplified approach using physics-based climate processes as well as interactions between atmospheric and hydrological processes. The vertically and latitudinally averaged mean temperature and mean water vapour content between 30°N-50°N latitudes are considered as atmospheric state variables while soil and sea temperatures and water storage amount are considered for describing the behaviour of the hydrological system. Temperatures in both the atmosphere and ground are calculated by a thermal energy equation that considers the physically-based processes of shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux. Precipitation and evaporation processes transport moisture between the atmosphere and ground. In this study, the radiation parameterization of the simplified climate model is tested in the investigation of the various effects of global warming due to doubling and quadrupling of CO2. Changes of temperature, soil water content, evaporation rate and precipitation rate are investigated by numerical experiments. The simplified climate model provides acceptable simulation of climate change and holds promise for practical investigations such as the interactions of physical processes in the evolution of drought phenomena. © 1996 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"Carbon dioxide; Drought; Earth atmosphere; Environmental impact; Evaporation; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Thermal effects; Weather modification; Radiation parameters; Climate change; atmospheric processes; carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; climate model; global warming; hydrological processes; radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030418732

This rock exhibits a strong schistosity, comprises mostly talc, contains high MgO (28.0 wt%), Ni (553 ppm) and Cr (267 ppm) and low Al2O3 (2.13 wt%), and bears a high Fe2O3/FeO ratio (0.94). The original rock was probably a submarine ultramafic tuff. The carbon content and the δ13C value of the rock vary on a microscopic scale (a few mm3 scale) from 0.7 to 5.5 wt% and from -15 to -12‰, respectively. The second rock, a quartzite, contains 0.13 wt% C as reduced carbon with a δ13C value of -11.2‰. These δ13C values fall within the range -27 to -10‰ reported by previous investigators for graphite from the Isua district. The δ13C values of the Isua graphite have been interpreted by previous investigators (e.g., Schidlowski and Aharon, 1992) as metamorphic modification of organic matter with initial δ13C values of ∼ -30‰. An important implication of this model has been that the ∼ 3.8-Ga ocean already supported some biological activity. However, an examination of the carbon content vs. δ13C relationship of the graphite-bearing rocks from Isua has revealed that the δ13C value generally increases with increasing carbon contents: the rocks with δ13C values less than ∼ -20‰ contain extremely small amounts of carbon (&lt; 0.01 wt%), while the rocks with carbon contents greater than ∼ 1 wt% have δ13C values around -12‰. Such relationships are not consistent with the previous model for the origin of graphite in Isua, but are consistent with a two-component mixing model in which a major component had δ13C values of ∼ -12‰ and a minor component ∼ -25‰. The minor component may be biogenic, but it is not certain whether it represents a remnant of Archean biological products or more recent ones. The mineralogical and elemental characteristics of the rocks of this study - a thermodynamic consideration of the temperature and composition of metamorphic fluids - and carbon isotope mass calculations suggest that the major component of graphite with δ13C values around -12‰ was formed by an inorganic, rather than by a biological process. The graphite appeared to have formed at temperatures between 700° and 400°C by one or both of the following two processes: (1) reactions between CO2 and CH4 (CO2 + CH4 → 2C + 2H2O) during cooling of fluids with a CO2/CH4 molar ratio of ∼ 1; and/or (2) reactions between the FeO component in the ultramafic rock with CO2-rich fluids (4""FeO"" + CO2 → 2""Fe2O3"" + C). The δ13CΣC values for the fluids for both (1) and (2) were probably between -12 and -5‰, suggesting that the carbon-bearing fluids could have been derived from the mantle.","Archean; Carbon isotope ratio; Graphite; Greenland; Metamorphic fluid","Archaean; geochemistry; graphite; metamorphic rock; tuff; Greenland, Isua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030440532

Jet precession was accomplished using a mechanically-rotated nozzle. Parameters varied include nozzle diameter, jet deflection angle, initial jet velocity (Reynolds number), dimensionless precession frequency (Strouhal number), and fuel type. Measured quantities included visible flame dimensions; NOx, NO2, and CO emissions; and radiant heat flux. Results of these experiments showed that two broad regimes of flame type exist for precessing jet flames. For precession Strouhal numbers (Stp) less than about 0.01, flames are non-luminous and, in comparison with conventional flames, are short and broad. For Stp &gt; 0.03, flames are highly luminous, and of a shape which is between that of a conventional jet flame and the low-Stp flame. In general, radiant fractions increase with precession Strouhal number. High NO2-to-NOx ratios result for flames operating in the low-Stp regime. Concomitantly, CO emissions are relatively high in this regime. At higher Strouhal numbers, both NO2-to-NOx ratios and CO emission indices fall and approach the values typical of conventional jet flames. NOx emission indices are influenced by jet precession and found to be functions of precession Strouhal number, nozzle size, fuel type, and jet deflection angle. NOx emission indices are found to be somewhat lower than those of conventional jet flames, with the largest reduction being approximately 25%. Jet precession also causes a significant reduction in liftoff height relative to a conventional jet flame. This result is thought to be a consequence of the unique character of the flow field in the near-nozzle region of the precessing jet flames.","Carbon monoxide; Oxides of nitrogen; Turbulent combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001120524

CH4 emission data from limited sites are tentative. It is essential that uncertainty in individual sources is reduced in order to develop feasible and effective mitigation options which do not negate gains in rice production and productivity. Field studies at the International Rice Research Institute show that soil and added organic matter are the sources for initial methane production. Addition of rice straw enhances methane production. Roots and root exudates of wetland rice plants appear to be the major carbon sources at ripening stage. The production and transport of CH4 to the atmosphere depend on properties of the rice plant. Under the same spacing and fertilization, the traditional variety Dular emitted more CH4 per day than did the new plant type IR65597. Upon flooding for land preparation anaerobic conditions result in significant amount of methane being formed. Drying the field at midtillering significantly reduced total CH4 emissions. Large amounts of entrapped CH4 escape to the atmosphere when floodwater recedes upon drying at harvest. Cultural practices may account for 20% of the overall seasonal CH4 emissions.","Agronomic practices; Methane production; Organic amendment; Rice cultivars; Water management","methane; organic matter; agriculture; air pollution; climate; conference paper; cultivar; fertilization; plant root; pollution transport; priority journal; rice; season; soil; straw; United States; water management; Agronomy; Atmospheric chemistry; Crops; Cultivation; Floods; Gas emissions; Plants (botany); Productivity; Soils; Agronomic practices; Anoxic bacterial methane production; Organic amendment; Organic matter; Rice cultivars; Rice fields; Water management; Methane; agricultural practice; methane emission; organic amendment; paddy field; Philippines; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663076

The phosphorescence yield and lifetime were 2-6% and 0.9-1.2 sec, respectively. The main phosphorescence maximum was observed at 505 nm that corresponds to the triplet-level energy of 2.45 eV. Excitation spectra showed that phosphorescence originated from monomeric neutral pterin molecules. Phosphorescence emission from ionized and reduced pterin molecules was not detected. Fluorescence spectra of the neutral pterin forms had at 77°K maxima at 427 nm for DMP and at 432 nm for TOP. This shows that the energy of the pterin excited singlet state is 2.87-2.90 eV and the singlet-triplet energy gap is 0.42-0.45 eV. At room temperature, no pterin phosphorescence was observed. Instead, in aerobic aqueous (D2O) solutions, pterin-photosensitized phosphorescence of singlet oxygen was detected. The quantum yield of pterin-generated singlet oxygen calculated from the phosphorescence measurements was 10-17%. The data indicate that the pterin triplet state and singlet oxygen might be involved in photobiochemical reactions of pterins. As the intensity of pterin phosphorescence is very high, its detection can be used as a sensitive assay for studies of pterins in model and biological systems.","Flavins; Fluorescence; Phosphorescence; Photoreception; Pterins; Singlet oxygen; Triplet state",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001080641

The objective was to find how a typhoon redistributes trace constituents in the West Pacific region and whether any such redistribution is important on the global scale. The boundary layer air (300 m), in a region to the SE of the eye, contained low mixing ratios of the tracer species O3, CO, C2H6, C2H2, C3H8, C6H6 and CS2 but high values of dimethylsulfide (DMS). The eye region relative to the boundary layer, showed somewhat elevated levels of CO, substantially increased levels of O3, CS2 and all nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), and somewhat reduced levels of DMS. Ahead of the eye, CO and the NMHCs remained unchanged, O3 and CS2 showed a modest decrease, and DMS showed a substantial decrease. There was no evidence from lidar cross sections of ozone for the downward entrainment of stratospheric air into the eye region; these sections show that low ozone values were measured in the troposphere. The DMS data suggest substantial entrainment of boundary layer air into the system, particularly into the eye wall region. Estimates of the DMS sulphur flux between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, based on computations of velocity potential and divergent winds, gave values of about 69 μg S n-2 d-1 averaged over a 17.5° grid square encompassing the typhoon. A few hours after sampling with the DC-8, Mireille passed over Oki Island, just to the north of Japan, producing surface values of ozone of 5.5 ppbv. These O3 levels are consistent with the low tropospheric values found by lidar and are more typical of equatorial regions. We suggest that the central eye region may act like a Taylor column which has moved poleward from low latitudes. The high-altitude photochemical environment within Typhoon Mireille was found to be quite active as evidenced by significant levels of measured gas phase H2O2 and CH3OOH and model-computed levels of OH.

An inward rectifying K+ channel, the dominant ion channel in Müller cells, is localized preferentially to cell endfeet, which terminate on the vitreal surface of the retina and on blood vessels. Two acid/base transport systems, an Na+/HCO3- cotransporter and a Cl-/HCO3- anion exchanger, also are localized preferentially to the endfeet. These functional specializations facilitate the ability of Müller cells to regulate extracellular ion levels in the retina. Müller cells regulate extracellular K+ levels by transporting K+ away from the neural retina to the vitreous humor and the subretinal space. Müller cells may also regulate retinal CO2 and pH by the combined action of cell carbonic anhydrase and acid/base transporters localized to the endfeet, and they may control blood flow by the depolarization-induced release of potassium and protons from cell endfeet onto blood vessels. The physiology of ion transport in CNS astrocytes is not understood as well as it is in Müller cells. The presence of inward rectifying K+ channels and acid/base transporters in astrocytes, however, suggests that these cells may utilize mechanisms similar to those of Müller cells in regulating the extracellular microenvironment and in controlling blood flow.","Extracellular K+; Extracellular pH; Glial cell; K+ channels; Müller cell; Na+/HCO3- cotransport; Polarized",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042928351

Using large turves from an established pasture, the response of these communities at 350 or 700 μll-1 CO2 to a soil moisture deficit and to recovery from the deficit in comparison to turves that were well-watered throughout was measured. Prior to this experiment the turves had been exposed to the CO2 treatments for 324 d. Net CO2 exchange continued at elevated CO2 even when the volumetric soil moisture content was less than 0.10 m3 m-3 soil; at the same moisture deficit gas exchange at ambient CO2 was zero. The additional carbon fixed by the elevated CO2 turves was primarily allocated below-ground as shown by the maintenance of root length density at the same level as in well-watered turves. When the dry turves were rewatered there was compensatory growth at ambient CO2 so that the above-ground growth rate exceeded that of turves that had not experienced a moisture deficit. At the start of this experiment, the turves that were growing at 700 μl l-1 CO2 had a greater proportion of legume (principally white clover, Trifolium repens L.) in the harvested herbage. There was a trend for the legume content at elevated CO2 to be reduced under a soil moisture deficit. The results indicate different strategies in response to soil moisture deficits depending on the CO2 concentration. At ambient CO2, growth stopped, but plants were able to respond strongly on rewatering; while at elevated CO2 growth continued (particularly below-ground), but no additional growth was evident on rewatering. Ecosystem gas exchange measurements taken at the end of the experiment (after 429 d of exposure to CO2) showed 33% more CO2 was fixed at elevated CO2 with only a small (12%) and non-significant downward regulation.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas exchange; Grassland; Soil moisture deficit","Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001140642

The first-stage worldwide survey was completed in fall 1994 while the second-stage was completed by summer 1995. The paper reports results from the second round of the survey and the major differences between the two rounds. This second-stage international survey obtained information from 93 expert respondents from the automotive technology field. The second stage response provided the following key results. EVs will penetrate the market first followed by internal combustion engine powered HEVs while gas turbine and fuel cell powered HEVs will not have any significant penetration until after 2020. By 2020 EVs and internal combustion engine powered HEVs are projected to have approximately a 15% share of the new vehicle market. They will also cost significantly (18-50%) more and will have characteristics slightly inferior to 1993 gasoline baseline cars. The AC (alternating current) induction motor is projected to be both technically and economically superior to the DC (direct-current) and DC brushless motors by 2020. The DC motor will be significantly less expensive in 2000 offsetting its declining technical competitiveness DC brushless motors are projected to be the most expensive throughout the study period. Though generally declining significantly throughout the period, battery costs will remain high, especially for the high specific energy units. EVs are believed to be effective in reducing urban emissions however, the costs of these vehicles must be reduced drastically. Petroleum is expected to be the predominant source of fuel for hybrid vehicles through 2020. The mean energy equivalent fuel economy of electric drivetrain vehicles is projected to be 20-40% greater than for conventional vehicles in 2000 and to rise a few percents during the projection period.

This paper shows that coastal management also needs to address long-term problems and, in particular, the likelihood of climate change. Regional scale studies suggest that the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable to increased flooding by storm surges as sea levels rise-a 1-m rise in sea level would cause at least a six-fold increase in the number of people experiencing such flooding in a typical year, without considering population growth. Protection is quite feasible, however, this would place a greater burden on those Mediterranean countries in the south than those in the north. All coastal wetlands appear threatened. Case studies of coastal cities (Venice and Alexandria), deltas (Nile, Po, Rhone and Ebro), and islands (Cyprus) support the need to consider climate change in coastal planning. However, the critical issues vary from site to site and from setting, to setting. In deltaic areas and low-lying coastal plains climate change, particularly sea-level rise, is already considered as an important issue, but elsewhere this is not the case. Therefore, there is a need for coastal management plans to explicitly address long-term issues, including climate change, and integrate this planning with short-term issues. This is entirely consistent with existing guidelines. Given the large uncertainty concerning the future, planning for climate change will involve identifying and implementing low-cost proactive measures, such as appropriate land use planning or improved design standards incorporated within renewal cycles, as well as identifying sectors or activities which may he compromised by likely climate change. In the latter case, any necessary investment can he seen as a prudent 'insurance policy'.",,"Coastal management; Coastal wetlands; Insurance policy; Mediterranean; Population growth; Coastal zones; Floods; Management; Regional planning; Sea level; Seawater; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030437691

Such local fields are usually obtained using sharp emitters. An alternative approach is to cover the otherwise blunt emitter (BE) with a porous silicon (PS) layer. The PS is composed of many fibrils with dimensions of several nm which act as ""nano-emitters"". In this article such an emitter is considered as part of a vertical field emission microtriode (FEMT). The BE has spherical tip and conical body and protrudes through the gate circular opening, allowing the FEMT operation in the collector-assisted mode. An electric field multiplication approximation is studied using both an analytical and a numerical emitter model. The field multiplication means that the fibril increases the local electric field, which is already increased by the BE as compared with the uniform field at large distances from it. This approximation is valid as long as the fibril dimensions are much smaller than the BE ones. The fibrils mutual influence on the field is studied separately and taken into account for the FEMT case. The emission current is computed through integration of the Fowler-Nordheim J(E) current density-electric field relationship over the BE and fibrils area. Comparison is provided with the case of BE not covered with PS. The emission current is obtained as function of model parameters.

The model simulated potential and water-limited crop production (growth with ample supply of nutrients and in the absence of damage by pests, diseases and weeds). Historic daily weather data from 13 sites in Western Europe were used as starting point. For potential production (optimal water) a 3 °C temperature rise led to a yield decline due to a shortening of the growing period on all locations. Doubling of the CO2 concentration caused an increase in yield of 40% due to higher assimilation rates. It was found that effects of higher temperature and higher CO2 concentration were nearly additive and the combination of both led to a yield increase of 1-2 ton ha-1. A very small CO2-temperature interaction was found: the effect of doubled CO2 concentration on crop yield was larger at higher temperatures. The inter-annual yield variability was hardly affected. When water was limiting crop-production effects of temperature rise and higher CO2 levels were different than for the potential production. Rise in temperature led to a smaller yield reduction, doubled CO2 concentration to a larger yield increase and combination of both led to a large yield increase (3 ton ha-1) in comparison with yields simulated for the present situation. Both rise in temperature and increase in the CO2 concentration reduced water requirements of the crop. Water shortages became smaller, leading to a reduction in inter-annual variability. It is concluded that when no major changes in precipitation pattern occur a climate change will not affect wheat yields since negative effects of higher temperatures are compensated by positive effects of CO2 enrichment.",,"Triticum aestivum; Poaceae; Triticum aestivum; agricultural impact; air temperature; carbon dioxide; climate change; climatic change; crop growth; growth; modelling; simulation model; SUCROS87; temperature; wheat; wheat yield; yield; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659932

The measured performance of the CVOTC during field trials is reported and shows that a 5-fold reduction in carbon dioxide consumption is possible in comparison to OTCs. This low carbon dioxide consumption has been achieved in the CVOTC mostly by controlling the ventilation air flow in relation to the cooling requirement and by using a frustum with a 0.5 m diameter opening over the 3 m diameter chamber to limit air incursion; this small frustum opening resulted in the CVOTC nearly resembling a closed chamber. The average temperature in the CVOTC was 1.6°C above ambient which represents a slight increase above the average temperature excess in conventional OTCs. Air speeds over the plants within the CVOTC were approximately 1 ms-1, with the flow uniformity much improved in comparison to current OTCs. The results for the CVOTC show that a mean standard deviation in carbon dioxide concentration of about 40 μmol mol-1 is achievable when four permitted combinations (states) of ventilation/recirculation are employed, and that at least six ventilation states, or preferably a continuously-variable ventilation/recirculation combination, are required in order to achieve a narrow spread. During the CVOTC trials, the deviation between the mean carbon dioxide concentration and the target value was less than 6%. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Mauritius Family Planning Association (MFPA) tackled the issue of unsafe abortion in 1993. Abortion is illegal in the country, and the Catholic Church also strongly opposes modern family planning methods, thus the use of withdrawal and/or calendar methods have been increasing. The MFPA organized an advocacy symposium in 1993 on unsafe abortion with the result of revealing the pressure the Church was exerting relative to abortion and contraceptives. The advocacy campaign of the MFPA consists of having abortion legalized on health grounds and improving family planning services, especially for young unmarried women and men. The full support of the media was secured on the abortion issue: articles appeared, meetings were attended by the press, and public relations support was also received from them. The MFPA worked closely with parliamentarians. A motion was tabled in 1994 in the National Assembly which called for legalization of abortion on health grounds, but the Church squelched its debate. In March 1994 MFPA hosted the IPPF African Regional Conference on Unsafe Abortion in Mauritius with the participation of over 100 representatives from 20 countries, and subsequently a second motion was tabled without parliamentary debate. The deliberations were covered by the media and the Ministry of Women's Rights recognized abortion as an urgent issue as outlined in a white paper prepared for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995. The campaign changed the policy climate favorably making the public more conscious of unsafe abortion. The Ministry of Health decided to collect more data and the newly elected government seems to be more open about this issue.",,"Abortion, Illegal; Abortion, Induced--religious aspects; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; attitude; attitude to health; behavior; developing country; Eastern Africa; Economic Factors; economics; English Speaking Africa; family planning; Fertility Control, Postconception; French Speaking Africa; illegal abortion; induced abortion; law; Mauritius; Opposition To Family Planning; Psychological Factors; psychology; socioeconomics; women's rights; Women's Status; Abortion, Illegal; Abortion, Induced--religious aspects; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Attitude; Behavior; Developing Countries; Eastern Africa; Economic Factors; English Speaking Africa; Family Planning; Fertility Control, Postconception; French Speaking Africa; Legislation; Mauritius; Opposition To Family Planning; Psychological Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Women's Status; Abortion, Criminal; Abortion, Induced; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Eastern; Africa, Northern; Attitude; Behavior; Developing Countries; Economics; Family Planning Services; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Legislation; Mauritius; Psychology; Socioeconomic Factors; Women's Rights",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029704007

By applying the standard necessary conditions, a multipoint-boundary-value problem is derived and its numerical solution obtained by multiple-shooting technique is presented. Special attention is paid to the computation of the reachable set of the system and to the dependence of the control structure on the final state prescribed. In order to smooth a certain irregular behaviour of the solutions near the end of the arbitrarily fixed time-interval, an additional monotonicity constraint for the CO2-concentration is introduced.

The area considered in southwest Ghana is covered by lithologies of the volcanic-sedimentary Birimian Supergroup and the overlying clastic sedimentary Tarkwaian Group which were jointly folded and metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions during the Eburnean tectonothermal event at about 2.1 Ga. Regional foliation and subparallel shear zones hosting mesothermal gold mineralization developed during deformation coeval with metamorphism. Four major types of primary) gold mineralization are present in the Ashanti belt: (1) mesothermal, generally steeply dipping quartz veins in shear zones mainly in Birimian sedimentary rocks, (2) sulfide ores with auriferous arsenopyrite and pyrite, spatially closely associated with the quartz veins, (3) sulfide disseminations and stockworks in granitoids, and (4) paleoplacers of the Tarkwaian Group. This study concentrates on types (1) and (2) of the hydrothermal gold mineralization. Stable isotope analyses of host-rock and ore components were performed with the aim of obtaining parameters relevant to the origin and evolution of the fluids that produced gold mineralization. Carbonaceous matter in the Birimian metasediments displays δ 13C values ranging from -11.4 to -28.3 per mil relative to PDB, indicating an organogenic origin. Carbonates display a unimodal distribution of δ 13C values ranging from -9.9 to -17.0 per mil relative to PDB. CO 2 extracted from fluid inclusions in the auriferous quartz veins has δ 13C values ranging from -9.5 to -15.7 per mil relative to PDB. It is proposed that these carbon isotope compositions of carbonates and CO 2 reflect extensive interaction of the CO 2-rich hydrothermal fluids with reduced carbon in Birimian sediments in the deeper parts of the hydrothermal systems. Carbonates and auriferous vein quartz have δ 18O values ranging from 12.9 to 22.2 and 12.8 to 15.6 per mil relative to SMOW, respectively. Carbonates and quartz were deposited in near isotopic equilibrium with respect to δ 18O, indicating fluid-dominated conditions during ore formation, from fluids of metamorphic or magmatic origin. Such an origin is corroborated by δD values of water extracted from fluid inclusions in vein quartz (-37 to -53‰ relative to SMOW). Pyrite of synsedimentary-diagenetic origin in Birimian schists displays sulfur isotope compositions ranging from +7.3 to -20.9 per mil (median ca. -10‰ relative to CDT). Similar compositions and wide ranges are usually attributed to sulfide generation by bacterial sulfate reduction from seawater. Arsenopyrite and cogenetic pyrite from the sulfide ores generally have δ 34S values in the range -5.3 to -10.2 per mil relative to CDT. The tight unimodal distribution of δ 34S values indicates a large, homogeneous fluid reservoir. The low δ 34S values are interpreted as source-inherited, not related to unusual pH, Eh, temperature, or depositional conditions. Sulfides in Birimian sediments represent the most likely sulfur reservoir tapped by the fluid systems. The C, O, H, and S isotope compositions of ore-related hydrothermal minerals and fluid inclusion components indicate that the mineralizing fluids interacted extensively with the Paleoproterozoic rocks, especially Birimian sediments, at deeper crustal levels and at high temperatures. The isotopic compositions are most compatible with the formation of fluids from devolatilization reactions involving Birimian strata during prograde metamorphism at depth (metamorphic fluids).",,"geochemistry; gold; isotopic analysis; ore genesis; Ghana, Ashanti Belt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030485553

The spectroscopic data are analyzed in the strong coupling limit of dimer models and lead to an excitation exchange interaction term of 1770 cm-1 and an evaluation of the excited state lifetime of ca. 24 ps.

The enzyme (HSD 28) has a monomeric molecular mass of 28 kDa. It belongs to the protein superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) as established by N-terminal sequence analysis. Along with the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3-oxo-reductase activities towards a variety of cis or trans fused A/B ring steroids, it also reduces several xenobiotic carbonyl compounds, including a metyrapone-based class of insecticides, to the respective alcohol metabolites. No dihydrodiol dehydrogenase activity towards trans- or cis-benzene-dihydrodiols could be detected, thus distinguishing it from the indomethacine-sensitive, mammalian liver type 3α-HSDs. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the enzyme is localized in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. Proteins similar to the 3α-HSD were detected and characterized from Comamonas testosteroni strain ATCC 17454 and from a commercially available steroid-induced extract of a patent Pseudomonas strain. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 3α-HSD from the latter strain (HSD 29) is highly similar (94% identity over 15 residues) to a previously determined primary structure of a Pseudomonas species 3α-HSD. However, no similarities could be detected between HSD 28 and a recently determined 3α-HSD sequence from the ATCC 11996 Comamonas strain. The specific crossreaction of antibodies directed against mammalian liver type I 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD I) with the isolated 3α-HSDs suggests the existence of a functionally and structurally related subgroup within the SDR superfamily. The broad substrate specificities of the characterized 3α-HSD enzymes lead to the conclusion that they might participate in the intestinal bioactivation or inactivation of hormones, bile acids and xenobiotics since Comamonas testosteroni and related species are found in the intestinal tract of vertebrates including man.","Bile acid; Carbonyl reduction; Ecdysteroid; Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases","3alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; carbonyl reductase; testosterone; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; article; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; enzyme purification; enzyme specificity; Gram negative bacterium; immunoreactivity; liver; molecular weight; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein family; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; sequence homology; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Comamonas; Comamonas testosteroni; Mammalia; Negibacteria; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029973223

As nonattainment areas strive to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, the potential emission reduction benefits of truck-related control measures must be evaluated to ensure that all sources of emissions are considered in the planning processes. However, little is known about the contribution of intercity trucking to emissions inventories in regions across the country, particularly since the Environmental Protection Agency's MOBILE emissions factor model is not well-suited for this purpose. The incorporation of intercity trucking in emission inventory estimates is reviewed, and a methodology by which intercity trucking emissions can be easily isolated using information documented in state implementation plans (SIPs) is developed. Using SIP data for a select number of metropolitan areas and the Truck Inventory and Use Survey (TIUS), the emissions contributions of city-to-city truck transport and drayage operations are assessed.

Design: necropsy, police and hospital records were scrutinized for 194 victims who committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning from car exhausts during a four-year period in Sweden. Setting and participants: the State Institutes of Forensic Medicine in Umea and Stockholm. Results: a higher incidence (24.2/million population) was seen in the rural region than in the urban region (14.9). Males dominated (88%), most of them middle aged. Most victims committed suicide in a car outdoors. A vacuum cleaner tube connected to the compartment was most commonly used. Severe disease, mostly psychiatric, was seen in 61% of the victims. Drugs were detected in 8% of the victims under psychiatric treatment. In 37%, earlier suicide behaviour was documented. Suicide notes were found in 40%. Blood alcohol was detected in 51% of the victims and other drugs in 7%. Conclusions: environmental changes may reduce the number of carbon monoxide suicides from car exhausts, e.g. introduction of a law requiring catalyst exhaust, of automatic idling stop, and of exhaust pipes incompatible with vacuum cleaner tubes. The importance of accurate treatment of psychiatric patients is stressed.","Car exhausts; Carbon monoxide intoxication; Prevention; Suicide","adult; age; aged; alcohol blood level; article; autopsy; carbon monoxide intoxication; drug blood level; exhaust gas; female; human; major clinical study; male; marriage; medical record; police; psychiatric treatment; rural area; sex difference; social status; suicide; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343586538

Since wastewater treatment systems operate under different aeration regimens, the influence of different oxygen concentrations and oxygen fluctuations on denitrification was studied. Continuous cultures of Alcaligenes faecalis TUD produced N2O under anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions. Below a dissolved oxygen concentration of 5% air saturation, the relatively highest N2O production was observed. Under these conditions, significant activities of nitrite reductase could be measured. After transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, there was insufficient nitrite reductase present to sustain growth and the culture began to wash out. After 20 h, nitrite reductase became detectable and the culture started to recover. Nitrous oxide reductase became measurable only after 27 h, suggesting sequential induction of the denitrification reductases, causing the transient accumulation of N2O. After transition from anaerobic conditions to aerobic conditions, nitrite reduction continued (at a lower rate) for several hours. N2O reduction appeared to stop immediately after the switch, indicating inhibition of nitrous oxide reductase, resulting in high N2O emissions (maximum, 1.4 mmol liter-1 h-1). The nitrite reductase was not inactivated by oxygen, but its synthesis was repressed. A half-life of 16 to 22 h for nitrite reductase under these conditions was calculated. In a dynamic aerobic-anaerobic culture of A. faecalis, a semisteady state in which most of the N2O production took place after the transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions was obtained. The nitrite consumption rate in this culture was equal to that in an anaerobic culture (0.95 and 0.92 mmol liter-1 h-1, respectively), but the production of N2O was higher in the dynamic culture (28 and 26% of nitrite consumption, respectively).",,"nitrous oxide; activated sludge; aerobic metabolism; Alcaligenes faecalis; anaerobic metabolism; article; bacterial growth; denitrification; effluent; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; nonhuman; waste water management; Alcaligenes faecalis; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029982865

A non-stoichiometric, mixed-oxide catalyst, Li 0.9Ni0.5Co0.5O2-δ containing both mobile ions and electrons at elevated temperatures was investigated. The exit gas stream was monitored by using the multiple-ion monitoring facility of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The AC electrical characteristics of the catalyst pellet between 100 Hz and 1 MHz were simultaneously monitored in-situ. A clear correlation between catalytic behaviour and electrical properties was obtained. Frequency-dependent AC losses due to surface dipole effects were dominant during phases of strong chemisorption and reaction, whilst reversion to thermally activated behaviour occurred during times of reduced chemical activity. In the case of carbon dioxide hydrogenation, the catalyst becomes partially reduced as a result of the chemical reaction, as shown by the changes in conductance-temperature-frequency characteristics. The original oxidised state could be recovered by re-oxidation at 700°C for 1 hour in air. For the partial oxidation of methane, mobile lattice oxygen participates in the reaction.

Our previous work showed that, because of the effect of gravitational lensing, dipolar fields cannot reproduce the strong pulsations observed in the four nearby pulsars for which surface thermal radiation has been detected: PSR 0833-45 (Vela), PSR 0656 + 14, PSR 0630+178 (Geminga), and PSR 1055-52. Assuming a standard neutron star mass of 1.4 M⊙, we show here that the inclusion of a quadrupolar component, if it is suitably oriented, is sufficient to increase substantially the pulsed fraction, PF, up to or above the observed values if the stellar radius is 13 km or even 10 km. For models with a radius of 7 km, the maximum pulsed fraction obtainable with (isotropic) blackbody emission is of the order of 15% for orthogonal rotators (Vela, Geminga, and PSR 1055-52) and only 5% for an inclined rotator such as PSR 0656 + 14. Given the observed values, this may indicate that the neutron stars in Geminga and PSR 0656 + 14 have radii significantly larger than 7 km, and given that very specific quadrupolar components are required to reproduce the large observed PF, even radii of the order of 10 km may be unlikely in all four cases. However, effects not included in our study might seriously invalidate this tentative conclusion. We confirm our previous finding that the pulsed fraction always increases with photon energy, up to ∼ 1 keV, when blackbody emission is used, and we show that this is due to the hardening of the black- 7 body spectrum with increasing temperature. The observed decrease of the pulsed fraction may thus suggest that the emitted spectrum is softer in the warmest regions than in colder ones and that this observed effect must be of magnetospheric origin, probably due to the magnetic field. Finally, we apply our model to reassess the magnetic field's effect on the outer boundary condition used in neutron star cooling models and show that, in contradistinction to several previous claims, it is a small effect. © 1996.

Following compression, burning proceeds as air and fuel mix to the composition necessary for combustion to take place. In the diesel engine, fuel is injected in the cylinder into high pressure and temperature air. The engine has less time to form the air-fuel mixture, which is less homogenous as a result. This creates periods during the combustion phase where the air to fuel relationship is non-optimized. This is particularly apparent during low-end operating cycles. Traditionally, efforts to reduce engine-out emissions have concentrated on fuel management. Development of two advanced technologies on turbocharged diesel engines have focused instead on air management with the optimization of this relationship of air to fuel. Test results indicate significant improvements that meet or exceed fuel management techniques designed to improve combustion efficiency, fuel economy, engine performance and emission reductions. This paper discusses these air management advancements based on steady-state and EPA transient cycle testing of two heavy-duty diesel engines. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air engines; Combustion; Efficiency; Emission control; Engine cylinders; Fuel economy; Fuels; Advanced technology; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion pro-cess; Engine performance; Engine-out emissions; Heavy-duty diesel engine; High-pressure and temperatures; Turbocharged diesel engine; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072474652

The modeling is one component of a hazardous air pollution research program undertaken by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Health Services to estimate health risks in the state. The program focuses on analyzing four geographic regions that were selected to represent a large fraction of the state's population and that are characteristic of many of the types of communities in the state. The atmospheric simulation model used in this study is a three-dimensional, Eulerian model that simulates transport and deposition of HAP emissions at a time step of one hour. The model used a detailed 1994 inventory of emissions from all known sources of HAPS and 1994 meteorological data from several operational networks in Arizona. Hourly-, monthly- and yearly-averaged model estimates were used to evaluate chronic, sub-chronic and acute exposures respectively, of the population from inhalation of these HAPs. This modeling approach is unique because health risk assessment studies typically use plume models based on Gaussian dispersion (such as the Industrial Source Complex or ISC model) to estimate atmospheric chemical concentrations resulting from emissions from a few sources. However, the use of Gaussian models would be impractical in this study due to the presence of a multitude of sources (i.e. point, line, and area sources) distributed in large (e.g., 120 × 100 km2 study regions. The evaluations of the ability of the model to simulate geographic distributions of annual-average HAP concentrations are presented in this paper. These include (comparison of 24-hour HAP concentrations estimated by the model with 24-hour HAP measurements at limited locations. Results from the simulations indicate that the simulation model predicts both annual and 24-hour average concentrations of some HAPs at the residential neighborhood site fairly well.",,"Air pollution; Computer simulation; Health hazards; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Risk assessment; Three dimensional; Arizona; Eulerian modeling; Gaussian models; Hazardous air pollutants; Atmospheric composition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17544390129

Past emissions requirements have been achieved by controlling engine combustion parameters. Extremely low NOx and particulate levels are achieved by adding an external device downstream of the engine. Noxtech, Inc. has developed a system for the selective non-catalytic reduction of NOx and particulates from diesel engines. This non-catalytic Noxtech system use an innocuous chemical at 1300-1500°F to achieve greater than 90% NOx reduction, with concurrent particulate and hydrocarbon reduction. The reaction temperature is achieved by combustion of supplemental diesel fuel. The first part of this presentation will discuss some of Noxtech's experience with parametric testing and by-product certification in various experimental systems. Noxtech has installed and field tested commercial scale systems on large stationary diesel power generation sites in Hawaii, Minnesota, and California. Sampling procedures and analytical methodologies adopted to achieve complete resolution on all by-product issues will be discussed. Continual process improvements has since resulted in a compact, efficient and cost effective muffler sized Noxtech system for controlling emissions from diesel and lean burn natural gas engines. Advanced designs incorporate a simplified control as well as chemical and supplemental fuel delivery systems. The salient features and performance characteristics of this advanced Noxtech system will be discussed in the latter part of this presentation. Efforts will be made to elucidate the critical reactions and effect of reaction parameters on achieving NOx reduction.

The emissions of metals into different environmental media are estimated. The pools and flows in the biosphere are introduced, and compared with the anthropogenic pools and emissions. Finally, the product emissions are compared with the measured dissipative use, based on the metal concentrations in the sludge at the main waste water treatment plant and in storm water. The amount of lead that is recorded in the waste water treatment plants can mainly be explained by deposition. However, emissions from many of the product categories quantified for lead in Stockholm are not likely to collect at sewage treatment plants. Instead, the emissions are more likely to be noticed in the storm water, the soil and the sediments around the city. In total, about 45000 tonnes of lead and about 6000 tonnes of metallic zinc are quantified in the study. The product emissions were roughly estimated to be 30 tonnes of lead each year. There are however, large uncertainties in the emission factors. The city can definitely be regarded as a source of zinc pollution. This can be seen in the flows that are registered in the waste water treatment plants, and the estimated storm water flows. From these estimates, the city appears to contribute about 30 tonnes of metallic and biogenic zinc each year to surrounding waters and to sludge. For the product groups and the emission factors used in this study, a zinc emission of about 17 tonnes per year was estimated, with the main contributions coming from street furniture, tyres and buildings.","Pb; regional material flow analysis; Stockholm; Zn","lead; zinc; article; biosphere; environmental impact assessment; pollution transport; priority journal; sludge disposal; Sweden; urban area; water pollution; biosphere; lead; material flow; technosphere; zinc; Sweden, Stockholm",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030606031

Persons suffering from respiratory diseases, especially asthma patients, are sensitive to NO2 at high concentrations. Nitrogen oxide emissions from private cars have decreased due to the introduction of catalysts. However, the catalyst technique is today limited to petrol vehicles. Since heavy diesel vehicles, e.g. buses, contribute significantly to the NO(x) emissions, this will limit the reduction in emissions in many urban streets. Another factor is the continued increase in the car fleet in all countries. Most of the NO(x) from traffic is emitted as NO, which is thought to be harmless. NO is rapidly transformed to NO2 by a reaction with ozone in the air. Tropospheric ozone levels have been increasing in Europe for many years as a consequence of increasing pollution. Ozone in Danish streets is seen to be the limiting factor for the production of NO2. Thereby O3 is also the limiting factor for the NO2 levels in the streets. In this paper the above will be supported both by observations from the Danish air quality measurement programmes and by model simulations with the Danish Operational Street Pollution Model.","air pollution; modelling; monitoring; NO2; O3; traffic","nitrogen dioxide; nitrous oxide; air pollution; conference paper; controlled study; priority journal; reduction; traffic; urban area",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243653537

It is explained by physical properties of laser emission (LE) which differs from general light sources by quantitative behavior of such parameters as the degrees of coherence, monochromaticity, brightness, polarization. Thus, biological effects due to laser emission, as a rule, are more expressed comparing with other types of emission from other spontaneous light sources. LE effects biological tissues through the density of energy flow and impulse duration. It is common knowledge nowadays that LE biological action is assessed by two criteria: physical parameters and absorptive properties of tissues exposed to rays. LE causes the greatest danger to the eyes due to their specific structure. The next target organ vulnerable to LE is skin. Pathological changes of skin depend on the LE power, time of exposure, wave length, and the extent of skin pigmentation. Along with different kinds of damage directly in the tissues exposed to rays, LE may cause changes in organs and body systems subject to indirect exposure. It is important that these changes may develop due to low intensity levels of LE that do not cause local damage. National and international standards on LE safety are based on maximum allowable levels (MAL) of exposure. It has been generally accepted that the main MAL criterion is LE threshold minimal exposure which causes damage to retina, eyes, and skin. As distinct from foreign safety standards, hygienic norms and regulations are in force in the Russian Federation where additional co-efficients along with standard generally accepted MAL values have been introduced for the persons who are subject to occupational regular exposure to lasers. This approach has been chosen after the results of follow-up and health studies of these occupational contingents have been analyzed, and experiments on laboratory animals assessed.",,"Biophysics; Medical safety; Accident prevention; Health risks; Laser beam effects; Laser surgery; Light absorption; Patient treatment; Skin; Laser tissue interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029753624

HC-toxin production is controlled, at least in part, by a duplicated 22-kb region of DNA that is found only in toxin-producing isolates of the fungus. This 22-kb region of DNA is flanked by a repetitive element. We have sequenced the element and found an interrupted reading frame that would encode a product similar to transposases from the fungal transposons Fot1 of Fusarium oxysporum and Pot2 of Magnaporthe grisea. The individual element cloned from C. carbonum is likely to function neither in cis nor trans, as it had a nonsense mutation in frame and several substitutions in its terminal inverted repeats. However, similar elements in the C. carbonum genome may be active, as the putative transposase-encoding region hybridized to mRNA of the size predicted by the reading frame. The element was found in varying copy number in the genomes of all Cochliobolus spp. examined, giving a distinct fingerprint in each species and race tested. The sequence similarity of the C. carbonum repetitive element to other fungal transposons, along with its presence in multiple copies per genome, strongly suggest that the C. carbonum repetitive element is a member of the Fot1 family of fungal transposons.","Bipolaris; DNA fingerprinting; HC-toxin; Helminthosporium; Transposable element; Transposase","cyclopeptide; messenger RNA; mycotoxin; article; Ascomycetes; controlled study; DNA fingerprinting; DNA flanking region; DNA sequence; Fusarium oxysporum; gene locus; genotype; maize; nonhuman; nonsense mutation; nucleic acid base substitution; priority journal; RNA hybridization; transposon; Ascomycota; Bipolaris; Cochliobolus carbonum; Fungi; Fusarium; Fusarium oxysporum; Helminthosporium; Magnaporthe grisea; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030591742

Critical loads are being used in policy decisions regarding air pollution emissions. In this paper, we applied four mass and charge balance methods of calculating critical loads to two northern hardwood forests in the northeastern United States. Critical loads for nitrogen deposition with respect to acidity ranged from 0-630 eq/ha-yr. Critical loads for nitrogen deposition with respect to effects of elevated nitrogen (eutrophication and nutrient imbalances) ranged from 0-1450 eq/ha-yr. At both the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) and Huntington Wildlife Forest (HWF), the critical load for nitrogen with respect to acidity was exceeded. At the HBEF, due to reduced forest growth, the critical load for nitrogen with respect to nutrient imbalances and eutrophication was exceeded in recent years. At Huntington Wildlife Forest, the critical load with respect to nitrogen effects was also exceeded. This analysis demonstrated that the calculated critical load of nitrogen varies in response to changes in environmental conditions such as variations in atmospheric deposition of sulfate or changes in forest biomass accumulation.",,"nitrogen; air pollution; article; bioaccumulation; biomass; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; forest; nonhuman; United States; acidity; atmospheric deposition; boreal forest; critical load; nitrogen deposition; USA; Acid rain; Biomass; Calculations; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Forestry; Mathematical models; Nitrogen; pH; Critical loads; Eutrophication; Forest growth; Hardwood forest; Nitrogen deposition; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663635

Treatment of this cell line with 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dibenzodioxin (TCDD), a nonmetabolized environmental contaminant, and indolo(3,2-b)carbazole (ICZ), a metabolite of a natural pesticide found in cruciferous vegetables, is shown to both induce CYP1A1 activity and elevate the excretion rate of oxo8Gua; 7,8-benzoflavone (7,8-BF or α-naphthoflavone), an inhibitor of CYP1A1 activity and an antagonist of the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor, reduced the excretion rate of oxo8Gua. The essential role of Ah-receptor, which mediates the induction of CYP1A1, is shown by the inability of TCDD to induce CYP1A1 and to increase excretion of oxo8Gua in Ah receptor-defective c4 mutant cells. While there was a significant 7.0-fold increase over 2 days in the excretion rate of oxo8Gua into the growth medium of TCDD-treated Hepa1c1c7 cells compared to control, no significant increase was detected in the steady-state level of oxo8dG in the DNA presumably due to efficient DNA repair.

A pure manganese target is used as well as a manganese target containing 2 mol % carbon. The clusters are reacted with hydrogen both in the region of cluster growth and in a flow-tube reactor (FTR) downstream of the cluster source. The reactions, both with hydrogen atoms in the cluster growth region and dissociative chemisorption of H2 in the FTR, result in hydrogen atoms bound to the clusters, except that for Mn15 and smaller clusters the H atoms are unstable against H2 desorption. Above Mn15 stable hydrides are formed, but the rate of reaction in the FTR varies considerably with cluster size. This abrupt change in the ability to bind hydrogen may reflect a significant change in the character of the bonding within the cluster, perhaps from van der Waals to metallic. MnnC clusters readily react with hydrogen for n&gt;6 to form MnnCH2. Further reactivity generally follows the pattern of the bare clusters, suggesting that the two hydrogen atoms on MnnCH2 are bound to the carbon.

The phase separation conditions are shown to impact the microstructure of the foams. Pore growth will occur through two mechanisms: diffusion of CO2 from polymer-rich regions into the pores and also through CO2 gas expansion (boiling of liquid CO2 at reduced pressure). Higher CO2 pressures for polymerization (hence, higher fluid density) provide more CO2 molecules for foaming, generate lower interfacial tension and viscosity in the polymer matrix, and thus produce higher cell densities. Increasing the functionality of the polyurethane precursors increases the Tg of the polymer network and leads to smaller cell diameters by raising the vitrification pressure and allowing less time for CO2 gas expansion to play a role in cell growth. Higher reaction temperatures result in an increase in bulk density as the cell density remains invariant and the cell size drops. The use of the more polar fluoroform as a foaming agent results in larger cells, as it is able to plasticize the polymer network and allow for gas expansion during depressurization.

The behavior of samples fabricated using direct plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) can be explained by electronic emission from interface states to the conduction band minimum. However, the remote PECVD method gave a DLTS peak corresponding to electron emission with a low activation energy ≈0.13 eV. As with the direct PECVD samples, the thermal activation energy decreased as the bias was made more positive, but in this case the change in emission energy was only a fraction of the shift in the Fermi level position.

Since the combustion process in a diesel engine is a diffusion flame, the local fuel concentration as a function of time is one of the factors that governs engine efficiency and emissions. The method is utilizing the classic Schlieren technique. A CCD camera and frame-grabber combination is used to record the data. Based on these data and the assumption that the flow-field is axisymmetrical, the local index of light refraction is calculated, and from this an estimate of the local gas-phase fuel concentration is made. Since the flow-field is turbulent, data from a large number of separate injections are used. Therefore the results should represent the development of the average flow-field. Since it is a full-field method, the results can be checked for overall conservation of mass. Included is the theory of the method, a description of the experimental equipment and the results of the experiments. The method has been tested using methane and propane fuels at room temperatures and the results show that the total mass of fuel found in the flow-field is in good agreement with the mass-flow through the nozzle. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"CCD cameras; Diesel engines; Flow fields; Gases; Rocket nozzles; Combustion pro-cess; Conservation of mass; Evaporating sprays; Experimental equipments; Fuel concentration; Full-field measurement; Gas concentration; Schlieren techniques; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072418286

One possibility for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is to remove it from the flue gases of coal-fired power stations and dispose of it in underground geological reservoirs, possibly offshore in the North Sea. The feasibility of this option has been studied in detail by a consortium of European partners. As part of this study, natural occurrences of carbon dioxide were identified and preliminary information from these was obtained. The best characterised are found in the United States where the carbon dioxide reserves are exploited for use in tertiary enhanced oil recovery (EOR) programs in the Texas oilfields. The carbon dioxide reserves occur in geological structures and lithologies which are similar to those present in the North Sea. As such, these fields offer an ideal natural analogue for the disposal of carbon dioxide, since the interactions with groundwaters and reservoir lithologies have occurred on both spatial and temporal scales relevant to geological processes. Those carbon dioxide fields currently being exploited have already been studied to a limited extent by the oil companies involved. However, further study is required to provide information on the potential effects that disposing of large quantities of carbon dioxide might have on groundwaters and reservoir quality.

To test this, full-scale measurements were carried out for 1 week on a 250 MWe pulverized coal fired unit using 10-20% straw (thermal basis). With an increased fraction of straw in the fuel, a net decrease in NOx and SO2 emissions was measured. The SO2 emission decreased partly due to the lower sulfur content of the fuel per MJ, but also due to higher sulfur retention in the ash. The NO emission decreased solely due to lower conversion of fuel-N. An increased fraction of straw in the fuel blend resulted in a higher potassium content, but no significant increase in slagging or fouling was observed. Only small amounts of deposit at the lower part of the radiant superheater and little slagging at the furnace walls were observed as a result of co-firing straw and coal. No significant effects on the performance of the desulfurization plant were detected, which may be due to the short test period, probably not allowing the desulfurization process to reach steady-state operation.

We find that the iron atoms ‘float’ above the graphite surface where the slight charge puckering below the iron atom indicates a very weak interaction with the carbon surface. We tested this effect both at relatively low (5·5% at the surface) iron concentrations and at high surface iron concentrations, and there is relatively little change in this behaviour with concentration. The stable position of the low-concentration iron impurities is a little less than half a graphite interlayer distance above the surface, with the stable location being above an empty carbon-ring centre. The charge distribution within the carbon atomic plane shows the normal s and p types of bonding between carbon atoms, quite similar to the pure carbon monolayer system, indicating that the presence of iron does not change the carbon-carbon interaction significantly. The charge distribution does, however, show some structure between the iron and carbon atoms, suggesting weak bonding between the iron and carbon atoms. Our results also indicate that the iron atoms do not contribute a large portion of their charges to the interstitial region, other than the ‘bridging’ region between the iron atoms and the six neighbouring carbon atoms. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001653206

Drought characteristics are strongly related to general circulation patterns (CP). CPs are determined from daily atmospheric pressure data. The link between large-scale CPs and regional scale droughts is modeled using a fuzzy rule-based approach. A fuzzy rule- based model operates on an 'if' → 'then' principle, where 'if' corresponds to a vector of fuzzy inputs and 'then' corresponds to some fuzzy consequences. The rules are derived from a so-called training set which includes a daily time series of CP classes and a corresponding monthly sequence of Palmer Drought Severity Indices (PDSI). Split sampling of historical data available for a 35-year time period is used to derive and then to validate the rules. Then, these fuzzy rules may be applied to predict droughts in terms of atmospheric circulation patterns. The occurrence and persistence of CPs are expected to vary under global climate change. Thus the approach may also be useful in estimating the potential impact of climatic change (e.g., 2 x CO 2 scenario) on droughts. The methodology is illustrated using drought index data from New Mexico and atmospheric pressure data over the western United States.",,"atmospheric pressure; drought assessment; general circulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029662865

Two-thirds of complaints received by the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department in 1988 were related to poor air quality. In July 1990 legislation was implemented to reduce fuel sulphur levels. The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the intervention on respiratory health in primary school children. Methods. In all, 3521 children, mean age 9.51 years (SD = 0.78), from two districts with good and poor air quality respectively before intervention were followed yearly from 1989 to 1991. Children and parents reported the children's respiratory symptoms using self-completed questionnaires. Factor analysis was used to derive independent scores from 12 symptoms. Four groups of related symptoms were identified and binary variables (presence of any symptom in each group) were treated as dependent variables in modelling using generalized estimating equations procedures. Results. In 1989 and 1990 an excess of respiratory symptoms was observed in the polluted compared with unpolluted district. The significant effects (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI], P value) associated with living in the polluted district were: cough and sore throat (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.04-1.43, P < 0.01) and wheezing (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.10-1.66, P < 0.01). After the intervention, in the polluted district only, sulphur dioxide levels fell by up to 80% and sulphate concentrations in respirable particulates by 38%. Between 1989 and 1990-1991 there was a greater decline in the polluted compared with the unpolluted district for reported symptoms of cough or sore throat, phlegm, and wheezing. The risks to respiratory health for children exposed to tobacco smoke in the home were higher than those for air pollution in both 1989 and 1990 and remained unchanged in 1991. Conclusions. Air quality can be improved by fuel controls but an effective intersectoral approach is required if other risks from environmental tobacco smoke are to be avoided.","Air pollution; Environmental tobacco smoke; Hong Kong; Respiratory symptoms","sulfur; tobacco smoke; air quality; ambient air; article; child health; coughing; factorial analysis; female; home; Hong Kong; human; indoor air pollution; law; male; normal human; primary school; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory system; risk; school child; self report; sore throat; wheezing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029782560

The goal of this study was to assess the role of the thyroid hormone system in regulating the expression of carbonic anhydrase-II at various stages of neural retina development. Methods. Standard immunochemical, biochemical and molecular biological methods were used to measure the levels of thyroid hormone receptor α(C-erbA), thyronine metabolizing enzyme Type II 5′-deiodinase and how these correlate with changes in expression of carbonic anhydrase-II as functions of chick retina development. Cultured embryonic retina cells were also used to measure the effects of the depletion and/or addition of thyroid hormone on carbonic anhydrase mRNA concentration (Northern analysis). Results. As previously reported by others (Sjoberg et al, Development 114:39-47, 1992), C-erbA is present continuously in retina from early in development into maturity. Immunohistochemistry showed the protein to be present in many retinal cells including Müller glial cells. The activity of Type II 5′-deiodinase (the enzyme necessary for local activation of T4 into T3) showed a developmental pattern of increase-decrease-increase that mimics the pattern for carbonic anhydrase-II expression. Culture of embryonic retina cells in the absence of T3 reduces carbonic anhydrase [mRNA] while addition of exogenous T3 induces higher levels of expression. Conclusions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Thyroid hormone plays a role in the regulation of carbonic anhydrase expression in the embryonic neural retina.

Surface characterization (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy) revealed that the surface chemistry and surface morphology of pyrolytic carbon was altered in the presence of some of the chemical treatments. Results also suggested that the cells can potentially alter the surface chemistry and surface morphology of pyrolytic carbon. Additional studies were conducted to assess the influence of pyrolytic carbon on the functionality of human monocytes. Extracellular release of superoxide by human monocytes in the presence of pyrolytic carbon was 58% less than the control (cells in the absence of pyrolytic carbon). In the presence of a phagocytic challenge, cells incubated with pyrolytic carbon showed a 27 % reduction in extra-cellular superoxide when compared to the controls. A concomitant increase in surface oxidized carbon bond levels on the pyrolytic carbon exposed to cells suggests that the material may act as a ""sink"" for cell generated oxidative species and hence as a dissipater of the oxidative host defense mechanism.","Cell-biomaterial interactions; Chemiluminescence; Human monocyte-derived macrophages; In vitro assay; Oxidation; Pyrolytic carbon; Superoxide","pyrolytic carbon; article; cell interaction; chemoluminescence; drug degradation; human; human cell; macrophage function; oxidation; priority journal; safety",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030318513

Although the regulation of this enzyme has been studied in algal cultures and higher plants, little is known regarding RubisCO regulation in natural phytoplankton populations. To determine if natural communities of phytoplankton utilize transcriptional regulation to control RubisCO expression, we investigated the diel relationship between 14C carbon fixation and RubisCO large subunit (rbcL) transcript levels, rbcL DNA, chlorophyll a, autofluorescent cell counts and bacterial direct counts for natural communities of the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Studies were performed with natural phytoplankton populations in Lagrangian studies or deck-top incubators as well as with a Prochlorococcus isolate in culture from the North Pacific Ocean. rbcL mRNA and DNA were detected by stringent hybridization using an antisense rbcL RNA gene probe originating from Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301. For natural communities, carbon fixation maxima (~0.1 to 0.7 μg Cl-1 h-1) occurred from early morning to mid afternoon, with minimal values at night. Peak levels of rbcL mRNA (3.6 to 22.2 ng 1-1) almost always coincided with the time of maximum carbon fixation and were positively correlated. When natural phytoplankton populations or the Prochlorococcus culture were maintained in continuous illumination for 24 h, the same diel pattern of RubisCO regulation was observed, implying that diel entrained rhythms in rbcL transcription occurred. The results thus indicate that natural phytoplankton communities appear to regulate carbon fixation at least in part by transcriptional control of RubisCO synthesis and that such patterns appear to be rhythmic in nature.","mRNA; Natural phytoplankton; Prochlorococcus; RubisCO; Synechococcus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029803394

Some 75 events over a 2 yr period between 1991 December 6 and 1993 December 31 have been analyzed. The greater sensitivity of the BCS compared with previous instruments has enabled such emission to be detected from a wider group of flares than has previously been possible. The likelihood of detecting Fe XXVI lines in a flare is found to increase sharply with the electron temperature obtained from the Fe xxv line spectrum, also observed by the BCS, and with GOES X-ray class. The width of the Lyα1 line, measured after the impulsive stage, is greater than that determined by thermal Doppler broadening, but this is explained by the nonzero spatial extent of flares. Electron temperatures from the intensity ratio of a nearby feature due to Fe xxv dielectronic satellites and the Fe XXVI Lyα1 line are obtained from new atomic parameters from the superstructure code, details of which are described. This revises earlier calculations that have been extensively used. Comparison of these temperatures with those from the Fe xxv spectra provides evidence for a single loose grouping of flares, with the difference between the two temperatures ranging from nearly zero to about 20 MK. A ""superhot"" component would seem to be more or less developed according to whether the temperature difference is large or nearly zero. Flares at both extremes are examined in detail. The gradually varying part of the 14-33 keV X-ray emission for these events, as observed by the Hard X-ray Telescope on Yohkoh, has a hardness ratio corresponding to temperatures and emission measures similar to those from Fe XXVI line ratios, pointing to a common origin for their emission. Many of the flares studied occurred in particular active regions with great magnetic complexity, although Fe xxvi flares do not seem to be a distinct class within large X-ray flares. © 1996.

Here we report the purification and characterization of four soluble proteins required for the in vitro reconstitution of T4MO catalytic activity. These proteins are a diiron hydroxylase (T4MOH), a Rieske-type ferredoxin (T4MOC), an effector protein (T4MOD), and an NADH oxidoreductase (T4MOF). The T4MOH component is composed of the tmoA, tmoB, and tmoE gene products [quaternary structure (αβε)2, M(r) ≃ 220 kDa]. The T4MOA polypeptide contains two copies of the amino acid sequence motif (D/E)X((28-37))DEXRH; the same motif provides all of the protein-derived ligands to the diiron centers of ribonucleotide reductase, the soluble methane monooxygenase, and the stearoyl-ACP Δ9 desaturase. Mossbauer, optical, and EPR measurements show that the T4MOH contains diiron centers and suggest that the diiron center contains hydroxo bridge(s) in the diferric state, as observed for methane monooxygenase. Mossbauer and EPR measurements also show that the T4MOC contains a Rieske-type iron-sulfur center. This assignment is in accord with the presence of the amino acid sequence motif CPHX((15-17))CX2H, which has also been found in the bacterial, chloroplastic, and mitochondrial Rieske proteins as well as the bacterial NADH-dependent cis-dihydrodiol-forming aromatic dioxygenases. While single-turnover catalytic studies confirm the function of the T4MOH as the hydroxylase, the NADH-dependent multiple-turnover hydroxylation activity is increased by more than 100-fold in the presence of the T4MOC, which mediates highly specific electron transfer between the T4MOF and the T4MOH. The T4MOD can be purified as an 11.6 kDa monomeric protein devoid of cofactors or redox-active metal ions; this component is also detected as a substoichiometric constituent of the purified T4MOH. The rate of the hydroxylation reaction can be mildly stimulated by the further addition of separately purified T4MOD to the T4MOH, implying the formation of a high affinity, catalytically competent complex between these two components. These characterizations define a novel, four-component oxygenase combining elements from the soluble methane oxidation complex of the methanotrophic bacteria and the aromatic hydroxylation complexes of the soil pseudomonads.",,"unspecific monooxygenase; article; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme purification; methanogenesis; methanotrophic bacterium; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Cloning, Molecular; Cresols; DNA Primers; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Escherichia coli; Ferredoxins; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Structure; Oxygenases; Protein Conformation; Pseudomonas; Recombinant Proteins; Spectroscopy, Mossbauer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029942829

Negative-ion formation that occurred via the A 2Σ+(v=3) state was suppressed in the presence of CO2 due to collisional quenching of that state by CO2, and the reduction in the A 2Σ+(v=3) state lifetime with increasing CO2 pressure was also observed. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,"Carbon dioxide; Differential equations; Electric currents; Electrodes; Electron energy levels; Electrons; Excimer lasers; Light absorption; Nitrogen oxides; Photoionization; Sulfur compounds; Waveform analysis; Dissociative recombination; Electron attachment; Electron drift; Laser excited molecules; Signal waveforms; Sulfur hexafluoride; Two photon absorption; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030166522

Flanking HTS1, which encodes the central enzyme in HC-toxin biosynthesis, a gene was identified and named TOXA. Like HTS1, TOXA occurred only in isolates of the fungus that make HC-toxin and was present as two linked copies in most toxin-producing isolates. HTS1 and TOXA were transcribed in the opposite orientation and their transcriptional start sites were 386 bp apart. The predicted product of TOXA was a 58 kDa hydrophobic protein with 10-13 membrane-spanning regions. The sequence was highly similar to several members of the major facilitator superfamily that confer resistance to tetracycline, methylenomycin, and other antibiotics. Although it was possible to mutate one copy or the other of TOXA by targeted gene disruption, numerous attempts to disrupt both copies in a single strain were unsuccessful, suggesting that TOXA is an essential gene in strains that synthesize HC-toxin. On the basis of its presence only in HC-toxin-producing strains, its proximity to HTS1 and its predicted amino acid sequence, we propose that TOXA encodes an HC-toxin efflux pump which contributes to self-protection against HC-toxin and/or the secretion of HC-toxin into the extracellular milieu.","Cachliobolus (Helminthosporium) carbonum; Cyclic peptide efflux pump; HC-toxin; Major facilitator superfamily; TOXA","cyclopeptide; mycotoxin; article; fungal genetics; fungus; gene disruption; gene mutation; nonhuman; priority journal; transcription initiation; Cochliobolus carbonum; Fungi; Helminthosporium; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029931717

Box 230, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles, Seychelles National Oil Company, Adelaide University, SA, Australia","Tarballs have been found stranded as traction deposits on a beach on northwest Mahe Island, Seychelles, with every ebbing tide. Weekly collections from mid-1993 to mid-1994 gathered nearly 4750 samples of two types of tar: a dominant black malleable tar and a less common brownish-black hard tar. Both tars represent moderately degraded extracts of crude oils seemingly derived from mature source rocks dominated by a combination of oil-prone phytoplanktonic and algal organic matter over gas-prone land-plant organic matter. Source rock deposition occurred principally in paralic to open-marine environments. The presence of minor oleanane and bicadinane, and a general preponderance of diasteranes and tricyclic terpanes in the hard tar suggest derivation from a Late Cretaceous clastic source rock with possible carbonate interbeds. By contrast, no samples of the malleable tar contain oleanane or bicadinane, but all contain significant norhopane and tetracyclic terpanes, which, along with significant sulfur and low diasterane contents, indicate derivation from a carbonate source rock of perhaps pre-Late Cretaceous age. Both these tars differ markedly from a tar that is stranded only on Coetivy Island that contains minor amounts of steranes, oleanane, bicadinane, and botryococcane, but has high pristane and tricyclic terpane contents, suggesting derivation from a Late Cretaceous clastic deltaic source rock. All three tar types can be related to depositional environments that developed during the multiphase rift-drift origin of the Seychelles microcontinent from east Africa, Madagascar, and India. Additionally, maturity and limited geochemical data from proven and potential source rocks present in the offshore wells enable the malleable and hard tars to be equated with specific units in the Seychelles stratigraphy; the malleable tar is seemingly derived from a Middle Jurassic carbonate of Tethyan affinity and the hard tar possibly originated from either Campanian or Maastrichtian-Paleocene shales. These tars are thus concluded to be natural seepage products derived from source rocks indigenous to Seychelles, and their persistent beach stranding significantly reduces the risk of hydrocarbon exploration in this frontier province.",,"Beaches; Crude petroleum; Geochemistry; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum geology; Petroleum prospecting; Rocks; Stratigraphy; Beach stranded tars; Bicadinane; Botryococcane; Mature source rocks; Oleanane; Rock deposition; Steranes; Tarballs; Petroleum tar; beach stranded deposit; Cretaceous; source rock; tarball; traction deposit; Seychelles, Mahe Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666799

The numerical prediction of NOx levels in such combustors with multidimensional CFD codes has only met with limited success so far. This is to some extent due to the complexity of the NOx formation chemistry in lean-premixed combustion, i.e., all three known NOx formation routes (Zeldovich, nitrous, and prompt) can contribute significantly. Furthermore, NOx formation occurs almost exclusively in the flame zone, where radical concentrations significantly above equilibrium values are observed. A relatively large chemical mechanism is therefore required to predict radical concentrations and NOx formation rates under such conditions. These difficulties have prompted the development of a NOx postprocessing scheme, where rate and concentration information necessary to predict NOx formation is taken from one-dimensional combustion models with detailed chemistry and provided—via look-up tables—to the multidimensional CFD code. The look-up tables are prepared beforehand in accordance with the operating conditions and are based on CO concentrations, which are indicative of free radical chemistry. Once the reacting flow field has been computed with the main CFD code, the chemical source terms of the NO transport equation, i.e., local NO formation rates, are determined from the reacting flow field and the tabulated chemical data. Then the main code is turned on again to compute the NO concentration field. This NOx submodel has no adjustable parameters and converges very quickly. Good agreement with experiment has been observed and interesting conclusions concerning superequilibrium O-atom concentrations and fluctuations of temperature could be drawn. © 1996 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003228613

The deduced proteins, termed rtARNT(a) and rtARNT(b), are identical over the first 533 amino acids and contain a basic helix-loop-helix domain that is 100% identical to human ARNT. rtARNT(a) and rtARNT(b) differ in their COOH-terminal domains due to the presence of an additional 373 base pairs of sequence that have the characteristics of an alternatively spliced exon. The presence of the 373-base pair region causes a shift in the reading frame. rtARNT(a) lacks the sequence and has a COOH-terminal domain of 104 residues rich in proline, serine, and threonine. rtARNT(b) contains the sequence and has a COOH-terminal domain of 190 residues rich in glutamine and asparagine. mRNAs for both rtARNT splice variants were detected in RTG-2 gonad cells, trout liver, and gonad tissue. rtARNT(a) and rtARN(b) protein were identified in cell lysates from RTG-2 cells. Transfection of rtARNT expression vectors into murine Hepa-1 cells that are defective in ARNT function (type II) result in rtARNT protein expression localized to the nucleus.

The decreased function of rtARNT(a) appears to be due to inefficient binding of rtARNT(a)·AHR complexes to DNA.

While prior studies focused on flow field interrogation and the nature of waste destruction under conditions of natural acoustic excitation, the present study focuses on the device's behavior under externally forced acoustical conditions. External forcing was accomplished here using a loudspeaker situated in the plenum section of the device, allowing strong excitation of acoustic resonances. The effect of this external forcing on waste destruction in the device was found to be significant. Results show that, for specific forcing frequencies (coincident with the system natural modes), marked improvement in destruction and removal efficiencies (DREs) of the waste surrogate SF6, by four orders of magnitude and perhaps higher, could be achieved. When the device was forced at frequencies other than natural modes, little improvement over the nonforced combustor performance was achieved. External forcing at very high frequency natural modes yielded some improvement in waste destruction, but to a lesser extent than at lower frequency natural modes. OH6 chemiluminescence images indicated that the enhancement of waste destruction at certain natural modes coincided with flame shortening and broadening likely arising due to vortex shedding during the acoustical excitation. This alteration in flame structure during excitation of specific natural modes appeared to materially enhance energy transport to the regions in which waste was injected, as evidenced by reduced flame liftoff under such conditions. These observations suggest that acoustically resonant combustor conditions can render this device extremely efficient as well as highly controllable. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Acoustic wave propagation; Chemiluminescence; Energy transfer; Flame research; Frequencies; Loudspeakers; Performance; Resonance; Sulfur compounds; Vortex shedding; Waste incineration; Acoustic excitation; Destruction and removal efficiencies; External forcing; Sulfur hexafluoride; Waste destruction; Combustors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030375878

Experimental results were compared with predictions from mathematical simulations based on measured optical tissue parameters. Results: After 10 minutes of irradiation with 2-4.6 W CW laser power, sizable coagulation diameters had been achieved. In prostate and kidney tissue, temperature rises and coagulation diameters after laser irradiation were found to be smaller than in liver tissue. Those tissues also had a higher threshold for carbonization, thus reducing the risk of damage to the delivery system.

For northern cities to function more satisfactorily, the negative impacts of winter must be reduced while its beneficial characteristics are enhanced. While not all summer activities can or should be abandoned during winter, proper micro-climatic control is essential if human life is to be retained outside. The outdoor season should be extended since so much indoor isolation occurs. The main principles to be incorporated in exemplary 'winter city' design should be contact with nature, year-round usability, user participation, cultural continuity, and the creation of comfortable micro-climatic conditions throughout much of the city's open spaces. All valuable sources of inspiration must be harnessed in the attempt to mediate between organic regionalism and internationalism, on the one hand, and romanticism and pragmatic realism, on the other. Creating optimum conditions for human well-being, habitation, work and intellectual development in each of the four seasons is vital under harsh environments. Adopting a climate-sensitive approach to planning policy and urban design can render everyday life less stressful, especially during the lengthy winter periods found in many northern latitude and high altitude settings.","City planning; Climate; Human confort; North; Urban form","city; conference paper; daily life activity; environmental planning; environmental temperature; microclimate; policy; priority journal; urban area; wellbeing; winter; climatic control; design approach; human comfort; urban design; winter city",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667920

The effect of a modern diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) also was determined in an effort to minimize emissions. Neat SME produced a higher volatile fraction of the DPM, but much less carbon soot fraction, leading to overall DPM reductions of 23 to 30% for the light- and heavy-duty transients. The DOC further reduced the volatile fraction and the total DPM. The SME fuel reduced gaseous emissions of CO by 23% and hydrocarbons by over 30% without increasing NOX. The DOC further reduced CO and hydrocarbon levels. Mutagenicity of the SME exhaust was low.

Steady and predictable operations can be a 'hidden' air pollution control device and are essential to multiple hearth incinerators emissions control. This paper presents an investigation on the optimization of operations to comply with emission regulations. The purpose of the investigation was to determine an optimum operating mode for compliance with both NOx, emissions and THC emissions. The control of NOx, often leads to conflicting operating parameters with the control of other regulated pollutants such as THC. NOx, is traditionally controlled by reducing temperatures and oxygen concentrations, while THC is controlled by increasing temperatures and oxygen concentrations. Cincinnati's Mill Creek WWTP incineration operating permit requires the afterburner to be energized, which raises temperatures and increases NOx, emissions. A multiple hearth incinerator is unique in that there are many burner and air injection locations used to control temperatures and introduce air. Deciding how and where to control these is confusing to operators and often leads to unstable operations. Also, variations in the total and volatile content of the feed sludge changes the auxiliary fuel requirements and may change the combustion location in the furnace. Unstable operations are becoming more of a problem as oxygen concentrations are reduced for NOx, control. The operating strategy presented has allowed the Metropolitan Sewer District to comply with their stringent NOx, and THC emission regulations, and can be applied to other facilities.",,"Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Particulate emissions; Temperature; Waste incineration; Incinerator emissions control; Pollutant; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19244387342

Thus, co-firing a MWC with coal, because of the S species from coal, may reduce PCDD and PCDF emissions. Experiments were carried out to test this hypothesis and to determine the role of S. A field-sampled MWC fly ash was injected into the EPA's pilot- scale reactor, doped with hydrogen chloride (HCl). The tests involved either natural gas or coal combustion. Besides the combustion environment, MWC fly ash injection temperature and sulfur-to-chlorine ratio (S/Cl) were varied. Flue gas was sampled and analyzed for PCDD and PCDF to determine in-flight formation. In the natural-gas-fired reactor, when S was added (as sulfur dioxide, SO2), the PCDD and PCDF formation decreased dramatically at S/Cl ratios as low as 0.64, and with varying furnace conditions, the inhibitory effect was consistent for S/Cl ratios of about 1. In tests with the coal- fired furnace, the S inhibitory effect was again observed at S/Cl values of 0.8 and 1.2, respectively, for the two coals tested. S inhibition mechanisms were studied in a bench-scale reactor. Results show that the depletion of molecular chlorine (Cl2), an active chlorinating agent, by SO2 through a gas-phase reaction appears to be a significant inhibition mechanism in addition to previously reported SO2 deactivation of copper catalysts.",,"chlorine; coal; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air sampling; article; atmospheric dispersion; combustion; flue gas; fly ash; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029951333

The charge distributions of n-octane, benzene, and water adsorbed inside the supercage of zeolite Y and siliceous zeolite Y show that the lattice provides little perturbation to these molecules. In contrast, a local dipole in the zeolite Y lattice is found to induce a change in the partial charge distribution of a cracking hydride transfer transition state model (C4H9+ plus n-octane). The polarization in this transition state model is attributed to the increased size of the transition-state model in comparision to the size of n-octane.

One method for defining economic reasonableness is to use cost per ton of reduced emmisions (CPTRE). This paper defines four additional abatement strategies.

The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project developed a suite of codes to estimate the doses that might have resulted from these releases. The Regional Atmospheric Transport Code for Hanford Emission Tracking (RATCHET) computer code is part of this suite. The RATCHET cede implements a Lagrangian-trajectory, Gaussian-puff dispersion model that uses hourly meteorological and release rate data to estimate daily time-integrated air concentrations and surface contamination for use in dose estimates. In this model, iodine is treated as a mixture of three species (inorganic gases, organic gases, and particles). Model deposition parameters are functions of the mixture and meteorological conditions. A resistance model is used to calculate dry deposition velocities. Equilibrium between concentrations in the precipitation and the air near the ground is assumed in calculating wet deposition of gases, and irreversible washout of the particles is assumed. RATCHET explicitly treats the uncertainties in model parameters and meteorological conditions. Uncertainties in 131I release rates and partitioning among the nominal species are treated by varying model input. The results of 100 model runs for December 1944 through December 1949 indicate that monthly average air concentrations and deposition have uncertainties ranging from a factor of two near the center of the time- integrated plume to more than an order of magnitude near the edge. These results indicate that ~10% of the 131I released to the atmosphere decayed during transit in the study area, ~56% was deposited within the study area, and the remaining 34% was transported out of the study area while still in the air.","131I; dose assessment; emissions, atmospheric; radioactivity, airborne","iodine 131; radioactive microsphere; article; atmospheric dispersion; atmospheric transport; computer model; dosimetry; nuclear fuel reprocessing; pollution transport; priority journal; radiation monitoring; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029785469

By applying the transient method to this reaction, it has been shown that for reduced catalysts without adsorbed CO, the N2O reduction step is well described qualitatively by two of the models, whereas only one of them can describe the NO reduction step. In the presence of adsorbed CO, however, none of these models can explain the observed transient behaviour. Therefore, a modification of the best model was proposed and tested via computer simulation, which showed good agreement with transient experiments.","Iron oxide; Model discrimination; NO reduction; Transient","Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Characterization; Computer simulation; Iron oxides; Mathematical models; Modification; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Catalyst preparation; Model discrimination; Steady state catalytic reduction; Unsteady state operation; Catalysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030260725

As a part of this analysis, we compare heterotrophic respiration models based solely on temperature and soil moisture controls (zero-order models) with models that depend on available substrate as well (first-order models). As indicators of regional and global CO2 exchange, we use maps of monthly global net ecosystem production, growing season net flux (GSNF), and simulated atmospheric CO2 concentrations from an atmospheric tracer transport model. In one first-order model, CASA, variations on the representation of the seasonal flow of organic matter from plants to heterotrophs can increase global GSNF as much as 60% (5.7 Pg C yr-1) above estimates obtained from a zero-order model. Under a new first-order scheme that includes separate seasonal dynamics for leaf litterfall, fine root mortality, coarse woody debris, and herbivory, we observe an increase in GSNF of 8% (0.7 Pg C yr-1) over that predicted by the zero-order model. The increase in seasonality of CO2 exchange in first-order models reflects the dynamics of labile litter fractions; specifically, the rapid decomposition of a pulse of labile leaf and fine root litter that enters the heterotrophic community primarily from the middle to the end of the growing season shifts respiration outside the growing season. From the perspective of a first-order model, we then explore the consequences of land use change and winter temperature anomalies on the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2. Agricultural practices that accelerate decomposition may drive a long-term increase in the amplitude, independent of human impacts on plant production. Consideration of first-order litter decomposition dynamics may also help explain year-to-year variation in the amplitude. © Copyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"agricultural practice; atmospheric modeling; biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; coarse woody debris; decomposition; fine root; flux measurement; herbivory; heterotrophy; land use; litterfall; mortality; net ecosystem production; organic matter; phytochemistry; respiration; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; soil moisture; substrate; temperature anomaly; tracer; atmospheric carbon dioxide; heterotrophic respiration; land use change; seasonal cycle; substrate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030373246

In this paper, we demonstrate that the observed ozone time series is comprised of deterministic and stochastic components; the deterministic part contains seasonal variation and long-term trend, superimposed upon which is the white noise process. The stochastic variations cannot be controlled. However, after separation of the white noise process, the deterministic part forms a stable basis for the examination of responses in ozone concentrations to changes in precursor emissions. Based on this examination, we argue that a reduction in the deterministic part is needed to achieve ozone compliance. The information developed in this study can then be used in conjunction with the results from photochemical models in determining the level and type of emission reductions required for ozone attainment. Currently, photochemical models are being used to simulate episodic ozone events, rather than baseline, for determining the level of emission reductions needed to achieve compliance with the ozone standard. Given the uncertainties inherent in the modeling, total reliance on absolute model predictions may be stretching the applicability of such models beyond their limits. Models are more useful when they are used as tools for directional and relative analyses than in an absolute sense.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002198002

Significant spatial variability was shown for non sea-salt sulphate, calcium and hydrogen ion concentrations. Although nitrate concentrations did not show significant variability, a coherent gradient across the study area was observed. The large variability of calcium ion concentration across the area was related to limestone quarrying, which is prevalent in the south of the study area. Calcareous wind-blown soil may have also made a minor contribution to the abundance of calcium in the rain-water samples. It is likely, however, that a large fraction of the calcium was dry deposited to the funnels of the collectors in the form of particles. The network was not designed to study orographic enhancement of deposition, but it is suggested that this mechanism, along with wind-drift of scavenged cap-cloud droplets, cannot explain the spatial variation in ion concentrations. It is speculated that the variability in non-sea-salt sulphate concentrations may also be partially explained by reaction of CaCO3 particles deposited to the funnels of the collectors with SO2. Critical load exceedances in terms of deposited acidity from non-sea-salt sulphate were calculated using different spatially resolved deposition data. A better estimate of deposition in the study area was achieved by combining rainfall concentration data from the national network with the 5 km rainfall field, than the current methodology used for mapping of U.K. deposition which utilises a 20 km rainfall field. However, 20 km is considered to be the minimum resolution at which a procedure for parameterising orographic enhancement can be incorporated. Deposition and critical load exceedances in 2005 were calculated using a long-range transport model and significant improvements in the protection of soils were predicted from the projected emissions reductions.","Critical loads; Small-scale variability; Wet deposition","calcium ion; limestone; nitrate; proton; rain; sulfate; air pollution; article; geographic distribution; pH; priority journal; rural area; United Kingdom; precipitation chemistry; precipitation collection network; rainfall concentration data; subgrid rainfall field; wet deposition; UK, England",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029668165

The evolution of a CO2 rich medium only produces very low yields of formaldehyde and related oxygenated compounds. Considering a CO rich atmosphere, the photochemical yield of O-organics formation is much higher, when the synthesis of N-organics remains difficult. The most favourable atmosphere as far as photochemical organic synthesis is concerned is a CH4 rich milieu.. The photochemical evolution of such a CH4 atmosphere under UV irradiation leads to a chain of various organics, the complexity of which increases together with the number of pathways involved in their formation. Their complexity also closely correlates with their UV photoabsorption spectrum : the more complex they are, the more shifted is their UV spectrum toward the visible range. Direct photodissociation of methane requires UV photon of wavelengths shorter than about 145 nm. It mainly produces ethane which absorbs UV at wavelengths shorter than about 160 nm, and acetylene, that presents an absorption spectrum extending up to 200 nm. This shift still continuously increases with further increase in number of C atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbons with 4 and more C atoms have UV absorption characteristics including noticeable band structures in the 250-300 nm range. This trend has very important implication in the photochemical behaviour of a CH4-rich planetary atmosphere, as it induces many catalytic processes. The occurrence of such processes is closely related to vertical atmospheric and energy deposition profiles. Titan provides a very good example of such a UV-directed organic atmospheric chemistry.

Samples were taken from narrow-leaved ironbark, Eucalyptus crebra, and grey box, Eucalyptus moluccana, in the east and from jarrah, Eucalyptus marginata, and marri, Eucalyptus calophylla, in the west. Arthropods were more abundant on trees in eastern Australia and exhibited different seasonal patterns from those in the west. Members of different functional groups exhibited different seasonal patterns, with some herbivorous groups responding to times of leaf production, decomposers and fungus feeders responding to high moisture availability, and predators/parasites responding to the abundance of food items. Seasonal variability was slightly higher in the west, possibly reflecting the greater seasonal amplitude in rainfall. In the eastern forest, proportionately more taxa peaked in spring or summer and declined to minimum numbers in winter. In the western forest several taxa attained peak numbers in autumn, winter or spring, while others declined to minimum values in winter or summer. The phenological patterns of canopy arthropods appear to be linked to the condition of the host plant and/or to climatic factors. Comparison of the western Australian data to those from a second year of sampling at a time when rainfall was greater and fell later into the season indicated that variability in arthropod numbers between years can be as great as that between seasons.

Characteristic properties of the matrix, analytes and extraction fluids are examined in order to explain trends and controlling factors in extraction yields. As expected, the higher solvent strength of the methanol-CO2 mixtures greatly reduces the volume and time required for efficient extraction compared to CO2 alone. The effect of temperature is markedly less important than composition for the mixtures and matrix studied and the state of the extraction fluid, either liquid or supercritical, is irrelevant for the majority of analytes. The enhanced-fluidity liquid technique appears to be a viable alternative to supercritical fluid extraction for the extraction of polar analytes from more complex matrices.","aromatic compounds, nitro; enhanced-fluidity liquids; environmental analysis; extraction methods; nitroaromatic compounds; phenols","2 chlorophenol; 2,4 dinitrophenol; 2,4 xylenol; 2,4,6 trichlorophenol; dinitro ortho cresol; meta cresol; nitrobenzene; ortho cresol; pentachlorophenol; phenol; phenol derivative; unclassified drug; article; pollution; priority journal; supercritical fluid extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029897125

It depends mainly on the nature of the pores, pore size distribution and crack formation in concrete. Consequently, the classical concrete mix design approach based on compressive strength criteria do not necessarily produce durable concrete. Proper concrete mix design accompanied by good material selection, adequate supervision during concreting and curing is known to be very important in an effort to produce durable concrete. It has been generally accepted that the durability properties of concrete can be basically studied using permeability, diffusivity and sorptivity measurements, since these parameters depend on the actual pore structure of the concrete. In the recent years, however, assessment of concrete performance using gas permeability measurements of concrete are given more importance due to the fact that gas permeability measurements take short time, produce repeatable test results provided appropriate test method is chosen and can be made either in situ or in the laboratory without significant destruction. Meanwhile, the tendencies of current research results are aimed at relating gas permeability coefficients to performance properties of concrete, such as depth of carbonation and sorptivity, in order to make a prognosis of durability. Numerous gas permeability test methods are available in practice and are discussed elsewhere [1], [2], [3]. The design and test procedure of these test methods vary widely: some of the methods are designed mainly to be used in the laboratory condition, e.g. [4], [5], while others can be used on sites as well [6], [7]. In most of the cases, they require specimen conditioning before testing (and are mainly destructive) and therefore test results do not represent the actual material property. In this report gas permeability of concrete specimens as measured by the overpressure method [3], [8] will be presented and its relation to other concrete properties will be discussed.",,"Durability; Gases; High pressure effects; Mechanical permeability; Mechanical variables measurement; Nitrogen; Overpressure test method; Permeability measurement; Concretes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030282416

This model, rated 38 MWe-ISO and burning natural gas or fuel oil, has become the core of a new cogeneration unit exhibiting outstanding performance: efficiency higher than 80 percent (LHV) providing a 20 percent energy saving in comparison to a conventional plant low pollutant emissions (NOx, CO, HC) and low contribution to the greenhouse effect (CO2). The gas turbine has been equipped with two steam injection devices, for DeNOx and power augmentation, respectively, resulting in a very flexible system.

The mechanisms by which cooling inhibits insulin secretion were investigated by capacitance measurements of exocytosis in single mouse pancreatic B-cells maintained in short-term tissue culture. 2. A reduction of the bath temperature from 34 to 24°C produced a gradual inhibition of exocytosis. Inhibition of exocytosis was use dependent rather than time dependent. The steady-state inhibition amounted to 90%, which was paralleled by a 30% reduction of the peak Ca2+ current. 3. The Q10 values (between 27 and 37°C) for inhibition of exocytosis and the peak Ca2+ current amplitude were determined as &gt; 5 and 1.6, respectively. From the temperature dependence of exocytosis, an energy of activation was estimated as 145 kJ mol-1. 4. Suppression of exocytosis was not the result of a reduction of Ca2+ influx. When the Ca2+ currents were blocked by 30% (comparable to that produced by cooling) by using a low concentration of Co2+, exocytosis was reduced by &lt; 25%. 5. Elevation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+, by photorelease of 'caged' Ca2+ from Ca2+-nitrophenyl-EGTA preloaded into the B-cell, was equally effective at eliciting exocytosis at 24 and 34°C. 6. Cooling produced 70% inhibition of exocytosis evoked by infusion of Ca2+ through the recording electrode. Omission of either MgATP or cAMP from the electrode solution resulted in a comparable reduction of exocytosis. Cooling had no additional inhibitory effect when exocytosis was already suppressed by removal of cytoplasmic MgATP. 7. Our data indicate that exocytosis of granules already docked beneath the membrane is little affected by cooling in the B-cell. Instead, the high overall temperature sensitivity of insulin secretion arises because the replenishment of the readily releasable pool is temperature dependent.",,"adenosine triphosphate magnesium; calcium ion; cyclic AMP; insulin; animal cell; article; calcium current; calcium transport; cell granule; cooling; exocytosis; insulin release; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; temperature dependence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030004317

The majority of these efforts have been at the country level. Such studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of the costs of emissions abatement. Studies which confine emission reduction opportunities to the boundaries of a single country however have certain limitations. First, they ignore low cost abatement opportunities available elsewhere in the world. Hence, they fail to identify least cost mitigation strategies. Second, they ignore potentially important 'spill over effects' - for example, the effect of a slowdown in economic growth in one country on the prices and incomes of another. Additional insights can be gained from taking a more global perspective. Capturing the relevant interactions, however, requires a 'general equilibrium' formulation of the global economic system.

However, energy is required to operate the system fan and to heat or cool the resulting increased building ventilation. We present regional and national estimates of the energy requirements, operating expenses and CO2 emissions associated with using SSD systems at saturation (i.e. in all US homes with radon concentrations above the EPA remediation guideline and either basement or slab-on-grade construction). The primary source of uncertainty in these estimates is the impact of the SSD system on house ventilation rate. Overall, individual SSD system operating expenses are highest in the Northeast and Midwest at about $99 y-1, and lowest in the South and West at about $66 y-1. The fan consumes, on average, about 40% of the end-use energy used to operate the SSD system and accounts for about 60% of the annual expense. At saturation, regional impacts are largest in the Midwest because this area has a large number of mitigable houses and a relatively high heating load. We estimate that operating SSD systems in US houses, where it is both appropriate and possible (about 2.6 million houses), will annually consume 1.7 × 104 (6.4 × 103 to 3.9 × 104) TJ of end-use energy, cost $230 (130 to 400) million (at current energy prices), and generate 2.0 × 109 (1.2 × 109 to 3.5 × 109) kg of CO2.

This increases the atomic diffusion energy, which moves the optimum deposition conditions to higher ion energies and higher temperatures.

The cryogenic limb array etalon spectrometer (CLAES) instrument on the NASA UARS provided simultaneous global measurements of the altitude profiles of CH4 and N2O mixing ratios in the stratosphere between October 1, 1991, and May 5, 1993. Data between January 9, 1992, and May 5, 1993 (388 days), have been processed using version 7 data processing software, and this paper is concerned with the assessment of the quality of this data set. CLAES is a limb-viewing emission instrument, and approximately 1200 profiles were obtained each 24-hour period for each constituent over a nominal altitude range of 100 to 0.1 mbar (16 to 64 km). Each latitude was sampled 30 times per day between latitudes 34°S and 80°N, or 34°N and 80°S depending on the yaw direction of the UARS, and nearly all local times were sampled in about 36 days. This data set extends the altitude, latitude, and seasonal coverage of previous experiments, particularly in relation to measurements at high winter latitudes. To arrive at estimates of experiment error, we compared CLAES profiles for both gases with a wide variety of correlative data from ground-based, rocket, aircraft, balloon, and space-borne sensors, looked at the repeatability of multiple profiles in the same location, and carried out empirical estimates of experiment error based on knowledge of instrument characteristics. These analyses indicate an average single-profile CH4 systematic error of about 15% between 46 and 0.46 mbar, with CLAES biased high. The CH4 random error over this range is 0.08 to 0.05 parts per million, which translates to about 7% in the midstratosphere. For N2O the indicated systematic error is less than 15% at all altitudes between 68 and 2 mbar, with CLAES tending to be high below 6.8 mbar and low above. The N2O random error is 20 to 5 ppb between 46 and 2 mbar, which also translates to 7% in the low to midstratosphere. Both tracers have useful profile information to as low as 68 mbar, excluding the tropics, and as high as 0.2 mbar (CH4) and 1 mbar (N2O). The global fields show generally good spatial correlation and exhibit the major morphological and seasonal features seen in previous global field data. Several morphological features are pointed out for regions and conditions for which there have been essentially no previous data. These include the differential behavior of the tracer isopleths near and inside the Antarctic winter vortex, and local maxima in the tropics in 1992, probably associated with the Mount Pinatubo sulfate aerosol layer. Overall, the results of this validation exercise indicate that the version 7 CH4 and N2O data sets can be used with good confidence for quantitative and qualitative studies of stratospheric and lower-mesospheric atmospheric structure and dynamics.

It displays an approximately linear dependence upon the C/O ratio, with a threshold near C/O ∼0.6. The emission band is present in 18 of the 21 nebulae, being absent in three of the six oxygen-rich objects and only weakly present in a fourth.

Weaker emission features in the 3.4-3.5 μm region are detected in nine objects, and are prominent only in nitrogen-rich type I nebulae. The intensity of the 3.4-μm feature in these objects is correlated with that of the 3.29-μm band, while the ratio of the two bands is strongly correlated with the nitrogen abundance.

Incubation experiments demonstrated that microbial Fe(III) oxide reduction suppressed sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in surface sediments and mediated ≥ 40% of depth-integrated (0-10 cm) unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism, compared to ≤ 10% for sulfate reduction. In situ CO2 and CH4 flux measurements verified that nonmethanogenic pathways accounted for ∼50% of unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism. Lower (∼10-fold) rates of dark/anaerobic CH4 flux from experimental vegetated cores relative to unvegetated controls suggested that methanogenesis was inhibited in the Juncus rhizosphere, in which active Fe(III) oxide reduction was indicated by the presence of low but readily detectable levels of dissolved and solid-phase Fe(II). Fe(III) oxide reduction accounted for 65% of total carbon metabolism in rhizosphere sediment incubations, compared to 22% for methanogenesis. In contrast, methanogenesis dominated carbon metabolism (72% of total) in experimental unvegetated sediment cores. The high Fe(III) oxide concentrations and reduction rates observed in unvegetated surface and Juncus rhizosphere sediments were perpetuated by rapid Fe(III) regeneration via oxidation of Fe(II) compounds coupled to O2 input from the overlying water and plant roots, respectively.

In spite of the fact that the use of ceramic traps has lost popularity in the U.S. during the last few years, mainly due to the severe problems encountered during regeneration, a new approach to Diesel1 emissions control, is presented. Main objective is to attain the emissions levels set forth by the EPA for 1998, both on PM and NOx emissions. The very high levels of temperature required for thermal regeneration and elaborate controls, have almost eliminated the preference for ceramic filters. However, a new approach is presented by using catalyzed filters which considerably reduce the high temperature requirements. Along with the mathematical modelling a new hardware is presented, which is capable of performing filtering, regeneration, and operation with somewhat simpler and more economical controls. Improvements in the design of combustion chambers, higher injection pressures, better fuels and lubricants, etc., have made possible to re-think the concept of mechanical filtration of Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM).

Adaptive planting dates of - 28, -14, +14 and +28 days were included in the potato simulations for current and increased temperature regimes. Twenty-two sites were simulated for citrus yields and 12 sites for potato, using climate records from 1951 to 1980. Response surfaces were developed for all combinations of increased temperature and CO2. Results of citrus simulations without CO2-induced yield improvement indicate that production may shift slightly northward in the southern states, but yields may decline in southern Florida and Texas due to excessive heat during the winter. CO2 effects tended to counteract the decline in simulated citrus yields. Fall potato production under current management practices appears vulnerable to an increase in temperature in the northern states; increased CO2 and changes in planting date were estimated to have minimal compensating impacts on simulated potato yields.",,"carbon dioxide; citrus; climate change; climatic change; fruit yield; potato; temperature; vegetable yield; yield; yield impact; USA, Florida; USA, Texas; Citrus; Magnoliophyta; Rutaceae; Solanaceae; Solanum tuberosum; Tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301559

The goal is to bring each state, and ultimately the entire region, into attainment for ozone. This can be accomplished, in part, through effective control of NOx emissions from major stationary combustion sources. The lack of 'air borders' when it comes to interstate transport of ozone and precursor compound emissions (NOx and VOC), presents significant regulatory challenges. Pressure exists for states to further tighten allowable NOx RACT emission limits. However, preliminary photochemical modeling suggests that only modest NOx controls may be needed, and Massachusetts does not want to economically constrain itself through 'over-regulation.' Use of innovative 'zero emissions' technologies such as wind turbine generators is a potentially viable alternative to conventional power sources, and appears premising in light of recent technological advances. Such strategies may be sufficient to help large combustion sources obtain the necessary modest reductions of NOx emissions during high ozone episodes. Cost-effective reduction of peak energy demand can aid in achieving regional compliance for ozone. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is conducting a study of technical and regulatory feasibility of siting wind turbine generators at the 780 MGD Deer Island wastewater treatment plant in Boston. This plant, located near Logan International Airport, is undergoing extensive reconstruction that presents sane unique siting challenges. Collected an-site meteorological data will be used to define daily and seasonal patterns of wind availability, and can be later compared with utility system demand. Future study goals include ascertaining the magnitude of reduced NOx emission levels if eventually deploying coastal-sited wind farms. Potential utility system benefits from urban siting of zero emission power systems based on recent theoretical investigations are also discussed.",,"Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sewage treatment plants; Strategic planning; Turbogenerators; Urban planning; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Industrial coastal sites; Massachusetts; Ozone transport region; Siting wind turbine generators; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17544388939

The aerosol loading of the atmosphere depends on wind direction, the southern and southeastern winds being the main carriers of aerosol. During the last decade, the increase in the optical thickness of aerosol in the case of W-, NW- and N-winds has slowed down. This is most likely caused by a reduction in the SO2 emission in Western and Central Europe as well as in Finland. In April, the advection of aerosol is greatest from the NE-direction.

In order to be successful, these episodic controls must be accompanied by a viable forecasting program. This paper reports O3 forecasting results from the 1994 and 1995 summer seasons in the Baltimore metropolitan area. The forecasts are based on a meteorological regression algorithm using surface and upper air measurements and subjective forecaster analyses. The results show that short range (12-24 h) forecasts are successful in predicting multi-day severe high 03 events and low 03 cases but is less successful in forecasting isolated (single day) high 03 events. Uncertainty in the forecasts are related to poor forecasts of sky conditions, local wind conditions and lack of knowledge of boundary advection of 03 and its precursors.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Algorithms; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Standards; Wind effects; Baltimore; Meteorological regression algorithm; Ozone air quality; Ozone",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030314176

Owing to the polarization of the stationary working Pt electrode by rectangular pulses with a frequency of 0.25 Hz and a current intensity of ± 5.0mA, the steady light flow was achieved for more than 10 min. The intensity of light emission was increased by the presence of halides. Especially remarkable was the effect of bromides, the presence of which increased the light emission by almost three orders of magnitude. The light emission could also be increased by the addition of cetyltrimethylammonium cation, and in the dependence on surfactant concentration the formation of two types of associate with different properties could be seen in a system of surfactant counterion/luminol anion (CTA+/L-). Submicellar clusters in solutions of approximately equimolar concentrations of both counterions were formed, increasing the ECL intensity 6 to 17 times.

S. Sahakian, Astrofizika, 38, 143 (1995)]. In this paper it is solved for the realistic case in which the star's magnetic axis does not coincide with its rotational axis (an inclined rotator). It is shown that above the star's magnetic cap a special region, called a magnetic funnel, is formed in which vigorous processes of particle multiplication occur. The height of this region is h = 8·10 6Ω0.2μ301/3R6 1.3 cm and its radius r(Ωr/c)0.5 depends little on the inclination angle α (Ω is the angular rotation rate, μ is the magnetic moment, R is the star's radius, and r is distance from the center of the star). It is shown that the pulsar radio emission is produced in the magnetic funnel. Here, in the course of active radiative processes, two main particle fluxes with a high ultrarelativistic energy are formed: an upward electron flux and a positron flux falling onto the star's magnetic cap. These main fluxes are accompanied by individual narrow strips of positron and electron fluxes with a relatively low energy, which are fairly powerful, coherent radio sources. Such secondary fluxes are formed immediately after the annihilation of photons of curvature radiation emitted by particles of the main fluxes. The pulsar's radio luminosity is estimated to be L ≈ 7.4·10 23Ω3.52μ308/3 ψ(α), where ψ(α) is a known function (ψ ≈ 1 for α &lt; 50°). Equating the theoretical and observed radio luminosities L and L0, we obtain the formula μ30 ≈ P 1.32R60.4 (2.1·10-27L 0/ψ)3/8 for the magnetic moment of the pulsar's neutron star, where P is the pulsar's period. The magnetic moments of slow pulsars calculated from this formula turn out to be considerably larger than those of fast pulsars. This means that the masses of slow pulsars are larger, on the average, than those of fast pulsars. The magnetic funnel operates with interruptions, periodically undergoing a discharge, so that the production of pulsar radio emission operates with interruptions. The durations of the production of radio emission and of the interruptions between those processes are on the order of h/c = 2.7·10-4Ω 0.2μ301/3 sec, i.e., pulsar radio emission has a microstructure. Consequently, a study of the microstructure of the profiles of observed radio pulses enables one to obtain additional information about the magnetic moments of the neutron stars. ©1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349144710

The originality of this model is its capacity for dealing with on-road scale measurements together with more global information on transportation fluxes which are usually extracted from statistical population data representative of larger areas. In this approach, emission factors have to be carefully chosen. The model uses specific exhaust emission factors based on real driving modes and on a representative vehicle fleet. This task generally requires a great deal of traffic density and speed data for accurate emission calculations. Extrapolations over time and space are used to approximate missing parameters. Such a model offers a refined description of emission fluxes and can be applied to perform sensitivity tests and vehicle evolution impact studies.","Air pollutants; Anthropogenic emissions; Emission inventory; Mobile sources","air monitoring; air pollutant; air quality; conference paper; exhaust gas; France; model; priority journal; traffic; Air quality; Calculations; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Sensitivity analysis; Air pollutants; Anthropogenic emissions; Emission inventory; Extrapolations; Transportation fluxes; Vehicle evolution impact study; Air pollution; anthropogenic emission; atmospheric pollutant; emission inventory; model; vehicle emission; France, Paris",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663080

Whether this addition might improve the corrosion resistance of the concrete reinforcement by increasing the resistance to carbonation, via reducing penetrating paths, is the subject addressed in the present paper. Crack control by the fibres in plastic state mortars and crack evolution with time have been studied. Furthermore, the influence of crack width on the steel bar corrosion induced by carbonation has also been monitored. Circular specimens made of mortar have been employed in the experimental phase of the study, using a water/cement ratio of 0.50 and cement/sand ratio of 2/1. The polypropylene fibre content was 0% and 0.5% by volume. Low modulus polypropylene fibres may control the crack width in specimens subjected to inadequate curing conditions. No relationship between crack width and time for corrosion initiation has been observed. However, a beneficial effect of fibre addition on the corrosion rate was found.",,"Carbonation; Composition effects; Concrete reinforcements; Corrosion resistance; Crack propagation; Mortar; Polypropylenes; Reinforced concrete; Steel corrosion; Penetrating paths; Polypropylene fiber reinforced mortar; Fiber reinforced materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032095187

This paper is concerned with the implantation of nitrogen or carbon ions into TiN films to evaluate and obtain the optimum conditions for increased tribological resistance. A commercially available titanium nitride coating produced by ion plating, of approximately 3.5 μm thickness, was treated by implantation of nitrogen or carbon ions at energies of 100 and 75 keV, respectively. The dose range was between 5 × 1016 and 1 × 1018 ions cm-2. It has been observed that a suitable implantation procedure can lead to a maximum hardness improvement of about 15%, as evaluated with a dynamic micro-indentation method at loads from 0.4 to 10 mN. Wear tests performed on an unlubricated reciprocating apparatus, using an alumina ball with a load of 9.8 N and at a speed of 150 cycles min-1, showed that implantation of nitrogen and carbon can reduce wear by 22% and 42%, respectively. Small-area X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SAXPS) was used to evaluate the concentration of implanted elements as a function of depth. The analysis showed that in the high-dose C+-implanted sample a very high percentage of the carbon remained as pure carbon, whereas in the lower-dose C+-implanted sample the carbon stayed mainly in a carbidic form. In the case of nitrogen implantation, no large variations in the state or concentrations were recorded.","Hardness; Ion implantation; TiN coating; Wear","Carbon; Hardness; Ion implantation; Mechanical testing; Nitrogen; Titanium nitride; Tribology; Wear of materials; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Ion plating; Micro indentation method; Small area x ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Protective coatings; ion implantation; titanium nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030266278

Isotopic, lithological and palaeontological data indicate that Tertiary sedimentation started in this region in the early middle Eocene (Lutetian) with the development of semi-locked basins (lagoons) in the depressions of pre-existing Deccan Trap basements. The larger benthic foraminifera Assilina was the dominant microbiotic species capable of surviving in this highly stressed environment. The basins were later cut off by the oscillatory withdrawal of the sea, which trapped large amounts of organic matter. Degradation of this organic matter exhausted the dissolved oxygen and biogenic methane was produced in anaerobic conditions. This methane, decomposed by sulphate reducing bacteria, produced some bioclastic limestones with extremely depleted carbon isotope values. The oxygen isotope values of the limestones suggest a significant contribution of freshwater into these lagoons. As a result, terrigenous elastics were formed; associated lignite beds developed in a warm, humid climate. Probably the area was part of a global warm humid belt which extended through Africa and Europe as far as 40°N during the Lutetian. A renewed marine transgression is recorded by the formation of aerated tidal lagoons having a more seaward extensions. The process culminated in a relatively open shallow marine condition when late middle Eocene and Oligocene bioclastic limestones (with a vast array of tropical chlorozoan assemblages) were deposited.",,"Assilina; Bacteria (microorganisms); Foraminifera; carbonate; clastic sediment; depositional environment; isotopic analysis; Palaeogene; palaeogeography; India, Gujarat, Kutch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029751303

Two data sets, one acquired on February 28 and the other on March 22, 1992, were analyzed independently. A sequence of image mosaics was used to constrain the parameters of an emission source model. The emission source model utilizes an auroral oval traced from the distant magnetosphere, using the O6 magnetic field model (Connerney, J. E. P. 1992. In Planetary Radio Emissions III (H. O. Rucker, S. J. Bauer, and M. L. Kaiser, Eds.), pp. 13-33. Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, Vienna.) plus the current sheet model (Connerney, J. E. P., M. H. Acuña, and N. F. Ness 1981. J. Geophys. Res. 86, 8370-8384.). Limb positioning errors, photometric uncertainties, atmospheric seeing changes, telescope point spread functions, and disk emissions are all included in the model. A generalized inverse methodology, applied to individual pixel intensities in the sequence of auroral images, is used to constrain the model parameters. A uniformly bright auroral oval, and two non-uniform emission models were examined; one has an anomaly fixed to the System-III coordinate, and the other has an anomaly fixed in planet's local time. The latter has a broad and bright emission in the afternoon sector, and offers a significantly better fit in the south. Finally, a combination of the System-III fixed anomaly (equatorward of the oval) plus the local-time fixed anomaly (poleward) was found to simulate the emission intensities in both aurorae consistently well. The size of the auroral oval is larger in the north (by 10%) and smaller in the south (by 3-7%) compared to the O6 model auroral oval. Weaker H+3 emissions are found both poleward and equatorward of the oval, the latter extending approximately to the footprint of the Io torus at most longitudes. System-III anomalies are tentatively identified at longitudes where the local magnetic field strength is less than that at the conjugate point. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030186917

Following storms, moving vehicles crush the sand and cinders and suspend fine dust (PM-10) in the air. The dust that is created following the snow storms contributes 40% of the PM-10 emissions in Mammoth Lakes, which violates the federal 24-hour PM-10 standard, and 60% of the PM-10 in Reno, which violates the federal annual PM-10 standard. Street sweeping is used in both areas to reduce the sand/cinder street loading following storms to reduce PM-10 emissions. Tests in this study show that the effectiveness of the street sweepers for reducing PM-10 emissions could be increased from 30% to 90approx. by using magnesium chloride (MgCl2), a dust suppressant, in the street sweeper's spray bars. The MgCl2 helps to agglomerate particles to improve pick-up effectiveness and also binds fine particles to the road surface to reduce PM-10 emissions. Added benefits with MgCl2 are that the solution has a lower freezing temperature that water (30% solution is -24.4φC) which allows it to be applied in the morning hours on streets where water would normally turn to ice, and the residual MgCl2, will lower the temperature of water freezing on the roadway to extend the period before sand or cinders must be applied for traffic safety.",,"Agglomeration; Dust; Magnesium compounds; Particles (particulate matter); Roads and streets; Testing; Magnesium chloride; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030316170

Species concentration and temperature profiles are measured with a molecular beam mass spectrometer and thin-wire thermocouple, respectively. Species profiled include H2, N2O, NH3, N2, NO, and Ar. The experimental mole fractions are compared to both equilibrium and premixed laminar flame code calculations. The flame code employs a chemical mechanism consisting of 87 reactions and 20 species with rate constants obtained from a critical literature review. Equilibrium calculations are in very good agreement with both experimental and flame code calculations for N2O, N2, and H2O in the postflame region of both neat and doped flames. However, they underpredict the H2 and NO mole fraction in both flames, proving that NO is not in equilibrium and prevents full energy release. The flame code profiles of the majority of the species agree well with experiment for the neat flame and reasonably well for the doped flame. A 55% reduction in the NO mole fraction for 4% dopant is predicted in the postflame region, in good agreement with that observed experimentally. The flame calculations overpredict the NH3 mole fractions in the postflame region, however, suggesting that refinements in the model are necessary. Rate and sensitivity analyses reveal that the decrease in NO mole fraction results from less NO formation by the reactions N2O+H=NO+NH and N+OH=NO+H and more of its consumption to N2 by reactions NO+NH2=N2+H2O and NO+NH2=NNH+OH. © 1996 Combustion Institute.",,"Ammonia; Argon; Calculations; Computer simulation; Doping (additives); Hydrogen; Laminar flow; Mass spectrometry; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Temperature measurement; Thermocouples; Mole fraction; Molecular beam mass spectrometry; Flame research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030375944

Maximum daily net photosynthetic rates measured at the two different CO2 concentrations were from 30 to 100% higher in elevated than in ambient [CO2] throughout the experimental period. The increase in maximum daily photosynthesis was also accompanied by a 93% rise in the apparent quantum yield of CO2 assimilation, measured during periods of optimum soil moisture conditions. Hence, no clear evidence of down-regulation of net photosynthetic activity was found. Interactions between atmospheric CO2 concentration and plant water stress were studied by following the natural evolution of drought in different seasons and years. At each level of water stress, the maximum rate of carbon assimilation was higher in elevated than in ambient [CO2] by up to 100%. Analysis of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in normal (21%) and low (2%) oxygen concentrations provided useful insights into the functioning and stability of the photosynthetic processes. The photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) progressively decreased as drought conditions became more evident; this trend was accentuated under elevated [CO2]. Thermal de-excitation processes were possibly more significant under elevated than under ambient [CO2], in a combination of environmental stresses. This research suggests two possible conclusions: (i) a 'positive' interaction between elevated [CO2] and carbon metabolism can be obtained through relief of water stress limitation in the summer months, and (ii) elevated [CO2], under drought conditions, may also enhance the significance of slow-relaxing quenching.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Elevated [CO2]; Mediterranean ecosystems; Photosynthesis; Quercus ilex L; Water stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001666767

Tracer kinetic techniques were used in the present study to assess the physiological importance of vitamin A deficiency on the de novo synthesis of methionine via the hepatic folate-dependent one-carbon pool. Vitamin A-deficient (0 retinol equivalents (RE) retinyl palmitate/g diet) rats were fed their respective diet for 11 wk, whereas control rats (1.2 RE retinyl palmitate/g diet) were food restricted to match the growth rate exhibited by the vitamin A-deficient group. After the dietary treatment period, duodenal cannulated rats were continuously infused with L-[3-14C] serine and L-[methyl-3H] methionine until a plateau specific radioactivity was exhibited with respect to the hepatic serine and methionine pools, indicating a steady state had been achieved. The hepatic concentration of both S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine were elevated in vitamin A-deficient rats. However, vitamin A-deficient rats exhibited similar kinetic values compared with control rats fed a vitamin A-sufficient diet. The irreversible loss rate of hepatic serine and methionine, the transfer quotient from serine to methionine and the folate-dependent flow of carbon to methionine from serine were unaffected by vitamin A status. These studies demonstrate that vitamin A deficiency does not affect the reductive carbon flow from serine to methionine because the ability to generate methionine via remethylation of homocysteine with the carbon group originating from serine was not altered in vitamin A-deficient rats. Furthermore, the data illustrate the importance of using tracer kinetic techniques to quantify metabolic flux under steady-state conditions in vivo, thereby evaluating the consequences of an abnormal condition on a physiological and functional basis.","folate; one-carbon metabolism; rats; tracer kinetic techniques; vitamin A deficiency","folic acid; methionine; retinol; s adenosylhomocysteine; s adenosylmethionine; serine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; carbon dioxide fixation; controlled study; folate metabolism; folic acid deficiency; kinetics; nonhuman; rat; reaction analysis; retinol deficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029947237

In order to test whether this higher carbon fixation efficiency will translate into increased biomass production under CO2 enrichment we exposed plots of narrow alpine grassland (Swiss Central Alps, 2470 m) to ambient (355 μl 1-1) and elevated (680 μl 1-1) CO2 concentration using open top chambers. Part of the plots received moderate mineral nutrient additions (40 kg ha-1 year -1 of nitrogen in a complete fertilizer mix). Under natural nutrient supply CO2 enrichment had no effect on biomass production per unit land area during any of the three seasons studied so far. Correspondingly, the dominant species Carex curvula and Leontodon helveticus as well as Trifolium alpinum did not show a growth response either at the population level or at the shoot level. However, the subdominant generalistic species Poa alpina strongly increased shoot growth (+47%). Annual root production (in ingrowth cores) was significantly enhanced in C. curvula in the 2nd and 3rd year of investigation (+43%) but was not altered in the bulk samples for all species. Fertilizer addition generally stimulated above-ground (+48%) and below-ground (+26%) biomass production right from the beginning. Annual variations in weather conditions during summer also strongly influenced above-ground biomass production (19-27% more biomass in warm seasons compared to cool seasons). However, neither nutrient availability nor climate had a significant effect on the CO2 response of the plants. Our results do not support the hypothesis that alpine plants, due to their higher carbon uptake efficiency, will increase biomass production under future atmospheric CO2 enrichment, at least not in such late successional communities. However, as indicated by the response of P. alpina, species-specific responses occur which may lead to altered community structure and perhaps ecosystem functioning in the long-term. Our findings further suggest that possible climatic changes are likely to have a greater impact on plant growth in alpine environments than the direct stimulation of photosynthesis by CO2. Counter-intuitively, our results suggest that even under moderate climate warming or enhanced atmospheric nitrogen deposition positive biomass responses to CO2 enrichment of the currently dominating species are unlikely.","Alps; Biomass; Carbon sequestration; Carex; Climate","alpine grassland; biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; grassland; growth; Europe, Alps; Switzerland, Alps; Carex curvula; Leontodon helveticus; Poa alpina; Trifolium alpinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029669059

Spraberry was once deemed, ""The largest uneconomic field in the world."" The marginal economics and low recoveries of producing in Spraberry are well documented and have effectively prevented comprehensive reservoir characterization yet the Spraberry Trend Area continues to produce nearly 60 Mbopd from more than 7,500 wells and has produced 700 MMbbls during the life of the reservoir. Many wells have been abandoned due to low productivity and many more face the same fate unless new technology becomes available which will improve recovery over the current low value. Spraberry Trend Area reservoirs originally contained some 10 Bbbls OOIP of which less than 10% has been recovered. Obviously, the oil remaining in place rep-resents a tremendous EOR target. Many of the large Spraberry Units which were once operated by major oil companies have been acquired by independent oil companies. Development of these units has resulted in extensive in-fill drilling from 1991 through 1995. The consolidation of large tracts of unitized Spraberry production under one operator combined with a plentiful, local and relatively inexpensive supply of CO2 has raised some interesting questions. This paper addresses the necessary background and future plans for a proposed CO2 pilot in the Upper Spraberry. The work in this paper also demonstrates the value of consolidating old data from several operators and integrating with more recent data as a necessary step towards comprehensive fracture characterization, a precursor for developing all possible process options before vast numbers of Spraberry wells are plugged and abandoned. © 1996, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fracture; Recovery; Fracture characterization; Oil companies; Pilot design; Reservoir characterization; Abandoned wells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054371619

Within ecology, there has been considerable confusion and controversy over the large-scale significance of limitation of net primary production (NPP) by nutrients versus biophysical quantities (e.g., heat, water, and sunlight) with considerable evidence supporting both views. The Century model, run to a quasi-steady state condition, predicts ""equilibration"" of water with nutrient limitation, because carbon fixation and nitrogen fluxes (inputs and losses) are controlled by water fluxes, and the capture of nitrogen into organic matter is governed by carbon fixation. Patterns in the coupled water, nitrogen, and carbon cycles are modified substantially by ecosystem type or species-specific controls over resource use efficiency (water and nitrogen used per unit NPP), detrital chemistry, and soil water holding capacity. We also examined the coupling between water and nutrients during several temperature perturbation experiments. Model experiments forced by satellite-observed temperatures suggest that climate anomalies can result in significant changes to terrestrial carbon dynamics. The cooling associated with the Mount Pinatubo eruption aerosol injection may have transiently increased terrestrial carbon storage. However, because processes in the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles have different response times, model behavior during the return to steady state following perturbation was complex and extended for decades after 1- to 5-year perturbations. Thus consequences of climate anomalies are influenced by the climatic conditions of the preceding years, and climate-carbon correlations may not be simple to interpret.",,"Pinatubo; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycle; Century model; climate; ecosystem; nitrogen; water flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030326255

In the course of the sunny day the photosynthetic net CO2 assimilation rates P(N) rose with the PPFD in the morning and were then predominantly determined by the stomata opening (partial closure at noon and further closure in the afternoon as seen from the decrease in gH2O-values). When the rate of CO2-fixation began to decrease at a high sun irradiance (high PPFD) at about 10:00 am (partial closure of stomata), large zeaxanthin amounts were accumulated in a hipbasic process: 1) by a fast phototransformation of existing violaxanthin into zeaxanthin and 2) by a slow but continuous increase of the zeaxanthin level of 50 to 60% via de novo biosynthesis. A strong zeaxanthin accumulation depends on a high proton gradient and only proceeded when P(N) was light- saturated and was reduced by a partial closure of stomata. The zeaxanthin accumulation in the morning followed the rise in PPFD with some delay as well as the zeaxanthin retransformation to violaxanthin at the PPFD decrease in the late afternoon and evening. On the sunny day the photochemical and non- photochemical quenching coefficients of the chlorophyll fluorescence, qP and qN, showed an inverse relationship. With increasing PPFD qP declined to very low rallies (below 0.1) and qN increased to high values &gt;0.9. The variable chlorophyll fluorescence ratios F(v')/F(m')and ΔF/F(m'), indicators of the quantum efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport of photosystem II, declined parallel to the high PPFI)-induced declinc of qP and the rise in qN. There was, however, no clear correlation between the changes in chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and the rise and fall of zeaxanthin in the course of the sunny day. In fact, in the afternoon the zeaxanthin level decreased much earlier than the decline in qN and the rise and regeneration of the initial values of qP, F(v')/(Fm')or AF/Fm'. Despite the strong increase in qN and the large decrease in qP, F(v')/F(m') and AF/(Fm'), the net CO2 assimilation rates P(N) of maple leaves only declined by 22% as compared to the maximum P(N) values at 10:15 am indicating that the photosynthetic apparatus was only marginally photoinhibited. It is assumed that only a small fraction of chloroplasts at the tipper leaf side became photoinhibited and functioned as a light filter for the other chloroplasts in the lower mesophyll parts which remained photosynthetically active. The results demonstrate that the changes of the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters qP and qN as well as of the ratios P(v')/F(m') or δF/P(m1), measured with the PAM fluorometer at the upper leaf side, are not represcntative of the total pool of leaf chloroplasts. For this reason it is suggested to measure the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters not only at the upper but also at the lower leaf side in order to obtain more representative information on the chloroplasts of the whole leaf. In addition, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements should always be complemented by net CO2 fixation measurements in order to investigate to which degree a presumed photoinhibition really exists at the whole leaf level. On the cloudy day up to 3 pm the PPFD was very low, yet net photosynthesis (P(N)) was performed at good rates. There occurred, however, hardly any increase in zeaxanthin content, except for a short sunny period in the early afternoon. All accumulation of zeaxanthin by de nova biosynthesis did, however, not occur. Significant changes in the quenching coeffecients qP and qN or in the variable fluorescence ratios δF/Fm1 and Fv'/Fm' were not detectable in the course of the cloudy day. The results suggest that zeaxanthin seems to play an essential role in photoprotections of the photosynthetic apparatus against high light exposure in plants growing at field conditions in direct sunlight. The major part of high light induced chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, as seen in the decline of qP and the fluorescence ratios Fv'/Fm' anti δF'/Fm' and in the risc of qN, is apparently not dependent on zeaxanthin. The possible function of zeaxanthin (detoxifying highly reactive oxygen species, removing of expoy groups from lipids or as spacer between LHCII and the reaction center of PSII) is being discussed, yet the exact mode of the photoprotective action of zeaxanthin remains to be clarified.","Acer platanoides L.; carotenoids; chlorophyll fluorescence; daily cycle; photoprotection; photosynthesis; zeaxanthin; zeaxanthin cycle","Acer; Acer platanoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029843233

Such strategies can affect the net flux of carbon to the atmosphere through 4 mechanisms: storage of C in the biosphere; storage of C in forest products; use of biofuels to displace fossil-fuel use: use of wood products which often displaces other products that require more fossil fuel for their production. We use the mathematical model GORCAM (Graz/Oak Ridge Carbon Accounting Model) to examine these mechanisms for 16 land-use scenarios. Over long time intervals the amount of C stored in the biosphere and in forest products reaches a steady state and continuing mitigation of C emissions depends on the extent to which fossil fuel use is displaced by the use of bioenergy and wood products. The relative effectiveness of alternative forest and bioenergy strategies and their impact on net C emissions strongly depend, for example, on the productivity of the site, its current usage, and the efficiency with which the harvest is used. When growth rates are high and harvest is used efficiently, the dominant opportunity for net reduction in C emissions is seen to be fossil-fuel displacement. At the growth rates and efficiencies of harvest utilization adopted in many of our base scenarios, the net C balance at the end of 100 years is very similar whether trees are harvested and used for energy and traditional forest products, or reforestation and forest protection strategies are implemented. The C balance on a plantation system that provides a constant output of biomass products can look different than the balance of a single parcel of land.Forest and bioenergy strategies offer the prospect of reduced CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Such strategies can affect the net flux of carbon to the atmosphere through 4 mechanisms: storage of C in the biosphere; storage of C in forest products; use of biofuels to displace fossil-fuel use; use of wood products which often displaces other products that require more fossil fuel for their production.

Solution spectra in H2O, MeCN, and DMF indicate no participation of the side-chain donor group in metal coordination. This is also the case in the solid state as shown by the X-ray structures of the Ni2+ complexes with 1 and 2, in which a tetrahedrally distorted square-planar geometry around the Ni2- results by the coordination of the four N-atoms of the macrocycle. Cyclic voltammetry of these complexes in MeCN reveals that Ni2- is reversibly reduced to Ni+ between -0.7 and -0.8 V vs. SCE. For the complexes with 1 and 2, the thioether bond is cleaved at more negative potentials, whereby a thiol group is formed. This thiol group is then oxidized at ca. +0.7 V vs. SCE, when a glassy C electrode is used, or at ca. 0 V vs. SCE at a dropping Hg electrode. No cleavage of the ether bond in the complexes with 3 and 4 is observed under similar conditions. Reduction of the Ni2+ complexes of 1 and 2 with Na-amalgam in DMF produces small amounts of methane only in the case of 1, indicating the importance of the proximity between the NII centre and the MeS group.",,"metal complex; nickel complex; article; coenzyme; complex formation; drug analysis; drug development; electrochemistry; electron spin resonance; model; reaction analysis; X ray analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029942171

The procedure is based on a mathematical analysis of the reaction system. Neither steady state assumptions for some species, nor partial equilibrium for reactions have to be specified explicitly. The only requirements to the scheme are a detailed reaction mechanism and the number of degrees of freedom desired for the simplified scheme. All necessary information on the thermochemical state (species concentrations, temperature, density, etc.) is then given as function of a small number of reaction progress variables, associated with the degrees of freedom. Therefore, less equations (for two or three reaction progress variables instead of for 34 species in case of CH4) have to be solved, thus drastically reducing the computational effort compared to calculations using detailed chemistry. Subsequent use of a tabulation procedure, where all information is stored, guarantees an efficient use in various CFD applications.","Chemical kinetics; Laminar flames; Reduced reaction schemes; Simplified chemical kinetics; Simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002467515

Here we describe that brief hypercapnia produces marked up-regulation of somatosensory activation of blood flow that outlasts carbon dioxide exposure for at least 60 min. In chloralose-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats, somatosensory activation was carried out by electrical stimulation of the forepaw. Blood flow was measured in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Under control conditions, somatosensory stimulation increased LDF by 38.8 ± 11.0%. Ventilation with 6% CO2 for 3 min caused a rise of LDF by 28.0 ± 8.7%. Baseline CBF and PaCO2 returned to control values within 20 min. Repetition of somatosensory stimulation after hypercapnia revealed a long-lasting up-regulation of the flow response: 25 min after hypercapnia, functional stimulation increased LDF by 86.0 ± 18.1%, and 60 min after hypercapnia even by 96.0 ± 26.0%. This is the first demonstration of CO2-induced up-regulation of functional activation of blood flow and an example of the importance of general physiological variables for the modulation of the coupling process.","Carbon dioxide; Forepaw stimulation; Functional activation; Regional cerebral blood flow","animal experiment; animal model; article; brain blood flow; carbon dioxide tension; controlled study; hypercapnia; laser Doppler flowmetry; male; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; rat; somatosensory cortex; somatosensory stimulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029861789

The ambient pollution levels now tend to be determined solely by the background pollution. The costs of dust collection increase disproportionately with falling clean gas dust content, so any further dedusting measures can only be appropriate if they lead to an improvement in ambient air pollution levels. However, this can only be decided if the contributions of individual emission sources to the ambient pollution levels in the vicinity of the works are known. Systematic investigations using adhesive films in accordance with Code of Practice VDI 2119, page 4 (draft), were earned out to assign deposited dust particles to individual emitters in a cement works. The particles were able to be assigned to their various emission sources by optical evaluation under a light-optical microscope. The evaluation has shown that emissions from directional, dedusted sources, such as the main chimneys of rotary kiln plants, do not make any detectable contribution to the ambient particulate pollution levels. Low-lying diffuse emission sources can make a relevant contribution in the immediate neighbourhood of the works. The influence of secondary emissions such as wind erosion, mechanical soil cultivation or vehicular traffic (tyre abrasion) is dominant in dry weather. Evaluation of a non-steady operating state using adhesive films for measuring deposited dust showed no indication of increased ambient pollution loading. The results of the investigation are in agreement with dispersion calculations which simulated the ambient pollution levels for steady-state operation and for short-term non-steady operating states.",,"Air pollution; Air pollution control; Calculations; Cement plants; Codes (standards); Computer simulation; Dust; Dust control; Environmental impact; Optical microscopy; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Adhesive films; Cement works; Dust collection; Dust emission; Particulate pollution; Cement manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030205546

Cultures were acclimated to green, blue, red and white light. The spectral dependency in the light-limited slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance curves (α) was measured with carbon action spectra that, when divided by the spectrally weighted absorption coefficient, provided estimates of the maximum quantum yield (φ(max)) for carbon fixation. Values of (φ(max)) varied with wavelength within each culture conditions as well as between different culture conditions. The degree to which the spectral dependency in (φ(max)) was influenced by the presence of photoprotective carotenoids and/or energy imbalances between photosystems I and II was assessed for both dinoflagellates. The impact of photoprotective pigmentation on the spectral dependency of (φ(max)) was most significant for cells grown under high light conditions reflecting the enrichment of diadinoxanthin. Energy imbalances between the photosystems was assessed by quantifying enhancement effects on spectral (φ(max))in the presence of background illumination. Under our experimental conditions, enhancement effects on carbon action spectra were evident for H. Pygmaea under nearly all growth conditions but were not detectable for P. minimum under any growth condition. We hyphotesize that sensitivity to enhancement effects reflected differences in the structure of the photosynthetic machinery of these two peridinin-containing dinoflagellates. While measurements of (φ(max)) are sensitive to the color of the light within an incubator, the relative impact on the spectral dependency of a was less than the wavelength associated with the cellular absorption properties. Finally we used data to validate an approach proposed by others to aid in the correction of photosynthetic measurements where the in situ spectral light field cannot be easily mimicked. The average error using this approach was 8%, which was significantly error associated with ignoring the spectral dependency in α.","action spectra; chromatic adaptation; Heterocapsa pygmaea; photosynthesis; Prorocentrum minimum; Pyrrophyta; quantum yield","Dinophyceae; Heterocapsa pygmaea; Heterocapsa pygmaea; Prorocentrum minimum; Prorocentrum minimum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029742919

In addition, distinctive facies controls can be identified. Utilizing data from both anatomically preserved plants and compressions, broad controls upon the distribution of taxa can be identified. The composition of a flora will reflect not only palaeobiogeography but also stratigraphic age, ecology, facies distribution, preservation, intensity of collection and study. Most recent palaeogeographical analyses have relied on published data which rarely documents all of these facets. In addition, different authors world wide have quite different concepts of the taxa concerned so that a statistical analysis using published lists may have little value. In this paper we examine the spacial and temporal distribution of Lower Carboniferous plants from Western Europe. In particular, adjacent localities of the same age may have distinctly different floras reflecting ecological and taphonomic controls. When viewed outside their geological context they could easily be considered as floras of different ages or from different biological provinces. We present a revised stratigraphic distribution of key genera of anatomically preserved plants in Western Europe. We believe that, particularly in the Lower Carboniferous where rapid evolution of several plant groups can be demonstrated, accurate dating of the floras is an essential prerequisite to all other studies.

It is essential to assess the spatial distribution of air quality and its impact on human beings in the urban region. A large data base is required to estimate the human exposure to air pollution. The Geographical Information System (GIS), which is especially suited for handling data with large spatially distributed features, is a valuable tool for estimation of population exposure. In this study an indigenously, developed GIS package GRAM has been used to assess the exposure and health risk of the population of the Greater Bombay region from atmospheric pollutants. The population and the built-up area are growing rapidly, and the concentration of air pollutants is large in the eastern and central parts of the city. Interpolated maps of three pollutants have been created using GIS to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI). Maps of population density and population growth give an idea of the pressure of population on the land. The final map generated by overlaying the AQI map and population pressure map helps to demarcate five pollutant risk zones in Greater Bombay. This map is useful for developing various air pollution management strategies.

Under second-order homogeneity assumptions, climatological variability of mean areal rainfall, as measured by its coefficient of variation, is shown to be a function of mean fractional coverage, conditional coefficient of variation of point rainfall and two correlation scales associated with inner variability and intermittency of point rainfall. To verify the analytical results, empirical analyses are performed using hourly rainfall data from nine Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars in the southern plains, United States. The results indicate that given the local rainfall climatology there exists a catchment scale at which the climatological variability of mean areal rainfall is at its maximum. Existence of such a scale has been hypothesized and demonstrated via an analytical treatment of an idealized situation by Eagleson and Wang [1985], but only in climatological variability of fractional coverage (i.e., variability due only to intermittency). Sensitivity analyses for the correlation-scale parameters indicate that intermittency plays as important a role as inner variability in shaping the catchment scale-climatological variability relationship of mean areal rainfall. Decomposition of total variability indicates that over the range of catchment scales that fall within a single WSR-88D radar umbrella (effective radius of 230 km) the integrated contribution from intermittency is almost as large as that from inner variability.",,"rain; catchment; decomposition; radius; sensitivity analysis; telecommunication; United States; weather; areal rainfall; hydrological model; rainfall",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029803585

The CAAA Title V program alone requires major sources to track at least six criteria pollutants as well as the 189 Hazardous Air Pollutants and other regulated chemicals. This paper discusses the use of a computerized data management system for decreasing the burden of recordkeeping and reporting requirements. It focuses on the requirements of a good data management system with emphasis on three primary aspects: data entry, analysis and reporting. The data entry interface should be as user friendly as possible, thereby, taking away the time consuming exercise of data entry from technical staff. There are certain key data elements which are required as system inputs for a comprehensive Title V air emissions analysis: MSDS, purchase/usage, emission factors, process and operational data. The analytical capability of a system is dependent on its design. The study examines potential software platforms for designing such a system including spreadsheets, flat file databases and relational databases. Regardless of the software selection there are certain features which make a system efficient and time-saving. The utility of a good system lies in its flexibility. It should provide the user with options of calculating emissions for actual, projected and alternate operating scenarios. These options are extremely helpful in Title V determination studies and comparisons to permit allowables where the user needs to study different aspects of the emissions scenario. Finally, the system should provide a range of output formats which allow the user to choose depending on the end use of the results: this could range from a printout of the MSDS database to a fee calculation from the actual emissions. This paper discusses all the above factors in detail with examples. Based on a study of a few available systems and feedback from their users, we believe that a flexible and efficient data management system substantially reduces the time, money and effort industry needs to spend dealing with recordkeeping and reporting.",,"Computer software selection and evaluation; Data acquisition; Data recording; Data reduction; Database systems; Industrial emissions; User interfaces; Air emission analysis; Computerized data management system; Environmental engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030315726

During the past 25 years, the day-night average sound level, has gained substantial acceptance as a measure of community noise exposure. During the same period, the effects of various levels of noise exposure on human activities and health have been widely studied. Data from many social surveys have been brought together and analyzed to clarify the relationship between noise exposure and the prevalence of annoyance which provides a broad indication of the impact of intrusive noise on human communities. Criteria and guidelines based on such studies are now widely used in urban planning and their effectiveness is enhanced by new standards that characterize sound propagation outdoors. Regulations that control motor vehicle noise at the source have, as yet, produced only limited benefits, while highway barriers provide some relief from excessive exposure to traffic noise. In recent years, there have been impressive reductions in the noise emissions from commercial aircraft and notable improvements in the control of airport noise. Finally, the potential effects of noise on wildlife, especially endangered species, now come under close scrutiny when noise-generating projects are planned in sensitive environments.",,"Acoustic noise; Environmental impact; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Motor transportation; Noise pollution control; Community noise exposure; Noise environments outdoors; Noise pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030143699

Box 31-244, Lower Hutt, New Zealand","Artificial coalification can fill a gap in our understanding of the processes of natural maturation of coal in a time frame reasonable for scientific investigation. This study focused on two main aspects of the coalification process. These aspects were, first, the effects on carbonised components in peat and, second, the amount and location of compaction during coalification. It was found that the proportion of the carbonised components increased during artificial coalification while the proportion of amorphous matrix decreased. These relative changes in proportion of constituents may be the result of the differing reactivities of these components. Compaction during artificial coalification resulted in a 72% volume loss (or a 5,7:1 compaction ratio). Most of the volume loss was from a decrease in pore space (45%) between the particles of organic material, although compression of plant parts accounts for 17% of the volume loss. The remaining 10% of the compaction was from organic mass loss, in out-gassing and fluid expulsion. Finally, although it was observed that compaction of wood was of the order of 2,5:1, it does not occur uniformly across all anatomical structures. Xylem tracheids appear to have compacted little and the majority of wood compaction appeared in the ray parenchyma. However, the compaction ratio in the rays was relatively low (1,5:1), considering that ray parenchyma should compress easily as they lack secondary cell walls and the cells thus have less inherent strength to withstand compression than xylem tracheids. However, it appears that the ray parenchyma are filled with solid organic residues at or before the time of burial, which prevents the compression of cell lumens. This suggests that the tissue would have originated from the heartwood of trees where tannins and other waste products are stored in ray parenchyma cells. Although the above observations are based on a limited sample set, the results do pose interesting subject matter for further study. In particular it is essential that different peat types be examined in order to understand the changes in proportion of organic components during coalification. It has also been demonstrated that compaction occurs mainly as a loss of pore space between organic particles; however, the degree of material loss still needs to be documented in different peats of varying decomposition states.","artificial coalification; carbonised plant constituents; compaction; heartwood; Indonesian peat","Amorphous materials; Compaction; Composition; Decomposition; Peat; Plants (botany); Textures; Wood; Artificial coalification; Carbonised plant constituents; Coal natural maturation; Coalification; Heartwood; Xylem tracheids; Coal; coalification; compaction; peat; wood; Indonesia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030072228

The EVGSAU was unitized in 1978 and has been under waterflood operations since 1979. CO2/water injection (WAG injection) commenced in 1986. An interdisciplinary reservoir study was initiated in 1994 to integrate the unit's geological character and reservoir performance in order to optimize the CO2/waterflood. This paper examines the sedimentologic and stratigraphic framework, lithologic character, pore system, quality and continuity, and architecture and internal geometry of the reservoir and their application to safeguarding prime CO2 flood performance within the reservoir. The Permian-aged San Andres Formation is composed of two major, eustatically controlled, upward-shallowing carbonate ramp sequences that contain multiple, anhydritic, dolomitized successions in which subtidal grain-rich lithofacies grade upward into peritidal, mud-rich carbonates and siliciclastics. A siliciclastic, lowstand tidal flat unit, the Lovington sand, caps the lower sequence and separates the formation into the Lower and Upper San Andres. Grainstones and packstones deposited as high- energy shoals and bars are the primary reservoir lithologies. Diagenetic processes critical to the development of good reservoir porosity and quality are; (1) early dolomitization of the carbonate section, (2) intense dissolution and alteration of anhydrite to gypsum, and (3) dissolution of dolomite. Four correlatable subtidal grain-rich intervals constitute the chief flow units and the only continuous waterfloodable intervals across the field. Relationships between the distribution of the subtidal grain-rich lithofacies, porosity content, anhydrite and gypsum abundances, and structural position exhibit considerable potential for mapping reservoir flow units and for defining reservoir quality within flow units. This geological model provided the architectural basis for the reservoir simulation pattern model used to evaluate reservoir performance and to modify EVGSAU operating plans to ensure optimum flooding. The geological model helped determine; 1) Upper San Andres vs. Lower San Andres performance, 2) infill spacing within the Upper and Lower San Andres, 3) the potential for horizontal injection in the Upper and Lower San Andres, and 4) repressurization volumes required for the Upper San Andres. © 1996, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Deposition; Dissolution; Floods; Geologic models; Gypsum; Plastic flow; Porosity; Reservoirs (water); Stratigraphy; Diagenetic process; Geological character; Geological modeling; Reservoir performance; Reservoir porosity; Reservoir quality; Reservoir simulation; Stratigraphic framework; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888597273

In order to better understand the consequences of global climate change, it is essential that we define how soil C storage is influenced by changes in temperature and moisture that are expected as a result of global climate change. Forest floor carbon pools and fluxes were evaluated at 16 northern hardwood sites located within four distinct climate regions (Northern, Central, Southern and Coastal) in Maine. Mean annual air temperature at the sites ranged from 2.0°C in the Northern region to 6.2°C in the Coastal region and average annual precipitation ranged from 90 cm in the Northern region to 140 cm in the Coastal region. Leaf litter mass and leaf litter C flux were not correlated with temperature indices and did not vary among regions. However, they were positively correlated with annual precipitation, suggesting that litter production was controlled, in part at least, by precipitation but not by temperature. Northern sites stored more C in the forest floor than Coastal sites, and they experienced slower decomposition rates. Because soil and vegetation characteristics of these sites were similar, we attribute these trends to differences in climate. Indeed, C turnover time was correlated with latitude and temperature indices. Slower decomposition in the Northern region was attributed to a combination of lower specific activity at temperatures below 13°C, cooler average temperatures and a shorter frost-free season. Soil respiration at each site was positively correlated with temperature and the slope of the relationship increased with latitude, indicating that the ability of the soil biota to respire C varied with climate. A predictive equation is presented that accounts for the change in slope with latitude. Because C loss through soil respiration was more sensitive to temperature than C inputs from litter, any regional warming in the next century may lead to a decrease in forest floor carbon storage. However, if precipitation increases with temperature, then litter C flux may increase and offset the increase in soil respiration.","Decomposition; Litter; Moisture; Soil respiration; Temperature","cellular organisms; cellular organisms; carbon flux; carbon pool; climatic change; decomposition; forest; soil respiration; temperature; USA, Maine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030201325

Box 7909, Austin, TX 78713-7909, United States","A practical approach to linear prestack seismic inversion in the context of a locally 1-D earth is employed to use amplitude variation with offset (AVO) information for the direct detection in hydrocarbons. The inversion is based on the three-term linearized approximation to the Zoeppritz equations. The normal-incidence compressional-wave reflection coefficient Ro models the background reflectivity in the absence of hydrocarbons and incorporates the mudrock curve and Gardner's equation. Prediction-error parameters, ΔRsh and ΔRρ, represent perturbations in the normal-incidence shear-wave reflection coefficient and the density contribution to the normal incidence reflectivity, respectively, from that predicted by the mudrock curve and Gardner's equation. This prediction-error approach can detect hydrocarbons in the absence of an overall increase in AVO, and in the absence of bright spots, as expected in theory. Linear inversion is applied to a portion of a young, Tertiary, shallow-marine data set that contains known hydrocarbon accumulations. Prestack data are in the form of angle stack, or constant offset-to-depth ratio, gathers. Prestack synthetic seismograms are obtained by primaries-only ray tracing using the linearized approximation to the Zoeppritz equations to model the reflection amplitudes. Where the a priori assumptions hold, the data are reproduced with a single parameter Ro. Hydrocarbons are detected as low impedance relative to the surrounding shales and the downdip brine-filled reservoir on Ro, also as positive perturbations (opposite polarity relative to Ro) on Δsh and ΔRρ. The maximum perturbation in ΔRsh, from the normal-incidence shearwave reflection coefficient predicted by the a priori assumptions is 0.08. Hydrocarbon detection is achieved, although the overall seismic response of a gas-filled thin layer shows a decrease in amplitude with offset (angle). The angle-stack data (70 prestack ensembles, 0.504-1.936 s time range) are reproduced with a data residual that is 7 dB down. Reflectivity-based prestack seismograms properly model a gas/water contact as a strong increase in AVO and a gas-filled thin layer as a decrease in AVO.",,"Acoustic wave reflection; Approximation theory; Differential equations; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Perturbation techniques; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoirs; Seismic waves; Seismographs; Statistical methods; Amplitude variation with offset (AVO); Compressional waves; Gardner's equation; Hydrocarbon detection; Linear prestack seismic inversion; Mudrock curve; Prediction error parameters; Reflection coefficient; Zoeppritz equation; Seismic prospecting; AVO; hydrocarbon; inversion; mudstone; seismic reflection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030291060

Caring ability was quantified with the Caring Ability Inventory. Maternal and paternal care were measured with the Parental Bonding Instrument. School climate was measured on the Charles F. Kettering School Climate Inventory. There is no linear correlation between level of maternal or paternal care and subsequent caring ability (r= -.01 and 0.01, respectively). However, a curvilinear relationship exists: Those with higher caring are respondents who scored both at the highest and the lowest levels of maternal care. Moreover, levels of caring within nursing schools appear to moderate caring ability developed at home. A caring school climate is the strongest predictor of caring ability (r = 0.16, P < .01). Thus, it is of concern to note that only 52 per cent of the respondents rated their schools high in caring. Caring is a valued attribute in professional nursing. If this quality is to flourish, it must be cultivated within the climate of nursing schools that exert a major professional socializing influence on future nurses. Copyright © 1996 by W.B.

The crystals of good optical quality, were investigated using optical spectroscopy with the aim to assess their potential interest as laser materials in the 1.5 μAm (Er: CAS) and 1 μm (Yb:CAS) range, respectively. In both cases, absorption, siimulated emission, and gain cross sections were determined. Radiative and experimental lifetimes were also calculated. In the two compounds, as the two levels involved in the transitions are the ground and first excited states, radiation trapping and energy migration occur. For Er:CAS, emission around 1.55 μm (in the middle of the eye-safe range) may be obtained for a reasonable value of the population inversion ratio β(β = 0.4). The Judd-Ofelt parameters are significantly higher than those of Er:YAG and the nonradiative relaxation of the excited states located above 4I13/2 is fast (phonon energy cut-off around 1020cm-1) ensuring efficient population of the 4I13/2 emitting level. For Yb:CAS, the absorption and emission cross sections are higher than for Er:CAS. Positive gain cross section is possible for very low β values, for instance β= 0.04 at 1045 nm. Taking into account the pump saturation intensity and the β value, it appears that this compound should be one of the best ytterbium activated laser crystal (if one excepts the apatite-type hosts).",,"Aluminum compounds; Crystal growth; Crystal impurities; Silicates; Single crystals; Solid state lasers; Aluminosilicates; Laser materials; Optical materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030144724

We evaluated 24 patients prospectively who had rising serum CEA 6–19 months after initial surgery for colorectal carcinoma. Ten patients had lesions confirmed by computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic examination or barium enema. Fourteen patients had negative findings on one or more of the above studies, but were suspected of having occult disease from their rising serum CEA. All patients were scheduled for surgery for restaging during a 'second look' procedure. Planar and single photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging was performed in all patients. All scintigraphic findings were correlated with surgical and histopathological results. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 81,90 and 86% respectively when analysed by lesion, and 95, 60 and 88% respectively when analysed by patient. Ten of 14 (71%) patients with occult disease were correctly diagnosed as having recurrent disease. The SPET images were shown to have superior detectability (80%) compared with the planar images (35%). The surgeon judged the study to have had a neutral impact in 75% of the patients, but to have been helpful in 25%. We conclude that this antibody is potentially useful in detecting recurrent colorectal carcinoma in patients with rising serum CEA, especially when conventional imaging is negative or equivocal.

Our results indicate substantial enhancement of NO in the high latitude winter mesosphere extending from thermospheric altitudes down to about 55-60 km. We also see evidence of substantial equatorward mixing of mesospheric NO. Occasional enhancements of NOx are seen extending down into the upper stratosphere in winter; however, they do not appear to persist. Observations by HALOE at latitudes up to 75-80 degrees in early spring show no evidence for enhanced NOx.

In this study, the UAM has been applied to investigate the sensitivity of ozone predictions to the choices in wind fields and mixing height profiles for the data-sparse New York metropolitan area. A set of three wind fields, in combination with spatially varying and spatially invariant mixing heights, is investigated for the July 1988 ozone episode. In general, model-predicted ozone levels were higher under the spatially varying mixing height (SVM) option than under the spatially invariant mixing height (SIM) option. SVM-based UAM simulations provided better agreement between the predicted and measured ozone concentrations than SIM-based UAM simulations. However, from the regulatory standpoint, predicted ozone concentrations based on either of these mixing height options are within the range considered as acceptable. UAM simulations with emission reductions of 75% NO(x) and 25% VOCs (NO(x)-focused) reveal that the improvement in peak ozone levels under the SIM option is larger than that under the SVM option, whereas the emission reduction scenario of 25% NO(x) and 75% VOCs (VOC-focused) yields greater improvement in peak ozone under the SVM option than with the SIM option. Given the strong influence of mixing heights and wind fields on UAM model predictions in data-sparse areas, it is imperative that uncertainties in development of ozone abatement plans be quantified.","Meteorological inputs; Ozone control; UAM","ozone; air monitoring; air quality control; conference paper; meteorology; model; photochemistry; prediction; priority journal; United States; urban area; wind; mixing height; ozone control; urban airshed model; wind field; USA, New York, New York; Air pollution control; Computer simulation; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Ozone; Meteorological measurement; Metropolitan area; Ozone abatement; Ozone control; Uncertainties; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030174776

Many of these TCMs are aimed at commute trips (i.e., trips from home to work and back). A number of techniques are used to analyze the TCMs. Models use home-based work (HBW) trip tables as input; these consist of the trip from home to work and the trip from work to home, which account for 25 to 30 percent of all trips in a region. However, analysis of the Home Interview Survey data for Washington, D.C., indicates a large number of the nonwork trips were actually taking place either as part of the trip from home to work or from work to home, or during the workday. If a TCM is analyzed using only the HBW trip table, it is implicitly assumed that there will be no impact on the trip from home to work with an intermediate stop. However, it is possible that the TCM could alter the behavior of the person making the home-to-work trip with an intermediate stop. If this is not accounted for, the results of the analysis underestimate the impact of the TCM. Research undertaken for two distinct but related subjects is summarized. The amount of work-related nonwork travel in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region is estimated, and the methodology developed to account for the effect of TCMs on total work is described.",,"Air pollution control; Highway administration; Parameter estimation; Traffic control; Traffic surveys; Urban planning; Mobile source emission reduction; Transportation control measures (TCM); Motor transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030182605

Visible remains of fulachta fia on Clare Island frequently show a characteristic horseshoe-shaped structure at the surface, covered by a very thin layer of topsoil. Magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity surveys over two intact fulachta fia were carried out in order to map their lateral and vertical extent. The magnetic susceptibility surveys provided horseshoe-shaped signatures, which immediately identify the extent and orientation of both the surveyed monuments. The success of the resistivity method was found to be dependant upon the proximity of unwanted sources of resistivity variation not related to these archaeological targets, and possibly climatological and method-related influences. These results illustrate the feasibility of using geophysical methods to define a characteristic signature related to fulachta fia. The reproduction of this signature over suspected archaeological sites can provide confirmation of the existence of a monument without the need for an intrusive excavation. Resistivity surveys over two damaged fulachta fia partially exposed in the bank of a drainage channel have revealed useful information on the degree of preservation of these monuments.

We have investigated the hypothesis that the warm climate of the early Eocene may have been caused by higher-than-present levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). We have used an atmospheric general circulation model, the NCAR GENESIS model, coupled to a land surface model and a mixed layer ocean, to examine the sensitivity of early Eocene climate to varying levels of atmospheric CO2. Model cases contained a description of the early Eocene Earth and included either 300, 560, or 1680 ppm atmospheric CO2. Climate responses to increased atmospheric CO2 include (1) increased mean annual global temperature by 2-6°C, and decreased latitudinal surface temperature gradients; (2) maximum warming at high latitudes, especially in the winter season; (3) increased mean global precipitation; (4) increased high latitude clouds. In comparison with geological paleoclimate data, the climate response to increased CO2 does not appear to explain completely the early Eocene latitudinal surface temperature gradient; for example, with the 1680 ppm CO2 case, high latitude oceans and continents are minimally warm enough to match paleoclimate data, while low latitude regions are overly warm when compared to sea surface temperature reconstructions. We conclude that CO2 was very likely at least double the present level during the early Eocene and contributed to the overall character of early Eocene climate. However, consideration of increased poleward oceanic heat transport and/or other factors, may be required to produce model results that more closely agree with marine and terrestrial paleoclimate data, especially at low latitudes. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances. Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen. The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.",,"abyssal plain; carbon; carbon cycling; continental shelf; continental slope; cycling; depth; diagenesis; mineralization; model; nitrogen; nitrogen cycling; oxygen; oxygen cycling; sediment chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029751874

The van der Waals molecules are formed when a mixture of CO2 and Ar gases is expanded in a supersonic slit jet. To probe the clusters, the ν3 asymmetric stretch of the CO2 monomer is then monitored in absorption. Sixty-one trimer transitions are assigned and fit to a Watson asymmetric top Hamiltonian. Rotational constants for the upper and lower vibrational states permit determination of vibrationally averaged molecular structures, which indicate that the Ar atoms lie in the plane that bisects CO2 and is perpendicular to the CO2 intramolecular axis. These geometries are consistent with an equivalent ""T-shaped"" ArCO2 geometry for each Ar atom. Vibrational origins for the ν3 CO2 asymmetric stretch frequency in ArnCO2 are found to shift approximately linearly for zero, one, and two Ar atoms. Calculations using pair potentials are used to extrapolate these red shifts out to the bulk phase and to compare the results to experimental matrix data. Finally, the slight nonliriearity in the red shift between ArCO2 dimer and Ar2CO2 trimers is interpreted in the context of three-body forces. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011136569

In the low-temperature regime (T≤50 K), radiative recombination dominates the decay of the excitonic luminescence. The low-temperature lifetime as well as the increase of the lifetime with temperature are strongly well-width dependent, due to the correlation between the exciton binding energy and the radiative lifetime. At high temperatures, a decrease of the lifetime and of the photoluminescence intensity is observed that depends on the well width and the Mg content in the barrier. By analyzing transient photoluminescence spectra, carrier capture and thermal emission were studied. Within the first picoseconds after the excitation, the carriers are distributed between the quantum wells by a fast capture process.

Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is the most commonly used fuel oxygenate and is a relatively new gasoline additive. Nevertheless, out of 60 volatile organic chemicals analyzed, MTBE was the second most frequently detected chemical in samples of shallow ambient groundwater from urban areas that were collected during 1993-1994 aspart of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment program. Samples were collected from five drinking water wells, 12 springs, and 193 monitoring wells in urban areas. No MTBE was detected in drinking water wells. At a reporting level of 0.2 μg/L, MTBE was detected most frequently in shallow groundwater from urban areas (27% of 210 wells and springs sampled in eight areas) as compared to shallow groundwater from agricultural areas (1.3% of 549 wells sampled in 21 areas) or deeper groundwater from major aquifers (1.0% of 412 wells sampled in nine areas). Only 3% of the shallow wells sampled in urban areas had concentrations of MTBE that exceed 20 μg/L, which is the estimated lower limit of the United States Environmental Protection Agency draft drinking water health advisory. Because MTBE is persistent and mobile in groundwater, it can move from shallow to deeper aquifers with time. In shallow urban groundwater, MTBE generally was not found with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylene (BTEX) compounds, which commonly are associated with gasoline spills. This disassociation causes uncertainty as to the source of MTBE. Possible sources of MTBE in groundwater include point sources, such as leaking storage tanks, and non-point sources, such as recharge of precipitation and stormwater runoff.",,"drinking water; gasoline; ground water; tert butyl methyl ether; well water; aquifer; article; rural area; united states; urban area; fuel additive; groundwater pollution; MTBE; pollution source; urban area; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029662889

Characterization of the air pollutants demonstrated unusually high concentrations during winter inversions of fine particles dominated by acidic sulfates, genotoxic organic compounds, and toxic trace elements. The major source of airborne fine particle is the burning of coal for heating and power. Human exposure and biomarker studies demonstrated large seasonal variations in air pollution within the Teplice District and higher seasonal average pollution levels than the comparative district, Prachatice. Personal exposures to fine particles and organic carcinogens [e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)] were correlated with excretion of PAH metabolites in urine, several trace metals in blood, and DNA adducts in while blood cells. Respiratory and neurobehavioral studies of school children were conducted using questionnaires and clinical measures. A significantly higher prevalence of adverse respiratory symptoms and decreased lung function were found in the Teplice district than in Prachatice. The neurobehavioral studies indicated significantly higher teacher referrals for clinical assessment in Teplice, but the majority of objective performance measures did not differ. Reproductive studies were conducted in both males and females. A study of the effects of exposure on pregnancy and birth found an excess prevalence of low birth weight and premature births in Teplice; these adverse effects were more common in infants conceived in the winter and whose mothers were smokers. Based on questionnaires and medical examination, the reproductive development of young men was not different between districts and seasons, however, measures of semen quality suggest that exposure to high levels of air pollution are associated with transient decrements in semen quality.","Air pollution; Air toxics; Biomarkers; Coal combustion; Czech Republic; Eastern Europe; Lung function; Neurobehavioral effects; Particulate matter; Personal exposure; Pregnancy outcome; Reproductive effects; Respiratory effects; Semen quality","biological marker; carcinogen; coal; organic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfate; trace element; air pollution; blood level; comparative study; Czech Republic; DNA adduct; health; health program; heating; human; leukocyte; low birth weight; lung function; nervous system function; particulate matter; performance; pregnancy; prematurity; priority journal; questionnaire; reproduction; respiratory tract disease; review; seasonal variation; smoking; sperm; urinary excretion; winter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842363849

Procedures, based on their use as radiotracers for nuclear medicine imaging and for radiotherapy of cancer and other pathology, have become firmly established as important clinical modalities. It is estimated that on an annual basis in the United States alone, radionuclides are used medically in over 13 million imaging procedures, in over 100 million laboratory tests, and in an ever increasing number (&gt; 100,000) for therapeutic administrations. One out of every four hospital patients undergoes a procedure that involves the use of radionuclides. Diagnostic imaging methods using planar/single-photon emission computed tomography and positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging, as well as the measurement of in vivo organ function, physiology, or biochemistry, have become indispensable tools in patient workup and management. More than 80% of all imaging studies (mostly anatomic) currently use technetium-99m (99mTc), because it has turned out to be the ideal isotope from various considerations. However, over the past few years, nuclear medicine has experienced a slow but steady evolution towards functional studies, quantitative PET imaging, and novel therapeutic approaches. New radionuclides are required for these applications, and their development has attracted considerable interest. This article reviews the current status and future prospects for the development of many new potential isotopes. Practical issues, such as the feasibility of large-scale production and widespread availability in a continuous reliable fashion, are addressed. To date, the data are not sufficient to answer the question as to whether any of these radionuclides (or their applications, for that matter) will eventually assume as broad-based a role as that of To. Nonetheless, there are a number of promising radionuclides that could assume an important place in the future practice of nuclear medicine. Copyright © 1996 by W.B.

After the draft release, the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) proposed to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the replacement of the certification standard measure with a program for the accelerated retirement of HDDVs. WSPA's proposal was based on modeling conducted to determine the potential emissions benefits and cost effectiveness associated with early retirement programs. Parsons Engineering Science (Parsons ES) was contracted by the California and American Trucking Associations to review the emissions reduction benefits for the draft measures in the SIP, the HDDV retirement program assumptions and estimates by WSPA, and to model alternative HDDV retirement programs. A spreadsheet-based emissions model was developed which integrated the CARB's EMFAC/BURDEN7F modeling procedures with the effects of accelerated vehicle retirement and any new California and/or national NOx certification standards. The model allowed factors such as VMT estimates, historic fleet turnover, California/out-of-state VMT proportion, introduction years of lower California and/or national NOx standards, retirement program start dates and replacement rates, and vehicle population to be easily changed. Modeling was conducted with various combinations of new vehicle emissions standards and replacement program assumptions. Results of the modeling showed that the predicted outcome of an accelerated retirement program is highly dependent on the assumptions used for vehicle replacement. The emissions benefits and cost effectiveness of the program increase significantly as the start is delayed because of replacement with vehicles meeting a lower new vehicle standard.

These reactions model the microscopic reverse of C-H activation by aqueous Pt(II). Each of the four systems (2 in CD3OD, 5 in CD2Cl2, 11 in CD3OD, and 15 in CD3OD) exhibits different behavior in the protonolysis reaction as observed by low-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy. Protonolysis of 2 in methanol-d4 proceeds with no observable intermediates. Reversible reaction between 5 and HCl in CD2Cl2 at -78°C produces (tmeda)Pt(CH2Ph)(H)Cl2 (6), which undergoes reductive elimination of toluene at higher temperatures. Treatment of 11 with HCl in methanol at -78°C generates (tmeda)PtMe2(H)Cl (12), which incorporates deuterium from solvent (CD3OD) into the methyl groups prior to reductive elimination of methane. Finally, 15 reacts with H+ in methanol to liberate methane with no intermediates observed. However, hydrogen/deuterium exchange takes place between the solvent (CD3OD) and Pt-Me prior to methane loss. Each of these reactions was evaluated further to determine the kinetics of the reaction, activation parameters, and isotope effects. Based on the results, a common mechanistic sequence is proposed to operate in all the reactions: (1) chloride- or solvent-mediated protonation of Pt(II) to generate an alkylhydridoplatinum(IV) intermediate, (2) dissociation of solvent or chloride to generate a cationic, five-coordinate platinum(IV) species, (3) reductive C-H bond formation producing a platinum(II) alkane σ-complex, and (4) loss of alkane either through an associative or dissociative substitution pathway.

The models were produced with the spectral energy distribution from a stellar evolutionary synthesis code as input for a photoionization code that computes the emission-line strengths and equivalent widths. Stellar evolution was assumed to proceed according to the models of Maeder. The radiation field was computed using the Kurucz model atmospheres, supplemented by the expanding non-LTE atmospheres of Schmutz et al. for stellar evolutionary phases with strong winds, making a significant improvement over previous works using classical static, plane-parallel model atmospheres. Models for stellar interiors and atmospheres being still in a phase of continuous improvement, our population synthesis models reflect the state of the art in 1995. The models were used to analyze a sample of 100 H II galaxies for which both the Hβ equivalent widths and the [O III] λ4363 line intensities were available (the latter allowing a direct determination of the oxygen abundances based on measured electron temperatures). Because of these selection criteria, the results of our study are restricted to metal-poor objects with metallicities less than about one-half solar. The confrontation of models with observations is presented in six diagnostic diagrams involving hydrogen and oxygen lines. Our approach is in many respects much more constraining for the models than previous studies on H II regions ionized by evolving starbursts. We found that the standard starburst model (instantaneous burst of star formation with a Salpeter initial mass function and an upper cutoff mass of 100 M⊙) reproduces the observational constraints provided by the nebular emission lines extremely well if selection effects are taken into account. Models with a unique initial mass function are consistent with essentially all observational constraints over a metallicity range from ∼0.025 to ∼0.25 Z⊙. In contrast, models with a Salpeter-type initial mass function truncated at 50 M⊙ are not consistent with the observations: they violate the observed distribution of Hβ equivalent widths. The mean effective temperature of the ionizing star cluster declines from about 50,000 to 40,000 K during the time when the line [O III] λ14363 is strong enough to be measurable. Within the framework of our models, and in the abundance range where comparisons were made with observations, there is no significant evidence for a variation of the star cluster mean effective temperature with metallicity, other than the one generated by the metallicity-dependent stellar atmospheric and evolutionary models. A very narrow range in ionization parameters is required to reproduce the observed line ratios. This should set limits on the dynamical evolution of giant H II regions. We find a large fraction of H II galaxies having [O I] λ6300/Hβ ratios larger than 0.02. Even models with the lowest ionization parameters considered do not produce these large ratios. An approximate estimate of the mechanical energy released by winds and supernovae during later phases of the starburst leads to the suggestion that the [O I] λ6300/Hβ ratio - in contrast to other line ratios studied - is significantly affected by shocks. The small spread in the free parameters necessary to reproduce the emission-line properties of metalpoor H II galaxies allows us to propose a new indicator of the starburst age: the [O III] λ5007 equivalent width is quite robust and can be used up to larger ages than the traditional Hβ equivalent width for high signal-to-noise spectra. This indicator should also prove useful for low signal-to-noise spectra of star-forming galaxies at higher redshift, because of the large value of [O III] λ15007/Hβ in starbursts younger than 5 Myr.","Abundances - ISM; Galaxies; H II regions; ISM - galaxies; Starburst - galaxies; Stellar content - ISM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043140256

Our objective is to estimate the detectability of IR emission from debris created by collisions. We find that eccentricities in the Kuiper Disk are high enough to promote erosion on virtually all objects up to ∼ 30 km, independent of their impact strength. Larger objects, such as the 50-170 km radius ""QB1"" population, will suffer net erosion if their orbital eccentricity is greater than ≈ 0.05 (≈ 0.1) if they are structurally weak (strong). Our model predicts a net collisional erosion rate from all objects out to 50 AU ranging from 3 × 1016 to 1019g yr-1, depending on the mass, population structure, and mechanical properties of the objects in the Disk. We find two kinds of collisional signatures that this debris should generate. First, there should be a relatively smooth, quasi-steady-state, longitudinally isotropic, far IR (i.e, ∼ 60 μm peak) emission near the ecliptic in the solar system's invariable plane ecliptic, caused by debris created by the ensemble of ancient collisions. The predicted optical depth of this emission could be as low as 7 × 10-8, but is most likely between 3 × 10-7 and 5 × 10-6. We find that this signature was most likely below IRAS detection limits, but that it should be detectable by both ISO and SIRTF. Second, very recent impacts in the disk should produce short-lived, discrete clouds with significantly enhanced, localized IR emission signatures superimposed on the smooth, invariable plane emission. These discrete clouds should have angular diameters up to 0.2 deg, and annual parallaxes up to 2.6 degrees. Individual expanding clouds (or trails) should show significant temporal evolution over timescales of a few years. As few as zero or as many as several 102 such clouds may be detectable in a complete ecliptic survey at ISO's sensitivity, depending on the population structure of the Kuiper Disk.","Infrared: solar system; Interplanetary medium; Minor planets, asteroids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000677726

One option for achieving this reduced emission limit is to use a more reactive reagent in the existing wet scrubbing system. To test this option, TMPA and Chemical Lime Company developed a test plan to compare the performance of limestone, the design reagent, to the more reactive reagents, limestone + dibasic acids(DBA) and magnesium- containing lime(Mg-lime). The independent variables, L/G, pH, and Mg++ or DBA concentration, were set at three different levels with each of the reagents to determine their effects on SO2 removal, removal efficiency in each scrubber module, and reagent utilization. The tests show that limestone alone could not attain the emission limit of 0.85 lb/Btu under any conditions. Both limestone + DBA and Mg-lime could reduce emissions to 0.85 lb/mmBtu under some conditions. The DBA tests were run at lower SO2 inlet levels than the Mg-lime tests, and it is doubtful that DBA could meet the emission limit if SO2 inlet concentrations had been as high as in the Mg-lime tests. Whereas, the Mg-Lime at magnesium levels of 3000 ppm could easily meet the emission limit. Mg-Lime achieved removal efficiencies of >90% when magnesium levels were 3000 ppm. Increasing pH level to 7.5 resulted in removal efficiencies of >99%. Limestone + DBA gave removal efficiencies of >90% when DBA concentrations were 400 ppm. To get 99% removal, the DBA level had to be increased to 2000 ppm.",,"Acids; Agents; Gas emissions; Limestone; Magnesium compounds; Performance; pH; Removal; Scrubbers; Steam power plants; Sulfur dioxide; Testing; Dibasic acids; Emission limit; Reagents; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030315739

The emission of NO was parameterized using empirical relationships with type of landuse, fertilization rate of agricultural areas and soil temperature. For the year 1994, it was estimated that annual soil NO emissions in the inventoried area amounted to 535 kt NO-N yr-1, i.e. 8% of the emissions from combustion processes. On a hot summer day, this fraction increased to 27%. The uncertainty of these emission estimates, however, is high. They are accurate only within a factor of three to four. As the major fraction (in summer 81%) of the emissions came from arable land, soil NO emissions have to be considered as largely anthropogenic. Large regional differences existed in the soil NO emission rates with the highest emission rates found in southern and western Europe, intermediate rates in eastern Europe and the lowest rates in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The effect of the soil NO emissions on the photochemical formation of ozone (O3) was investigated with a one-dimensional photochemical model. When soil NO emissions were considered in the model simulations, computed mean daily maximum O3 concentrations over Europe from June to August 1994 were 4 ppb (uncertainty range: 1.4-9.6 ppb) higher than without these emissions. Reductions of pyrogenic NO(x) emissions were less efficient in reducing O3 concentrations when soil NO emissions were taken into account.","Emission inventory; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone formation; Photochemistry; Soil NO emissions","fertilizer; nitric oxide; ozone; agriculture; air monitoring; article; Europe; geographic distribution; land use; model; photochemistry; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil; soil pollution; summer; emission inventory; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone formation; photochemistry; soil emission; Europe; Air pollution; Combustion; Effects; Estimation; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Probability; Soils; Synthesis (chemical); Emission inventory; Europe; Nitric oxide; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302224

A scientific theme ""Exploring Mars as another home for life: past, present and future"" is proposed to provide a focus for the science strategy. There are two major science goals within this theme: (1) determine the relationship between planetary evolution, climate change and life, and (2) determine the habitability of Mars and its suitability for future human settlement. The space and time scales required for Mars exploration are discussed. Human exploration of Mars will be effective only if we can perform detailed science investigations of a variety of globally-distributed sites over a period of decades. A strategy for achieving this range of mobility consists of at least three parts: (1) local mobility supported by spacesuits and low-mass ""dune-buggy"" style piloted rovers, (2) regional mobility in field excursions supported by live-in ""motor-home"" style piloted rovers, and (3) global mobility supported by teleoperated robotic rovers placed in widely-distributed areas on Mars. The time scales of Mars exploration suggest that missions with long surface stay times are needed, and that science can best be performed when staged from a permanent Mars base. Telepresence operation of remotely operated robotic vehicles will be used in all phases of exploration to expand the range and the capabilities of human crews on Mars, and to provide access to information and the exploration experience to scientists, students and the general public on Earth. Site selection for a Mars base must be viewed in a regional context. The Coprates Quadrangle and adjacent areas is proposed as a geographical area of Mars which could be the focus of Mars exploration activities and provide a rich scientific return over a period of decades. The science questions and activities motivated by the science theme in the areas of geoscience, atmospheric science, exobiology, and habitability are described in detail for the precursor and human exploration phases of the program.

These types of engines will operate at lean A/F ratios during cruising at partial load and return to stoichiometric or even rich conditions when more power is required. The challenge for the engine and catalyst manufacturer is to develop a system which will combine the high activity rates of a state-of-the-art three way catalyst (TWC) with the ability to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) under excess of oxygen. The target is to achieve the future legislation limits (EURO III/IV) in the European Union. Recent developments in automotive pollution control catalysis have shown that the utilization of NOx adsorption materials is a suitable way for reduction of NOx emissions of gasoline fueled lean burn engines. However, the primary task for the implementation of this technology in the European market will be to improve the high temperature stability and to decrease the susceptibility to sulfur poisoning. The present paper outlines results of a recent research and development program to achieve nitrogen oxide reduction under lean burn gasoline engine conditions. Model gas test results as well as engine bench data are used for discussion of the parameters which control NOx adsorption efficiency under various conditions. It is shown that the NOx adsorption technology enables an efficient removal of NOx up to 85% over a wide temperature range even at high NO x inlet concentrations. The major part of the paper is dedicated to the problem of sulfur poisoning under laboratory and engine operation conditions. The relationship between the uptake of poisons such as sulfur and phosphorus and the activity results is reported. It is demonstrated that relatively small amounts of adsorbed sulfur might cause a severe overproportional suppression of NOx storage activity. Regarding this, fundamental studies using various physicochemical and spectroscopic methods such as BET-surface area measurements, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), inductive coupled plasma (ICP) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were performed to elucidate the nature of sulfur deposition on the NOx storage catalyst. Some evidence exists that at short time-on-stream the SO3 reacts preferably with the NOx adsorbents by forming surface sulfate species which block off the active sites of the adsorbents for further NO x adsorption. However, by treating the, sulfur poisoned NO x storage catalysts with hydrogen the equivalent activity of the fresh catalyst can be restored. The results obtained by thermogravimetrical analyses coupled to a mass spectrometer (TG-MS) show that high concentrations of hydrogen bring about high levels of H2S and little SO2 whereas low concentrations of hydrogen preferably lead to increased SO 2 emissions at expense of H2S. Another subject reported in detail is the progress made recently concerning improved sulfur tolerance of the technology by applying a sulfur trap mounted upstream to the NOx storage catalyst. The concept of the sulfur trap provides the periodical adsorption of SO3 whenever the exhaust is adjusted lean and the decomposition and emission of the sulfur as SO2 when the engine management provides the rich spikes. One target was to avoid the generation of H2S during the rich periods. Aided by the utilization of ion molecular reaction mass spectroscopy (IMR-MS) the general ability of the sulfur trap to function could be confirmed at different engine operating points and temperature levels. It is demonstrated that in the presence of sulfur a significant improvement in NOx activity retention by additionally applying the sulfur trap is feasible. © 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Adsorption; Automobile manufacture; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Digital storage; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Exhaust gases; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Hydrogen storage; Ion engines; Mass spectrometry; Pollution control; Spectrometers; Spectroscopic analysis; Sulfur compounds; X rays; BET surface area measurement; Catalyst manufacturers; Energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX); High temperature stability; Inductive coupled plasma; Lean burn gasoline engine; Nitrogen oxide reduction; Wide temperature ranges; Nitrogen oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072474648

However, the effort required to implement Title V varies widely according to the provisions of existing permitting programs. A significant concern raised in California and other areas, is the fact that new regulations and source-specific requirements have been imposed on sources without consideration of the fact that pre-existing requirements are still in force. Thus there are sources subject to old standards with higher emission limits, such as NSPS, that are also subject to more stringent emission standards in local rules or source-specific BACT determinations. The result: 1) applicants must certify compliance with extraneous compliance-related provisions that have no relation to the actual emission standard that must be achieved; and 2) Title V operating permits must include redundant layers of applicable requirements. Title V prompts us to take a facility-wide look at operations and applicable requirements in the present, and revisit the entire permit every five years. This effort, though extensive, may actually provide an opportunity to clear away old, redundant and useless requirements. This would relieve sources from liability for compliance with inappropriate terms and conditions. California agencies, working closely with EPA, have developed a streamlining method to resolve programmatic inconsistencies for Title V sources.",,"Laws and legislation; Particulate emissions; Societies and institutions; Standards; Streamlining method; Title V permitting program; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030313925

Measurements of wet deposition were made with rain samplers between Stolberg and the town of Julich to the north-east during the period August 1991-May 1992. Analysis of rainwater after filtration in the rain sampler comprised heavy metal concentrations in the residue as well as heavy metal in the filtrate. Conclusions were drawn from the regional distribution of deposition data and statistical factor analysis. Experimental results on deposition show that in the case of Pb, wet deposition by particulate matter prevails for the emittent at Stolberg-Binsfeldhammer as far as the station at Stolberg-Werth. In the case of Cd, deposition of Cd dissolved in rainwater dominates. Cadmium and Pb compounds analyzed have total concentrations in the rain sampler which are smaller than their respective solubilities. It is concluded that in the stationary state, Cd and Pb must have an insoluble status on the particulate matter. In the case of Pb, elemental Pb could also be responsible for the relatively large amount of Pb adsorbed on solid particles. From the relative contribution of metal deposition on particulate matter and in filtered rainwater in the vicinity of the emitter, there were higher dispersion rates of the particulate matter studied in comparison with the heavy metal species in filtered rainwater. Statistical factor analysis of Cd and Pb wet deposition in the region investigated revealed the ranking of the influencing factors as: particulate matter dispersion and scavenging, rainfall conditions, dispersion of heavy metals dissolved in rainwater as well as emission of heavy metals. Factor analysis of metal concentrations in the residue and proton concentration in the filtrate showed the course of the metal dissolution process throughout dispersion.","atmospheric dispersion; cadmium; factor analysis; lead; particulate matter; rainwater","cadmium; lead; rain; air pollution; article; chemistry; controlled study; factorial analysis; Germany; pollution transport; priority journal; atmospheric dispersion; atmospheric pollution; cadmium; lead; rainwater; wet deposition; Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, Stolberg; Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, Stolberg-Binsfeldhammer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663335

These adaptations are generally discussed at either the sectoral or at the micro-economic level. However, little has been said about the macro-economic adaptation to shifts in water resources due to climate change. This lack of discussion is primarily due to the fact that very few countries have been able to make a comprehensive national assessment of climate change impacts on water resources at the same scale as a macro-economic modelling analysis. Where macro-economic modelling has been done, the water resource systems are highly regional and difficult to aggregate to a single national impact. Where homogenous water resources systems exist, macro-economic impact modelling has not incorporated water resources. This paper examines the macro-economic adaptations to climate change impacts on national water resources. Because of the problems listed above, a 'laboratory' country was chosen. Egypt has a single water resource - the Nile - and a substantial portion of Egypt's economic activity is related to this river. Changes in Nile discharges can be directly linked to macro-economic accounts, yet obviously more strongly linked to the agricultural sector. For this reason, a macro-economic model has been used which contains a disaggregated agricultural sector and a highly aggregated non-agricultural sector. A discussion of technical adaptations to climate change-induced reductions in Nile flows is presented. While these technical adaptations of the Nile are important, the macro-economic impacts of decreases or increases in Nile River discharge are shown to be minor compared with future socioeconomic development and domestic policy strategies. The paper concludes with a discussion of anticipatory economic and policy adaptations that appear to be more significant than technical adaptations for Egypt.",,"Agriculture; Climate change; Computer simulation; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Gases; Geographical regions; Mathematical models; Numerical analysis; Public policy; Climet change impacts; Disaggregated agricultural sector; Economic and social adaptations; Egypt; Macro economic impact modelling; Micro economic level; Nile; Socioeconomic development; Water resources exploration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030173172

Otter trawls were taken at 12 sites: 4 cross-shore transects with 3 depths (23, 61, and 137 m). Dominant soft-bottom demersal fish were Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), stripetail rockfish (Sebastes saxicola), slender sole (Eopsetta exilis), Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus), plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus), yellowchin sculpin (Icelinus quadriseriatus), and speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus). Spatial and temporal abundance patterns are reviewed for 28 representative species. Two decades of dynamic environmental conditions off Palos Verdes are documented. Specific factors causing fluctuations in fish catches cannot be determined. However, water depth greatly influences distributions, and major temperature shifts and associated biological changes correlate strongest with temporal variations. The extreme 1982-83 El Niño event created the largest changes in community composition. Reduced mass emissions of suspended solids and contaminants from the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts' submarine outfall system contributed to declining sediment contamination, kelp bed expansion, increased food resource diversity, and greater water clarity. Environmental changes associated with improved wastewater quality stimulated recovery of demersal fish assemblages. Annual incidence of fin erosion in Dover sole at the outfall station decreased from over 50% in the early 1970s to zero since the mid- to late 1980s.

To identify sites within NR protein that play a role in this post-translational regulation, a heterologous expression system and an in vitro inactivation assay for Arabidopsis NR were developed. Protein extracts containing NR kinases and inhibitor proteins were prepared from an NR-defective mutant that had lesions in both the NIA1 and NIA2 NR genes of Arabidopsis. Active NR protein was produced in a Pichia pastoris expression system. Incubation of these two preparations resulted in a Mg-ATP-dependent inactivation of NR that was reversed with EDTA. Mutant forms of NR were constructed, produced in P. pastoris, and tested in the in vitro inactivation assay. Six conserved serine residues in the hinge 1 region of NR, which separates the molybdenum cofactor and heme domains, were specifically targeted for mutagenesis because they are located in a potential regulatory region identified as a target for NR kinases in spinach. A change in Ser-534 to aspartate was found to block NR inactivation; changes in the other five serines had no effect. The aspartate that replaced Ser-534 did not appear to mimic a phosphorylated serine but simply prevented the NR from being inactivated.

Two hydrophobic sites, with indicated affinities for the probe, were identified on factor VIII (K(d) = 0.2 and 1.22 μM), the isolated heavy chain (HC; K(d) = 0.21 and 1.44 μM), and light chain (LC; K(d) = 0.04 and 0.22 μM). Comparison of these values and fluorescence emission maxima parameters suggested that the higher affinity site on each isolated subunit contributes to the divalent metal ion- dependent, intersubunit interaction while the two lower affinity sites are retained on the surface of the factor VIII heterodimer. A single bis-ANS site was identified on both the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (K(d) = 0.19 μM) and A2 subunit (K(d) = 0.11 μM), whereas two sites, equivalent to the sites of factor VIII, were observed on factor VIIIa.

Yet the paleomagnetic recorders of this event have remained elusive. Magnetic spherules have been candidates for this role, because they are probably authigenic. Therefore we have studied the hysteresis properties of individual magnetic spherules from two formations, the remagnetized Onondaga (Devonian, New York) and the effectively unremagnetized Wabash (Silurian, Indiana). Also, we have compared the hysteresis properties of spherules to those of remagnetized limestones from the Onondaga, Trenton (Ordovician, New York), and Helderberg (Devonian, New York) formations and from the unremagnetized Wabash formation. The spherules studied here vary from about 20 μm to over 100 μm in diameter. Nevertheless, on the basis of hysteresis behavior this spherule population spans the full range of domain states, from truly multidomain (MD) to pseudo-single-domain (PSD) to single domain (SD). Because these spherules are so large, it is remarkable that more than half display the highly PSD-like behavior typical of many remagnetized carbonate rocks. Equally as remarkable is the lack of dependence on spherule size of various hysteresis properties such as coercive force (Hc), remanent coercive force (Hcr), the ratio of saturation remanence to saturation moment (Mrs/Ms), and the ratio of remanent coercive force to coercive force (Hcr/Hc). These findings dispel the preconception that large spherules are too magnetically soft to be stable carriers of ancient magnetization. Surprisingly, Onondaga and Wabash spherules yield virtually identical suites of hysteresis properties. On the one hand, this high degree of similarity could indicate that spherules are irrelevant to remagnetization. More intriguing, however, is that this similarity could mean that the Wabash formation, although effectively unremagnetized, nevertheless contains magnetic mineralogical traces of a regional remagnetization event. It is significant that for these spherules a bilogarithmic plot of Mrs/Ms versus Hcr/Hc does not define a simple linear trend. Instead, Mrs/Ms increases more rapidly with decreasing Hcr/Hc for spherules in the PSD range than in the MD range. When a power law is fit solely to the hysteresis ratios of PSD-like to SD-like spherules, extrapolation to the SD limit gives Mrs/Ms = 0.75. Similarly, a power law fit to the hysteresis ratios obtained here from remagnetized carbonate rocks yields Mrs/Ms = 0.72 at the SD boundary. These results could indicate that a large percentage of SD-like spherules, like the SD carriers in remagnetized carbonate rocks, are governed by magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Finally, the present data point to values of Hc near 350 Oe both for SD-like spherules and for the SD grains thought to carry remanence in remagnetized carbonates. Clearly, PSD- and SD-like spherules share several key rock magnetic properties with remagnetized carbonate rocks. Thus spherules still are likely candidates for carrying the remagnetization signal.

The effects of combustion chamber design, carburetor design, lean burning, and fuel composition on performance, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were studied. All tested engines had been designed to run richer than stoichiometric in order to obtain satisfactory cooling and higher power. While hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions could be greatly reduced with lean burning, engine durability would be worsened. However, it was shown that the use of a catalytic converter with acceptably lean combustion was an effective method of reducing emissions. Replacing carburetion with in-cylinder fuel injection in one of the engines resulted in a significant reduction of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. However, difficulties with stable operation under transient operations indicated that the combustion chamber should be redesigned for in-cylinder fuel injection. It was shown that acceleration pumps, which are typically used to improve chainsaw engine performance in transient operations, significantly increase HC and CO emissions. On the other hand, oxygenated fuels can reduce those emissions. Overall, a compromise has to be reached between emissions, performance, cost, and durability for a given two-stroke design. © Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon monoxide; Catalytic converters; Combustion chambers; Durability; Fuel injection; Fuels; Carbon monoxide emissions; Engine durability; Engine performance; Fuel compositions; Reducing emissions; Steady state and transients; Transient operation; Two-stroke engine; Hydrocarbons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072427834

In this study, the fuel injection timing was advanced greatly to promote fuel and air mixing. Using this injection method, the engine could be operated with PREmixed lean DIesel Combustion (PREDIC), and NOx emissions were reduced greatly. To avoid collision of the fuel spray with the cylinder liner. the fuel was injected simultaneously with two side injectors.

A total of 910 permanent sample plots established in the course of national forest inventory (NFI) in Finland and located on mineral soil sites in southern Finland were selected as the input data. The climatological input used in the simulations consisted of interpolated means of and deviations from long-term local temperature and precipitation records. The policy oriented climate scenarios of SILMU (Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change) were used to describe the climate change. The temperature changes in the climate scenarios were increases of ca. +1.1°C (low), +4.4°C (medium) and +6.6°C (high) compared to the current climate in 110 years. The simulation period was 110 years covering the time years 1990-2100. Southern Finland, divided into fifteen forestry board districts, was used as the study region. Regional development of stand volume, cutting yield, and total wood production of forests under different climate scenarios were examined. The annual average growth in simulations under current climate was close to that observed in NFI. Forests benefited from a modest temperature increase (Scenario 2), but under Scenario 1the growing stock remained at a lower level than under the current climate in all parts of the study region. In wood production and cutting yield there were regional differences. In the southern part of the study region wood production under Scenario 1 was ca. 10% lower than under the current climate, but in the eastern and western parts wood production was 5-15% higher under Scenario 1 than under the current climate. The relative values of total wood production and cutting yield indicated that the response of forests to climate change varied by geographical location and the magnitude of climate change. This may be a consequence of not just varying climatic (e.g. temperature and precipitation) and site conditions, but of varying responses by different kinds of forests (e.g. forests differing in tree species composition and age).","Climate change; Gap-model; Regional predictions; Simulation","climatic change; forest inventory; gap model; wood production; yield; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030430815

When plane carbon steel reaches the yield point, Lueder's line appear. When stress exceeds yield stress the Lueder's lines change into an orange peel texture. These phenomena are in all cases visible. Therefore it is possible to use the visible change in the appearance of the Lueder's lines that accompanies the increase in loading as a simple device to predict the appearance of cracks. Since the visible surface conditions are used as the predictor, it is unnecessary to use any special instrument. All one has to do is to make the surface that is to be observed flat and smooth. It is an extremely simple technique. Observation was made of the change of state on the flat, smooth surface of a basic material undergoing cyclic loading. Investigation was made of the relation between Stretcher Strains, or the orange peel texture, and the S-N diagram. It was possible to apprehend the process by which the state of the flat, smooth surface changed from the moment that the Stretcher Strains developed until the appearance of cracks. The utilization of the results of this experiment render a concrete example of the possibility of predicting the appearance of cracks by visual observation of stretcher strains.

The emission model assumes a source of magnetohydrodynamical outflow and efficient and fast particle acceleration (most likely mediated by a relativistic shock) in optically thin environments. The properties of the synchrotron shock emission can be derived under general conditions valid for both Galactic or cosmological interpretations of GRB sources. We show that the synchrotron shock model (SSM) predicts a specific shape of the GRB spectral continuum (broad maximum of the vFv spectrum, low-energy continuum with characteristic curvature, high-energy power-law emission) in agreement with recently determined broadband GRB spectra. The calculated spectrum turns out to be a universal two-parameter function in the energy range ∼ 30 keV-1 GeV. The peak photon energy Ep of the GRB vFv spectrum (power per logarithmic photon energy band) is interpreted as the relativistic synchrotron energy of impulsively accelerated particles. From the GRB properties, we obtain a crucial constraint relating the average Lorentz factor of preaccelerated particles γ* and the strength of the local magnetic field Bps at the GRB site (modulo possible Doppler and cosmological factors of order ∼102 and an inverse Compton blueshift factor): 1012 ≲ γ*2Bps ≲ 1014 cgs Hard-to-soft spectral evolution often observed in GRBs can be due to a variation of γ* and Bps as the synchrotron emission evolves within the burst. The burst emissivity depends on the strength of the average magnetic field at the acceleration site, and we derive general relations from among peak intensities, durations, and Ep's of elementary shock emission episodes. In general, a complex burst can be a superposition of different elementary shock emission episodes, and the durations of elementary shock emission episodes τe can tentatively be identified with those of individual GRB pulses. We find that the pulse durations τe have a simple physical meaning. On the contrary, the statistically defined durations T90 and T50 are not suitable for an accurate description of GRB physical processes. The SSM in its simplest realization predicts correlated spectral hardness and burst intensity and an anticorrelation between shock episode durations τe and peak intensities. Both of these characteristics are qualitatively similar to GRB features expected in cosmological models. The determination of the GRB spectral continuum shapes as a function of time is particularly important for testing the shock model proposed here. Under general conditions of emission, the SSM predicts specific patterns of spectral evolution which can be tested. In this paper, we discuss the general properties of the shock emission model, and we leave open the issue of the ultimate origin of the relativistic MHD winds and nature of the outbursts. © 1996.

The revision of the model, ISCST3, was completed in mid 1995. The ISCST3 model is typically used in performing air dispersion modeling analyses of industrial air emission sources to estimate short-term ambient air concentrations for comparison to health based regulatory standards such as National Ambient Air Quality Standards and state regulated air toxics standards. The model is described in more detail in the updated user's guide for the ISCST3 model. Since the ISCST3 model is often used by regulatory agencies to establish emission limitations and operating conditions in a facility's air permit, an analysis was deemed necessary to reevaluate and verify the performance of the ISCST3 model. The ISCST3 model performance evaluation was performed using actual source parameters and emission rates in the model to estimate hourly ground level concentrations for comparison to observed hourly ambient monitoring concentration data. More specifically, the analyses consisted of modeling process operations at a large chemical manufacturing facility located in North Carolina to determine hourly ambient concentrations at two separate receptor locations. These receptor locations correspond to the location of two existing ambient monitoring sites located at the facility fence-line and 6 kilometers from the facility, respectively. The hourly modeled concentrations were used for comparison to the observed monitoring data collected at the two monitoring sites and fractional bias values were calculated for different meteorological categories. The modeling evaluation was performed using 1994 actual emissions data, emission source parameters, on-site meteorological data, and observed ambient monitoring data.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Computer simulation; Dispersions; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Monitoring; Particulate emissions; Performance; Standards; Chemical manufacturing facility; Industrial source complex short term dispersion model; North Carolina; Air pollution control equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030314489

A research framework, consisting of travel simulation models, and energy and emissions factors, was developed for testing land use -transportation scenarios. The travel simulation modelling framework consisted of the four-step approach, including the calibration of trip distribution and modal split models. Fuel consumption and emissions were estimated by using vehicle kilometres of travel. The city of Kanata within the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, Canada, was used as a case study. Five scenarios illustrating possible future employment schemes were developed. Vehicle kilometres, fuel, and emissions for both automobile and public transit were estimated for year 2011 scenarios.

The obtained polymers thus contained a nearly equal weight composition of both soft and hard segments and were prepared as polymer membranes for permeation and sorption of CO2. The properties of the polymer membranes were characterized using a Fourier transform IR spectrophotometer, thermal gravimetric analysis, and rheometric measurement. The permeation and sorption isotherms as a function of temperature and pressure as well as the activation energy of permeability and diffusivity and the enthalpy change of the solution were measured. The test temperatures were carried out above and below the Tgs of soft-segment domains or the Tgh of hard-segment domains. The steady-state permeability (P) and diffusion coefficients (D) obtained ranged from 1.01 to 12.9 barrer and 1.04 to 4.04 cm2/s, respectively, and the solubility coefficients (S), from 0.529 to 3.43 cm3(STP)/cm3 polymer-atm at 10 atm and 35°C. The TEPA-containing polymer membranes showed a smaller P and D but a larger S than did MDEA-containing ones. The membranes comprising PEG-600 exhibit the values of P, D, and S at about 11.5-, 2.5-, and 4.5-fold the PEG-400 ones, respectively. For SPU membranes, above Tgs or Tgh, the pressure dependencies of P followed the modified free-volume model. On the other hand below Tgs, they exhibited a minimum permeability at a certain pressure caused by the plasticization action of sorbed CO2. The sorption isotherms of CO2 indicated that the membranes comprising PEG-400 can be described by a dual-mode sorption model below Tgs. Also, the SPU polymer membranes obied the Henry's law above Tgs as well as Tgh. The characteristic constants of the sorption model were also determined and are discussed. © 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,"Activation energy; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Composition; Diffusion; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Polyethylene glycols; Polyurethanes; Sorption; Spectrophotometers; Thermal effects; Thermogravimetric analysis; Amine contained polyurethane; Diffusion coefficient; Diffusivity; Diphenylmethane diisocyante; Methyldiethanolamine; Permeation; Polyurea urethane membranes; Solubility coefficient; Steady state permeability; Tetraethylenepentamine; Polymeric membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030573384

Although biodegradable, petroleum compounds are the focus of cleanup efforts at tens of thousands of sites throughout the United States. Considerable national effort is being spent to accelerate the cleanup of compounds which eventually degrade. However, without excavation, engineered remedial efforts cannot completely remove residual petroleum hydrocarbons near the water table in the smear zone. At sites that have impacted aquifers of no beneficial use, natural attenuation (NA) with long-term monitoring should be given more emphasis as an effective bridge between active remediation and no further action. This alternative has often been ignored by regulators because of its tendency to be incorrectly categorized as a 'No Further Action (NFA)' alternative. For NA to be used effectively, it is important to know its limitations and avoid its misuse. A review of parameters for evaluation and a discussion of the strategy to be used for applying NA is followed by two case studies. One of the case studies demonstrates that natural attenuation can be successfully demonstrated as a management strategy for diesel-range hydrocarbons in soil. Overall, the conditions supporting natural attenuation as a remedial alternative are: the release has stabilized, the site has been characterized and has an adequate long-term groundwater monitoring plan, recoverable LNAPL has been removed, remediation of source area has been accomplished to the extent practicable, and documentation of ongoing natural attenuation has been obtained. The extent of data gathering for evidence for NA is site-specific, but should be incorporated into every site investigation from the onset.",,"Biodegradation; Crude petroleum; Environmental protection; Groundwater; Hydrocarbons; Laws and legislation; Management; Monitoring; Soils; Groundwater restoration; Natural attenuation; Remediation; Site closure; Soluble petroleum compounds; Water table; Oil fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029706420

In 12 patients the authors infused 12 mCi rubidium 82 into the femoral artery (following diagnostic cardiac catheterization) and recorded a dynamic PET sequence of the lower leg at rest and during reactive hyperemia following two minutes of complete arterial blockage by a cuff. Regional perfusion was calculated as the rate of uptake related to the 82 Rb input function. Perfusion reserve was calculated as the regional perfusion during hyperemia related to perfusion at rest. Muscle perfusion at rest was homogeneous in all patients. The regional perfusion reserve was markedly reduced in muscle areas distal to infrapopliteal stenoses or occlusions as compared with muscle areas following nonstenotic arteries and overall reduced in a patient with small-vessel disease. The authors conclude that 82 Rb-PET allows exact measurement of the regional perfusion of the lower leg muscles during rest and reactive hyperemia.

A recent two-dimensional model study has been conducted of how long-term changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations may modify the temperature and water vapor concentration at mesopause heights. The model is a version of the well-known Garcia-Solomon model, modified to include accurate non-LTE cooling in the CO2 15 μm band. The existence region of NLC is defined as a domain where water-ice is supersaturated. Reduced levels of CO2 and CH4 are found to confine the model NLC existence region to within the perpetually-sunlit polar cap region, where the clouds would no longer be visible to a ground observer.

We also inject sprays of liquid pure 1,1,1-trichloroethane, gaseous pure 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and gaseous 1,1,1-trichloroethane with 25% (by volume) heptane.

For the same engineering criterion to be satisfied, a room of dimensions 3.5 m×3.5 m×3.14 m constructed using low cost techniques costs only 66% of the conventional construction cost. Since these materials are low energy consuming, the associated CO2 emission is also low. The CO2 emission with the conventional method of construction is 5.88 tonnes compared to 2.42 tonnes in the low cost method of construction. There is a possibility of further reducing the emissions by 23% with 0.03% increase in the cost.

Among these, CO2 flooding is a highly attractive alternative. A large amount of CO2 is being produced by coal-fired power plants in this region. The CO2 is currently discharged into the atmosphere and could be a major contributor to the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. Thus, the concept of capturing CO2 and utilizing it as a flooding agent in EOR processes is currently generating much interest among oil, utility and coal companies. We demonstrate how cogeneration concepts, together with process-optimization strategies, help to reduce the CO2-production cost by utilizing low-pressure steam and waste heat from various sections of the power-generation process. Based on these concepts and strategies, results from this study show that the recovery cost of CO2 from a coal-fired power plant may range between $0.50 and 2.00/mscf. If the cost is approximately $1.25/mscf, the production cost of a barrel of incremental oil would be less than $18. Therefore, even at today's modest oil prices, there is room for profit to be made operating a CO2 flood with flue-gas-extracted CO2. The technical and economical feasibility of the concepts are evaluated and the practical implications for the Saskatchewan resources are discussed.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost accounting; International cooperation; Pilot plants; Recovery; Steam power plants; Carbon dioxide production; Coal-fired power plants; Oil recovery; Coal fired boilers; carbon recovery; coal fired power station; cogeneration; feasibility study; recovery costs; Canada, Saskatchewan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030268136

The sources of VOC emissions from the facility included three conformal coating dip tanks and two automated conformal coating spray chambers. The state regulation required an overall VOM removal efficiency of 85%, considering both capture efficiency and destruction efficiency. After reviewing several alternative control technologies, the facility elected to install a 15,000 scfm catalytic oxidation unit to meet its regulatory obligations. As a condition of its construction permit, the facility was required to demonstrate that the oxidation system was achieving greater than 85% overall VOM removal. As a part of this demonstration, the state regulatory agency required that the facility follow the guidelines contained in Method 204 to determine the capture efficiency of the catalytic oxidation system. Since the dip tanks did not meet all of the necessary criteria for passing the Permanent Total Enclosure (PTE) test, a number of alternative approaches were investigated. These approaches, which are the focus of this paper, included physical modifications, some temporary and some permanent, to the source; an alternative interpretation of the term, 'Natural Draft Opening' as defined in Method 204; and technical arguments against the relative merits of performing such a capture efficiency demonstration. This case study outlines some of the difficulties encountered in attempting to follow the guidelines of Method 204 and suggests practical recommendations for sources faced with implementing similar capture efficiency tests.",,"Air pollution control equipment; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Laws and legislation; Oxidation; Removal; Technology; Volatile organic compounds; Automated conformal coating spray chamber; Capture efficiency; Conformal coating dip tank; Destruction efficiency; Natural draft opening; Permanent total enclosure test; Volatile organic material; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030313627

The results show the qualitative and quantitative analysis of emission gases from plants, and also provide the emission rates of various compounds. More than twenty compounds under usual operation were found from this industrial park. The concentration variation with time could be correlated exactly with the distances from the emission source along the wind direction. This means that by changing the measuring points the source of emission could be unambiguously identified. The point, area and line source (PAL) plume dispersion model has been applied to estimate the emission rate of either a point or an area source. The local atmospheric stability was determined by releasing an SF6 tracer. The origin of errors came mainly from the uncertainty of the source configuration and the variation of the meteorological condition. Through continuous measurement using a portable open-path Fourier transform infrared (POP-FTIR) spectrometer, the maximum value of the emission rate and the annual amount of emission could be derived. The emission rate of the measured toxic gases was derived by the model technique, and the results show that the emission amount is on the order of ten to hundred tonnes per year.","Emission rate; Industrial park; Open-path FTIR; PAL model; Toxic gas","Fourier series; Industrial emissions; Organic pollutants; Particulate emissions; Spectrometers; Concentration variation; Emission rates; Fourier transform infra reds; Industrial parks; Meteorological condition; Open Path FTIR; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Toxic gas; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2842540622

P. Cout. and C. furcata (Huds.) Schrad.), and a DT moss (Tortula ruralis (Hedw.) Gaertn. ssp. ruralis) during slow drying, and on rehydration following a 12 h period of desiccation. Initially there was a two to fourfold increase in net CO2 assimilation due to reduction of CO2-diffusion resistance by elimination of excess water. Optimum water content for photosynthesis was 100-150% of dry mass (DM) in C. convoluta, c. 100% DM in C. furcata, and 120-200% DM in T. ruralis. The intensity of maximum and steady-state slow fluorescence showed little change above water contents of 56% DM in the lichens and 73% DM in T. ruralis (corresponding to c. 30-40% cell relative water content), but fell sharply at lower water content. The variable chlorophyll-fluorescence decrease ratio (Rfd) at 690 nm peaked at 56% DM water content in the two lichens, and at 45% DM in T. ruralis. Photochemical activity ceased at the same point in the experiments as CO2 assimilation; dark respiration ceased only when desiccation was complete. In all three species, the photosynthetic apparatus remained in a fully and quickly recoverable state. Chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations remained substantially unaltered throughout. On rehydration, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters returned within 30 min to predesiccation levels, and photosynthesis recovered fully and rapidly (&lt; 1 h). All three species attained a positive carbon balance within 20 min of re-moistening, in spite of high rates of dark respiration. The results confirm the significance of extracellularly-stored water to poikilohydric DT lichens and bryophytes. The measurements, in conjunction with published data on the full-turgor water content of similar mosses and lichens, show that the cell-physiological response of photosynthesis to water deficit is not greatly different from that of either normal or DT vascular plants. Small plant size and small cell volume in DT lichens and mosses, together with rapid recovery of photosynthesis after desiccation, allow the plants to utilize the small amounts of intermittently available water from brief showers or dew.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; CO2 exchange; Desiccation tolerance; Poikilohydric habit; Relative water content","Bryophyta; bryophytes; Cladonia convoluta; Convoluta; Convoluta convoluta; Lueheia; Tortula ruralis; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001467469

With this process joint products in different states of aggregation are emitted. Environmental impacts can be identified at any stage of the energy and material flow process. Due to the fact that production units and processes are interconnected with energy and material flows, it is of special interest to develop production control mechanisms which control the energy and material streams in a way that utilizes available resources most efficiently and reduces emissions and by-products caused by the production process. These production control strategies have to consider variations in the input and output flows of succeeding and preceding production units. The development of production control strategies depends especially on the structure of integrated production systems. If it is possible to influence the energy and material flows by the selection of special production processes and an adequate allocation of jobs and aggregates, the construction of production control strategies can be reduced to a combined scheduling and technology selection problem. Methodical production control strategies can be based on optimal algorithms (e.g. dynamic programming) heuristics (e.g. rule-based approaches) and methods of machine learning (e.g. neural networks). Due to the complexity of real production systems, it is advisable to use rule-based approaches or neural networks depending on the structure of the available production knowledge. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

The USGS collected the data without the benefit of a carefully considered sampling plan aimed at specific coal quality estimates. Therefore, the analysis of the collected data is problematical. This does not necessarily mean that the data set cannot provide useful estimates, only that the statistical techniques used would ordinarily be more complex. Spatially weighted average trace element concentrations estimated for the entire coal field within western Pennsylvania differed substantially from simple equally weighted average concentrations. The percentage differences ranged from -36% (where the spatially weighted average exceeds the equally weighted average) to +42%. Regression models were constructed to predict the effects of coal washing (i.e., the removal of ash and sulfur) on trace element concentrations. The percent of trace element variance accounted for by ash and sulfur ranged as high as 89%. The predictions based on these models for the only two CONSOL mines in the region tended to be significantly closer to the actual values than those produced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)2 using equally weighted averages. Finally, the paper discusses the advantages of providing accurate estimates of trace element concentrations for coal burned at power plants which are part of a relatively small sample set.

Such a situation could arise from the differential glycosylation of the core protein or due to duplexation and aggregation of the glycosaminoglycan chains.","Decorin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Structured/doublet emission","dermatan sulfate; proteoglycan; article; conformational transition; controlled study; cornea; cornea stroma; fluorescence spectroscopy; glycosylation; human tissue; nonhuman; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029931418

Weather observations demonstrate typical semi-arid Sonoran desert conditions, with frequent clear skies, high radiation, a large seasonal and diurnal temperature range, low relative humidity, and intermittent precipitation mainly of convective origin during a summer monsoon season. The substantial observational problems associated with surface flux measurements in this environment are reported. Comparisons between measured fluxes made simultaneously with different instrumental systems show acceptable agreement. Most of the incoming radiant energy leaves as sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes are always low, but transpiration is enhanced for about 10 days after rain. To investigate the influence of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism plants on carbon dioxide flux, measurements were sustained through the night. Carbon dioxide uptake is low, typically with peak daytime uptake in the order 0.25-1.0 μmol m-2 s-1 for the period for which data are available, and some carbon uptake persists even at night. The observations were used to validate and calibrate the surface energy balance simulated by the Biosphere- Atmosphere Transfer Scheme. Using the default 'semi-desert' soil and vegetation parameters specified in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model Version 2 resulted in a poor simulation of observations. However, using a set of site-specific parameters, including on-site observations to specify more realistic soil and vegetation characteristics, and optimized minimum surface resistance and plant wilting parameters, resulted in a substantial improvement in model performance. The site-specific parameters reflect the fact that the vegetation fraction is greater than assumed in the default parameter set, that leaf area index and minimum stomatal resistance are less, soils at the study site contain more clay, but that the plants' wilting point is lower than this clay fraction would imply. The modified, site-specific parameters more accurately describe the conservative character of the semi-desert vegetation and the moderate nature of its response to the seasonal water cycle.",,"Crassulaceae; carbon dioxide; desert; latent heat flux; semiarid region; sensible heat flux; surface energy balance; surface flux; USA, Arizona, Sonoran Desert",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030303418

Iodoazomycin arabinoside (IAZA) was radiolabelled with Iodine-123 and administered i.v. to 51 patients with newly diagnosed malignancies whose tumours were subsequently imaged by planar and single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) procedures. Quantitative analyses of radiotracer avidity were performed at 24 h post-injection and tumour- normal tissue ratios of greater than 1.10 were deemed positive for tumour hypoxia. By this criterion, the frequencies of hypoxia in small-cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck and malignant gliomas were 60% (9/15), 40% (6/15) and 0% (0/11) respectively. The correlation of positive IAZA scans with tumour control and survival in patients with lung cancer and head and neck tumours is currently under study. Preliminary observations in neck metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck tumours indicates decreased local control at 3 months post-treatment in tumours with IAZA avidity. This study concludes that: (1) 123I-IAZA can be administered safely and repeatedly as an outpatient routine imaging procedure in cancer patients during initial work-up and follow-up; (2) that retained drug can be detected by conventional nuclear medicine procedures in inaccessible deep-seated tumours; and (3) that this technique could prove useful for identifying those patients for whom hypoxia-directed therapy is indicated.","Bioreductive drug; Hypoxia; Imaging; Iodoazomycin arabinoside; Nitroimidazole","2 nitroimidazole; arabinoside; iodine 123; tracer; diagnostic agent; iodoazomycin arabinoside; nitroimidazole derivative; conference paper; drug resistance; head and neck cancer; human; hypoxia; intravenous drug administration; lung small cell cancer; metastasis; priority journal; quantitative assay; single photon emission computer tomography; squamous cell carcinoma; tissue oxygenation; article; cell hypoxia; metabolism; neoplasm; Cell Hypoxia; Humans; Neoplasms; Nitroimidazoles; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029933781

Seven heavy metals (HM) (Cd, Pb, Hg, Co, Cr, Ni and Zn) and As were determined. Heavy metal and As concentration in crops and soils were compared to the contaminant values from Czech state standards. A summary of the results shows that the relationship between HM and As contamination of the plants and soils is possibly complicated due to emission effects. In most cases both the degree of total contamination and the pollutant elements in the crops differed from pollution in the respective soils. In spite of a low degree of soil contamination in the regions examined (< 10%), the HM and As contamination of agricultural crops is very high (from 3-16% contaminated samples in the case of fodder crops, to 49-86% contamination of food crops).",,"contamination; heavy metal; soil crop; arsenic; brown coal; pollutant; Czech Republic, Bohemia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663839

Although the use of non-chemical methods to join fibers has recently undergone considerable growth for all such applications, the use of latex-type binders is still a popular means of creating the nonwoven product with a high degree of integrity, resistance and durability. The market for polymeric emulsions (latex-type binders) used in the production of nonwovens is now very large. During the 80s and 90s, the formaldehyde content of latex-type binders has become an increasingly important topic for nonwoven manufacturers, especially in the United States, Europe and Japan. This situation has come about as a result of governmental regulations stipulating new and stricter standards to combat potential problems caused by formaldehyde, such as cancer, hepatic disorders, respiratory sensitivity and the irritation of skin and mucous membranes. Not only are manufacturers seeking ways to reduce the formaldehyde emissions of their factories, they are also interested in the formaldehyde levels present in consumer products. This is particularly apparent in the area of disposable nonwovens like medical applications and products destined for domestic consumption. Special interest has been focused on controlling the formaldehyde level of products without sacrificing their characteristics and properties. Some companies involved in the manufacture of polymeric latex are aware of the formaldehyde problem and have made special efforts to respond to environmental issues and customer needs. These efforts have been mainly focused on reducing and even eliminating formaldehyde from their products, together with the development of testing methods designed to precisely measure the formaldehyde level of binders and the emissions of the factories using them.

With this purpose a buildup margin-to-basin transition of Upper Devonian (Frasnian) age has beem investigated in outcrops in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The study combined the platform margin geometry, as an indicator of relative sea leval change, and the geochemical characteristics of the adjacent basin sediments to povide a more complete picture of the evolution of this mixed carbonate/siliciclastic sedimentary system. The Frasnian represents a 2nd order transgressive/regressive sequence, which can be subdivided in six 3rd order sequences, each of which is characterised by specific platform margin geometrics. Vertical measured sections show a distinct pattern in the cross plots of the carbonate organic carbon for each 3rd order sequence. Particularly striking is the inverse linear relationship oberved in sequences 3 and 4, between the carbonate content, and the organic matter and clay content. This is interpeted as a dilution relationship, whereby low carbonate input and dysaerobic conditions led to the accumulation of large amounts of organic matter in the basin. Maximum accumulation of organic matter occured in two 3rd order sequences precedinh the 2nd order maximum flodding surface (sequences 3 and 4), and highest concentariation are recorded in the lowstand of squence 4. In addition, rapid lateral changes in sediment compositon have also been observed around the carbonate buildup. Four sedimentologic phases in the Fransian basin infill pattern are defined. Sequence 1 is characterised by regional shallow-water carbonate ramps amd platforms. In sequence 2, platforms retrograde and buildups are initiated; topography is low, and the sediment composition is carbonate dominated. Sequences 3 and 4 show buildup aggradation and basin starvation, which caused the development of a pronounced topography. In this phase a dilution relationship apperas between carbonate versus organic matter and calys. Carbonate input it low, and a large amount of organic matter accumulated in the dysacrobic basin. In sequnces 5 and 6, clays fill in the basin, and isolated platforms prograde. The topography is reduced, and sediment composition is domianted by carbonate and clay. The stratigraphic architecture is interpreted to be primarily the result of different orders of (eustatic) fluctuations inrelative sea level. In addition, dysaerobic conditions at the sea floor enhanced organic matter accumaulation in sequences 3 and 4, while at yet undefined environmental factors probably played a role in the change from regional platforms to isolated buildups (sequence 1 to 2). Finally, circulation patterns in the basin contributed to increased sedimentaion of (fine-grained) siliciclastics towards the end of the Frasnian (sequnces 5 and 6). Since there is strong evidence for a relative sea level control of the sedimentation pattern, the here proposed model will be predictive for the stratigraphic architecture in the alberta shale basais, and greatly facilitate correlation with the adjacent subsurface.","Basinal shales; Isolated carbonate platform; Margin geometrics; Organic matter; Sequence stratigraphy; Upper Devonian; Western Canada","carbonate platform; Devonian; Frasnian; organic matter; sequence stratigraphy; Canada, Rocky Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030440294

The origins of three such problems, the atmospheric deposition of N compounds, the leaching of nitrates to ground-water and the anthropogenic N-input to the North Sea, are investigated by means of a Substance Flow Analysis (SFA); the reference year is 1988. Although the problems occur at various scales and have varying direct causes, food production and consumption together are the main responsible sectors, and the production and import of fertilizer appear to be the major ultimate sources in all three cases. Measures to combat these problems have been agreed to in various international frameworks: the European Community, the International North Sea Conference and the Rhine States Conference. These measures include technical emission reduction for acidifying compounds resulting in a 30% emission reduction; extension of the sewage treatment network and application of denitrification with 50% effectiveness; and introduction of measures directed at efficiency increase and emission reduction in agricultural practice in 10% of the agricultural area. The recent changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are not expected to lead to significant changes in N flows. Assuming full implementation, an almost sufficient 45% reduction is expected for the anthropogenic nitrogen input into the North Sea. The atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds will be reduced by approximately 20%. The leaching of nitrates to the ground-water is expected to remain at the current level or even to increase a little. In all, these measures are conducive to solving, but do not satisfactorily solve, the three problems, mainly because the ultimate origins of the problems are not sufficiently influenced and measures therefore inevitably result in a shifting of problems.","atmospheric deposition; environmental policy; European Union; ground-water; materials balances; nitrogen compounds; North Sea","ground water; nitrogen; air pollution; article; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; Europe; human; politics; sea; water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029832162

A 4000 hr engine field test is planned for Phase III of the program. This paper summarizes progress from January 1995 through January 1996. First generation designs of the primary ceramic components (first stage blades and nozzles, combustor linen) for the program engine, the Solar Centaur 50S, and of the secondary metallic components interfacing with the ceramic pans were completed. The fabrication of several components has been completed as well. These components were evaluated in rigs and the Centaur 50S test engine. NT164 (Norton Advanced Ceramics) and GM-1 (AffiedSignal Ceramic Components) silicon nitride dovetail blades were cold and hot spin tested and engine tested at the baseline nominal turbine rotor inlet temperature (run of 1010° C. Full scale SiC/SiC continuous fiberreinforced ceramic matrix composite (CFCC) liners (B.F. Goodrich Aerospace) were also rig tested and engine tested at the nominal baseline MIT of 1010°C. One of the engine tests, incorporating both the GN-10 blades and the full scale SiC/SiC CFCC linen, was performed for 21.5 hrs (16 his at 100% load) with six suut/stop cycles. A cumulative 243 his of engine testing was performed at the end of January, 1996. The ceramic components were in good condition following completion of the testing. Subsade Hexoloy. SA silicon carbide (Carborundum) and enhanced SiC/SiC CFCC (DuPont Lama& Composites) and A120,/A1203 CFCC (Babcock & Wilxox) combustor liners were tested to evaluate mechanical attachment, durability and/or emissions reduction potential. The enhanced SiC/SiC CC of DuPont Lsnxide Composites demonstrated superior durability hi subscale combustor testing and this material was subsequently selected for the fabrkation of full scale combustor liners for final engine rig testing in Phase II and field testing in Phase III of the program. Enhanced SC/SC CFCC linos also showed significantly reduced emissions of NOx and CO when °unpaved with conventionally cooled subscale metallic liners. This observation is believed to apply generally to ""hot wall"" combustor substrates. The emissions results for the enhanced SiC/SiC CFCC liners were paralleled by similar emissions levels of NOx and CO monitored during engine testing with B.F. Goodrich Aerospace SiC/SiC CFCC combustor linen. NOx levels below 25 ppmv and CO levels below 10 ppmv were measured during the engine testing.

The six ether oxygens form the ground plane, the inner carbonyl group and one of the two outer carbonyl groups occupy the apical positions. The solution structure in methanol, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, has a time-averaged plane of symmetry through the inner phenyl ring. This plane of symmetry is the result of a fast interconversion of conformations in which either one of the outer carbonyl groups is coordinated to the Na+. The enthalpy of activation in methanol determined by T 1p measurements is 5 ± 1 kcal mol-1. This process of fast exchange was supported by TRAVEL/CHARMm simulations which revealed a transition-state structure with the two outer carbonyl groups coordinated to the Na+ with a plane of symmetry through the inner phenyl ring. The calculated activation energy is 6.1 kcal mol-1, in very good agreement with the experimental value.

However, the composition and amounts of such emissions have not been well characterized in the past. In this study the chemical composition of gaseous emissions was measured from a large waste water treatment plant (638 MGD) in the Chicago area. Twenty-three samples were collected in electropolished stainless steel canisters during the Summer and Fall of 1990. Analysis was carried out with gas chromatography using both flame ionization (FID) and electron capture (ECD) detectors. Concentrations were determined for 49 components which included chlorinated organics as well as hydrocarbons. The resulting chemical fingerprint was in good agreement with data collected from four relatively small wastewater plants in Ontario (each < 4 MGD) for the 16 compounds which were common to both studies. The chemical fingerprints were then used in a chemical mass balance receptor model (CMB) to estimate the ambient contribution of waste water treatment. Forty-four 12-hour air samples, collected in Chicago from Summer 1990 through Winter 1991, were evaluated. Other sources of organics included in the model were vehicle exhaust, diesel exhaust, gasoline vapor, coal combustion, steel processing (including coke manufacture), petroleum refineries, municipal incineration, printing, vapor degreasing, and, for winter samples, wood burning. The average contribution of waste water treatment was estimated from the CMB to be 6.3% of total VOC in the Chicago area. This value was in contrast to the emission inventory estimate of 1.1%. Since the CMB allocation is based on ambient measurements, it provides a time-weighted measure of the VOC's which are actually released. These results have implications for control of hazardous air pollutants (HAPS), such as benzene and chloroform, as well as for reduction in VOC emissions to reduce ozone levels.",,"Air pollution control; Atmospheric composition; Detectors; Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Hazardous materials; Ozone; Sampling; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Chemical balance receptor; Chemical fingerprint; Electron capture detectors; Flame ionization detectors; Hazardous air pollutants; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030316040

In this study, we have investigated the histochemical location and functional role of CA in the ferret heart. Heart sections stained by a modified Hansson's technique showed CA to be located on capillary endothelial membranes as well as on sarcolemmal membranes. In the Langendorff-perfused heart, washout of CO2 brought about by switching perfusion between 25 mM HCO3/--5% CO2-buffered solution and nominally HCO3/--CO2-free solution caused a transient rise in intracellular pH (pH(i)) measured by the chemical shift of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The initial rate of change of pH(i), measured over the first 60-75 s of CO2 efflux, was significantly reduced from 0.41 ± 0.03 pH units/min (n = 9) in control hearts to 0.28 ± 0.02 pH units/min (n = 5) in the presence of the membrane-permeable CA inhibitor 6-ethoxzolamide (P &lt; 0.05 compared with control) and to 0.22 ± 0.04 pH units/min (n = 5) in the presence of the membrane-impermeable CA inhibitor CL-11,366 (P &lt; 0.01 compared with control). After reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, both CA inhibitors caused a significant slowing of initial rate of change in pH (and initial rate of recovery of contractile function) compared with control hearts. These results suggest that CA, by facilitating the hydration-dehydration of CO2-H2CO3, alters the relative concentrations of CO2 inside and outside the cells, thus enhancing the rate of CO2 transfer from the intracellular to extracellular compartments, which contributes significantly to pHi recovery after reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium.","heart; intracellular pH; myocardial ischemia; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; carbonate dehydratase inhibitor; ethoxzolamide; thiadiazole derivative; animal tissue; article; capillary endothelium; cell pH; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme localization; ferret; heart muscle fiber membrane; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle reperfusion; histochemistry; isolated heart; nonhuman; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030446965

A number of cases drawn from both the public and private sectors are laid out to illustrate the reduction of wages and benefits, erosion of control over the work process, and political marginalization of Mexican workers. Among the explanations offered here for labor's inability to successfully resist employers and the state are: divisions within the worker movement, labor's isolation within political and civil society, undemocratic organizational structures, and worn tactics and strategies.

However, no endogenous physiological ligand for the AhR has been identified. Since the AhR regulates bioactivity to common environmental pollutants, and since it is predicted to play an important physiological function, we have investigated the expression of the AhR during the cell cycle of murine 3T3 fibroblasts. We show here that stimulation of growth-arrested 3T3 cells with serum results in increased expression of AhR protein. Serum-induced expression of AhR in synchronized, serum-stimulated cells occurs at the onset of DNA synthesis (S phase) and is maximal at time points corresponding to late S phase. Transient transfections with an AhR- promoter-luciferase construct demonstrate that reporter gene transcription from the AhR promoter is regulated in a serum-dependent manner. Serum- dependent induction of AhR expression is prevented by an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand-activated growth factor receptors (platelet- derived growth factor receptor basic fibroblast growth factor receptor) as well as an ectopically expressed tyrosine kinase (the v-Src oncoprotein) induce AhR expression in the absence of serum. Therefore, tyrosine kinase signaling is both necessary and sufficient for induction of AhR expression. Studies with the G1 blocker sodium butyrate show that the signal transduction pathways mediating serum-stimulated progression through the cell cycle are distinct from those that induce AhR expression. These data suggest that transcriptional regulation of the AhR is important in determining cellular sensitivity to the actions of AhR ligand(s) and that the AhR may play a role during the cellular proliferative response.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; basic fibroblast growth factor receptor; benzo[a]pyrene; growth factor receptor; oncoprotein; platelet derived growth factor receptor; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell proliferation; drug receptor binding; embryo; embryotoxicity; gene expression; mouse; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; protein expression; receptor upregulation; reporter gene; signal transduction; transcription regulation; Animals; Blood; Butyric Acid; Butyric Acids; Cell Cycle; Cell Line; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Fibroblasts; Flow Cytometry; Mice; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Animalia; Murinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029979715

Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the Sahel region, has been severely impacted by the compounding effects of drought, deforestation and desertification. The Senegal River Basin in the West Africa is a prime example of a region where development objectives are seriously undermined by the drought-induced desertification process. The basic hydrologic constraint on development is revealed in a time series decomposition of Senegal River annual flow volumes, which strongly suggests that water resources availability has been substantially curtailed since 1960. Two alternative time series mechanisms are hypothesized to account for the decreased flow volumes in recent decades. The first time series model suggests the presence of a long-term periodicity, while the second model hypothesizes an ARMA(1,1,) process. The second hypothesis provides a superior model fit. The stationary ARMA(1,1) model can be fitted successfully, however, only after explicitly removing a non-stationary component by linearly detrending after 1960. The implication of non-stationarity in Senegal River hydrology provides additional analytic evidence that the landscape degradation and desertification processes observed in Sahelian Africa can be in part attributed to climate change effects. Efforts to redress desertification should be at once conscious of complex socioeconomic forces exacerbating the desertification process and fundamental hydrologic constraints to river basin development.",,"Desertification; River basin development; Climate change; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Hydrology; Public policy; Rivers; Time series analysis; Surface water resources; climate change; desertification; flow volume; modelling; time series analysis; water resources; Africa, Senegal River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030380882

The objectives were to obtain credible statistical evidence to determine if bioremediation with inorganic mineral nutrients and/or microbial inoculation enhanced the removal of crude oil contaminating a sandy beach and to compute intrinsic and enhanced biodegradation rates. Biodegradation was tracked by GC/MS analysis of selected components, and the measured concentrations were corrected for abiotic removal by hopane normalization. A randomized block design was used to assess treatment effects. Three treatments were evaluated: a no-nutrient addition control, addition of watersoluble nutrients, and addition of water-soluble nutrients supplemented with a natural microbial inoculum from the site. Although substantial hydrocarbon biodegradation occurred in the untreated plots, statistically significant differences between treated and untreated plots were observed in the biodegradation rates of total alkane and total aromatic hydrocarbons. First-order rate constants for the disappearance of individual hopane-normalized alkanes and PAHs were computed, and the patterns of loss were typical of biodegradation. Significant differences were not observed between plots treated with nutrients alone and plots treated with nutrients and the indigenous inoculum. The high rate of oil biodegradation that was observed in the untreated plots was attributed to the background nitrogen that was measured at the site. Even though oil loss was enhanced by nutrient addition, active bioremediation in the form of exogenous nutrient addition might not be appropriate in cases where background nutrient levels are already sufficiently high to support high intrinsic rates of hydrocarbon biodegradation.",,"petroleum; article; biodegradation; gas chromatography; mass spectrometry; nutrient; oil spill; united states; bioremediation; indigenous inoculum; nutrients; oil spills; USA, Delaware, Delaware Bay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667277

A desktop computer drives a z-axis motorized controller to optically section plankton cells and detritus at very fine intervals (as small as 1 μm or less). Out-of-focus haze associated with each optical slice is removed via a nearest-neighbor algorithm in a process termed deconvolution. Image sets containing these stacks of deconvolved optical slices are subsequently displayed in 3D by volume-rendering software operating aboard a graphics computer.

One specific objective was to perform experiments with the gasifier in order to develop and test a process for generating combustible gases for production of heat and power from waste preserved wood. This process would ensure that heavy metals were present in the ash without any risk of wash out and that no toxic substances were emitted to the atmosphere. The objective of the gasification experiments in Jalasjärvi was to determine, which compounds emit from gasification of waste preserved wood impregnated with creosote or CCA (copper, chromium, arsenic). A further objective was determine the heavy metals in the ash from the gasifier and determine their leachability. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain any ash samples during the tests due to the unloading system for the ash. It is possible to gasify preserved waste wood impregnated with creosote and CCA with low exit concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. In all gasification experiments, the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans were well below the limit value for MSW incineration (0.1 I-TEQ ng/mn3, 11% O2). PCDD/F concentrations in the process gas are dependent on HCl concentration in the process gas. Similarly, PCDD/F concentration in the flue gas is dependent on HCl concentration in the flue gas. The congener distribution of PCDD/Fs in the process gas was different from that in the fuels. Some penta and hexa dioxins and furans existed in addition to hepta and octa congeners. The congener distribution of PCDD/Fs in the flue gas differed from that in the process gas but was similar to distribution in the fuels so that octa dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans were the main congeners. The concentration of particulate matter is low after the boiler and the condensing heat exchanger. The concentration of arsenic in the process and in the flue gas is originating from arsenic in the fuel. The arsenic concentration in the flue gas of the gasification tests with CCA impregnated wood was too high, compared with the limit value for municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration in Finland, also after the condensing heat exchanger. The limit value for new MSW plants is Sb, As, Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, V and Sn in total 0.5 mg/mn3 11% O2 and for old MSW plants Ni and As in total 0.5 mg/mn3 11% O2. The other heavy metal concentrations were within the limits. The hydrogen chloride concentration was highest in test 2 even though the chlorine content of creosote impregnated wood was not higher than in that of the other fuels. HCl concentrations were much smaller in the flue gas before and after the condensing heat exchanger (CHE) than in the process gas. CHE removed almost all HCl from the flue gas. Sulphur dioxide concentrations in the flue gas were higher in the gasification of creosote impregnated wood than the others both before and after the condensing heat exchanger.

The difference between the GHG mitigation potential and the actual level of GHGs mitigated in the Russian forest sector will depend to a great degree on external financing that may be available. One possibility for external financing is through joint implementation (JI). However, under the JI process, each project will be evaluated by considering a number of criteria including also the difference between the carbon emissions or sequestration for the baseline (or reference) and the project case, the permanence of the project, and leakage.

Besides one-exciton excitations also two-exciton excitations are demonstrated at higher photon densities incident on the monomer clusters resulting in nonlinear transmission and emission effects. The distribution of excitons over the exciton energy levels follows a Boltzmann law as shown by emission and nonlinear transmission experiments.

Air pollution regulations require that the project must with the applicable National and State Ambient Air Quality Standards and State Policy Guideline limits. This paper focuses on a description of a monitoring program implemented in the North Station area of Boston to determine a site-specific atmospheric conversion rate of nitrogen oxides from vehicle exhaust to nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere in areas close to the tunnel portals. Tests on constituent pollutants in motor vehicle exhaust confirm that a majority of the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted are in the form of nitric oxide (NO). Once released to the atmosphere, the NO undergoes a photochemical reaction in the presence of sunlight and ambient ozone (O3) to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The conversion in this reaction is dependent upon both available ambient O3 concentrations and a reasonable amount of time for mixing of the NO and O3 in the presence of sunlight to occur. An ambient air quality monitoring program was implemented at North Station in Boston. Six monitors were sited along the train yard where diesel locomotives sit idling. The intent of this siting was to obtain data on NO and NOx concentrations at distances nearby these relatively large sources of NOx. The data collected at these monitors, along with regional ambient NO2 background data and information on emissions from diesel locomotives was used to determine a site-specific NO2/NOx conversion factor for areas close to NOx emission sources.",,"Air quality; Automobiles; Computer simulation; Earth atmosphere; Exhaust gases; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Phase transitions; Atmospheric transformation; Nitrogen dioxide; Vehicular emissions; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030316044

R. China). Four types of diurnal variations (afternoon peak, night peak, afternoon-night double peaks and random pattern) of CH4 emission rates have been found. The first pattern was normally found in clear weather, the second and the third types were only found occasionally in particular place, while the fourth were found in cloudy or rainy weather. Due to the irregular pattern of the methane production observed in the morning-afternoon comparison experiment, the transport pathway influenced by certain factors, may be the major factor governing the diurnal variation of CH4 emission Seasonal variation patterns of CH4 emission differ slightly with different field locations, where climate system, cropping system and other factors are different. Two and three emission peaks were generally found during single and early rice vegetation periods, with the peak magnitude and time of appearance differing to small degree in individual sites. A decreasing trend of seasonal variation was always observed in late rice season. A combination of seasonal change of transport efficiency and that of CH4 production rate in the paddy soil explains well the CH4 emission. The role of rice plant in transporting CH4 varied over a large range in different rice growing stages. The reasons for internnual changes of CH4 flux are not yet clear. Great spatial variation of the CH4 emission has been found, which can be attributed to the differences in soil type and soil properties, local climate condition, rice species, fertilizer and water treatment. Experiments showed that while the application of some mineral fertilizers will reduce the CH4 emission and CH4 production in the soil, the application of organic manure will enhance CH4 emission and CH4 production in the soil. Any measures which can get off easily decomposed carbon from organic manure may reduce C supply for CH4. production, and hence reduce CH4 emission. Fermented sludges from biogas generators and farmyard-stored manure seem to be promising. In some parts of China, separate application of the organic and mineral manure instead of mixed application could be another option, Frequent Scientific drainage and ridge cultivation, which are often used water management techniques in Chinese rice agriculture, have been proved in experiments to be a very efficient mitigation measures to reduce CH4 emission from rice fields. By summarizing the present available data, China's rice fields contribute about 13.3 Tg yr-1 (11.4-15.2) CH4 to the atmosphere. The total methane emission from global rice fields can be estimated 33 60 Tg yr-1, much less than the estimates made before. If we extrapolate the measured data in China with a consideration of measured data in other Asian country, the total global emission of CH4 from rice fields are estimated to be about 35-60 Tg yr-1.",,"air pollution; developing country; emission; methane; methane emissions; paddy field; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030390407

The cloned gene, with a proposed designation of chcA, encodes an 843-bp open reading frame which predicts a primary translation product of 280 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 29.7 kDa. Highly significant sequence similiarity extending along almost the entire length of the protein was observed with members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily. The S. collinus chcA gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli by using a bacteriophage T7 transient expression system, and a protein with a specific ChcA activity was detected. The E. coli-produced ChcA protein was purified and shown to have similar steady-state kinetics and electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gels as the enoyl-coenzyme A reductase protein prepared from S. collinus. The enzyme demonstrated the ability to catalyze, in vitro, three of the reductive steps involved in the formation of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. An S. collinus chcA mutant, constructed by deletion of a genomic region comprising the 5' end of chcA, lost the ChcA activity and the ability to synthesize either cyclohexanecarboxylic acid or ansatrienin. These results suggest that chcA encodes the ChcA that is involved in catalyzing multiple reductive steps in the pathway that provides the cyclohexanecarboxylic acid from shikimic acid.",,"bacterial enzyme; bacterial protein; oxidoreductase; shikimic acid; article; bacterial genetics; enzyme activity; molecular cloning; nonhuman; priority journal; Streptococcus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Streptococcus; Streptomyces collinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10544222832

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the thermodynamics, catalyst selection and activity, reaction mechanism, and kinetics of this important reaction. Recently, research has centered on the development of catalysts and the feasible applications of this reaction in industry. Group VIII metals supported on oxides are found to be effective for this reason. However, carbon deposition causing catalyst deactivation is the major problem inhibiting the industrial application of the CO2/CH4 reaction. Ni-based catalysts impregnated on certain supports show carbon-free operation and thus attract much attention. To develop an effective catalyst for CO2 reforming of CH4 and accelerate the commercial application of the reaction, the following are identified to be the most important areas for future work: (1) selection of metal and support and studying the effect of their interaction on catalyst activity; (2) the effect of different promoter on catalyst activity; (3) the reaction mechanism and kinetics; and (4) pilot reactor performance and scale-up operation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039600735

On red light images, several internal rifts, including the historically well documented Rima Tenuis and Rima Hyperborea, as well as an internal, long absent, annular rift were mapped. The ground cap was asymmetric with a mean boundary at 72° N for ω = 270°, increasing to 77° N at ω = 90°. Images in green light showed the locations of high opacity hood clouds, including an extensive outflow to 67° N at ω ≈ 100°. The state of the cap and hood is compared with the findings of previous studies and the historical significance of the annular rift structure is discussed.

The assessment was based on co-liquefying 720 tons per day of plastic waste with an equivalent amount of coal on a weight basis. The plant products include hydrocarbon gases, naphtha, jet fuel and diesel fuel. Material and energy balances along with plant-wide simulation were conducted for the process. Furthermore, the data on plastic-waste availability, disposal and economics have been compiled. The results from the economic analysis identify profitability criteria for gross profit and thus return on investment based on variable conversion, yield and tipping fee for plastic waste processed.","Economic study; Municipal solid waste; Plastic/coal liquefaction","Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Hydrogen fuels; Industrial economics; Liquid fuels; Plastics; Refuse derived fuels; Waste disposal; Waste utilization; Liquid fuel hydrogen cogeneration; Municipal solid waste; Plastic waste availability; Coal liquefaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030259810

Throughout this area the Quaternary carbonates are generally no more than 30 m thick and are underlain by up to 145 m of Plio-Pleistocene mixed limestones and sands, and marine siliciclastics (Peace River Formation). Quartz sands, clays, and minor reworked phosphatic grains of the Peace River are the distal deposits of an almost peninsula-wide blanket that interrupted prolonged Tertiary carbonate deposition in southernmost Florida. In the Lower Keys the Peace River siliciclastics change facies to very fine- to fine-grained carbonates composed of bioclastic, planktonic-foraminiferal grainstones and packstones. The position of the present southern Florida shelf margin, with its discontinuous coral reefs, is determined by the seaward paleoslope of siliciclastics and/or carbonates of the Plio-Pleistocene section defined in the Florida Keys. Lithostratigraphy of five continuous cores on the Keys and southeastern mainland, each about 300 m long, combined with numerous well logs and sample descriptions from the Keys and mainland, establish the southern limit of Peace River siliciclastics to at least the Middle Keys. The well data show intervals of quartz of coarse sand to granule size localized as a north-south pathway of maximum paleocurrents that extend from the central part of the peninsula approximately 350 km to the Middle Keys. This pathway of maximum paleocurrents, about 100 km wide, is interpreted as the palimpsest record of unusually strong, southward-moving shoreline and channeled deposition or a giant prograding spit. The ultimate source of these siliciclastics is from the Appalachians, approximately 1000 km to the north. We propose that the Plio-Pleistocene marine siliciclastics and carbonates (including the Peace River Formation) recovered in wells on the Keys extend seaward beneath the present southern Florida outer shelf and are present in seismic profiles acquired across the shelf-margin slope. A series of profiles forming an offshore traverse from the Lower to Upper Keys show seaward-dipping clinothems that locally dip obliquely to the arcuate strike of the Florida Keys. These clinothems downlap on a prominent reflector that can be traced to an exposed submarine surface of upper Tertiary carbonates, the Pourtales and Miami Terraces. Some reflectors show configurations similar to contourites, and others, to channels. We contend that southward entry of the siliciclastics into southernmost Florida was deflected eastward by west-to-east channeled flow of an ancestral Florida Current.

Each of three experiments compared two fields treated with a first uniform fertilizer dose and a second fertilizer dose which was different for each of the two fields. The uniform fertilizer doses for both fields in each experiment comprised mineral (experiment 1), organic (experiment 2) and combined mineral plus organic components (experiment 3). In all three experiments the second fertilizer dose comprised organic amendments for field I and no organic amendments for field 2. The rate of increase in methane emission with a given amount of organic manure was found to depend on the total amount of organic manure applied. A single dose of organic manure increased the emission rates by factors of 2.7 to 4.1 as compared to fields without organic manure (experiment 1). In rice fields that had already been treated with organic manure, the application of a second dose of organic manure only slightly enhanced the emission rates in experiment 2 by factors of 1.1 to 1.5 and showed no detectable increase in experiment 3. The net reduction achieved by separation of organic and mineral fertilizers was maximized by concentrating the organic amendments in the season with low emission rates, i.e. early rice, and using exclusively mineral fertilizers on late rice when emission rates were generally higher. This distribution pattern, which was not associated with significant yield losses, resulted in an annual methane emission corresponding to only 56% of the methane emitted from fields treated with blended fertilizers.","Fertilization; Methane emission; Mitigation of greenhouse gases; Wetland rice","fertilizer; greenhouse gas; methane emission; organic amendment; paddy field; China, Hunan Province",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047678752

This is accomplished by integrating an OGCM with specified surface fluxes. It is shown that a dramatic climate drift of the coupled system is inevitable unless ocean meridional heat and freshwater (salt) transports are used as constraints for tuning the AGCM presentday climatology. It is further shown that the magnitude of the mismatch between OGCM and AGCM fluxes is not as important for climate drift as the difference in OGCM and implied AGCM meridional heat and freshwater (salt) transports. Hence a minimum flux adjustment is proposed, which is zonally-uniform in each basin and of small magnitude compared to present flux adjustments. This minimum flux adjustment acts only to correct the AGCM implied oceanic meridional transports of heat and freshwater (salt). A slight extension is also proposed to overcome the drift in the surface waters when the minimum flux adjustment is used. Finally, it is suggested that the flux adjustments which arise from current methods used to determine them are all very similar, leading to adjustment fields which are significantly larger than both AGCM and climatological fields over large regions.",,"AGCM; air-sea interaction; climate drift; flux adjustments; freshwater; freshwater flux; GCM; ocean circulation model; surface heat; surface heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029749116

Reef framework is divided into four categories: (1) skeletal metazoan; (2) non-skeletal microbialite (stromatolite and thrombolite); (3) calcimicrobe; and (4) biocementstone, in which small or delicate organisms serve as scaffolds for rigid cement crusts. The last three categories are dominated by non-enzymatic carbonates. Skeletal framework and non-skeletal microbialite framework were the most abundant framework types through the Phanerozoic. The composition and abundance of skeletal framework was controlled largely by mass extinction events, but most reefs consisted of both microbialite and skeletal organisms in a mutually beneficial relationship. Microbialite framework was abundant throughout the Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic, but declined after the Jurassic. Calcimicrobe framework was important during the Cambrian-Early Ordovician and Devonian and biocementstone framework was important from the late Mississippian to the Late Triassic. The Phanerozoic history of reefs does not correlate well with the stratigraphic distribution of large, skeletal 'reef builders', or with a variety of physicochemical parameters, including sea-level history, Wilson Cycle or global climate cycles. Because non-enzymatic carbonates result from induction by non-obligate calcifiers, and not enzymatic precipitation by obligate calcifiers, the distribution of these carbonates was controlled to a larger extent by temporal changes in physicochemical parameters affecting the saturation state of sea water with respect to carbonate minerals. Changes in pCO2, Ca/Mg ratios, cation concentrations and temperature may have affected the abundance of non-enzymatic carbonates and, hence, reefs, independently from the effects of these same parameters and mass extinction events on skeletal reef biota. The decline in abundance of reefal microbialite and absence of calcimicrobe and biocementstone reef framework after the Jurassic may be a result of relatively low saturation states of sea water owing to increased removal and sequestration of finite marine carbonate resources by calcareous plankton since the Jurassic.

Coreflood experiments were conducted to determine these parameters for samples from two major lithofacies in the South Cowden reservoir interval. This work was co-funded by DOE under the Class II Oil Program. The data provided key input parameters for simulation modeling and evaluation of the DOE sponsored advanced technology field demonstration project at the South Cowden Unit, Ector County, Texas. Measurements of residual oil saturations following miscible CO2 displacement, trapped CO2 saturations, and endpoint relative permeabilities of CO2 and water (both before and after CO2 displacements) are presented for the primary facies. The secondary facies was determined not to be amenable to a WAG injection process. The corefloods were conducted at reservoir conditions (98 °F and 1800 psig) using live oil and brine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to screen core plugs for internal, `hidden' heterogeneities prior to flow testing. Trapped gas saturations in the main reservoir facies at South Cowden varied from approximately 20-25±3% PV. Measured CO2 relative permeabilities were significantly lower than oil relative permeabilities at comparable water saturations. Water relative permeabilities after CO2 displacement were appreciably reduced compared with values observed prior to CO2 injection. The impact of these key parameters on simulation model predictions of CO2 flood performance is illustrated using a typical pattern simulation model. Experimental procedures and apparatus are presented along with a method for estimating uncertainties in the trapped gas saturation measurements.",,"Carbon dioxide; Core samples; Crude petroleum; Injection (oil wells); Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical models; Mechanical permeability; Parameter estimation; Petroleum geology; Saturation (materials composition); Carbon dioxide flooding; Residual oil saturations; Oil well flooding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029735553

Measured rates using the slurry technique in Z. noltii colonised sediments were consistently higher than those determined in isolated cores. This was probably due to the release of labile organic carbon sources during preparation of the slurries. Thus, in colonised sediments the whole core technique may provide a more accurate estimate of in situ activity. Acetylene reduction rates measured by the whole core technique in colonised sediments were 1.8 to 4-fold greater, dependent upon the season, in the light compared with those measured in the dark, indicating that organic carbon released by the plant roots during photosynthesis was an important factor regulating nitrogen fixation. In contrast acetylene reduction rates in uncolonised sediments were independent of light. Addition of sodium molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulphate reduction inhibited acetylene reduction activity in Z. noltii colonised sediments by &gt;80% as measured by both slurry and whole core techniques irrespective of the light regime, throughout the year inferring that sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) were the dominant component of the nitrogen fixing microflora. A mutualistic relationship between Z. noltii and nitrogen fixing SRB in the rhizosphere, based on the exchange of organic carbon and fixed nitrogen is proposed. In uncolonised sediments sodium molybdate initially severely inhibited acetylene reduction rates, but the level of this inhibition declined over the course of the year. These data indicate that the nitrogen fixing SRB associated with the Zostera roots and rhizomes were progressively replaced by an aerobic population of nitrogen fixers associated with the decomposition of this recalcitrant high C:N ratio organic matter. Acetylene and sulphate reduction rates in the seagrass beds showed distinct summer maxima which correlated with a reduced availability of NH4/+ in the sediment and the growth cycle of Z. noltii in the Bassin. Overall, these data indicate that acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) activity in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii was regulated both by release of organic carbon from the plant roots and maintenance of low ammonium concentrations in the root zone due to efficient ammonium assimilation. Nitrogen fixation rates determined from acetylene reduction rates measured by the whole core technique ranged from 0.1 to 7.3 mg N m-2 d-1 in the Z. noltii beds and between 0.02 and 3.7 mg N m-2 d-1 in uncolonised sediments, dependent upon the season. Nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii was calculated to contribute between 0.4 and 1.1 g N m-2 y- 1 or between 6.3 and 12% of the annual fixed nitrogen requirement of the plants. Heterotrophic nitrogen fixation therefore represents a substantial local input of fixed nitrogen to the sediments of this shallow coastal lagoon and contributes to the overall productivity of Z. noltii in this ecosystem.","Acetylene reduction; nitrogen fixation; rhizosphere; root exudates; sulphate reduction; Zostera noltii","Bacteria (microorganisms); Halophila; Zostera noltii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029982110

The simulation was made with a mesoscale dynamical model utilizing a simplified bulk water cloud scheme and a spectral model of radiative transfer. Expressions for cirrus optical properties for solar and infrared wavelength intervals as functions of ice water content and effective particle radius are modified for the midlatitude cirrus observed during FIRE-II and are shown to compare favorably with explicit size-resolving calculations of the optical properties. Rawinsonde, Raman lidar, and satellite data are evaluated and combined to produce a time-height cross section of humidity at the central FIRE-II site for model verification. Due to the wide spacing of rawinsondes and their infrequent release, important moisture features go undetected and are absent in the conventional analyses. The upper-tropospheric humidities used for the initial conditions were generally less than 50% of those inferred from satellite data, yet over the course of a 24-h simulation the model produced a distribution that closely resembles the large-scale features of the satellite analysis. The simulated distribution and concentration of ice compares favorably with data from radar, lidar, satellite, and aircraft. Direct comparison is made between the radiative transfer simulation and data from broadband and spectral sensors and inferred quantities such as cloud albedo, optical depth, and top-of-the-atmosphere 11-μm brightness temperature, and the 6.7-μm brightness temperature. Comparison is also made with theoretical heating rates calculated using the rawinsonde data and measured ice water size distributions near the central site. For this case study, and perhaps for most other mesoscale applications, the differences between the observed and simulated radiative quantities are due more to errors in the prediction of ice water content, than to errors in the optical properties or the radiative transfer solution technique.",,"atmospheric instrument; cirrus; cloud microphysics; FIRE-II; ISCCP; radiative transfer; USA, Kansas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5844268911

Two key issues are (1) the degree to which exposures of the U.S. population to methylmercury from fish consumption can be characterized and (2) the determination of the degree to which exposures from fish consumption are due to utility emissions; these issues are explored in this paper. The applicability of a standard approach to environmental risk assessment to assess mercury exposure from power plant air emissions has many components: assessment of emissions, characterization of transport including chemical transformations likely to affect mercury behavior, estimation of the rate of mercury deposition to the ground surface, characterization of transport to lakes and streams, chemical conversion in lakes, estimation of the uptake and bioaccumulation of methylmercury in fish, and characterization of freshwater fish consumption by humans. A difficulty of this approach is with the analytical connection between the multitude of sources and potential receptors. If the linkage between emissions, deposition, and uptake by fish were dominated by local, short-range processes, then it would be possible to attribute deposition into watersheds and water bodies to a limited number of local sources. An alternative approach can be taken, based on the apportionment of environmental mercury across sources. Under this approach, exposure to mercury is determined through studies of ingestion of mercury-containing foods, principally fish, or by measurement of mercury in hair or blood. Once the exposure has been estimated, the comparative magnitudes of mercury releases are evaluated, with adjustments made to account for differences in the degree to which particular emissions are likely to affect the availability of mercury from each particular source.",,"Coal fired boilers; Mercury (metal); Power plants; Risk assessment; Coal fired power plants; Exposure assessment; Mercury emissions; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030314183

Effluents were initially fractionated into dissolved substances, and substances adsorbed to suspended particulate matter. Acid/base partitioning was used to further fractionate aqueous extracts. Genotoxicity was measured using the SOS Chromotest. Genotoxicity of extracts was found to be related to sample type, industry type, metabolic activation status, and extract fluorescence (380 nm excitation, 430 nm emission). S9 metabolic activation reduced genotoxic potency in over 90% of the extracts examined. Expression of potency values per equivalent unit of original sample revealed that effluent particulate matter is, on average, almost four orders of magnitude more potent than aqueous filtrates. Suspended particulate matter from organic and inorganic chemical production, petroleum and metal refining, and from metal surface treatment facilities, provided extracts that were significantly more genotoxic than those from sewage treatment and pulp and paper facilities. Aqueous filtrates from inorganic and organic chemical production, metal refining, and surface treatment facilities were significantly more genotoxic than those emitted by aluminum and petroleum refineries. Overall, the results suggest that pulp and paper mills emit mostly soluble genotoxins, while petroleum and aluminum refineries emit predominantly particle-associated genotoxins. Although some extracts elicited a strong SOS response, the potency of the extractable residues was low when compared to highly potent pure substances such as benzo(a)pyrene. On average, a mg of dichloromethane-extractable residue has an SOS genotoxicity equivalent to 0.1-1.0 μg of benzo(a)pyrene. Predicted Ames mutagenic potency values corresponded reasonably well with industrial waste mutagenic potency values published by other researchers. Genotoxic loading values were calculated to quantify the total daily genotoxic emission and potential hazard of each industry. Highest loadings were from sewage treatment, pulp and paper, and metal refining facilities. Highest loading values were the SOS genotoxic equivalent of over 30 kg of benzo(a)pyrene per day. The ultimate hazard of genotoxic emissions is not known. Actual hazard assessment is complicated by a poor understanding of the postemission behavior of genotoxins. Exposure of downstream biota is likely substantial.","Genotoxicity; Hazard assessment; Industrial effluent; SOS chromotest; Water pollution","industrial effluent; metal; mutagenic agent; petroleum derivative; article; controlled study; effluent toxicity; genotoxicity; industrial waste; nonhuman; paper industry; petrochemical industry; sos chromotest; suspended particulate matter; water pollution; Analysis of Variance; Benzo(a)pyrene; Biotransformation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Exposure; Industrial Waste; Metals; Methylene Chloride; Mutagenicity Tests; Mutagens; Mutation; SOS Response (Genetics); Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029866836

The BangBox emissions testing program established the technical foundations for emissions characterization which have been accepted by the USEPA and other regulatory agencies; the technical issues remaining are nettlesome and require new approaches in test procedures. Characterizing emissions produced by the open burning (OB) or open detonation (OD) of chlorine-containing energetics is an excellent example. Highly reactive, chlorine combines with a number of materials found in most testing environments, e.g., metal in sampling devices and moisture in the air, thus greatly complicating the testing situation. This paper describes the materials tested, special considerations in preparing the test facility, the means used to account for chlorine, and preliminary results of a developmental test on solid rocket-motor propellants conducted in July and August 1995 at the BangBox test facility at the U.S. Army West Desert Test Center in Utah.

However, the actual existence of upward-shallowing lithofacies associations has rarely been explicitly demonstrated and, in contrast to such perceptions of periodic and global accumulation, many carbonate sequences can just as readily be interpreted as largely constituting unordered assemblages of various peritidal lithologies. Examination of published data from several long epicratonic sequences indicates that their division into shallowing cycles is a rather subjective exercise. Inference of repeated shoaling has commonly relied more heavily on the stratigraphic recurrence of particular units interpreted as representing extremely shallow to exposure conditions than on any documented tendency for groups of lithofacies to actually constitute upward-shallowing associations. Moreover, cycle definition via such picking of cycle ""tops"" results not only in a varied assemblage of overlying substitutable ""base"" and mid-cycle lithologies, but also leads to the designation of cycles that contain a relatively small number of stratal elements; most reported peritidal cycles contain only two stratal elements (mean = 2.25 lithofacies/shallowing cycle; n = 627) and thus are indistinguishable from sequences of randomly stacked peritidal units. Comparison of data on thicknesses and numbers of stratal elements in real-world ""cyclic"" and model chaotic sequences demonstrates that most Proterozoic and Phanerozoic sections exhibit little more meterscale ordering of component units than would commonly be present in sequences of randomly associated peritidal lithofacies. On the basis of these considerations, we conclude that meter-scale cyclicity in many if not most epicratonic sequences is more apparent than real, that perceptions of repeated and eustatically driven platform flooding are largely incorrect, and that a substantial component of presumed meterscale stratigraphic order in peritidal carbonates reflects little more than the random migration of various sedimentary subenvironments over specific platform localities during long-term accumulation of peritidal carbonate.

To date, the major research effort has concentrated on those mediators responsible for the initiation and maintenance of the pathological process. In contrast, little attention has been focused on endogenous factors responsible for the resolution of the inflammation. Heme oxygenase ((HO); EC 1.14.99.3) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme to biliverdin (which is converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase), free iron and carbon monoxide (GO). Two isoforms of HO have been characterized, the constitutive isoform, HO-2, which is the major isoform present ender physiological conditions, and the stress-induced isoform, HO-1, which has also been classified as heat-shock protein 32K (ref. 1). Increases in HO activity have been implicated in tissue protection against oxidative stress. In this communication, we describe the effects of modulating HO during an acute complement-dependent inflammatory response. Elevation of this enzyme resulted in a striking suppression, whereas inhibition of the enzyme led to a potentiation of the inflammatory response. Such novel enzyme modulation has application on the one hand to the treatment of inflammatory diseases and on the other hand to immunosuppressed states in which the impaired ability to mount an adequate inflammatory response may result in death from opportunistic infections.",,"heat shock protein; hematin; heme oxygenase; protoporphyrin tin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammatory disease; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; subcutaneous drug administration; Animals; Bilirubin; Blotting, Western; Carrageenan; Complement System Proteins; Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing); Inflammation; Isoenzymes; Kinetics; Monocytes; Neutrophils; Oxidative Stress; Pleura; Rats; Time Factors; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030045835

We use mathematical morphology, a non-linear image processing method, to model the interaction between probe tip and sample. In a typical imaging situation, baseline dimensions are most affected by the probe and widths can be 80% tip and 20% molecule. Using the morphological model and a known tip, we can restore the image so that it more closely resembles the actual surface. Morphological restoration is ideal in some regions, giving the exact sample surface, and improved in others. In the case of a carbon probe, restoration increases the perfectly obtained surface area by as much as 160 times. Following restoration, lateral widths at fixed heights are improved by as much as 75%. Restoration greatly improves image resolution even if one uses probes consisting of very small candidate structures, e.g., nanotubes and Bucky balls. The tip imaging process is also modeled, and we find that calibration spheres should be larger than the molecules of interest and that for many tips, there is little or no advantage to using smaller spheres.

Replacing the UAM chemistry solver by the implicit-explicit hybrid solver (IEH) tends to lower the afternoon ozone concentrations somewhat, the afternoon PAN concentrations more noticeably, and the H2O2 concentrations significantly. IEH is also much less likely to have a convergence failure than the UAM solver. Replacing the Smolarkiewicz scheme by the forward Euler Taylor Galerkin scheme (FETG) yields a greater impact. The replacement increases the local peak NO concentrations and lowers the local peak ozone and CO concentrations significantly. Replacing both chemistry and advection algorithms lowers the peak ozone, PAN, and H2O2 concentrations quite noticeably. For example, the predicted peak ozone for August 28 is reduced from 234 to 200 ppb. The complicated wind field for this episode generates two high-ozone subdomains in the model-one in the east and one in the northwest. Reducing the NO(x) emission by 50% shifts the predicted domainwide peak ozone from the east to the northwest. If we disregard this shift, then the use of more accurate modules in the UAM leads to a 50% increase in the domainwide peak ozone while the original UAM yields a 27% increase.

The largest frozen lake that was observed was close to 1 km in width. These melting features were also detected in a Landsat Thematic Mapper image recorded on 12 February 1990. Then, during NARE 1993-94, a 5 year glaciological programme was started in this area. In spite of negative air temperatures and the presence of a frozen ice surface, sub-surface melting and runoff were found within the uppermost metre in blue-ice fields. The subsurface melting is a consequence of solar radiative penetration and absorption within the ice, i.e. the ""solid-state-greenhouse effect"". Temperatures in blue ice were about 6°C higher than for snow. Internal melt and meltwater transport were observed throughout the 1 month of measurements. The conditions for active melting in Jutulgryta are probably marginal. A slight increase of air temperatures can result in more °classical° surface melting, whereas a cooling may disable sub-surface melting. Studies of how the extent and characteristics of the melting features change with time can be particularly valuable as indicators of climate change. This ongoing programme clearly identifies the importance of analyzing how these melting features originate, of mapping their present areal distribution, of determining how sensitive they are to climate change and of studying changes in the past and possible changes in the future.",,"blue ice field; climate change; frozen lake; ice mass; melting; meltwater; solar radiation; Antarctica, Queen Maud Land, Jutulgryta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030416694

These VdVt studies are time consuming and costly for our patients. The Protocol PROcap end tidal CO2 monitor (PROcap [Protocol Systems Inc., Beaverton, OR)] is capable of monitoring both end tidal CO2 and steady state CO2 (SS) (used to monitor the therapeutic delivery of CO2.). We hypothesized the values analyzed by the PROcap in SS would correlate with the blood gas machine results. Methods: We obtained 20 samples of MECO2 using a 2 liter anesthesia bag with a gas collecting valve system, using a modified Douglas bag technique. We analyzed the samples using a properly calibrated IL1420 BG3 blood gas analyzer (BG3) [Instrumentation Industries, Lexington MA] and properly calibrated PROcap. We followed both manufacturers recommendations regarding analysis of gas samples. The MECO2 samples were first analyzed on the BG3 by one investigator, sampling &gt;100 cc of gas. A second investigator analyzed the MECO2 on the PROcap being blinded to the BG3 results. The PROcap was set in the sidestream sampling and steady state mode aspirating at a rate of 175 cc/min. The highest MECO2 value analyzed, once stable, was recorded. Results: Data for the accuracy of the BG3 with gas analysis was unavailable. A typical CO2 electrode is accurate ± 3 mmHg.1 The PROcap has an accuracy of ± 2 mmHG in the range tested. The data was analyzed using Pearson Correlation (Statistix v4.0). Significance was defined with an r2 &gt;.95. BG3 results were 17.86±5.32 mmHg. The PROcap were 18.25±4.70 mmHg. [mean±sd] (r2 of .986) Conclusions: The PROcap is sufficiently accurate to analyze MECO2. The SC-300 is easy to operate and provides a graphic display of the MECO2 level, thus giving the investigators confidence in the values it reported. The BG3 does not have a graphical display of MECO2 analysis which made troubleshooting difficult (ie, inadvertent aspiration of ambient gas). Clinical Implications: Use of the PROcap to analyze MECO2 for use in VdVt calculations should reduce the time and cost of obtaining MECO2 values. The graphic display allows for real time troubleshooting of the gas analysis, which should improve the accuracy of reported results.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750262912

Most of the late lying snowbeds in Britain are in the central highlands of Scotland, coinciding with an area of very high deposition of nitrogenous air pollutants. Snow is a very efficient scavenger of atmospheric pollution and, due to the dynamics of snowmelt, much of the pollution load of a snow pack is released at very high concentrations in episodes known as 'acid flushes'. This study demonstrates the existence of a positive relationship between duration of snow-lie and tissue nitrogen content of Kiaeria starkei, a bryophyte characteristic of late snowbeds. An increase in the tissue nitrogen content of this bryophyte over this century is also shown, reflecting increasing air pollution. Maximum tissue nitrogen concentration in K. starkei is up to 50% greater than that recorded in other upland bryophyte species, demonstrating the exceptional threat of pollution to snowbed bryophytes. This has implications for the critical loads approach to pollution emission controls, as it indicates that some mountain communities are receiving higher pollution loadings than previously realised and therefore current exceedence of critical loads is probably greater than recognised at present.","Bryophyte; Deposition; Nitrogen; Snow","nitrogen; scavenger; snow; air pollutant; air pollution; article; climate; history; nonhuman; tissue level; vegetation; acid flush; air pollution; bryophyte; nitrogen; snowbed; UK, Scotland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029669248

In all cases the system was seen to be transitive, in that the sea ice eventually grew back to the present climate conditions. Here we examine the timescale and nature of the ice and atmospheric relaxation back to 'control' conditions. Several experiments were carried out, either supposing that all the sea ice was removed at certain times of year, or that it was removed only over certain large areas. The model in each case was run for six realizations for the equivalent of several years to a new equilibrium. For the 'whole sea-ice removal' experiment the maximum impact was found to occur when the removal was made at the time of sea-ice maximum (September) and least reaction near the minimum. In both cases the return to normal occured by the middle of the following winter. The atmospheric responses comprised reduced surface pressure over the area from which ice had been removed, greatly increased turbulent fluxes, reduced difference between precipitation and evaporation (P - E) over the ocean and increased (P - E) over the Antarctic continent. The air temperature changes spread through the troposphere and tended to reduce the circumpolar westerlies north of and over the sea-ice zone. The reaction to the regional sea-ice removals was more local and depended on where the region was located relative to the mean circulation pattern around and over Antarctica.","Antarctica; Climate model; Impact experiment; Sea-ice model","atmospheric response; climate system; climatic effects; coupled atmosphere/sea ice model; model; ocean-ice-atmosphere system; sea ice; Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030391026

Preliminary studies have been performed on the catalytic NOx reduction to evaluate the efficiency of a Pt/zeolite system as well as to establish the impact of operation conditions on the catalyst performance. The activity of the prepared samples (catalytic coating on particle trap) has been determined under model gas test conditions. Much attention has been focussed on the steady-state kinetics of the surface processes. Another aspect considered is the N2O formation which can be reduced, when alkali-earth or rare-earth oxides are added to the catalyst system. Additionally, the prepared samples have been tested on an engine test bench under steady state conditions and finally by vehicle tests. A fuel additive containing an organic-sodium compound is used to regenerate the particulate trap. The examined Pt/zeolite system on a particle trap exhibits NOx conversions up to 60 % under model gas test conditions. Furthermore, the addition of CeO2 to the catalyst reduces the N 2O formation.

This concept was developed to remove submicron and micron sized particles entrained in gas streams centrifugally, through the use of an unique recirculation method. The technology overcomes the performance limitation inherent in cyclones by performing the tasks of separation and collection in two separate components. The separation process is less affected by secondary flows and is much more efficient than the collection process. Also, the components of the system are arranged in such a way that the separation process actually predetermines the system efficiency. As a result, particulate emission rates downstream from this system are typically 3-6 times lower than those from the most efficient cyclones. This new technology has been demonstrated through several field prototypes, and more recently through commercial unit installations in the U.S. and abroad. It has been used to perform difficult industrial separations including coal fly ash, minerals, glass, and chemical recovery applications. In 1995, the technology was demonstrated in Poland, currently one of the more contaminated areas in the world. It is considered a lower-cost alternative to fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators, albeit one that can meet or exceed regulations for particulate emissions.

A potentially interesting system is one where the terminal groups in the chains that contain azobenzene are different from the other terminal groups. The configurational states of the azobenzene are then expected to control the relative protrusion of the terminal groups and alter the mole fraction of these groups present on the free surface, which directly influences the properties of the monolayer. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for mixed systems of a hydrocarbon chain containing azobenzene surrounded by pure hydrocarbon chains on a planar silica substrate. With a surface area assigned roughly three times larger than the usual area for a pure hydrocarbon chain, the azobenzene-containing chain exhibits an observable chain length difference between the trans and the cis configurations. Also the effect of relative positions of the azobenzene group within the chain is studied, and it is found that head and tail connections introduce larger variations in chain length than center connection during the trans ⇌ cis isomerization.

Identifying this sink requires a knowledge of CO2 fluxes at global and local scales. The former can be estimated from global averages of CO2 concentration and isotope composition4-9; local-scale measurements have been made by analysing individual eddies of air10,11. In both cases, the net CO2 exchange is the sum of two opposing fluxes: uptake by gross primary productivity and release by respiration. Here we show that these two components can be estimated separately at the local scale from small vertical gradients in 13C and 18O in atmospheric CO2 above vegetation. By also analysing the 18O content of moisture in the air samples, we can estimate evapotranspiration rates, providing information on water exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere12.

Methods and Results: Twenty-four measurements were performed in eight closed-chest anesthetized greybounds at baseline and during infusions of adenosine (100 to 200 μg · kg-1 · min-1), isoprorenol (1 to 10 μg/min), and propranolol (5 mg bolus + 0.2 to 1 mg/min) with morphine (5 mg slow infusion + 0.2 to 0.5 mg/min) to obtain a wide range of oxidative metabolism. The PET imaging protocol consisted of 15O2 emission (OEF and MMRo2), transmission. [15O]CO emission (blood pool), and [15O)CO2 emission (myocardial blood flow PET data (OEF(pet)) by three different analytical techniques; steady-state, 5-minute, and 8-minute autoradiographic analyses. Reference measurements of MBF (MBF(ref)) and OEF (OEF(ref)) were obtained during 15O2 inhalation with radiolabeled microspheres and paired arterial and coronary sinus blood sampling, respectively. MMBo2 was calculated from the PET (MMRo(2pet)) and the reference (MMRo(2ref)) data as follows MMRo2=OEFxMBVX(O2-content of arterial blood). OEF measured by the steady-state PET method was well correlated with the reference data over the range 0.16 to 0.73 (OEF(pet) = 1.03 OEF(ref) - 0.01, r=.97), as was MMRo2 over the range 2.4 to 27.5 mL · min-1 · 100 g (MMRo(2pet) =0.98 MMRo(2ref) +0.91, r=.94). OEF(pet) calculated by sue of the 5-minute and 8-minute autoradiographic analyses were equally well correlated with the reference measurements (r=.95 and r=.97, respectively. There were so significant differences between values of MMRo(2 pet) calculated by use of the steady-state, 5-minute, and 8-minute autoradiographic analyses (P=NS by ANOVA). Regional values of MBF(pet), OEF(pet) and MMRo(2pet) were homogeneously distributed and similar to the whole-heart values both a baseline and during the various pharmacological interventions. Conclusions: Accurate quantification of OEF and MMRo2 is feasible with 15O2 inhalation and PET imaging using both the steady-state and autoradiographic analytical approaches. These studies suggest the applicability of this method for quantitative assessment of regional cardiac oxidative metabolism in clinical studies.","metabolism; myocardium; oxygen; tomography","adenosine; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; isoprenaline; morphine; oxygen 15; propranolol; animal experiment; arterial blood; article; autoradiography; carbon dioxide excretion; controlled study; coronary sinus blood flow; dog; heart muscle oxygen consumption; hemodynamics; metabolic rate; nonhuman; oxygen breathing; positron emission tomography; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029737631

A higher fidelity, horizontal transport scheme, switchable CB-IV/SAPRC chemistries with added toxic VOC species, a more sophisticated chemical equation integrator, and new user-friendly features and pre-, post-, and graphical processors have been added to both the urban- and regional-scale model versions. New, regional-scale model features include the flexibility to operate on a variety of horizontal meshes (e.g., Lambert conformal) and the inclusion of grid-cell-specific clouds and solar angle in the computation of photolysis rates. The paper describes the formulation of each of these modules and an application of the regional CALGRID to the 5-11 July 1988 time period covering an 800×1000 km domain of the northeastern U.S. commonly referred to as the MOCA domain. Emissions and boundary and initial conditions were remapped from ROM2.2 applications and meteorological data were obtained from a CALMET simulation. CALGRID was exercised at a 20×20 ion resolution using 14 fixed layers up to 3500 m. GOES-7 satellite visual band cloud data was used to compute solar UV and visible in;irradiances for both CALGRID and CALMET. CALGRID's performance for this episode generally exceeded that of comparable regional models such as ROM2.2 and UAM-V. During the 6-8 July ozone episode, ROM2.2 consistently overpredicts the concentrations on the southwest inflow corner of the New England domain. This overprediction has made it difficult for the UAM-IV modelers in New England to sort out the effects of local emissions reductions whose effects are dwarfed by the amounts of ozone entering the domain from the southwest. Boundary conditions provided by CALGRID are substantially in agreement with the ozone surface observations. The assimilation of high resolution satellite cloud data into both CALGRID and CALMET seems to provide critical improvement over simple NWS cloud interpolation, or a parameterized cloud model.",,"Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Regional planning; Volatile organic compounds; CALGRID ozone model; Ozone surface observation; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17544386178

Y. Liu, H. Yang, and T. Romeo, J. Bacteriol. 177:2663-2672, 1995). When endogenous glycogen levels in isogenic csrA+ and csrA::kanR strains were quantified during the growth curve, both the rate of glycogen accumulation during late exponential or early stationary phase and its subsequent rate of degradation were found to be greatly accelerated by the csrA::kanR mutation. The expression of the biosynthetic genes glgA (glycogen synthase) and glgS was observed to be negatively modulated via csrA. Thus, csrA is now known to control all of the known glycogen biosynthetic genes (glg), which are located in three different operons. Similarly, the expression of the degradative enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which is encoded by glgY, was found to be negatively regulated via csrA in vivo. The in vitro transcription-translation of glgY was also specifically inhibited by the purified CsrA gene product. These results demonstrate that localization of glycogen biosynthetic and degradative genes within the Escherichia coli glgCAY operon facilitates their coordinate genetic regulation, as previously hypothesized (T.

The incremental cost of CO2 emission reduction is calculated. The main subject of paper is a zero-emissions power plant. The plant is based on air separation unit, combustion of arbitrary fossil fuel in the mixture of oxygen/carbon dioxide, expansion in CO2 turbines (240/60 bar, 600 °C and 60/4 bar, 1200 °C), CO2 compression and condensation, sequestering of liquid CO2 in a deep aquifer through depleted gas/oil wells (stack downward). Essentially new, very efficient power plant cycle is presented. It is referred to as quasicombined due to replacement of ordinary bottoming steam Rankine cycle by the topping one, using the same CO2 as a working substance. The detailed cycle computer simulation (made by Zvagolsky and Gavrilenko) along with the thermodynamic properties of combustion products calculations is discussed.

The development of an ozone attainment strategy involves many iterations of the photochemical grid model to determine which source regions, source categories, and emission types (i.e., VOC and NOx must be controlled to reduce ozone most effectively. Because photochemical grid model simulations are computationally demanding, not all permutations of controls can be analyzed and the potential exists for controlling sources that contribute little to the high ozone concentrations or, conversely, not controlling sources that contribute significantly to the high ozone concentrations. We have developed a method for estimating the contribution of emissions from specified source regions, source categories and times of day to ozone concentrations estimated by the UAM. The method also discriminates between ozone production occurring under VOC- or NOx limited conditions. The resulting ozone source apportionments are displayed to aid in the design of optimally effective ozone control strategies. In other words, the ozone source apportionment modeling tool shows clearly which are the major sources contributing to high ozone levels so that control strategies can focus on these sources.

Bend tests were performed at temperatures from liquid nitrogen temperature to room temperature and yield strength, maximum strength and bend angle were calculated in each temperature. In this study the low-temperature fracture strength and ductility of a material were represented by the critical stress and the critical temperature, respectively. Fracture surfaces of the specimens failed at low temperatures were examined by using a scanning electron microscope and crack initiation and propagation characteristics were investigated. The results are summarized as follows. (1) For the alloy with lower titanium content (e.g. Mo-0·1 mass%Ti alloy): the critical stress, the critical temperature and the fracture mode were almost unchanged after heating in vacuum. In this case it is deduced that carbon exists as free carbon and carbides at the grain boundaries. During heating, reduction of free carbon occurred by decarburizing, but it was compensated by the carbon produced by the resolution of carbides in a manner similar to pure molybdenum. Consequently there still remained enough carbon to strengthen the grain boundaries. (2) For the alloy with higher titanium content (e.g. Mo-1·0 mass%Ti alloy): the critical stress remarkably decreased and the critical temperature increased after heating in vacuum. The fracture mode also changed from transgranular to intergranular. In this case it is deduced that carbon exists as free carbon both at the grain boundaries and at the interfaces between titanium-oxides and matrix. During heating, only the reduction of free carbon proceeded and consequently the grain boundaries became short of carbon. © 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.",,"Bending strength; Crack initiation; Crack propagation; Ductility; Fracture testing; Low temperature properties; Microscopic examination; Molybdenum alloys; Strength of materials; Titanium alloys; Fracture strength; Refractory metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030382526

A re-positioning of health and social care has taken place in the light of this pre-eminence of market forces with the assumption increasingly being made that potential service users operate on a 'level playing field' of opportunity. A major consequence has been the expansion of household health responsibilities through measures which include a greater emphasis on preventative screening and healthy lifestyles and a general shift in the locus of care to the 'community'. Not only has the last decade seen this intensification of pressure on women in their social role as family carers, a restructuring has taken place of the U.K. labour market such that the 'double burden' of paid and unpaid work is an increasingly common experience. Contrary to the policy view of equality of access, in-depth interview evidence from Liverpool shows that the health care behaviour of many women is increasingly constrained by their social roles and availability of economic and social network resources. This paper distinguishes between groups who are and are not well equipped to cope in the light of changing structures of provision and discusses the implications of the research for the design and implementation of health and social care.","Gender; Health care; Household; Policy","community care; conference paper; female; government; health behavior; health care; health care policy; household; human; lifestyle; preventive medicine; responsibility; screening; social behavior; social care; United Kingdom; health care policy; health implication; policy climate; privatisation; social role; women's health; UK, England, Liverpool",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029669737

In particular, they provide a user-friendly minimum cost mechanism for investigating the impacts of policy. One such policy relates to increased urban densities. The rapid spread of low density suburbs in Australia is often seen as increasing individual travel and emissions. Yet the development of self-contained cities in outer suburban areas may enable people to work, live and recreate locally, thereby decreasing travel and reducing some of the concerns about outward growth. This paper therefore presents two computer model studies into different urban forms relating to sustainable development and the reduction of greenhouse emissions. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Greenhouse emissions; Urban density; Air pollution control; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Public policy; Urban planning; User interfaces; Environmental impact; computer model; environmental impact assessment; methodology; modelling approach; planning method; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030178114

Detection limits for terrestrial and Jovian planets orbiting Sun-like stars are presented by assuming Planck emission. We consider several potential sites including the south pole, a 5000-m elevation site in the Atacama Desert in Chile, Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and an aerostat-borne telescope flown near the poles. We consider extrasolar planet detection with a 10-m class mid-IR telescope and a dilute aperture stratospheric telescope consisting of 4-m mirrors optimized for this task. Detection in the submillimeter, even with a 104 m2 collecting area array is extremely difficult because of low atmospheric transparency, and the decrease (∝ λ-2) in planet emission with increasing wavelength in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit. We discuss critical technologies needed for this undertaking, including tethered aerostats and balloon-borne telescopes, the development of mid-IR nulling interferometry, actively cooled optics operating in the atmosphere, and optimized filters that are matched to the atmospheric transmission windows.

Although the helical transformation of MLT as determined from NMR is evident at lipid:peptide molar ratios as low as 1:2, tryptophan fluorescence measurements demonstrate that well-defined micellar complexes do not predominate until lipid:peptide ratios exceed 30:1. 31P linewidth measurements indicate that the interaction between phosphate ions in solution and cationic groups on MLT is pH dependent, and that the phosphoryl group of MMPC senses a constant charge, most likely +2, on MLT from pH 4 to pH 10. 13C-NMR relaxation data, analyzed using the model-free formalism, show that the peptide backbone of MLT is partially, but not completely, immobilized in the mixed micelles. Specifically, order parameters (S2) of Cα-H vectors averaged ~0.7 and were somewhat larger for residues in the N-terminal half of the molecule. The amino terminal glycine had essentially the same range of motion as the backbone carbons. Likewise, order parameters for the trp side chain were similar to those found for the peptide Cα moieties, as was verified by trp fluorescence anisotropy decay data. In contrast, the motion of the lysine side chains was less restricted, the average S2 values for the Cε-H vectors being 0.19, 0.30, and 0.44 for lys- 7, 21, and 23, respectively, for MLT in the mixed micelles. Values of the effective correlation time of the local motion τ(o) were in the motional narrowing limit and usually longer for side-chain atoms than for those in the backbone. The dynamics were independent of pH from pH 4 to pH 9, but at pH 11 the correlation time for the rotational motion of the mixed micelles as a whole increased from 10 ns to 16 ns, and S2 for the lys side chains increased. Overall it appears that the MLT helix lies near the surface of the micelle at low to neutral pH, but at higher pH its orientation changes, accompanied by deeper penetration of the lys side chains into the micelle interior. It is apparent, however, that the MLT-lipid interaction is not dependent on deprotonation of any of the titratable cationic groups in the peptide in the pH 4-10 range, and that there is substantial backbone and side-chain mobility in micelle-bound MLT.",,"melittin; phosphatidylcholine; amino acid analysis; article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; dynamics; lipid bilayer; micelle; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; protein analysis; protein lipid interaction; protein secondary structure; protein structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030012220

The results demonstrate that, when the energy level of the charge-transfer (CT) state is lowered below that of the localized excited state by appropriate substituents, there is a strong electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interaction in the ground state which is absent in other bichromophores. Absorption and fluorescence excitation studies revealed that there is an unusually strong EDA interaction in the ground state of A-2 which is absent in other members in the A series.When A-2 is excited directly into this EDA absorption, it exhibits two CT emissions, one at 490 nm and the other at 605 nm. The quantum yield (τ(f))and the lifetime (Φ(f)) of the two emissions are dependent on the viscosity of the alkane solvent. The Φ(f) and the τ(f) of the 490 nm emission increased when the solvent viscosity was increased; however, those of the 605 nm emission remained essentially unchanged. The risetime of the 605 nm emission is 420 ps, but that of the 490 nm emission is instrument-function limiting. The results suggest that the two CT emissions may be derived from the two different conformations of the CT state. The 490 nm emission may be derived from the trans conformer of A-2, which is the major conformer at equilibrium. The EDA interaction in the trans conformer of A-2 may be treated as a type of through-σ-bond interaction via the spacer between the n orbital of the anilino nitrogen and the π orbital of the anthryl group. The direct excitation of A-2 from its EDA ground state to the CT state indicates that PET may occur in a σ-linked bichromophoric system upon light absorption, thus reaching the limiting rate of a photochemical process.",,"anthracene derivative; article; electron transport; molecular dynamics; photochemistry; spectrophotometry; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029849457

The 13C KIE was of 1.020 in the temperature interval 90-133.7°C in this case. Copyright © 1996 Akadémiai Kiadó.

In the case of the assessment of OCS impacts on Houston, modeling showed that at times and locations where the federal ozone standard was exceeded, OCS contributions were minimal. This finding not only removes the probability of controls, but also greatly limits any probability of transfer of jurisdiction for OCS air quality from Minerals Management Service to EPA.

This approach can be very useful if one's primary purpose is to predict growth on the basis of a limited set of measurements. However, it is less likely to be successful if one purports to understand the regulation of growth in response to variations in, for instance, the nutrient concentrations in the environment. For such a purpose, models based on variable internal stores are more suited. In this paper, I present a variable internal stores model of microalgal growth, focusing on the kinetics of the limiting as well as the non-limiting nutrient. Data from chemostat steady states are well described by the model. The model provides an underpinning for the well established Droop equation for growth on a limiting nutrient. The model also shows that there is no meaningful basis for the Droop equation for non-limiting nutrients. It is likely that the approach followed in this paper can also be applied to the kinetics of carbon. With respect to the model presented in this paper, the main difference between carbon and other nutrients is the photosynthetically driven uptake of CO2. Once taken up, the kinetics of carbon may be similar to that of other nutrients.",,"growth; kinetics; microalgae; nutrient",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030251418

Cutajar said that industrialised countries needed to actively promote consumption patterns and energy-efficient technologies that reduced their per capita use of fossil fuels. Such an approach would create ""environmental space"" and enable developing countries to increase per capita consumption, he said. The Second Assessment Report, recently completed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)1, was the subject of much debate at both the AGBM meeting and the meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA),2 held the previous week. Cutajar's observations were confirmed by comments in various quarters that CO2 emission abatement targets were unlikely to be met. For example, the Norwegian Parliament recently abandoned the target of stabilising the country's CO2 emissions at 1989 levels by the year 2000. The Government currently forecasts a 16 per cent increase in CO2 emissions over that period. There are also recent indications that the Austrian Government has come to the conclusion that the Toronto target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the 1988 level by 20 per cent in the year 2005 is unrealistic. There were many energy taxation developments in the first quarter of 1996 that were, at least, ostensibly linked to the environment. While Germany's third party, the leftist-ecologist Greens, called for a DM5 ""ecology tax"" on fuel, Anna Lindh, Sweden's Environment Minister, announced a decision to double a carbon tax first introduced in 1990. Meanwhile, renewed pleas were heard from environmental groups and pro-tax European Union (EU) states for a carbon/energy tax as part of an EU energy policy. A World Bank delegate at an EU conference suggested that oil industry opposition to the tax could be reduced if the tax were not seen to penalise just oil. However, it was also reported in the first quarter that the EU may soon announce its abandonment of the long-debated carbon/energy tax. In the face of the continuing threat of the imposition of an EU carbon tax, Saudi Commerce Minister, Osama bin Jaafar bin Ibrahim Faquih, told delegates attending the eighth Asian ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 in Amman in January that oil and petrochemicals faced ""protectionist barriers in advanced countries' markets under the cover of environmental pretexts"". The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) estimates its members would suffer estimated losses exceeding $17.7 billion by the year 2000 if the EU imposed the carbon tax. The state of Minnesota in the United States is also considering the introduction of a $50-per-ton carbon tax on ail fuels and electricity consumed in the state; the tax is conceived as a revenue neutral tax, in contrast to recent Swedish and Austrian tax proposals. The increasing severity of urban air pollution across the globe continues to lead to attempts to improve air quality. Members of the Mexico City Pollution Control Commission announced in the first quarter details of a four-year programme to reduce air pollution in the capital, for example by retiring older cars through the elimination of looser emissions standards and by continuing the current one-day-a-week restrictions on private cars. Part of the funding for the new programme would come from gasoline taxes.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844446248
