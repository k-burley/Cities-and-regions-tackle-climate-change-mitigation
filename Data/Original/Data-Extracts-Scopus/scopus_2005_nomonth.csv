The household wastes quantities represent 80% of MSW, industrial (not heavy) is 5%.Cost benefit analysis of papers, plastic recycling showed that for the papers recycling of using 3% discount ratio produced the highest net present value (JD27,696,568), by this interest ratio the project will be more feasible. The higher feasibility is reflected through the highest benefit cost ratio (28.17), which was the highest under the 3% discount ratio. For the plastic recycling project, the results showed that under 3% discount ratio the highest net present value was achieved (JD 21,932,199), this, also, was approved through the benefit cost ratio (28.17). The results, also, showed that the paper recycling project was more feasible than the plastic recycling project. The net present value for the paper recycling project was (JD 27,696,568) as compared to (JD 21,684,627) for the plastic recycling project under the same discount ratio (3%). Constructing pilot project plant (bioreactor) for biogas production as first stage to handle 50-80 tones/day of pure organic materials (industrial) as dairy factories and slaughter houses will be very useful where a thermophilic fermentation can occur at around 55 C. The produced methane gas can be converted into electricity. Such these wastes are able to produce gases with methane of at least 65% and 35% of carbon dioxide. Normally such kinds of wastes can produce 400 cubic meters of methane/ tone which can be converted into around 800 kWHs of electricity. The more so the plant of 50 tones /day will produce around 40,000kWHs of electricity per day. Introducing similar technologies to deal with MSW of Amman city at least will reduce methane emissions by 30% and carbon dioxide by 2%.",,"Bioreactors; Cost benefit analysis; Electricity; Fermentation; Methane; Project management; Recycling; Household wastes; Plastic recycling; Thermophilic fermentation; Greenhouse effect",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847409262

Among the issues requiring consideration is the need to obtain high initial dilution, in order to minimize the excess concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, and hence associated increases in pCO2 and decreases in pH, to which aquatic life would be exposed. Here we examine three dilution strategies that promote mixing in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions. A point release of negatively buoyant solid CO2 hydrate particles from a moving ship would get acceptable dilution near the source, while subsequent concentrations would be very low due to longitudinal mixing afford by the ship's speed. A long bottom-mounted diffuser discharging buoyant liquid CO2 droplets can be designed for high lateral mixing, resulting in arbitrarily small near source concentrations, but because the resulting near field plume would be very wide, subsequent dilution would be slow. A stationary point release of hydrate particles achieves good vertical mixing, due to the negatively buoyant plume effect, resulting in intermediate local and subsequent concentrations. While directly applicable to ocean carbon sequestration, results presented here also provide guidance for the effective three-dimensional dispersal of other substances, such as nutrients for open water aquaculture, or flocculants or algaecides for improving water clarity in reservoirs or town ponds. © 2005 Old City Publishing, Inc.","CO2 hydrate; CO2 plume; Dilution; Ocean carbon sequestration; Ocean dispersion","Buoyancy; Carbon dioxide; Hydrates; Marine biology; Sensitivity analysis; Turbulent flow; Dilution; Ocean carbon sequestration; Ocean dispersion; Oceanography; air-sea interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolved inorganic carbon; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26444605887

A laboratory incubation study was conducted at Waste Management and Forage Research Unit, USDA-ARS with the objective of determining the effects of temperature and soil properties on water-soluble P (WSP), Mehlich 3 P, and P fractions in broiler litter-amended soils. Broiler litter was mixed with three soils (Leeper silty clay, Grenada silt loam, and Ruston sandy loam) at the rate of 10 Mg ha-1. The mixtures were incubated at 18°C, 25°C, and 32°C for up to 90 days and repeated three times. Soil samples were taken at eight time intervals (2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days) and analyzed for water-soluble P and Mehlich 3-extractable P (MEP). Phosphorus also was fractionated chemically into inorganic and organic components by sequential extraction for soil samples taken at the end of incubation period (90 days). Water-soluble P decreased rapidly after a 15-day incubation in all soils for all temperatures and followed to a steady state to the end of incubation period. Averaged across temperatures, broiler litter application resulted in a significant increase in all fractions compared with controls. However, the increase was greater for inorganic than for organic fractions. The concentration of calcium (Ca)-P fraction was highest in calcareous Grenada soil, which suggests that the presence of carbonates influence the fate of P from applied broiler litter. The coarse textured Ruston contained a greater concentration of water-soluble P (WSP) than the other soils. At 32°C, the concentration of plant-available P fractions [bicarbonate inorganic P (IP) and hydroxide IP] significantly increased and WSP decreased. It is likely that the higher temperature (32°C) promotes higher biological activity and lower water-soluble P than lower temperature.

In clastic reservoirs, clay characterization from logs is critical because it influences the computation of important petrophysical properties such as porosity, permeability, and water saturation. The formations of the Niger Delta region are predominantly composed of facies successions of open marine shelf and wave-dominated shoreface environments. The minerals associated with these formations are mainly mixtures of quartz, kaolinite, smectite, and illite with traces of feldspars, pyrite, and carbonate. Traditional measurements based on naturally occurring gamma ray radiation frequently overestimate clay and shale volume because of formation gamma activity not solely related to clay minerals. In many of these situations, a calculation from neutron and density data yields a more accurate clay volume, but in the presence of gas or light hydrocarbons this approach is less accurate. Moreover, for both the techniques (gamma ray and neutron-density combination), selection of clean-sand and shale endpoints is subjective, leading to more potential errors in clay (shale) volume computation. To achieve a more accurate clay volume and porosity, a wireline spectroscopy tool, along with other openhole logs and a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tool, was run in a few wells. Spectroscopy aids in an improved clay volume estimate and in so doing, a more accurate porosity can be computed. The spectroscopy-supported porosities (total, clay-bound, and capillary-bound) and permeability are in good agreement with NMR results. Utilizing new logging technologies in some older fields greatly enhances and can be used to corroborate the petrophysical models derived from standard and in many cases limited logging suites. Spectroscopy also helped in correlating petrophysical answers with depositional environment. By combining with core mineral analysis and magnetic resonance data, the sands with lowest feldspar content yielded the highest permeability. These sands with larger grain sizes were deposited in the higher energy, more proximal tidal and upper shoreface environments and also explained the wide variation (20 to 70 API) observed in the gamma ray response of reservoir sands. © 2005, held jointly by the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) and the submitting authors.",,"Feldspar; Kaolinite; Nuclear magnetic logging; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Porosity; Pyrites; Sand; Shale; Tidal power; Clastic reservoirs; Depositional environment; Formation evaluation; Gamma ray radiation; Naturally occurring; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR); Petrophysical models; Petrophysical properties; Gamma rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058051590

The new version of the TEE model (TEE2003) has been developed with many features allowing the user to better analyse transport related impacts, taking into account: vehicle kinematics, cold emission distribution, parking process, emissions of new categories of pollutants, noise emissions and accident occurrence. As regards the kinematics, TEE code can calculate link emissions starting from standard correlations based on average speed or from instantaneous emissions data. This flexibility allows detailed emissions calculations, according to the traffic input data available, either from measurements or from traffic models. As it concerns the estimation of the effects of cold emissions, spatial and temporal distributions, TEE offers alternative solutions for the user, according to the more or less disaggregated information, allowing one in any case to distinguish different situations (e.g. morning traffic in residential areas or evening traffic in city centres where cold vehicles represent a majority). The parking process algorithm provides an approximated but meaningful treatment of traffic flows from and to parking areas allowing the location of cold vehicle emissions in space and time and a greater accuracy in the estimation of evaporative emissions distribution. The pollutants added within the TEE2003 version are N2O, Benzene, PM10, Aromatics, Benzo-(A)-pyrene, PAH, Dioxins and Furans. Two new models have been inserted: the noise emission model, and the accident occurrence model. The first model is sensitive to vehicle speed and heavy-duty vehicle presence. The accident model calculates the total number of accidents involving only vehicles or vehicles and pedestrians.

The major air pollutants of concern are identified as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and particulate matter. Thermal power plants and transport sector is the biggest contributor of air pollution in the country. Ambient air around large industrial sources and metropolitan cities has already shown pollutant levels above the standards set by Central Pollution Control Board. India. Experimental studies conducted at Varanasi situated in upper Gangetic plains of India have indicated significant losses of agricultural production at current ambient pollutant levels in urban, suburban and rural areas. The intensity of losses, however, depends upon the pollutant concentration, duration of exposure, climatic and edaphic factors, plant species and cultivars. Pollutants either affect the plants directly by causing visible injury or indirectly growth or yield reductions without visible injury. Reductions in leaf area, biomass, chlorophyll, ascorbic acid and N contents have often been observed for the crop species growing in polluted area. Field transect studies have shown significant negative correlations between air pollutant concentrations and net photosynthesis, biomass accumulation and yield of crop plants. Monocot plants are found to be more resistant than dicot plants. Leguminous plants and leafy vegetables are most sensitive to air pollutants among the crop plants. Winter crops showed relatively lower magnitude of yield losses at different sites than summer crops. Quality of seeds also varied between urban, suburban and rural sites. Variations in nutrient, metabolite and energy contents of seeds directly corresponded to the levels of air pollutants at different sites. At urban and suburban sites, the magnitude of response involved all pollutants, whereas at rural site ozone had more influence. Ozone seems to play a major role in yield loss as maximum reductions in yield and quality of seeds were recorded at sites showing highest O3 concentrations. Simulation experiments conducted in closed top or open top chambers have also confirmed the adverse impacts of individual pollutants on plants. National ambient air quality standards are mainly based on health impact, hence a revision of the same taking into account climatic conditions; type of vegetation and soil is urgently required to save crops from adverse impacts of air pollution. Economic evaluation of crop loss due to air pollution is an important need of the future to secure food for growing population of the country. Long-term studies are required all along the country to identify the high and low risk zones of air pollution in different regions to develop control policy for reducing adversities of air pollution on vegetation.","Agriculture; Air pollution; Vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645233870

Five kinds of CO2 sequestration technologies are modeled: enhanced oil recovery, depleted gas well sequestration, enhanced coal-bed methane, aquifer sequestration, and ocean sequestration. The divided regions are interlinked through transportations of CO2 and various kinds of energies. The model is an intertemporal optimization type; the objective function is the total cost of energy systems plus CO2 sequestration between 2000 and 2050. Energy supply systems and CO2 capture and sequestration technologies are represented in the bottom-up fashion in order to evaluate technological strategies of CO2 emission mitigation technologies. CO2 sequestration potentials of the 77 divided regions were estimated based on several geographical information systems (GIS) data. The model analysis results show that CO2 sequestration accounts for a large part of the total CO2 emission reduction; the amounts of the cumulative world CO2 sequestration between 2000 and 2050 are about 45 GtC and 65 GtC with and without emission trading, respectively, and that the cost effective strategies differ by region. In the emission trading case, all the four types of underground CO2 sequestration technologies are utilized for US; the sequestration into ocean and aquifer are utilized for Japan.

In order to meet such demand, the optimum design of the fuel supply system is the most effective method. In the carburetor, the core component of the fuel supply system used on a majority of current models, a 25% improvement in the accuracy of air-fuel ratio fluctuation, as well as a 15% reduction in size, have been achieved in comparison with past models. On the other hand, in fuel injection systems, the use of which is gradually expanding, it is essential that the components be highly functional with high performance, while at the same time being of a compact size. In regards to the injector, optimum spray form and a 30% reduction in size have been realized by utilizing injection simulation techniques. As for the fuel pump, a unit capable of operating with an electrical current of less than 1 amp has been developed by optimizing the design of the pump rotor. For the throttle body, the number of sensor components has been reduced by 21 while at the same time stable control at minute airflow volumes has also been achieved. In regards to the ECU, with the use of integrated-function custom IC components and high-density surface mounting, both a reduction in size and also an increase in possible function range have been realized. As a result of these activities, system components to constitute a fuel injection system easily installed in and suitable for the wide range of engine frames and engine characteristics of small size engines have been developed.

The CESI experience on a grid connected PEFC system fuelled with hydrogen stored in metal hydrides is outlined in this presentation with emphasis on all the aspects related to subsystem interlacing. A 6,5 Nm3 capacity hydrogen storage was developed at CESI starting from commercial metal hydride powders supplied by LabTech Ltd. The heat transfer during the charge - discharge cycles and the useful hydrogen output were optimised in view of the coupling with a PEFC stack/module operating near ambient pressure. Three Independence 1000 PEFC modules were supplied by ReliOn and carefully characterised at CESI laboratories. This module is a rather open system and a lot of parameters can be acquired at operating conditions including all the cell and cartridges voltages, currents and temperatures. The module responses to an external electric load were investigated both in steady state conditions, by increasing gradually the load, and during steep load changes. The actual hydrogen consumption was measured at different operating conditions and LHV and HHV efficiencies were obtained as a function of the power output. The PEFC modules were connected to the local grid through a 3.3 kW DC-AC converter (inverter) that was supplied by SGS Future based on CESI specifications. The inverter efficiency exceeded 90%. A control system was set up in a LabVIEW™ environment to manage the hydrogen storage charge and discharge cycles and to test the PEFC - inverter system behaviour on different load profiles. Experimental results on the integrated system are presented and discussed. A few critical aspects related to each subsystem and to their interfaces are analysed This work was carried out in the frame of the research on the Italian Electrical System ""Ricerca di Sistema"", Ministerial Decrees of January 26, 2000 and April 17, 2001.",,"Energy vector; Fossil fuel resources; Metal hydrides; Primary energy sources; Carbon dioxide; Energy storage; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Renewable energy resources; Solid oxide fuel cells; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646561212

A significant component of this project included understanding the issues associated with distributed generation connected to the local utility grid and how this would impact both the customer and the grid. An added benefit would be to provide a fuel cell education site that is accessible to other AE customers and the general public. The site selected for the project is the city-owned Rebekah Baines Johnson Health Center, which houses the city health clinic. Since the Health Center had existing redundant 1,000,000 btu per hour boilers for HVAC dessicant drying and building heat along with a domestic hot water heater, the site presented an opportunity for using the waste heat generated by the fuel cell power plant in a combined heat and power application. Using a federal grant of $200, 000 from the Climate Change Program administered by the U. S. Department of Defense, AE installed a 200-kW UTC Power Model PC25™C Fuel Cell. This fuel cell was the first in Texas to feed electric power into the utility grid. Commercial operation began July 2, 2002. The issues to be worked through in many areas proved to be difficult, but doable, and many lessons have been learned along the way. The performance results have been impressive proving that this technology is not only technically viable in commercial applications but reliable as well. The lessons learned from this project have proven valuable and a number of key issues will be shared in this paper.

Some of the challenges that rise during the development of tight heterogonous gas reservoirs are: initial drop in the productivity of some wells, liquid dropout, the need to mechanically fracture wells in some areas to sustain high production rates, and the need for non-conventional wells (multilateral/maximum reservoir contacts) to efficiently deplete such type of tight reservoirs. Each one of the above challenges requires special technical treatment in order to simulate fluid movements with high confidence levels of accuracy. For example, comprehensive reservoir and fluid characterization studies, that captures important fluid behavior/drives inside the complex rock textures, are vital for realistic and reliable simulation. Implementation of local grid refinement near well bore, using conventional and unconventional girding, is essential to correctly simulate production mechanism across and around the induced fracture systems. Careful design of simulation grid systems, efficient lumping of gas components (Fluid Characterization) and business-driven up-scaling were main keys to speed up the delivery of accurate solutions with practical approximations. In this paper, a case history for a tight gas reservoir that has been explored, developed and operated by Saudi Aramco, will be used to highlight the day-to-day challenges that are facing simulation engineering, utilizing state-of-art soft/hardware technologies, to come up with feasible and cost-effective development scenarios that can be confidently considered in the decision-making process.

These simulation methods are discussed showing that their accuracy during the intake stroke is neglected. Since most of the modern engines use strong structured air motion during the intake and compression strokes to both reduce consumption and reach different emissions levels targets, one may focus on in-cylinder aerodynamics and convective heat transfer coupling. The experimental velocity data acquired allow us to get an in-depth understanding of the spatial and temporal gradients of measured heat transfers in the cylinder of an internal combustion engine. Two different experimental methods have been used to investigate the in-cylinder air motion. First, near wall flow has been studied using two component local time-resolved Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). Heat transfers are measured by thin-film fast-response heat flux probe constituted of two thermocouples. Velocity and turbulence intensity are analysed by the cycle resolved method. For a global time-resolved analysis of in-cylinder aerodynamics Time Resolved Planar Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV) fields are analysed. The comparison of the TR-PIV and LDA measurements gives a detailed description of the effect of in cylinder aerodynamics on the near wall flow characteristics. Parametric analysis of the motored optical test-engine conditions effects on heat transfers and flow fields is presented. In parallel to physics understanding, experimental databases built here are then of a great interest to check quality of the different models implemented in CFD software. A first evaluation of a local convection coefficient formula during the intake stroke is then carried out. Thermal experimental data compared to this correlation demonstrate a great underestimation of the simulated coefficient during the intake stroke leading to an underestimation of the heat transfer from the wall to the gas.

In this study the effect of carbon additions on the microstructure of a model Ni-based superalloy, LMSX-1, was examined. Previous results have shown that the tendency of the alloy to form all types of solidification defects decreased as the carbon content increased. The as-cast microstructures also exhibited a decrease in the amount of γ-γ' eutectic structure and an increase in the volume fraction of carbides and porosity, as the carbon content was increased. The carbides formed in these alloys were mostly script-type MC carbides which formed continuous, dendritic networks in the interdendritic region. Microprobe analysis of the as-cast structures showed that the partitioning coefficients did not change with carbon additions. Therefore the reduction in defect formation with increasing carbon content could not be attributed to changes in segregation behavior of alloying elements. Instead, the presence of these carbides in the interdendritic regions of the alloy appears to have prevented the thermosolutal fluid flow.",,"Carbon content; Grain defects; Partitioning coefficients; Single crystal Ni-based superalloy; Carbon; Defects; Grain boundaries; Microstructure; Single crystals; Superalloys; Nickel alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645987020

The increased severity of legislative pressure means that performance of waste treatment plants must become ever more efficient if discharge consents are to be met. Treatment plants are now hard pressed to meet the new regime. Over the last thirty years there have been some significant advances leading to substantial improvements in performance. The introduction of different modes of contacting gave a boost to treatment efficiency, as did more sophisticated analysis of both biological and engineering aspects of plant design and operation. However, more recently, the rate of improvement has diminished and today the performance of modern plant is increasing only gradually. Designers and operators are working ever harder to gain even small improvements. As the complexity of biological treatment plants becomes more apparent, the sophistication of the methods needed to analyse and control it increases.

The vehicles operated in Southern California and were nominally identical. Three vehicles operated ""as-is"" on California Air Resources Board (CARB) specification diesel fuel and no emission control devices. Three vehicles were retrofit with Johnson Matthey CCRT® (Catalyzed Continuously Regenerating Technology) filters and fueled with Shell GTL Fuel. Two rounds of emissions tests were conducted on a chassis dynamometer over the City Suburban Heavy Vehicle Route (CSHVR) and the New York City Bus (NYCB) cycle. The CARB-fueled vehicles served as the baseline, while the GTL-fueled vehicles were tested with and without the CCRT filters. Results from the first round of testing have been reported previously (see 2004-01-2959). The second round results were compared to the CARB specification diesel fuel baseline. Over the CSHVR cycle, the GTL Fuel (no filter) reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO x), hydrocarbon (HC), and particulate matter (PM) emissions by 13%, 46%, and 21%, respectively, and increased carbon monoxide (CO) by 11%. The GTL Fuel and the CCRT filter virtually eliminated the HC, CO, and PM emissions and reduced NOx emissions by 22%, a statistically significant reduction. Testing over the NYCB cycle also revealed emission reductions are possible with GTL Fuel. Compared to the CARB specification diesel fuel, the GTL Fuel provided statistically significant reductions in NOx, HC, and PM emissions by 11%, 58%, and 16%, respectively. A 10% increase in CO emissions was also noted, although not statistically significant. With the CCRT filter, the HC, CO, and PM emissions were reduced by over 95%. A statistically significant NOx reduction of 20% was observed. Reductions from round 2 were notably larger than those in round 1. To determine if the changes observed between rounds were ""real"", a statistical analysis was performed. The analysis found that CO emissions were higher without the filter in round 2, while no changes were observed for HC or PM emissions. The NOx emissions were significantly higher in round 1 for the NYCB cycle only. The fleet was followed for operability for 6 months and accumulated ∼20,000 miles. Driver feedback for the vehicles operating on the GTL Fuel and CCRT filters was very positive. An analysis determined that the fuel economy with the combination of GTL Fuel and CCRT filters decreased by 8%. Evaluation of the maintenance records did not reveal any impact of the GTL fuel or CCRT filters on operability.

(TDA) is developing a simple system that provides an effective way of interfacing the carbondioxide (CO2) removal and reduction functions. The system uses a chemical absorbent and a Sabatier catalyst combination to remove the CO2 and water vapor (H 2O) produced by metabolic processes from cabin air and subsequently reduce the CO2 to methane and water. The system has the potential to weigh less than the Four Bed Molecular Sieve and CO2 Reduction Assembly combination, which is connected with a CO2 pump/compressor and storage tank due to the high CO2 absorption capacity of the sorbent and its ability to simultaneously absorb both CO2 and H 2O (which eliminates the need for desiccant beds in the Four Bed Molecular Sieve System). The system does not require a CO2 pump/compressor or storage tank offering energy savings that come from effective utilization of the heat released by the Sabatier reaction to drive sorbent regeneration. Previously, TDA developed a high capacity regenerable CO 2 and H2O sorbent to support the operation of the system and showed that the sorbent maintains its activity over extended cycling (Alptekin et al., 2003). We also demonstrated the operation of a state-of-the-art catalyst under the operation conditions of interest (Alptekin et al., 2003). Recently, TDA built a prototype of the system to demonstrate the key aspects of the process. This paper briefly describes the prototype system and summarizes the results of the demonstration tests.

The composite was produced initially using plane weave carbon fiber and phenolic resin. The carbonization of the phenolic resin was carried out at 1000°C in an argon environment for several hours. A Nd:YAG pulsed laser with 10 Hz repetition rate was used to irradiate the workpiece. The laser output power intensity could be changed between two levels: low and high power intensity. SEM and EDS were carried out to examine the surface of the composite and quantify the elemental composition in the region irradiated by the laser beam. It was found that at low power intensities, high temperature oxidation reactions result in the decomposition of carbon fibers and globules-like particles form on the surface. In the case of high power intensities, surface ablation and no resolidification of carbon is observed after the ablation process. This, in turn, results in a deep cavity with almost no taper.","Carbon fiber; Composite; Laser treatment","Argon; Carbon fibers; Carbonization; Composite materials; Flame resistance; High temperature effects; Irradiation; Laser beams; Mechanical properties; Oxidation; Phenolic resins; Reinforcement; Argon environment; High temperature oxidation; Laser treatment; Power intensity; Laser applications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11344263139

This can be achieved through the plant-life extension and upgrading of existing schemes, as well as by the sustainable development of new projects according to the needs, opportunities and resources available. Hydropower is the world's largest source of renewable energy used for power generation; it accounts for 19 percent of the world's supply (by 2010 wind power is expected to contribute 0.6 percent and solar power 0.12 percent. Hydropower is also a truly global resource, as more than 150 countries generate hydroelectric power. There is about 730 GW of hydro capacity in operation worldwide, generating 2650 TWh/year. A further 101 GW is under construction and 338 GW is at the planning stage. Hydropower plays an important role in reducing global GHG emissions by an estimated 10 percent per annum; in its current role, hydropower offsets 4.4 million barrels of oil-equivalent (thermal electric generation) each day. There is vast unexploited potential worldwide for new hydro plants, with only 33 percent of the economic potential having been developed so far. The majority of the remaining potential exists in lesser developed countries in Asia, South America and Africa. For example, Europe has developed 75 percent of its economic potential, whereas Africa has only developed seven percent. Hydropower technologie s are reliable, advanced and efficient. The energy conversion efficiency of 80 to 93 percent is far higher than that for other major types of power plant. The level of service from the various types of hydro scheme varies from base-load supply, typically from run-of-river schemes, to peak-load and system-back-up services from hydro storage schemes. In regions where there is long-developed hydro capacity, plant-life extension can be achieved by the replacement of equipment within existing infrastructure; this can extend the operating life by a further 30 to 50 years. Small-scale, decentralised developmen t has been responsible for bringing light and power to remote communities. Such schemes have catalysed local commercial diversification and prosperity. The lower investment demand of smaller schemes has enabled private sector involvement through independent power production. Typically smaller schemes become grid connected if the power system is accessible, as this increases the security of supply. Furthermore, schemes at remote sites can assist transmission system stability. A further important role of smaller scale hydro is the recovery of energy at water infrastructure developed for other purposes. In many countries, large schemes play a s ignificant role in national and regional supply security due to the flexibility of storage reservoirs and independence from fuel price fluctuations. Hydro also integrates well with other generation technologies, with its flexibility enabling thermal plants to operate steadily (saving fuel and reducing emissions). In addition, its responsiveness permits the back-up of the intermittent renewables. The question of storage is clearly a major iss ue in balancing supply and demand. Hydro reservoirs and pumped-storage schemes offer security in the stability and reliability of power systems; they can absorb power when there is an excess and follow load demand instantaneously. A major challenge is that 'support' and 'storage' services are rarely understood and encouraged in the market-driven arena. The main arguments against h ydropower concern its social impacts, such as land transformation, displacement of people, and environmental changes, i.e. fauna, flora, sedimentation and water quality. The social and environmental impacts can, however, be mitigated by taking appropriate steps according to established codes of good practice. As a tool for this purpose, the hydropower sector has recently developed and adopted Sustainability Guidelines. These Guidelines are currently being tested by a number of governments and international organisations.",,"Climate change; Greenhouse effect; Hydroelectric power; Particulate emissions; Power generation; Power plants; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Wind power; Reservoir emissions; Synergy; Thermal power plants; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; energy policy; hydroelectric power; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25444440352

Therefore, the amount of power being generated varies widely depending on the time of day, day of the week, and atmospheric conditions such as cold spells and heat waves. While the amount of power varies, it is recognized that maximum efficiencies are achieved by operating power generation systems at or near steady state conditions. With this in mind, there has been an increased use of gas turbine systems that may be quickly added online to the grid to provide additional power because gas turbine systems are typically well suited for being brought online quickly to provide spinning reserve or electrical generation. However, gas turbines are recognized as not being as efficient as other plant systems such as large steam plants because the gas turbine is an open cycle system where approximately 60 to 70 percent of the energy is lost as exhaust waste heat energy. One recognized method of increasing gas turbine efficiencies is to add a steam bottoming cycle to the exhaust system. However, these closed cycle systems are costly and they compromise the gas turbine's quick starting capability. This paper discusses an open bottoming cycle that is simple, cost effective and well suited for peaking power generation service. It not only substantially improves the gas turbine simple cycle plant heat rate, but also provides the opportunity to greatly reduce the NOX emissions levels with the application of a low temperature SCR.

The comparison assumes that the same amount of biomass that is imported in alternative A is supplied to a stand-alone hydrogen production plant and that the gasified black liquor in alternative B is used in a BLGCC (Black Liquor Gasification Combined Cycle) CHP unit. The comparison is based upon equal amounts of black liquor fed to the gasifier, and identical steam and power requirements for the pulp mill.

A single cylinder research engine has been modified to enable direct injection of a small quantity of natural gas through the spark plug to the region of the electrodes, independent of the overall lean homogeneous charge. Thus, a Partially Stratified Charge (PSC) is formed within the chamber allowing significant extension of the lean limit of combustion. Although PSC has been shown to reduce NOX emissions and improve combustion efficiency, high hydrocarbon emissions have been observed and this was thought to be due to poor mixing of the injected fuel air charge. The mixed experimental-numerical activity described herein, carried out by the Universities of British Columbia of Vancouver and Roma Tor Vergata, is aimed at improving the micro-direct injection PSC process. The numerical study has enabled a detailed analysis of the fluid dynamics and combustion processes in the region of the electrodes, early in the combustion cycle. The model has been verified using experimental data from the single cylinder research engine.

In UK cities cold-starting vehicles directly into congested traffic conditions is a common occurrence that is not currently taken into account when modeling urban traffic pollution. In-vehicle emission samples were taken directly from the exhaust, upstream and downstream of the catalyst, using the bag sampling technique. The first bag was for the cold start emissions and approximately the first 1.1 km of travel. The following three bags were with a hotter catalyst. The cold start tests were conducted over a year, with ambient temperatures ranging from 2°C to 30°C. The results showed that CO emissions for the cold start were reduced by 70% downstream of the catalyst when the ambient temperature rose from 2°C to 30°C. The corresponding hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by 41% and NOx emissions were increased by 90%. The influence of ambient temperature was less when the catalyst was fully warmed up. The results showed that ambient temperature had a greater influence on cold start emission under traffic jam conditions than in previous work with real world driving closer to the ECE passenger car drive cycle.

The bounding slopes have a variety of morphologies and sediment types. Dates from Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 and 3 have been obtained from sediments recovered from Húnaflóaáll (N. Iceland), Djúpáll (NW Iceland), and the Látra Bank (W. Iceland). Sediments of this age have also been recovered from the slope of W and NW Iceland above the Denmark Strait sill, and from the base of the slope below Djúpáll. However, it is still not clear where the margins of the Iceland Ice Cap were located during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). It appears probable that the extent of ice on the North West Peninsula was restricted during the LGM and did not extend any distance across Djúpáll (the trough which extends from Ísafjar{eth}ardjúp to the shelf break). In places on the shelf, cores have penetrated through Holocene and late glacial marine sediments into underlying diamictons. Radiocarbon dates from sediments immediately above diamictons from troughs off N and SW Iceland give dates on deglaciation of ca 13.4k±14C yr BP (with a 400 yr ocean reservoir correction). It appears that deglaciation of the shelf occurred rapidly after ca 13.4k±14C yr BP and the ice was grounded near the present coast by 12.5 k 14C yr BP. On the NW and N Iceland shelves, 3.5 kHz seismic surveys reveal regional reflectors which can be tracked over 10s to 100s of kilometers. Recovery of sediment cores which penetrate these reflectors indicate that they mark the Saksunarvatn and Vedde ashes with ages of 9k±and 10.3k±14C yr BP. A variety of evidence, including foraminifera and carbonate variations, suggests that the Holocene of N Iceland in particular was marked by rapid changes in oceanography. In the last 5k yr there has been a noticeable cooling of the climate, which led to the reoccurrence of species of cold water benthic forminifera and a reduction in net carbonate production.

The proposed idea describes an approach, based on an artificial life environment, for on-line optimization of complex processes for energy production. Such approach is based on evolutionary control methodology that by emulating the mechanism of the biological evolution, composes the capability of elaborate models with the continuous learning. In order to work with MSWC (Municipal Solid Waste Combustion) it was necessary to improve the stability of the optimizer to obtain a good compromise between stability and reactivity. So a specific MSWI performance function has been properly defined in order to characterize quantitatively the current status of the process. The evolutionary control approach has been successfully tested on a MSWC simulator and subsequently installed on a real MWSC plant which produce electricity and heat for a small Italian town (Ferrara). The paper reports the first promising experimental tests on the real plant for optimization of energetic efficiency and pollutant emission reduction.","Artificial life; Emission reduction; Energetic efficiency; Evolutionary control; On-line optimization; Waste incinerator","Biology; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Incineration; Artificial Life; Emission reduction; Energetic efficiency; Online optimization; Waste incinerator; Process control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906970351

The 10 mm to 12mm thick sheet is made using an extrusion process. Typically each polymer layer has its own hopper, screw, barrel, nozzle and extruder. During manufacturing, polymer layers are fused together within the tool and the multilayer polymer sheet leaves the extruder in a viscoelastic state. The multilayer sheet is initially cooled by passing it over chilled rolls. The final cooling of the sheet is done via natural convection to the ambient air while the sheet is transported to the cutting station at the end of the line. The cooling of the sheet on the chilled and polished rolls has a direct influence on the quality of the sheet as well as the scrap. The conductive heat transfer is primarily responsible for the cooling while the sheet is on the chilled roll. It is desired to have the smooth sheet exterior surfaces with constant thickness of each polymer layer in the cross section. Due to the numerous materials in the cross section, and associated variability of material properties, it becomes a challenging task to meet these requirements. This paper discusses the problem of the smoothness of the exterior surfaces of the extruded sheet. The dimpled or orange peel surface finish is observed to be linked to the cooling of the sheet on the chilled rolls. Experimental data and simulation results are presented that relate the formation of dimples to the local cooling rate. The variability of thermal contact resistance between the sheet surface and the chill rolls also appear to be another variable that contributes to the dimpled surface Copyright © 2005 by ASME.","Dimples; Extrusion; Orange peel; Polymer sheet cooling","Dimples; Orange peel; Polymer sheet cooling; Automotive industry; Computer simulation; Cooling; Extrusion; Heat resistance; Viscoelasticity; Polymers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29644440601

The largest model is rated at a power level of 330 PS, with a maximum power of 360 PS, and incorporates a new AutoPowr™ infinitely variable transmission (IVT). These tractors bring a new level of productivity and fuel efficiency to customers while maintaining the maneuverability, visibility, and ease of operation for which the 8000 Series are known. Integrated tractor systems and their technologies have lead to overall tractor factory observed fuel efficiency improvements of 2% to 5% based upon model and option. Improved vehicle fuel efficiency was one of the program goals that resulted in a new fan drive, reduced hydraulic and drive train power losses, and an engine-transmission control system that provides for optimal fuel economy. The John Deere 8030 Series tractors use innovative Engineering solutions in the cooling module design for increased power levels, without compromise in vehicle size and visibility, yet improving serviceability. The new 9.0 L engine uses externally cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), along with a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) to improve fuel economy. Customer requirements for higher power, reduced sound levels, increased productivity, and improved air conditioning performance were also planned in the new design.

Unintentionally boron-doped diamond layers were grown by microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on {001}-oriented undoped Ib substrates with the addition of oxygen gas during growth. The relative quantities of nitrogen and boron incorporated in the diamond lattice are evaluated by cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra recorded at 5 K. Two different effects are shown to limit nitrogen incorporation: the substrate crystalline quality and the addition of oxygen into the precursor during the growth. First, the CL spectra are shown to change strongly near the edges of the substrate in the regions corresponding to different bulk crystal growth modes. Some regions show a luminescence governed by UV emission while in other regions, where the H3 defect-related luminescence of the substrate is much stronger, the film UV emission is reduced. Second, the relative importance of the free exciton emission with respect to those from the nitrogen-related H3 centre and from the boron-bound exciton is shown to increase with the addition of oxygen during growth. Such observations are of first importance to improve the spectral emission and absorption threshold of the diamond material in the deep UV range. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The isotopic composition of specific compounds can provide useful information on their atmospheric budgets and biogeochemistry that cannot be ascertained from abundance measurements alone. Although pre-concentration systems have been previously used with a GC/MS/IRMS for atmospheric trace gas analysis, this is the first study also to report system validation tests. Validation results indicate that the preconcentration system and subsequent separation technologies do not significantly alter the stable isotopic ratios of the target methyl halides, CFC-12 (CCl2F2) and CFC-113 (C2Cl 3F3). Significant, but consistent, isotopic shifts of -27.5‰ to -25.6‰ do occur within the system for CFC-11 (CCl 3F), although the shift is correctible. The method presented has the capacity to separate these target halocarbons from more than 50 other compounds in ambient air samples. Separation allows for the determination of stable carbon isotope ratios of five of these six target trace atmospheric constituents within ambient air for large volume samples (≤10 L). Representative urban air analyses from Belfast City are also presented which give carbon isotope results similar to published values for 13C/12C analysis of MeCl (-39.1‰) and CFC-113 (-28.1‰).

Environmental managers of companies doing business or considering investing in these new markets now have new environmental issues to consider. The types of issues often encountered include the following: Should companies apply the same environmental standards and environmental management to their activities in less developed countries as they do in their own country? How do companies protect themselves from evolving and changing regulations in developing nations? What is the role of Western companies in transferring environmental technologies to developing nations? To answer these questions, companies need to apply new techniques for understanding environmental regulations. They need to not only collect information on applicable environmental rules and regulations but also understand the history or background of the regulations; the external forces, both regional and international, driving the regulations: the institutional capabilities of the regulatory bodies; and the regulatory standards being applied by their peers. Once the regulatory climate is understood, companies need to develop a strong environmental management strategy that should include, incorporate, or allow for the development of an environmental management system; the prioritization of short-term liabilities, such as oil spills or accidental releases; the development and application of appropriate standards when none exist; and the development and implementation of an institutional strengthening program.",,"Environmental compliance; Environmental management; Oil and gas operations; Short-term liabilities; Developing countries; Industrial management; Petroleum industry; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Standards; Sustainable development; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646049729

The northeastern states and Canada through NESCCAF have worked closely with CARB and CO2 equivalent emission regulations have been proposed. The eventual status of these regulations may not be clear, but what is clear is that there is a need to develop cost effective technology to reduce GHG emissions. This paper presents such technology. Advances in turbocharging technology relevant to both gasoline and diesel engines are described. Turbocharging, as a technology has been around for 70 years, but just like the internal combustion engine itself, it is far from being mature. Conventional evolutionary development of turbocharging such as inertia reduction, aerodynamics and bearing improvements have been ongoing. More recent step improvements due to variable geometry technology both on the turbine and compressor side are now available. Work is under way on electrically assisted turbocharging as well as new concepts to meet the demands of exhaust gas recirculation. It is shown that turbocharging, applied to different classes of vehicles with appropriate choices of gasoline and diesel engines, provides a cost effective way of reducing GHG emissions well within the goals being considered by the California Air Resources Board.

This analysis describes the 15-year trend records and reconstructions developed to put the research findings in historical context, whereas the process-level research findings are reported elsewhere. At the time these studies began neither the causes of this problem were apparent nor was there any expectation among the scientists that any would live to see the fruits of their labors-viz., a significant decline in mercury in Everglades biota. However, and most gratifyingly, beginning mid-decade of the 1990's and continuing into the new millennium, progressive, statistically significant declines in mercury concentrations have been observed in both largemouth bass and great egret nestlings at a number of sites located throughout the Everglades (Pollman et al., 2002; Frederick et al., 2001). It was not until later that retrospective studies determined that marked declines in local emissions and deposition of mercury (RMB, 2002; Husar and Husar, 2002) from the major point emissions sources in southern Florida antedated the declines in emissions and deposition. Atmospheric sources of wet and dry deposition are now accepted as the major sources of mercury to the Everglades (Stober et al., 2001), and because local emissions have been inferred to be the predominant source of mercury deposited in south Florida rainfall, including the Everglades (Dvonch et al., 1999), the question arises whether the observed declines in biota mercury concentrations can be related to declines in local emissions. This chapter reviews the existing data on mercury emissions, deposition, and biota trends in south Florida in order to address this question. Much of this discussion is based on work previously published by Pollman et al. (2002) and Pollman and Porcella (2003), but extends that work by including more recently available, longer time series for biota concentrations, as well as incorporating new analyses on wet deposition trends of mercury and some exploratory model hindcasting to examine the relationship between emissions and deposition, and aquatic biota response. This analysis integrates information from numerous studies to evaluate the causal relationship between mercury emissions, deposition and biotic response in the Florida Everglades. We began first with an examination of the recent trends in both mercury emissions and, as a surrogate to test the robustness of the emissions trends, mercury use. The mercury emissions and usage trends data were compiled by RMB Consulting & Research (RMB; 2002) and Husar and Husar (2002), respectively, for the major sources of mercury emissions in south Florida including municipal waste combustion (MWC) and medical waste incineration (MWI) facilities. These results indicate that large reductions in emissions (approximately 90% relative to peak emissions), occurring ca. 1991. Second, we statistically analyzed wet deposition fluxes for mercury from November 1993 through December 2002 for samples collected in Everglades National Park to determine whether these trends can be related to changes in the atmospheric signal, or are related to changes in rainfall patterns. Although the monitoring period for wet deposition began well after the largest fraction of the reductions in local emissions had occurred, the wet deposition signal still showed a significant decline (ca. 25%; p = 0.0413) that agrees reasonably well with the emissions declines during the same period. Third, we compare the biota trends to examine whether the timing and magnitude of changes in largemouth bass mercury observed in the Everglades are consistent with predicted changes produced by the changing deposition trajectory. These results suggest that the biota changes are indeed consistent with the estimated declines in local emissions and deposition, although additional analyses to test other hypotheses should be conducted before more definitive conclusions are reached.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951818982

The carbon sequestration potential of agroforestry and forestry projects was studied in Nepal, Uganda and Tanzania. Carbon sequestration in biomass was 0.43 and 2.0 Mg C ha-1 year-1 in regeneration of natural forests in Tanzania and Nepal, respectively. Carbon sequestration rates in planted forests were 4.0 Mg C ha-1 year-1 for Eucalyptus woodlots in Uganda and 5.9 Mg C ha-1 year-1 for Pinus patula plantations in Tanzania. The economic profitability of these land-use systems was calculated using the Net Present Value (NPV). Based on a carbon price of US $10 per ton (Mg) and an annual interest rate of 10%, the NPV increased by between 4.9% and 6.5% for these systems when the carbon value was added to the timber value and value of non-wood products.

The difference in growth rates is found to be less than 0.05% per year. Nevertheless, concern still remains about the distribution of costs. If abatement policies are introduced in one or a few regions without similar climate policies being introduced in the rest of the world, some energy-intensive industries may lose competitiveness, and production may be relocated to other countries. Policies to protect these industries have for that reason been proposed (in order to protect jobs, to avoid strong actors lobbying against the climate policies, and to avoid carbon leakage).

Through various mechanisms of dialogue and cooperation, various policies and programs have been established to provide solutions that are accessible to developing countries so that all stakeholders benefit from the international standardization of techniques and tools. A number of international programs based on the holistic concepts have already been put in place.

They combine very high brightness, due both to high absorbency and high quantum yields, with unprecedented resistance to photobleaching. Emission wavelengths, governed primarily by composition and secondarily by size, range from the near-ultraviolet to the infrared. For a given quantum dot composition, emission bandwidths depend on the size range of the quantum dots and can be very narrow; &lt;35 nm width is now routine for production quantum dots. Core-shell quantum dots can have quantum yields greater than 90%, and quantum dots may be excited in a broad spectral window shorter than their emission wavelength, with absorbency rising as wavelength decreases. For example, molar absorbencies of 6 × 106 at 450 nm and quantum yields in excess of 60% are found for the 655 nm polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated cadmium selenide-zinc sulfide (CdSe-ZnS) core-shell quantum dots used in our laboratory. Because all quantum dots show rising absorbency at wavelengths shorter than their emission wavelengths, many quantum dots can be excited using one illumination window. (Readers are referred to the Quantum Dot Corporation Website, http://www.qdots.com, for more details and for several tutorials on the properties of quantum dots.). The combination of high brightness, photostability, and narrow emission bandwidths with the ability to excite many colors naturally leads to the possibility of using multicolor combinations of quantum dots to label (""bar-code"") large numbers of different objects (e.g., different cell types in a mixed population) (Chan and Nie, 1998; Gao and Nie, 2003, 2004; Han et al., 2001; Jaiswal et al., 2003; Lagerholm et al., 2004; Voura et al., 2004). Quantum dots may be used for single-molecule imaging in living cells (Dahan et al., 2003). Finally, quantum dots are well suited for two-photon microscopy (Larson et al., 2003). There are potential drawbacks to the use of quantum dots: their large size and high molecular weights may limit applications that require measurement of molecular mobility, and attached quantum dots might interfere with molecular interactions. Finally, since the current generation of quantum dots is composed of toxic heavy metals (CdSe and cadmium telluride [CdTe] cores, with ZnS shells), toxicity might be anticipated if the quantum dots degrade during use. Several recent reviews have summarized progress in biological applications of quantum dots (Jaiswal and Simon, 2004; Parak et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2004). In this chapter we briefly review recent advances in the use of quantum dots for biological imaging, then summarize our work on the effects of chemically varying quantum dot surface properties to improve cellular uptake and imaging in vivo. Applications of nucleic acid conjugates are not discussed. Stabilizing the Surface: Core-shell quantum dots are stable and highly fluorescent in nonpolar organic solvents but are not very fluorescent in aqueous solution. Much current work involves making surface coatings that preserve high fluorescence, confer stability and solubility in aqueous solution, and allow ready conjugation of biological molecules. During the usual core-shell manufacturing process, freshly prepared quantum dots are coated with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) (Dabbousi et al., 1997; Hines and Guyot-Sionnest, 1996). Thus the quantum dots start with a hydrophobic surface. Several approaches have been reported to work reasonably well for creating a stable primary coat around the core-shell that preserves fluorescence in aqueous solution:1Coating the quantum dot with an amphiphilic (amp) polymer (Gao et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2003)2Replacing the TOPO using organosulfur or other organophosphorous ligands that compete for binding sites on the quantum dot shell. Examples include mercaptoacetic acid (Chan and Nie, 1998), mercaptopropionic acid (Mitchell et al., 1999), dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) (Mattoussi et al., 2000), dl-cysteine (Sukhanova et al., 2004), and an organic phosphene oligomer (Kim and Bawendi, 2003)3Forming a micelle around quantum dots using a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and PEG-substituted phosphatidylethanolamine (Dubertret et al., 2002), or by coating with a cone-shaped amphiphile that self-assembles around the quantum dot (Osaki et al., 2004)4Creating a silica layer around the dot (Bruchez et al., 1998; Chen and Gerion, 2004; Gerion et al., 2001)5Adsorbing albumin directly to quantum dots (Hanaki et al., 2003).These methods may be combined; for example, a primary cysteine coat was overcoated using polyallylamine (Sukhanova et al., 2004). All these primary coats allow conjugation of biomolecules, usually by amide or thioether formation. Minimizing Uptake In Vitro and In Vivo: Minimizing nonspecific aggregation and binding requires further modification of quantum dot surfaces. Most authors have used PEG conjugation to minimize nonspecific binding, as PEG derivatives for conjugation are readily available and work effectively in many systems (see reviews by Chapman, 2002; Greenwald, 2001; Harris and Chess, 2003; Harrington et al., 2002; Molineux, 2002). A potential drawback to PEG conjugation is that neither tissue-cultured cells nor live animals metabolize PEG (Ibid.). Sugar or polysaccharide derivatives offer another potential way to avoid nonspecific binding or to cause binding to appropriate receptors (Osaki et al., 2004). Conjugates that Confer Specificity: Conjugation of biomolecules to the primary coat is usually performed by conventional methods, using active esters, carbodiimides, or maleimides. An interesting approach is the use of cationic proteins or polyhistidine tagged chimeric proteins for self-assembly onto DHLA-coated quantum dots. Binding is mediated by electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged surface of the quantum dot and the cationic protein or tag (Goldman et al., 2002a,b; Mattoussi et al., 2000; Voura et al., 2004). This primary coat allows fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between adsorbed surface components and quantum dots (Clapp et al., 2004; Medintz et al., 2003a,b, 2004). Binding and Uptake Using Cultured Cells In Vitro: Binding to cell surfaces nonspecifically can promote uptake (Derfus et al., 2004a). Quantum dots layered on a surface can be taken up by cells that traverse the surface (Parak et al., 2002). Binding to, and in some cases uptake by, specific cell surface receptors has been demonstrated in many cases (transferrin receptor [Chan and Nie, 1998], serotonin receptors [Rosenthal et al., 2002], glycine receptor [Dahan et al., 2003], and epidermal growth factor receptor [Lidke et al., 2004]). Membrane labeling and monitoring of membrane integrity was performed using concanavalin A-biotin bound to streptavidin quantum dots (Minet et al., 2004). Cell labeling by quantum dots after microinjection (Dubertret et al., 2002), electroporation (Chen and Gerion, 2004), and cationic lipid-mediated cell entry (Derfus et al., 2004a; Voura et al., 2004) have all been demonstrated. Although internalized quantum dots frequently localize in endosomes, organelle-specific localization to the cell nucleus and to mitochondria has been shown using appropriate peptide conjugates to DHLA-coated quantum dots (Derfus et al., 2004a) and to the nucleus using peptide conjugates of silica-coated quantum dots (Chen and Gerion, 2004); thus once quantum dots are transported across the cell membrane, tagging of intracellular structures is possible. Derfus et al. (2004a) compared four methods of internalizing quantum dots: a membrane transport peptide, cationic lipids, electroporation, and microinjection. All methods except microinjection caused aggregation of the mercaptoacetic acid-coated quantum dots used in their experiments; cationic lipids provided the highest delivery. We have successfully incorporated large numbers of polymer-coated quantum dots by using polyarginine conjugates. Results from our laboratory (Lagerholm et al., 2004) are discussed in the following text. Cell Tracking In Vivo: Two groups have used quantum dot-labeled cells to follow circulation and extravasation of labeled tumor cell in living mice. Hoshino et al. (2004) used quantum dots coated by cross-linked sheep albumin to label mouse EL-4 lymphoma cells. Although high concentrations of these quantum dot conjugates proved toxic to cells, stable nontoxic labeling could be obtained at lower input levels. After injection into mice, persistence of labeled cells in circulation could be followed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) for at least 5 days, and uptake in various tissues (mainly spleen and lungs) could be monitored by microscopy. Voura et al. (2004) used cationic lipid-mediated internalization to label mouse B16F10 melanoma cells with DHLA-capped quantum dots. Cells were co-labeled with organic dyes to determine whether any loss of quantum dots occurred, as would be shown by a loss of coincidence of the two labels; on the time scale of these experiments (5 hours), no such loss was detectable. Again, by comparison with organic dye labels, quantum dots had no effects on the ability of the cells to survive in circulation, extravasate (emerge from the vascular compartment), or form metastatic tumors. Both standard fluorescence microscopy and two-photon microscopy could be used to detect the labeled cells.",,"contrast medium; quantum dot; animal; human; review; sensitivity and specificity; surface property; Animals; Contrast Media; Humans; Quantum Dots; Sensitivity and Specificity; Surface Properties",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646145311

The project aim was achieved by conducting a comprehensive survey (160 piggery buildings in fours states of Australia between autumn 1997 and autumn 1999) and measuring the concentrations of these gases in the study buildings. Ammonia and carbon dioxide concentrations were measured continuously over 60 hours at each monitoring occasions using a multi-gas monitoring machine (MGM), Engineering and management characteristics of the piggery buildings were recorded at the time of sampling and used in the subsequent multivariate analysis. The mean ammonia and carbon dioxide concentrations measured in the piggery buildings were 3.7 ppm and 858 ppm, respectively. A general linear model (GLM PROC) statistical procedure was used to model the effects of housing and management factors on the concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide. According to the model developed, ammonia concentrations were primarily affected by the level of pen hygiene, shed size, pig flow management and seasons. Carbon dioxide concentrations were affected by the classification of the buildings, seasons, ventilation control of the wall and ridge vent openings, ceiling height of the buildings, size of the wall openings and height of the ridge vent opening. The results highlighted potential strategies to be used to reduce the negative effects of poor air quality on pig production, environment, health and welfare and the working environment of piggery staff.","Air quality; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Emission; Gases; Risk factors; Survey","Gas concentrations; Risk factors; Statistical modeling; Air quality; Ammonia; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Condition monitoring; Particulate emissions; Risk assessment; Gas fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645025270

At present about 40% of the Perth's water supply comes from surface water resources. Due to below-average rainfall for several decades, streamflow to reservoirs supplying the Perth metropolitan area has declined more than 40%. General Circulation Models (GCMs) predict that rainfall in this region is likely to decrease further due to projected climate change. The availability of water resources may diminish further and pose a significant threat to water supply, environment and biodiversity. This paper presents a case study of the effect of a projected change in climate on the water yield of the Stirling Dam catchment, located in the south west of Western Australia. The study applied 40 realisations of current (1975 to 2004) and future (2035 to 2064) daily rainfall generated by statistically downscaling a single CSIRO Mk3 GCM simulation based on the IPCC SRES A2 emission scenario. The Land Use Change Incorporated Catchment Model (LUCICAT) was calibrated for the Stirling Dam catchment under existing conditions. The projected change in catchment runoff was then simulated using the downscaled rainfall. No change in land use, potential evaporation or evapotranspiration potential was assumed to occur when moving from the current to future climate. The study found that when the IPCC SRES A2 emission scenario is applied to the CSIRO Mk3 GCM to produce two 30-year realisations, annual rainfall in the south west of Western Australia is projected to decrease 11% by the middle of this century, . Taking into account the assumptions and limitations of the study, the projected reduction in rainfall would likely result in a 31% reduction in annual water yield from the catchment. A sensitivity analysis revealed that a 10% increase in potential evaporation, coupled with the 11% decrease in rainfall, could result in water yield reductions of greater than 40%. Conversely a 10% decrease in potential evaporation with same rainfall decrease resulted in only a 9% reduction in water yield. Confidence in the predictions of rainfall and runoff could be improved by using: (i) multiple GCMs and CO2 emission scenarios, (ii) multiple catchments and (iii) better estimates of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and potential evapotranspiration.","Climate change; LUCICAT model; Water resources; Western Australia","Annual rainfall; Catchment models; Change in land use; CO2 emissions; Daily rainfall; Down-scaling; Emission scenario; Existing conditions; Future climate; General circulation model; Land-use change; Leaf area index; Metropolitan area; Potential evaporation; Potential evapotranspiration; Simulation-based; Stirling; Water yield; Western Australia; Annual water yields; Catchment modeling; Catchment runoffs; Change in land use; General circulation model; Potential evaporation; Potential evapotranspiration; Rainfall and runoffs; Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Climate models; Decision making; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Land use; Phase transitions; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Stream flow; Surface water resources; Water resources; Water supply; Biodiversity; Catchments; Climate models; Decision making; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Land use; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Stream flow; Surface water resources; Water supply; Climate change; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053114990

The application here concerned is a reed device used to control a Secondary Air Injection (SAI) system which allows ambient air to enter the exhaust pipe upstream of the catalyst (useful for the reduction of emissions in rich mixture engine operating conditions). Since currently no commercial codes are still available for simulating in a comprehensive way the non-linear dynamics of a reed valve device with position constraints, the main objective of the work is the calculation of the air mass flow rate admitted to the exhaust system through the reed, by means of a slim and easy software tool. The task is accomplished by integrating two different codes, developed by the authors. For the gasdynamics phenomena a one-dimensional unsteady approach is used, while the dynamic behaviour of the reed valve is modelled by means of the finite element method. Moreover the present paper describes the methodology used for coupling the fluid and structure codes. To this end, experimental measurements were performed for the evaluation of the discharge coefficient, while various 3D-CFD steady state simulations were also carried out to analyse the pressure field on the actual reed geometry. The results of the 1D simulations are then compared with experimental measurements of mass flow rate and pressure histories, carried out on a Piaggio 150 cc engine, focusing the attention on the air injection subsystem. The comparison between the numerical and the experimental results shows a satisfactory agreement. As future work, the model seems suitable to be integrated in a comprehensive 1D code for engine cycle simulation.

Morphing combines present-day observed weather data with results from climate models. The procedure yields weather time series that encapsulate the average weather conditions of future climate scenarios, whilst preserving realistic weather sequences. In this sense the method 'downscales' coarse resolution climate model predictions to the fine spatial and temporal resolutions required for building thermal simulations. The morphing procedure is illustrated by application to CIBSE design weather years and climate change scenarios for the UK. Heating degree days calculated from the weather series morphed to future climates show a marked reduction compared to present day, by an amount that agrees well with results calculated directly from the climate model. This agreement gives confidence that the morphing technique faithfully transforms the weather sequences. Practical application: The re is overwhelming consensus amongst the scientific community that the Earth's climate is warming. This warming will have implications for building services in the UK that should be considered now.

Global constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases (first of all CO2 as the main greenhouse gas) will greatly affect the energy structure of the world especially in some regions. An optimisation model of world energy (GEM-10R) was used to study long-term prospects of world energy development in general and wind energy development in particular. The results of the calculations for four scenarios of energy development in the 21st century are analysed. In Scenario 1 ('business as usual') there are no constraints on CO2 emissions. Scenario 2 supposes moderate constraints on CO2 emissions; Scenario 3, rigid constraints on emissions and simultaneously moderate constraints on nuclear energy, that is, alternative energy resource to organic fuels; Scenario 4, rigid constraints on CO2 emissions and moratorium on nuclear energy development. The possible scale of wind energy development in the 21st century is analysed for the above four scenarios in the context of the development of competing energy sources.

FCC gasoline is recognized as the principal contributor of sulfur to the gasoline pool and has become the focus for meeting the new specifications. The difficulty in removing sterically hindered sulfur species in the FCCU cycle oil drives up the hydrogen and investment costs for treating the distillates. Although installation of pre- and post-treatment facilities is planned by many refiners, other non-capital approaches such as undercutting are being evaluated to meet interim and future sulfur levels. Even when expensive treatment facilities are installed, operating costs can be lowered and the flexibility of the facility increased with improvements in the ability to remove sulfur in the FCCU. In this paper, we detail Petro-Canada's experience in integrating Albemarle's RESOLVE sulfur reduction technology with a combination of innovative process ideas. These concepts include heavy naphtha recycle, coprocessing of hydrogen donor feeds, and recycle of LCO to a specially designed stripper reactor. Special attention is paid to the interaction of deep FCC feed hydrodesulfurization with the FCC performance. The results demonstrate that very low FCC gasoline sulfur levels can be achieved without significant capital investment through novel approaches to recycle, creative integration of CF - FCCU designs and operations, and application of state-of-the-art sulfur reduction additive technology. An added benefit of the RESOLVE 950 sulfur reduction technology is the substantial elimination of sulfur oxides in the FCC flue gas. This has been observed in Petro-Canada operations and numerous other RESOLVE 950 applications around the world.

In hydrocarbon-producing regions, such as Texas in the United States and Alberta in Canada, CO2 geological sequestration is likely to first occur in depleted or abandoned oil and gas reservoirs. However, in many regions, including oil and gas producing areas, this is insufficient because either the sequestration capacity of oil and gas reservoirs is lower than the amount of CO2 emissions from large stationary sources, or because this capacity is not available until the reservoirs are depleted. Deep saline aquifers provide a very large capacity for CO2 sequestration that is immediately accessible, and they are found in all sedimentary basins in the North American mid-continent. Proper understanding of the relative-permeability character of such systems is essential in ascertaining CO2 injectivity and migration, and in assessing the suitability and safety of prospective CO2 sequestration sites. This paper reviews the experimental protocol and presents detailed water-CO2 relative permeability data for three sandstone and three carbonate formations in the Wabamun Lake area southwest of Edmonton in Alberta, western Canada, where four major coal-fired power plants which produce large volumes of CO2 are located. These formations are in general representative of the in-situ temperature, pressure, salinity, porosity and intercrystalline permeability characteristics of deep saline aquifers in on-shore North American sedimentary basins. The data will allow detailed numerical simulations of CO2 injection and sequestration processes both at this specific location, and for similar operations planned elsewhere and around the world.

These facts, thought to be triggered by environmental changes coupled with inefficient management and policies, highlight particularly exposed and vulnerable regions worldwide. Argentina faces several challenges associated with global environmental change and climate variability, especially related to water resources management including extreme floods and droughts. At the same time, the country's production capacity (i.e. natural resource-based commodities) and future development opportunities are closely tied to the sustainable development of its natural resource endowments. Given that vulnerability is registered not only by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses), but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards, Argentina will need to improve its water management capacities to reduce its vulnerability to climate variability and change.

Since 1980, an increasing number of studies and calculations have shown that the relative roles are reversed. Thus, it has been found that in, for example, boreal forests, the soil microbial population transforms more than 95% of the plant litter carbon, leaving a maximum of 5% to soil animals. The dominating primary decomposers in boreal and temperate forest soil systems are the microorganisms, encompassing both fungi and bacteria. Both these main groups of microorganisms can degrade cellulose, hemicelluloses, and various lignins (Textbox 3 in Chapter 2). In this chapter, we emphasize the functional roles of microorganisms (e.g., cellulolytic and lignolytic) rather than their taxonomy. The concepts of white-rot, brown-rot, and soft-rot and what they functionally stand for in terms of degradation processes will be presented. We use these functional concepts as a basis to discuss the degradation of litter tissues. Although the terms originally referred to visually different types of lignin degradation, it now appears that the degradation of not only lignin but also cellulose and hemicellulose is different among the taxonomic groups of microorganisms (Worrall et al., 1997). The terms, however, relate to the type of rot rather than to the group of organisms, namely, rots giving the wood a white or brown color. In the following text, we adopt the common use of the terms and refer to fungi when using the terms white-rot, brown-rot, and soft-rot. Regarding degradation by bacteria, it is described and discussed as such. Many microorganisms in nature degrade cellulose and hemicellulose. These organisms have in common the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that are either bound onto the outside of the cell or released into the surrounding environment. Thus, the first steps in their degradation activity take place outside the cells. Some polymer carbohydrates may be degraded by both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, but a complete degradation of lignin (white-rot type) requires the action of aerobic organisms (fungi and/or aerobic bacteria). Partial lignin degradation (brown-rot type) may be carried out also by anaerobic bacteria but is mainly found among fungi and aerobic bacteria. The species composition of the microbial community (as regards cellulolytic and lignolytic species) may vary with the general properties of the soil/litter subecosystem, such as nutrient status and pH. A specific functional property that may discriminate among soil systems in terms of their microbial community structure is, for example, differentiated sensitivity of species to concentrations of nitrogen in litter and humus, which may be either stimulating or suppressing for particular species. Such a suppressing effect of nitrogen is not general, but is common in species of both white-rot and brown-rot organisms as regards their lignin degradation. By tradition, soil animals have been considered important for litter decomposition; such groups as springtails, mites, and earthworms, among others, have been ascribed different roles in decomposition, although the roles are not always clear and not always proven. The decomposition by free-living microorganisms has also been considered important but the relative influences of the two main groups, namely, soil animals and soil microorganisms, have not been apparent. It has become increasingly clear, however, that for some systems, at least boreal and temperate coniferous ones, the microbial component is of absolute dominance, with more than 95% of the energy going through the microbial community. The implications of such a finding and of such a proportion are considerable. As the book focuses on boreal and temperate systems, with an evident dominance of microorganisms in the decomposition process, we have given special attention to microbial communities (Section II.A.) and the enzymatic degradation mechanisms (Section III.) for the polymer carbohydrates and lignin. This chapter thus presents basic properties of microorganisms, as regards degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Although presented on the basis of studies carried out in boreal and temperate forest systems, these decay mechanisms should be similar across ecosystems and climatic zones. What may differ among systems and climates is the relative interaction between microorganisms and litter chemical composition and the influence of microorganisms versus soil animals. For those microorganisms that decompose plant litter structures, the term ""decomposer"" is sometimes used. The structure and development of decomposer communities can influence the pattern of decay. Also, structural changes in the community and its function during the decay process will be addressed. The effects of moisture and temperature on the activity of the microbiological decomposition are presented later, in Chapter 7. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In order to build the necessary infrastructure, large investments must be made. Oil fields in the fight phase of their lifespan for CO2 flooding may improve the economics for investment in CO2 infrastructure. In a near-term time perspective, using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery is an option that can help us start building the sort of infrastructure needed. Reservoir studies have shown that the gullfaks field in the North Sea can produce significant amounts of extra oil by using CO2 instead of or in addition to injecting water for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). It illustrates that incentives are needed to achieve acceptable project economics in a North Sea setting. Such incentives can be justified not only by the ensuing greenhouse gas emission reduction, but also by the increased oil recovery. Potential mechanisms and magnitudes of incentives necessary to get the first North Sea CO2 EOR project started are also discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Government and private organizations from Australia, Canada, Japan and Switzerland subsequently joined the project. The purpose of the agreement was to evaluate the technical and environmental feasibility of CO2 ocean storage by direct injection. The members agreed to an initial field experiment, which if successful, would lead to future field experiments. A modified version of the original field experiment was successfully completed in December 2002 on Loihi Seamount, a hydrothermal vent, 35 km southeast of the big island of Hawaii.(Vetter and Smith,2005;Summers et al., 2004). Hydrothermal vents at Loihi emit 5,000- 100,000 tons/year of CO2 (equivalent to an industrial-scale CO2 release) at water depths of 1200- 1500m. This natural CO2 analog served as a first order approximation to a direct CO2 ocean injection. The cruise focused primarily on biological impacts of a CO2 rich environment. Marine faunal species, both in trapped and natural states were exposed to high levels of CO2. In both experiments, no adverse effects were observed. The initial experiment cast doubt on the hypothesis that direct CO2 injection might create a mortality sink, where marine organis ms die, in turn attracting scavenging creatures that would also then be killed. A large body of supporting research and development was conducted by the participants to assist the experimental effort. Almost 100 papers and reports to date have resulted from the collaboration. Future field experiments will be dependent upon political attitudes toward direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean as a method of CO2 control. The absence of necessary field data is stifling overall progress in this field.

As shown through infrared spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, ellipsometry and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the partially fluorinated SAM yields a densely packed film in which the fluorocarbon groups govern the packing. Upon cleavage of the fluorocarbon group, the hydroxyl-terminated alkyl chains cant from the surface normal and are in a fluid like state. The resulting monolayer packing uniquely alters the wettability of the film by exposing methylene functionality in addition to the hydroxyl functionality yielding an intermediate surface energy (θa(H20) ∼64').

Another widely analysed MBI is the tradable emission allowance; the first international CO 2 emissions trading system is starting in the European Union. This paper explains the concepts of emissions trading, and of the policy instruments that involve green and white certificates. It discusses the effect of emissions trading on EUEE and RES and the conditions, including design specifics that may hamper or facilitate the wider introduction of EUEE and RES projects. Finally, the paper reviews the desirability and practicality of integration of green and white certificates and their introduction in emission trading. © 2005 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry.",,"Emissons trading; In-depth analysis; Investments; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31844453754

Even when the direct external effects of such products are limited to a single jurisdiction, the presence of increasing returns-to-scale production causes one jurisdiction's choice of regulatory standard to affect the prices and availability of goods elsewhere. Decentralized regulatory equilibria may be inefficient as a result. Because of a commitment failure, production may be split between standards-and consumers denied the full range of products-when it is efficient to have standards that allow products to be consumed everywhere. Coordination failures may cause similar inefficiencies.

Current development at EPA is to target specific initiatives that create federal, state, local government and higher education involvement to create implementation projects and the necessary development mechanisms, create networks of collaborative groups to discuss the technical feasibility to reduce the greenhouse gas footprints and development of regional energy strategies for the purposes of sequestering, collecting and trading GHG emissions. These approaches are being undertaken in the development of multi-layer ecosystem banks, the development of commodity values for GHG reduction, the development of models to facilitate environmental and ecosystem impact decisions and the need to develop infrastructure to support the voluntary decision making process for greenhouse gas emission reductions.

At each level of analysis, I look at the interests and expectations of two non-European actors or actor groups: the USA, which accounts for over a third of all Northern greenhouse gas emissions, and the group of developing countries, which accounts for the vast majority of humankind. I argue that Europe must take clear principled positions on a number of key issues, in particular the need to have a strong multilateral framework as the sole and core institutional setting for climate policy and to accept the principle of equal per-capita emissions entitlements as the long-term normative bedrock of global climate governance.

Although a well studied phenomenon, there is no generally accepted theory for black auroras. One theory suggests that black regions are formed when energetic magnetospheric electrons no longer have access to the loss cone. If this blocking mechanism drifts with the source electron population in the magnetosphere, black auroras in the ionosphere should drift eastward with a velocity that increases with the energy of the precipitating electrons in the surrounding aurora, since the gradient B curvature drift is energy dependent. It is the purpose of this paper to test this hypothesis. To do so we have used simultaneous measurements by the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar and an auroral TV camera at Tromsø, Norway. We have analyzed 8 periods in which a black aurora occurred frequently to determine their relative drift with respect to the ionospheric plasma. The black aurora was found to drift eastward with a velocity of 1.5-4 km/s, which is in accordance with earlier observations. However, one case was found where a black patch was moving westward, this being the first report of such behaviour in the literature. In general, the drift was parallel to the ionospheric flow but at a much higher velocity. This suggests that the generating mechanism is not of ionospheric origin. The characteristic energy of the precipitating electron population was estimated through inversion of E-region plasma density profiles. We show that the drift speed of the black patches increased with the energy of the precipitating electrons in a way consistent with the gradient-B curvature drift, suggesting a magnetospheric mechanism for the black aurora. As expected, a comparison of the drift speeds with a rudimentary dipole field model of the gradient-B curvature drift speed only yields order-of-magnitude agreement, which most likely is due to the nightside disturbed magnetosphere being significantly stretched. © European Geosciences Union 2005.","Auroral ionosphere; Energetic particles, precipitating; MI interaction","aurora; electron density; ionosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044507311

However, these cells are limited by poor water management, and are subject to poisoning by the presence of trace amounts of CO in the fuel feed. One solution to these problems is the implementation of a PEM cell that operates at elevated temperatures (120°-150°C). Even though, the currently employed perfluoronated sulfonated ionomer membranes such as Nafion are thermally stable through this region, above 80°-90°C, these materials have difficulty retaining water. This degrades their proton transport properties. The use of a metal oxide composite membrane allows for reproducible, stable cell operation ≤ -145°C. Metal oxide/Nafion composite membranes can be prepared via the direct addition of metal oxide nano- or mesoscale particles to a Nafion recasting suspension. The performance of the composite membrane at 120°-150°C is a function of the specific chemical details of the metal oxide-polymer interface. Composite PEM cells show decreased sensitivity to CO exposure and water content.

In the decade and a half since then, the regime has undergone a remarkable evolution. In 1992, states adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which took effect in 1994 and serves as the ""constitution"" for the international climate change regime.22As of February 17, 2003, 188 states and the European Community had become party to the UNFCCC, making it one of the most widely ratified treaties of any kind. In 1997, the UNFCCC was supplemented by the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect (so-called ""greenhouse gases"" or GHGs for short). And the 2001 Marrakesh Accords further elaborate the Kyoto Protocol's regulatory regime, setting forth detailed rules for how the Kyoto Protocol will operate. Several general features of the emerging climate change regime are noteworthy. First, the regime has aimed, thus far, at the widest participation possible, due to the global nature of the greenhouse effect and the recognition that human-induced (""anthropogenic"") climate change is the ""common concern of humankind.""33UNFCCC preamble, paragraph 1. This aim has been severely undermined by the withdrawal of the United States from the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, and the reluctance of developing countries to accept quantified limitations on their GHG emissions. Currently, the United States contributes more than one-fifth of global CO2 emissions and all OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries roughly one half.44World Resources Institute (2003). Moreover, although emissions from developing countries are comparatively low at present, particularly in per capita terms, they are growing rapidly and are projected to surpass industrialized country emissions in the next 20-30 years. Although some have argued that a regime comprising only the dozen largest industrialized and developing countries (which together account for more than three-fourths of global GHG emissions) could potentially be effective, such a regime would be difficult to negotiate, given fears that it would provide a competitive advantage to non-participants and would lack the international legitimacy of a regime representing a true global consensus. Second, the climate change regime exemplifies the ""framework convention/protocol"" approach to international environmental law - an approach used successfully to address such problems as acid rain in Europe and depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. As its title indicates, the UNFCCC established the basic framework for the climate change regime.55See generally Barratt-Brown, Hajost, and Sterne (1993), Bodansky (1993), Goldberg (1993), Grubb (1992), and Sands (1992). The 1997 Kyoto Protocol then built on that framework by setting forth specific obligations and mechanisms to control the GHG emissions of industrialized countries.66See generally Breidenich, Magraw, Rowle, and Rubin (1998), Davies (1998), and Oberthur and Ott (1999). Third, the climate change regime has an exceptionally broad scope, encompassing not simply environmental protection as traditionally conceived (that is, limiting emissions of pollutants), but economic and development policies more generally. Virtually the entire range of human activities contribute to GHG emissions. GHG emission scenarios, for example, are highly sensitive to population growth assumptions. (According to one scenario, population growth will account for half of the increase in global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels over the next 60 years.77DeCanio (1992).) Thus, population policy could conceivably play a prominent role in the climate change regime. Fourth, the climate change regime is largely neutral regarding policy options. Although climate change is primarily a problem of carbon dioxide (which accounts for about 70% of the enhanced greenhouse effect to date),88Houghton (1997). fossil fuels (which account for 65-90% of CO2 emissions and 30% of methane emissions),99The reports submitted by industrialized countries under the UNFCCC indicate that fossil fuels account for 97% of their CO2 emissions and CO2 for 75% of their overall GHG emissions. and ultimately coal (which represents more than 90% of the carbon in estimated fossil fuel reservoirs), neither the UNFCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol singles out any particular greenhouse gas or economic sector for special attention. Indeed, while attention has tended to focus thus far on mitigation - an emphasis reflected in the Kyoto Protocol - the UNFCCC addresses adaptation as well. As a result, states have significant flexibility in designing strategies to respond to climate change. This chapter provides an introduction to the international climate change regime. The first section reviews the development of the regime, from the emergence of the climate change issue in the 1980s through the adoption of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2001 Marrakesh Accords. The subsequent section then outlines the principal elements of the regime, including:•the objective and guiding principles set forth in the UNFCCC;•the regime's governing institutions such as the Conference of the Parties (COP) and financial mechanism;•the emissions limitation commitments set forth in the Kyoto Protocol, and•innovative mechanisms such as emissions trading and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change, population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and intensification of agriculture are putting increasing pressures on the resource (see Gleick et al. 2002; Gupta 2004; Petrella 1999). Growing scarcity, overexploitation, and pollution coincide with an ever-increasing demand, leading to competition for resource control between people, sectors, and countries. Unavoidably, these trends have generated sociopolitical tensions and conflicts between users at various levels. They also prompt the call for new approaches to water governance and management that are adapted to the changing use conditions of the resource in a rapidly changing world. Especially during the last decade, water policy discourse has become truly global (see Brans et al. 1997; Cosgrove and Rijsberman 2000). Problems increasingly tend to be framed and phrased in global terms, and standardized solutions are promoted that are assumed to have general and global applicability. In the fie|ld of irrigation, for instance, a global discourse of irrigation sector reforms characterized by ""model"" and ""tool-box"" approaches has become hegemonic.1 In water management in a more general sense, characterized by competition between multiple uses and users, the common wisdom treats as givens the river basin as a ""natural"" management unit and the treatment of water as an economic good. It is assumed that the formulation and enforcement of national legal frameworks will facilitate a uniform implementation of such policy principles, and thus provide backing to the water reform process. Yet these standardized approaches face a fundamental criticism: complex problems require a more contextualized understanding (Donahue and Johnston 1998; Wester and Warner 2002). Rights-based approaches to problems of water scarcity attempt to construct water rights as a (globally defined) human right, but fail to provide an answer to more context-specific questions: what are the contents and meaning of a water right? For which uses and users, and under which circumstances, should such a right be defined? How can such rights be exerted and operationalized in specific societal contexts in which other, local definitions of water rights exist? (see F. and IC. von Benda-Beckmann 2003). An important starting point of this book is that issues such as water scarcity and competition are not standard problems for which universally valid solutions can be formulated. Although partly attributable to the same causes, and although increasingly urgent in many places of the world, water problems are inherently local and context-specific in their manifestations. They are not simply reducible to natural and physical processes of water extraction and storage and do not follow universal economics or natural laws. Water control problems are both physical-ecological and human-made, the locally specific outcome of social and political histories and processes. In order to be effective at all, solutions to water-related problems framed in an increasingly global water policy discourse will have to be accepted and adopted in local settings of water use and water rights definitions. It is precisely in this field of tension between various levels of governance and management that water-related policy measures and interventions are contested, reinterpreted, and transformed under the influence of locally specific sociocultural normative systems and relations of power and control. This highlights the need for the contextualized study and analysis of water problems and for the formulation of context-specific solutions. These should pay attention to power relations, culturally defined meanings and patterns of resource use, and definitions of water rights (see Donahue and Johnston 1998). Law is one potentially important tool in regulating water allocation. The role of law in processes of water resources regulation has remained underexposed. In the fields of development studies and natural resource management, law tends to be treated rather one-dimensionally as an instrument of regulation that belongs exclusively to the state. In such views, state-made legal and institutional arrangements simply do their job: They generate the kind of societal changes they were designed for. More often than not, the crucial role of law and normative points of departure of policy making and water regulation remain hidden behind apparently neutral terms like ""appropriate practices"" or ""efficient use."" Water rights and the legal dimensions of water use have long been treated either within the paradigm of state-defined and centralized water control, or within a market-focused neoliberal paradigm. A third, nowadays popular, current emphasizes the need for decentralized platform structures for negotiating local water rights and mediating conflicts among multiple users and uses, but often fails to address fundamental power differentials. Even where local rights to water are recognized by state law, such recognition tends to be Janus-faced. The flip side of recognition tends to be incorporation, control, oppression, or downright eradication. In this book we actively engage with such contemporary issues of water use, management, and governance. We take as our point of departure the fact that we are dealing with complex interventions in resource tenure with an equally complex legal dimension. In the field of water resources, for instance, finding a solution to the problems of growing water demand and scarcity will inevitably entail the redistribution of established water rights and definition of new rights to this resource. In mainstream approaches that treat water as a tradable commodity, market efficiency has become the panacea. But because water use for irrigation is the least beneficial in market terms, such market-focused policies often entail water transfers from rural agricultural use toward urban and industrial uses. The transfer of water between sectors, users, and uses is not, however, simply a process mediated by market forces. Market-focused approaches tend to overlook the fact that water is not only a commodity to be redistributed and allocated in accordance with market principles but also a crucial resource in rural livelihoods, and that security of (land and water) tenure forms the backbone of these livelihoods. In addition, water is a fundamental source of cultural meaning, identity, and social identification. Thus, we believe that there is a great need for more critical appreciation of the complexities involved in water resources regulation and processes of development. Interventions in water resources such as irrigation reforms or intersectoral transfers of water are based not only on legal regulations and a variety of forms of sociolegal engineering (F. von Benda-Beckmann 1993; Crook 2001 ) but also on normative conceptions of the ideal ordering of resource tenure and management. Various social groups in society may hold differing conceptions of legitimate rights and forms of regulation. There is a growing awareness of the multilevel character of water governance, the tensions between various levels and sources of regulation, and the consequences of this multiple character of legal ordering for intervention, control, and planned change in the water sector. In this introductory chapter, we explore the general field of legal pluralism and water resources management. Although other water uses receive attention in some chapters, we will be mainly concerned with water use for irrigation in this introduction as well as in the book. In the second section of this chapter, we discuss the gradual emergence of legal pluralism as a field of study and policy attention. We also critically review some of the contributions that insights about law and legal pluralism can make to understanding and improving complex water use and management realities. In our view, attention to law and legal complexity increases analytical understanding of natural resource use. Insights derived from conceptualizations of law that take into account the existence of legally plural conditions also provide a refreshing and necessary counterbalance to the general tendency in the world of policy making to be prescriptive and normative rather than descriptive and analytical, to state what should be done rather than to understand what is at stake first. In the third section, we review main(stream) approaches to the analysis of water management. As we will show, irrigation and water management professionals and policy makers have been slow to adopt insights from studies of legal pluralism. Most scholars and practitioners in the field do not acknowledge the various and complex normative and legal dimensions of water control. We focus our discussion on four main bodies of thought that prevail in water resources and irrigation studies: Traditional engineering approaches, new institutionalism, common property resources management, and empowerment. This overview raises the question of how insights on plural legal conditions in society can contribute to the understanding of complex water use and management realities. We conclude the third section of this chapter with a short discussion of more recent trends in the irrigation and water management literature in which a genuine interest in the analytical value of the concept of legal pluralism has become visible, and which guides attempts to bring the social, legal, and policy worlds closer together. In the fourth, final section of this chapter we provide an introduction to the book itself. A short overview of all the chapters is preceded by more general introductory remarks on the case-study focus, as well as on the common themes and interests shared by the contributing authors.

In the medium term, increase of thermal efficiency of the steam cycle can be achieved by a rise of the process parameters. Currently, live steam pressures and temperatures up to 300 bar and 923 K are planned as a next step. This means an increase of 50-100 K in comparison to plants presently under operation. Such a large increase will only be possible, if all thermally high loaded components of the plant are made of new materials and/or new technologies for cooling and thermal insulation are applied. Closed circuit steam cooling of blades and vanes in modem steam turbines is a promising technology in order to establish elevated live steam temperatures in future steam turbine cycles. Due to the cooling of the components, materials can be used, which are common in todays application. In this paper, a steam-cooled test vane in a cascade with external hot steam flow is analysed numerically by applying a Conjugate Calculation Technique. The boundary conditions of the hot steam are derived from the planned inlet parameter of the HP steam turbine in a medium term and a long term in order to show the application potential of such a cooling technique. The supply steam parameters of the cooling are set equal to those of the outlet steam from the HP steam turbine. The results show that the steam cooling technique can reach necessary cooling effectiveness in the steam turbine by using only minor amounts of cooling steam. The internal part of the vane is cooled homogeneously in both investigated cases. Basic features and phenomena of the steam cooling technique in steam turbines are discussed in the paper with respect to future application. It has been found that the trailing edge region of the steam-cooled vane is less critical with respect to high thermal load than in gas turbine application with the same configuration. At the leading edge of the vane, high thermal load can be detected because of the direct impingement of the hot steam. Improvement of the leading edge cooling is recommended by increasing cooling steam amount for the leading edge channel. Thus, a larger diameter of the channel can increase internal cooling efficiency for the leading edge. Due to the different heat transfer characteristics on the suction side and pressure side, the suction side shows also a higher temperature distribution in the investigated cases.

We show that such hybrid emission regulation may lead to substantial excess costs compared to a comprehensive emissions trading system covering all segments of the economy. Furthermore, the hybrid system associated with the current design of National Allocation Plans is likely to discriminate against sectors that are not part of the emissions trading scheme.

Some topologies incorporate only an inductor between utility grid and inverter, and this may not suffice to meet regulatory standards on harmonics emission, like IEEE 519 or IEC 61000-3-2 [7]. To reduce the effect of PWM harmonics, more complex output filters are used, such as LC or LCL topologies [8-9]. These enhanced output filters allow lower switching frequencies. In this paper, a three-phase application is built and tested. After the hardware design of the output stage for a prototype PWM inverter, the control loop is explained briefly. It consists of a Kaiman observer to monitor the three-phase grid voltage (including distortion and unbalance), and the LCL output stage. The 20-state observer vector is used for state feedback. To control the DC link voltage, a fast control loop is designed, for operation as an Active Front End (AFE), or 'active rectifier', or to provide reactive power, and secondly, a slow controller is treated, which is useful for harmonic grid currents injection. Finally, many measurements show that this observer/controller operates very well (ITHD<1%), even under severely unbalanced three-phase voltage systems (VTHD=3%). © 2005 IEEE.",,"Electrets; Electric currents; Electric inverters; Electric network topology; Pulse width modulation; Switching frequency; Voltage control; Current distortions; Harmonics emission; Electric filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847720196

This renewed interest in coal is primarily driven by economics and the need for fuel diversity, although significant concerns remain about the environmental impact of these new coal plants. Most observers expect that further reductions in permitted emissions from coal-fired power plants are likely to be enacted. The fact is that coal-fired power plant emissions can be reduced to very low levels with only moderate cost impacts. In addition, new technologies are being developed to significantly improve the generating efficiency of power plants. Economic comparisons of a range of coal-fired generation technologies were developed in order to set cost and performance goals for future technologies. Advanced materials are being developed for construction of coal-fired boilers with ultrasupercritical steam cycles capable of operating at much higher efficiencies than current state-of-the-art facilities. EPRI has performed a preliminary economic analysis focused on a boiler design with a steam cycle operating at about 730°C-760°C (1350°F-1400°F) at 38.5 Mpa (5500 psi). Unit efficiency is estimated to be about 46% for a single reheat cycle and 48% for a double reheat cycle. Operation at these very high steam conditions will necessitate the use of relatively expensive advanced materials for the boiler, and superheater/reheater tubing. This leads to a classic trade-off study to determine how much you can afford to pay for these advanced materials in order to achieve greatly improved efficiencies. Breakeven cost analyses were performed to assess critical cost considerations for this ultrasupercritical design in light of cost projections for competing coal-fired generation technologies including subcritical and supercritical pulverized coal-fired (PC) plants, and integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) units.",,"Coal-fired generation; Combined cycle; Economic analysis; Fuel diversity; Coal; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Natural gas; Pulverized fuel; Steam power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646170640

However, ceramic membranes are also hydrophilic and resist solvent permeation via solvent interactions with pore surfaces. The ultimate effect of these interactions is low solvent permeability and deviation from Darcy's law, which has been used extensively to predict convective water flux through mesoporous (2 &lt; dp &lt; 50 nm) membranes. Due to the complex role of solvent-membrane interactions, there are currently no unifying models to predict solvent permeation through ceramic membranes. Liquid CO 2 and organic solvent permeation was examined through a series of mesoporous ceramic membranes with different selective layers; γ-alumina (5 nm), titania (1 and 5 KD), and zirconia (20 nm). In its liquid state, CO 2 acts as a non-polar organic solvent with comparable density and moderately lower viscosity, but with much lower surface tension (zero at critical point; 7.4 MPa and 304 K). Therefore, comparisons can be made between liquid CO2 and organic solvents to examine the effect of surface tension on permeation. A custom high-pressure, cross-flow filtration system was used to investigate liquid CO2 permeation in tubular membranes (Membralox™), while organic solvent permeation was examined using disk membranes (Sterlitech). Viscosity-corrected liquid flux values (ηJ = k mΔP) were used to test the applicability of Darcy's law and to calculate/compare membrane permeability coefficients (km). Dry liquid CO2 flux in 1 KD, 5 KD, and 5 nm membranes was a linear function of ΔP; however, km was 80-90% lower than that of water, indicating greater CO2-membrane repulsion. Consecutive pressure cycles also revealed that irreversible CO2 adsorption, via reaction with surface OH to yield carbonate-like species, may have reduced the effective pore size. When water was present (120 ppm), a significant reduction in CO2 flux and non-linear permeation behavior was observed, which was attributed to (i) pore blockage by water followed by (ii) a reduction in the effective pore size due to physisorbed water. For the organic solvents, ethanol, butanol, and acetone exhibited transient permeation profiles, also consistent with a reduction in the effective pore size via adsorption. Pre- and post-water permeation indicated that adsorption was reversed with drying.

Irreversible CO2 adsorption, via reaction with surface OH to yield carbonate-like species, might have reduced the effective pore size. When water was present, a significant reduction in CO2 flux and non-linear permeation behavior was observed. For the organic solvents, ethanol, butanol, and acetone exhibited transient permeation profiles, also consistent with a reduction in the effective pore size via adsorption. Adsorption was reversed with drying. Solvent-membrane interactions and their effect on non-aqueous solvent permeation (including hexane and toluene) were discussed.

Three criteria are used as evidence for human transport and manipulation of wild plant remains: number of items, fragmentation, and carbonization. Relations between these criteria and known ethnobotanical properties of the identified plants are statistically analyzed. Results display good evidence of the gathering of edible wild fruits and seeds. Other gathering practices are not documented. Edible fruits and seeds seem to have been gathered mainly from ruderal spring weed communities and, possibly, from forest clearances and hedge communities.

They lead to a loss of signal in tissues of size similar to the point spread function and induce activity spillover between regions. Although PVE can be corrected for by using algorithms that provide the correct radioactivity concentration in a series of regions of interest (ROI), so far little attention has been given to the possibility of creating Improved images as a result of PVE correction. The objective of our study was therefore to develop a methodology for PVE correction to enable not only the accurate recuperation of activity concentrations, but also to generate PVE corrected images. In the multiresolution analysis that we define here, details of a high resolution image H (MRI or CT) are extracted, transformed and Integrated in a low resolution image L (PET or SPECT). A discrete wavelet transform of both H and L images is performed by using the ""à trous"" algorithm, which allows the spatial frequencies to be easily obtained at a level of resolution common to H and L. A model is then inferred to build the lacking details of L from the high frequency details in H. The process was successfully tested on synthetic and simulated data, proving the ability to obtain accurately corrected images. Quantitative PVE correction was found to be comparable with a method considered as a reference but limited to ROI analyses. Improvement was obtained also in two examples of clinical images, the first using a combined PET/CT scanner with a lymphoma patient and the second using a FDG brain PET and corresponding T1-weighted MRI in an epileptic patient. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Clinical images; Emission tomography; Multiresolution analysis; Partial volume effects (PVE); Algorithms; Computerized tomography; Image quality; Optical resolving power; Tissue; Wavelet transforms; Image enhancement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846574391

Eighty per cent of the forests that originally covered the Earth have been cleared, fragmented or otherwise degraded by logging, mining, clearance for agriculture or urbanization. Although increased public awareness, forest conservation and reforestation initiatives and reductions in air pollution levels have helped forests to recover and grow in developed countries, most of the world's forests - located in the Amazon Basin, Central Africa, South-East Asia and the Russian Federation - are still significantly threatened. In tropical countries, logging for wood products is respons ible for about one-third of total deforestation (in some countries, the proportion reaches one half or greater). Possibly more than half of all the logging activities in the most vulnerable regions are conducted illegally. Worldwide, estimates suggest that illegal activities may account for over a tenth of the total global timber trade, itself worth over US$150 billion a year. Since the late 1990s, international attenti on has increasingly focused on the scale of illegal forestry activities, and their environmental, economic and social impacts. An important part of the debate has been the role of consumer countries in driving the demand for timber and timber products, and hence increasing the incentives for illegal logging. This article examines the efforts of the EU, through its Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative, to try to exclude illegal products from its imports and to build markets for verifiably legal products. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"deforestation; law enforcement; logging (timber); timber harvesting; timber trade; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20744449164

Among issues or concerns raised, the most frequently raised was the need to supplement research on breakthrough technologies like CCS with additional policy measures such as tax incentives and mandatory emissions caps. As a parallel to the positive point about CCS being a valuable component of a larger carbon management portfolio of options, there was concern expressed in some articles that funding for carbon capture and geologic sequestration might come at the expense of support for other emissions mitigation technologies such as renewable energy. Another frequent concern was the permanence of sequestered carbon.

As a countermeasure, a pressure estimation method based on physical first principles for the estimation of the instantaneous in-cylinder pressure of an SI engine using measured crankshaft angular velocity is presented here. The approach consists of (a) mapping the model parameters at nominal operating conditions and (b) adapting the model parameters to current operating conditions using the instantaneous crankshaft angular velocity. The model reflects all essential effects on in-cylinder pressure, while the simulation time was reduced to 6 milliseconds per cycle on a standard PC. This makes it possible to estimate a cylinder-averaged pressure for each cycle up to an engine speed of more than 6000 rpm. The estimated in-cylinder pressure is available with a delay of one engine cycle. The model has been compared to a benchmark pressure estimation method. Further, the model has been validated in simulation and against measured data for steady-state and transient operation. The model shows good accuracy, while the computational effort is promising for real-time applications. Furthermore, the model needs little calibration effort due to its physically based nature.

But nowadays, after the entry into force of the Kyoto protocol, it is possible that new environmental obligations concerning the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) could partially modify this approach. Two main impacts on the electric sector could be envisaged: first, an increase of the electricity price for final customers, due to higher costs in power generation and, second, a different distribution of the power flows among the countries, related to different national behaviours and needs in respecting the GHG constraints. With the aim of preventing high burdens, the European Union promoted the so-called Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS). This mechanism allows some industrial activities, that cause GHG pollution, to develop a trading of allowances within the Community in order to promote reductions of emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner. The paper will assess the impact of Kyoto constraints and of the proposed EU-ETS scheme on the European power system presenting a suitable multi-area optimisation tool and its application to study the optimal operation of the interconnected network of Western Europe.","Emission trading mechanism; Environmental factors; Interconnected power systems; Kyoto protocol; Power generation dispatch; Power system economics; Power system simulation; greenhouse gas emissions","Commerce; Computer networks; Cost effectiveness; Electric network analysis; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Industrial emissions; International law; Public policy; Emission trading mechanism; Environmental factors; Interconnected power systems; Kyoto protocol; Power generation dispatch; Power system economics; Power system simulation greenhouse gas emissions; Leakage (fluid)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51549106298

Many new refinery hydrogen plants are designed to use interchangeably three or even four available hydrocarbon streams but plants designed for a single feed can be modified with varying difficulty to switch to or add another feed type. Primary drivers for changing hydrocarbon feed are cost and availability, factors which are influenced geographically by local refinery stream availability and market conditions. Changing the feedstock has other implications and, in particular, impacts on the hydrogen plant's environmental performance in terms of energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of hydrogen product. Building on earlier work, Johnson Matthey Catalysts has modelled the energy usage and carbon dioxide emission levels across the range of hydrocarbon feedstocks in the common steam reforming hydrogen plant flowsheets. The results provide plant operators with a guide to aid decisions about changes to hydrocarbon feed type. Johnson Matthey Catalysts has participated in revamp studies examining changing feedstock in existing units. Using the models constructed to evaluate energy usage and carbon dioxide emission levels, Johnson Matthey Catalysts has assessed the environmental impact of this change in two cases. In the first case study, a refiner in the USA, driven by high natural gas prices in the USA, has successfully implemented a feedstock change from natural gas to a blend with off gases. In the second case study, a refiner in India is examining switching its hydrogen plants from naphtha feed to the increasing available piped natural gas derived from imported LNG. In both cases, the environmental impact of the feed change has been assessed.

Changes are predicted to be more extreme in the southern half of the UK, where severe summer droughts will become commonplace. Although rising atmospheric CO2 levels are likely to increase productivity through 'fertilizing' photosynthesis, water limitation in southern England is likely to lead to an overall reduction in growth and increase in drought-induced mortality. Incorporation of, the climate change scenarios within the GIS model Ecological Site Classification indicates that in isolation, the effects of climate change will result in significant changes in species suitability. Under current definitions the majority of native broadleaf species are predicted to become unsuitable for commercial timber production in southern England. Genetic variability in local native populations may enable a degree of adaptation. Existing trials of ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) suggest that the best performing provenances are those from regions with a climate similar to that of the trial site. The selection of a provenance for climate change adaptation should be from a region with a current climate well matched to a planting site's predicted climate of the future. Climate matching analysis indicates that coastal areas of western France experience a climate similar to that predicted for southern England by 2050, while the more extreme scenarios predict climates better matched to the Mediterranean region at high elevation by the end of the century. The scale of climate change predictions indicates that, in southern England, native broadleaf species may be unsuitable for timber production on some soils.

The big fire in the Mont-Blanc tunnel made it possible, in the framework of the POVA project (POllution in Alpine Valleys), to undertake measurement campaigns with and without heavy-vehicle traffic through the Chamonix and Maurienne valleys, towards Italy (before and after the tunnel re-opening). Modelling is one of the aspects of POVA and should make it possible to explain the processes leading to episodes of atmospheric pollution, both in summer and in winter. Atmospheric prediction model ARPS 4.5.2 (Advanced Regional Prediction System), developed at the CAPS (Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms) of the University of Oklahoma, enables to resolve the dynamics above a complex terrain. This model is coupled to the TAPOM 1.5.2 atmospheric chemistry (Transport and Air POllution Model) code developed at the Air and Soil Pollution Laboratory of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. The numerical codes MM5 and CHIMERE are used to compute large scale boundary forcing. This paper focuses on modelling Chamonix valley using 300-m gr id cells to calculate the dynamics and the reactive chemistry which makes possible to accurately represent the dynamics in the Chamonix valley (slope and valley winds) and to process chemistry at fine scale. The summer 2003 intensive campaign was used to validate the model and to study chemistry. NOY according to O3 reduction demonstrates a VOC controlled regime, different from the NOx controlled regime expected and observed in the nearby city of Grenoble. © 2005 Author(s).

The main advantage of the process is that the investment cost and the power penalty for CO2 removal can be substantially reduced compared to conventional combined cycles. The proposed technical solution comprises fully fired combined cycle, which minimizes the amount of flue gas. Furthermore, the CO2 absorption is performed at pressurized conditions prior to the expansion, which further enhances the CO2 removal. The modification of the power cycle and integration of absorption stages makes CO2 removal equipment much more compact and allows the use of CO2 absorbents with lower heat demand for the regeneration. The partial pressure of CO2 is above atmospheric pressure and removal efficiencies above 95% can be obtained with potassium carbonate absorption (the Benfield process). The treated flue gas is then reheated and re-humidified before the expansion in the gas turbine. A Norwegian consortium has developed the concept and feasibility studies have been performed for 100 MW and 400 MW power plants based on natural gas in Norway. The produced carbon dioxide is intended for storage in the Norwegian oil and gas fields in order to enhance the oil recovery. The suggested localizations of the power plants have been chosen accordingly. The design study is based on the same gas turbine and steam cycle as used in the commercial Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC) cycle. PFBC plants are presently fired with coal but the fluid bed combustor for coal will be replaced by a gas combustor if natural gas is used. A key advantage is that the process can be built solely from commercially available components. This report is an assessment of the features, capabilities, advantages and future possibilities of the suggested power cycle with integrated CO2 removal. A power plant for 100 MW power output and based on natural gas is considered suitable as a first demonstration plant to be built in Hammerfest, Norway. A permit application has been turned in. For such a demonstration plant the process simulations have indicated that an efficiency of about 40 % can be obtained, including the penalties from CO2 capture and compression. Further improvements, e.g. supercritical steam cycle or more advanced gas turbine increases the efficiency and for a 400 MW power cycle a net efficiency of about 44-48% has been simulated (including CO2 capture and compression). The cycle may also be suitable for CO2 removal from coal-fired plants.","CO2 capture; CO2 removal; Co2 storage; Demonstration plant; Enhanced oil recovery; Norway; Power plant","Atmospheric pressure; Coal; Coal combustion; Combustors; Demonstrations; Enhanced recovery; Environmental impact; Flue gases; Flues; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Gases; Investments; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gasoline plants; Oil fields; Oil shale; Petroleum reservoirs; Planning; Power plants; Steam engineering; Demonstration plants; Enhanced oil recovery; Feasibility studies; Norway; Partial pressure of co; Pressurized conditions; Pressurized fluidized bed combustion; Removal efficiencies; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64449084266

In this manuscript, results obtained from observations of the up-welling radiation in the near-infrared by SCIAMACHY on board ENVISAT are presented. Vertical columns of CH4, CO2 and oxygen (O2) have been retrieved and the (air or) O2-normalised CH4 and CO2 Column amounts, the dry air column averaged mixing ratios XCH4 and XCO2 derived. In this manuscript the first results, obtained by using the version 0.4 of the Weighting Function Modified (WFM) DOAS retrieval algorithm applied to SCIAMACHY data, are described and compared with global models. For the set of individual cloud free measurements over land the standard deviation of the difference with respect to the models is in the range ∼100-200 ppbv (5-10%) for XCH4 and ∼14-32 ppmv (4-9%) for XCO2. The interhemispheric difference of the methane mixing ratio, as determined from single day data, is in the range 30-110 ppbv and in reasonable agreement with the corresponding model data (48-71 ppbv). The weak inter-hemispheric difference of the CO2 mixing ratio can also be detected with single day data. The spatiotemporal pattern of the measured and the modelled XCO2 are in reasonable agreement. However, the amplitude of the difference between the maximum and the minimum for SCIAMACHY XCO2 is about ±20 ppmv which is about a factor of four larger than the variability of the model data which is about ±5 ppmv. More studies are needed to explain the observed differences. The XCO2 model field shows low CO2 concentrations beginning of January 2003 over a spatially extended CO2 sink region located in southern tropical/ sub-tropical Africa. The SCIAMACHY data also show low CO2 mixing ratios over this area. According to the model the sink region becomes a source-region about six months later and exhibits higher mixing ratios. The SCIAMACHY and the model data over this region show a similar time dependence over the period from January to October 2003. These results indicate that for the first time a regional CO2 surface source/sink region has been detected by measurements from space. The interpretation of the SCIAMACHY CO2 and CH4 measurements is difficult, e.g., because the error analysis of the currently implemented retrieval algorithm indicates that the retrieval errors are on the same order as the small greenhouse gas mixing ratio changes that are to be detected. © 2005 Author(s).

These and later sample collections were used to correlate environmental oil levels with an extensive array of biological impact studies and to assess the rates of dispersion and weathering processes. Highest oil concentrations were seen in heavily oiled and anoxic mangrove sediments, followed by organic rich sediments in seagrass beds. Dispersion and degradation processes had modified oil residues within the first half year to stages of weathering that would take at least two years in temperate regions. In year four, the mangroves remained a continuous source of reoiling to adjacent coastal ecosystems during erosional storm events. The residual oil trapped in mangrove sediments contained a significant percentage of low-molecular-weight hydrocarboned that presumably could still be toxic to burrowing and encrusting organisms. Source identification for the degraded oil was possible by selected ion monitoring GC/MS for pentacyclic triterpane biomarkers. After initial correlation of the chemistry studies with biological impact, the focus of the hydrocarbon program has shifted to developing methods to assess the importance of residual higher molecular weight hydrocarbons and their oxygenated reaction products. Results through year four of the long-term assessment are discussed. The key component in assessing the impact of a chemical spill in the marine environment is to relate the observed biological changes with the presence of the toxic chemicals. Oil is a complex mixture of many hundreds of chemicals, most of which are hydrocarbons of various configuration. Crude and refined oils have been documented to be toxic to all components of marine ecosystems exposed to catastrophic spills. The Bahia las Minas oil spill of over 8 million liters of medium-weight crude oil onto the Caribbean coast of Panama was documented to cause massive mortality in mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef ecosystems. Up to this time, the popular belief was that oil was not directly toxic to tropical reef ecosystems, except in cases of direct oiling in the intertidal zone or where dispersants transported oil to subtidal reefs. The long-term impact assessment was thus launched with major studies in all three types of tropical coastal ecosystems. The objectives of the hydrocarbon chemistry program are to interface with the extensive array of biological impact assessment studies to provide chemical evidence for exposure levels, to determine the variability of contaminating oil residues within habitats, and to study the digenetic fate of the oil in terms of correlating the composition of residual fractions with the long-term impact and recovery studies.",,"Biodiversity; Condition monitoring; Contamination; Crude petroleum; Degradation; Dispersions; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Erosion; Hydrocarbon refining; Molecular weight; Ocean habitats; Sediments; Storms; Weathering; Coral reef ecosystems; Sample collections; Sediment chemistry studies; Weathering processes; Oil spills",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646017700

While vane endwalls may be cooled by conventional methods extended from the airfoil techniques, blade platforms require simple but robust cooling methods that are amenable to the high rotational loads. This study presents a platform cooling solution that utilizes a single impingement jet directed to the underside of the platform from the forward shank face. Detailed local distributions of heat transfer coefficients are presented for the cooled platform region formed by the cavity between the pressure side and suction side of two adjacent blade castings. Fundamental understanding is provided for impingement into this confined cavity region, with two differing jet positions. The effects of jet impingement distance to the surface from Z/D of 1.5 to 8, and jet Reynolds number from 65.000 to 155,000 are investigated. Furthermore, to augment the cooled surface heat transfer coefficients, surface roughness is applied by a patented method appropriate to actual turbine hardware. The single cooling jet produces a platform cooling distribution that may be treated as two distinct regions. The primary impingement region is seen to behave in line with expectations from prior literature, with some cavity geometry effects. Impingement heat transfer coefficients are increased by as much as 50% through the use of an applied randomly roughened surface that models an actual braze alloy method. This roughness benefit is however lost if the impingement cooling jet is not relatively close to the platform surface. The non-impingement heat transfer regions of the platform are affected only by the total cooling flow rate supplied by the impingement jet.

The sulfur dioxide (SO 2) allowance market created by Title IV of the 1990 U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments represents the first real test of the wisdom of economists' advice. Subsequent urban and regional applications of nitrogen oxides (NO x) emission allowance trading took shape in the 1990s in the United States, culminating in a second large experiment in emissions trading in the eastern United States that began in 2003. This review provides an overview of the economic rationale for emissions trading and a description of the major U.S. programs to reduce SO 2 and NO x pollution. We evaluate these programs along measures of performance, which include cost savings, environmental integrity, and incentives for technological innovation.

Increasingly more operators are turning to acid gas disposal by injection into deep geological formations. This method offers a cost-effective alternative to surface sulfur recovery and represents a commercial-scale analogue for the reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere through geological sequestration. The trapping mechanism and geology of the injection unit and confining layer determine the geometry of the acid gas container, as well as its physical barriers that prevent acid gas migration. Trapping styles include diagenetic traps, combined stratigraphic-diagenetic traps, stratigraphic traps, as well as stratigraphic-structural traps. The rock composition may locally vary due to different degrees of dolomitization and recrystallization. These diagenetic processes also resulted in highly variable porosity and permeability. Injection takes place within Triassic carbonates, which are encompassed within a duplex thrust stack. The floor thrust of the duplex thrust stack is build by older Triassic and Paleozoic strata, whereas the roof thrust is located within the Jurassic-Cretaceous clastic interval. The duplex thrust stack in turn is enveloped in a series of kink folds developed within Cretaceous rocks in the area. The performance to date of acid gas sites in Alberta and British Columbia shows that injection of acid gas is feasible in a variety of geological settings, which is encouraging for large-scale disposal of greenhouse gases in sedimentary basins in the future. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Other sources, which have minor contributions to VOC concentrations, included aromatics emissions, industrial emissions, biogenic and mobile source/transient industrial. An interpretation of the likely source regions would be possible as the conditional probability function and potential source contribution function are calculated and the results for the three sites are compared to confirm the potential VOC source areas. The results of these analyses could be used to evaluate the emissions inventory for large point sources in Houston, which might then suggest effective control strategies for VOC emissions.

There are certain underground geologic formations that have structure, porosity, permeability, and other properties that make them ideal CO2 storage sites in the United States. Around one-third of the carbon emissions in the United States come from power plants. Many power plants and other large point sources of CO2 emissions are located near geologic formations that are amenable to CO2 storage. The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Research and Development (R&amp;D) program for CO2 sequestration in geologic media is a comprehensive effort to bring about this concept in a timely and acceptable method. The primary goal of the research in this area is to understand and validate the behavior of CO2 when stored in geologic formations so that CO2 can be sequestered for long term in a manner that is secure and environmentally acceptable. Currently, the planned and ongoing research and technology development includes initiatives to develop baseline information necessary to make decisions about potential demonstration and verification sites for CO2 geologic storage. This chapter presents an update of DOE-sponsored pilot-test opportunities for injection into a pressure-depleted oil reservoir, into deep saline reservoirs, and in unmineable coal beds.

This is contrary to the Kyoto protocol which states that the signators have agreed to reduce such emissions. This work looks at one such scenario where CO2 is injected prior to steam flooding in a heavy oil reservoir. Field applications have established that CO2 can be an efficient oil-displacing agent for both heavy and light oils as long as they are mobile at reservoir conditions. Using steam with horizontal injection-production well pairs is another recovery method for non-mobile heavy oils. This process can result in relatively higher oil production rates as compared to other steam-based processes not using horizontal wells. However, the higher production rates are associated with excessive energy requirements, CO2 generation, and post-production water treatment. For understanding and analyzing the effect of CO2 gas storage prior to steam flooding and optimizing recovery by varying the spacing between the horizontal injectors, a series of simulations were carried out. Unlike traditional sequestration of CO2, which is usually limited to exhausted reservoirs, the CO2 is injected, at high pressure, from horizontal well pairs into the heavy oil reservoir. This is done prior to the steam flood to enable viscosity reduction by swelling and to store the anthropogenic CO2, which is the main cause of global warming. To enable diffusion of the injected gas around the well bore, the system is shut in for some time. Then, steam flooding is conducted using the horizontal steam well pairs (SWP). For the heavy oil field model used in this study, which had no gas, the optimum injection rate with respect to distance, recovery and cumulative water-oil ratio (CWOR) was found to be 100 sm3/day/well. An analysis of the results obtained showed that the performance of the wells at the optimum steam injection rate, both with and without CO2 injection prior to the steam flood, were similar. In particular, over the 20-year life of the project, the recoveries were essentially the same. However, during the production period, when CO2, was injected, the CWOR decreased, resulting in an environmentally and economically attractive process. Moreover, 100% of the CO2 was stored, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of water that needed to be treated. The sequestration results showed that, after producing to the economic limit, 40 to 50 times the reservoir pore volume (PV) can be employed for sequestration purposes, depending on the amount of residual fluids. Given the volume of oil contained in heavy oil reservoirs, this represents a huge sink for future CO2 sequestration, and an opportunity not only to tap into a huge energy source for the future, but also an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2005 SPE All rights reserved.",,"Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Floods; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Horizontal wells; Injection (oil wells); Offshore oil well production; Oil well flooding; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Recovery; Reservoirs (water); Steam; Thermal oil recovery; Water injection; Water treatment; Well flooding; Well stimulation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Heavy oil reservoirs; Horizontal injectors; Oil-production rates; Recovery optimizations; Reservoir conditions; Sequestration of CO2; Steam injection rate; Heavy oil production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057366862

In ship diesel engines, wear usually occurs in the top region of the cylinder liner, where the maximum mechanical and thermal load appears. Modern high pressure direct fuel injection engines (i.e. common rail and pump injector systems) in combustion with high rate turbo charging increases the combustion temperature, pressure and flame propagation. Moreover, abrasive wear mechanism occurs due to the high quantity of abrasive particles and carbon depositions on the piston surface, coming from the heavy fuels combustion and oil degradation. Therefore the thermomechanically and tribologically highly loaded top region are subjected to premature local cylinder damage. This leads to the necessity of a reinforcement of the highly loaded areas by means of advanced materials engineering. State of the art is the use of exchangeable cylinder liner top rings made from hardened steel, placed on the highly loaded areas. This solution has the disadvantage that two different components and materials are used, leading to a reduced heat transfer and elaborate construction and assembly.

The project and final report titled ""Impact of Climate Change on Road Infrastructure"" (Austroads, 2004) was coordinated by the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics (BTRE). Climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on road infrastructure. Rainfall changes can alter moisture balances and influence pavement deterioration. In addition, temperature can affect the aging of bitumen resulting in an increase in embrittlement (cracking) of the surface chip seal, with a consequent loss of waterproofing. The result is that surface water can enter the pavement causing potholing and fairly rapid loss of surface condition. More frequent reseal treatments will ameliorate the problem, but at a cost to road agencies. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns can interact where higher temperatures increase cracking, compounding the effects of increased rainfall. The indirect impacts of climate change on roads are due to the effects on the location of population and human activity altering the demand for roads. Road infrastructure is a long-term investment. Roads typically have design lives of 20 to 40 years and bridges of 100 years. An understanding of the expected impacts of future climate change by road planners, designers and asset managers could engender considerable cost savings in the long term. At the broad strategic level, if road providers are forewarned of any costly likely future effects on existing infrastructure, they can better prepare to deal with them. The study compared pavement maintenance and rehabilitation costs for a year 2100 climate projection (based on a high emissions scenario; SRES A2) and ""climate-adjusted"" population projections, with present day levels, and determined the following major outcomes: • Nationally, there is a small decrease (between 0% and 3%) in the required pavement maintenance and rehabilitation budget based solely on climate change factors. This result reflects the generally warmer and drier Australian climate (i.e. reduced precipitation lowers the rate of pavement deterioration). • Annual pavement maintenance and rehabilitation budget is estimated to increase by around 30% (considering both the influences of climate change and transport demand changes). • There are significant regional variations in the change of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation costs as a result of climate variation and population and transport demand trends. For example, increases of over 100% and 50% are projected for the Northern Territory and Queensland respectively, due to the larger population increases and wetter climate expected within this territory and state. Limitations of the analysis include that the effects of weather extremes such as severe storms and flooding, which are projected to increase both in number and intensity (IPCC, 2001), have not been taken into account. Due to the computational requirements of the study, it was only possible to develop one high resolution regional climate pattern forced by one climate change scenario, instead of exploring the range of possible regional outcomes.","Climate change impacts; Environment; Road infrastructure provision","Asset managers; Australia; Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Climate projection; Climate variation; Computational requirements; Cost saving; Design life; Emissions scenarios; Environment; Federal Department; Future climate; High resolution; Higher temperatures; Highway networks; Human activities; Long-term investment; Moisture balance; Northern territories; Pavement deterioration; Pavement maintenance; Potholing; Queensland; Rainfall patterns; Regional climate; Regional services; Regional variation; Rehabilitation cost; Road infrastructures; Severe storms; Strategic level; Surface chips; Surface conditions; Transport demand; Transport research; Weather extremes; Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Computational requirements; Direct and indirect impacts; Northern territories; Pavement deterioration; Pavement maintenance and rehabilitations; Budget control; Computer simulation; Costs; Decision making; Deterioration; Economics; Forestry; Highway administration; Highway planning; Investments; Maintenance; Pavements; Rain; Regional planning; Research; Storms; Agricultural robots; Budget control; Costs; Decision making; Deterioration; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Highway administration; Highway planning; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Investments; Maintenance; Pavements; Rain; Regional planning; Storms; Surface waters; Urban transportation; Climate change; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053098210

Even though there are technological and CNS/ATM improvements to reduce the environmental effect, the increase of flights is much higher than the achieved benefits. In particular aircraft noise is perceived as one of the most important constraints to growth. In fact, ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) recommended new noise abatement procedures to reduce the impact on the areas of surrounding airports [1]. While implementing new noise abatement procedures, as the main focus is reducing the noise impact, generally other environmental issues are discarded such as global emissions and local air quality. Research and harmonised tools to understand better the relationship between noise and emissions is needed in order to ensure sustainable and cost-efficient operational decisions. This study highlights the importance to carry out trade-off assessments to understand the interrelation of different environmental impacts of proposed operational decisions and to determine the economic effects of each decision. The trade-off approach consists of: • Specification of operational scenarios • Quantification of environmental effects • Evaluation by converting the quantified values into monetary terms. One illustrative example is developed to assess the feasibility of the trade-off assessment approach. Preferred emissions route (PER) and preferred noise route (PNR) scenarios are used to demonstrate the study feasibility. One of the important aspects of the study is to demonstrate that the combined use of airspace simulation, environmental and economic tools, makes trade-off assessment feasible for any kind of scenarios, and adds value to operational project evaluation.","Airport operations; Cost; Emissions; ENHANCE; Fuel; INM; Noise; RAMS; TBEC; Tradeoffs","Advanced traffic management systems; Air quality; Air traffic control; Air transportation; Airports; Costs; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Fighter aircraft; Fueling; Noise abatement; Noise pollution; Particulate emissions; Project management; Research and development management; Airport operations; ENHANCE; INM; Noise; RAMS; TBEC; Tradeoffs; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942039284

Above the thermal optimum of photosynthesis, the activation state of Rubisco declined with increasing temperature. Doubling CO2 above 370 μbar further reduced the activation state, while reducing CO2 by one-half increased it. At cool temperature (&lt;16°C), the activation state of Rubisco declined at CO2 levels where photosynthesis was unaffected by a 90% reduction in O2 content. Reduction of the partial pressure of CO2 at cool temperature also enhanced the activation state of Rubisco. The rate of electron transport showed a pronounced temperature response with the same temperature optimum as A at elevated CO2. RuBP pool size and the RuBP-to-PGA ratio declined with increasing temperature. Increasing CO2 also reduced the RuBP pool size. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction in the activation state of Rubisco at high and low temperature is a regulated response to a limitation in one of the processes contributing to the rate of RuBP regeneration. To further evaluate this possibility we used measured estimates of Rubisco capacity electron transport capacity and the inorganic phosphate regeneration capacity to model the response of A to temperature. At elevated CO2, the activation state of Rubisco declined at high temperatures where electron transport capacity was predicted to be limiting, and at cooler temperatures where the inorganic phosphate regeneration capacity was limiting. At low CO2, where Rubisco capacity was predicted to limit photosynthesis, full activation of Rubisco was observed at all measurement temperatures. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carboxylic acids; Electron transport properties; Partial pressure; Phosphates; Photosynthesis; Activation state; Ipomoea batatas; Pool sizes; Temperature response; Plants (botany); Carbon Dioxide; Carboxylic Acids; Partial Pressure; Photosynthesis; Plants; Ipomoea batatas; 3 phosphoglyceric acid; 3-phosphoglycerate; carbon dioxide; glyceric acid; phosphate; ribulose 1,5 diphosphate; ribulose phosphate; ribulose-1,5 diphosphate; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; article; biological model; electron transport; enzyme activation; enzymology; kinetics; metabolism; photosynthesis; radiation exposure; sweet potato; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Electron Transport; Enzyme Activation; Glyceric Acids; Ipomoea batatas; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Phosphates; Photosynthesis; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Ribulosephosphates; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30344470621

Hydrogen can be burned with pure oxygen thus the production of CO2 and NOx is avoided. Since molecular hydrogen does not exist on the earth it has to be produced from fossil fuels or from renewable energy sources. Energy from fossil fuels can be transferred into hydrogen and released elsewhere. So relevant reduction of emission of pollutant can be achieved in critical zones at the centres of large cities. Nevertheless the losses occurring during production, distribution and storage of hydrogen lead to an increased consumption of the primary energy source (fossil fuels) and to increased emission levels (CO2 and others). Hydrogen can be obtained from renewable sources such as the solar energy and used in situ for power generation. In this case hydrogen can act as an energy carrier which allows a local energy storage. In such a way the time dependent availability of the solar energy and the production level of the power plant can be decoupled. In a distributed generation context a small size solar power plant equipped with a hydrogen storage system has been studied. Different storage options have been investigated and compared. Finally a liquid hydrogen storage system is proposed. The peculiarities of the selected system allow a reduction of losses, size of machinery and energy requirements. The paper presents an analysis of the more relevant issues related to the different hydrogen storage options suitable for the present application. After the characterization of the solar field in terms of energy availability and the specifications of both the hydrogen production system and the power generation unit, the design of a liquid hydrogen storage system is presented and widely discussed. This method is particularly useful in the plants management (for example nuclear or coal plants), where it's impossible or very difficult to modify power level, as well. So, such a static system would be useful in order to allow power modulation by H2 plant. In order to do this, a research for individuating high volumic (and mass) specific capacity systems should be driven.

The model explains how elevated temperature and pressure differences can increase the efficiency of a cool tower, and how that elevated pressure difference can be created by adding a Solar Chimney. The synergy created by the cooler incoming air through the cool tower (positive pressure) and the hot air exiting through the solar chimney (negative pressure) will definitely alter the air movement and therefore the fluid dynamics. Our objective is to analyze the indoor air velocity increment and the indoor air movement, as well as the possible heat gains through convection and conduction due to increased air circulation.

The hybrid electric vehicle system is powered with a 103kW 2.5L Detroit Diesel engine which operates with a fuel blend consisting of ultra-low-sulfur diesel and biodiesel (35%). Lower emissions are inherently achieved by the use of biodiesel. Additionally, the engine was fitted with a series of aftertreatment devices in an effort to achieve the low emissions standards. Vehicle testing has shown a gasoline-equivalent fuel economy improvement of approximately 22%, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 38%, and meeting or exceeding stock emissions numbers in all other categories through the use of an advanced catalyst and control strategy. This paper will review the engine and emissions system strategy to meet the low emissions standards, detail the operation of the aftertreatment system, detail the process by which it was tested in an engine dyno lab and chassis dyno lab, and review the control optimization. Most importantly, the data will suggest what further optimization would need to be completed to meet lower emissions standards.

The dominating species for ozone events are analyzed to provide the target pollutant for emission reduction. Smog Production Model with localized parameters is used to find the limiting species. The ozone response to variations in the anthropogenic emissions contributed by traffic transportation is evaluated for three proposed strategies. This study uses the Taiwan Air Quality Model model, a three-dimensional Eulerian grid model with photochemical processes, to simulate the air quality for different emission scenarios. The major downtown areas of Taipei City are VOC-limited, only limited rural areas are NOx-limited. The strategy for controlling ozone is developed by seeking possible reduction of emissions contributed by downtown traffic. The maximum ozone concentration reductions are found in scenarios to reduce the emission from motorcycles and cars, respectively. The reduction alternative for bus provides less improvement. However, the area of larger ozone reduction for motorcycle scenario is larger than the other two. The control of mobile sources in Taipei City seems a reasonable approach, however, motorcycles and passenger cars are much more important than other cars.

However, this environmentally friendly practice can be at risk due to odor complaints. Volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) including methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide, have been identified as major contributors to biosolids odor. In this study, methanogens were shown to play a key role in removing VOSCs and reducing odors, and methane production was related to reduced VOSC production. Factors influencing the growth of methanogens such as the shear during dewatering and storage temperature showed a strong impact on net odor production. Examination of the microbial communities of both bacteria and archaea indicated a simplified archaeal community in biosolids, which is susceptible to environmental perturbations. Therefore, one possible odor control strategy is the preservation and enhancement of the methanogenic population during biosolids storage. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Biosolids; Methanogen; Odor; Volatile organic sulfur compounds","Bacteria; DNA; Methane; Methanogens; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Biosolids; Volatile organic sulfur compounds; Anaerobic digestion; bacterial DNA; dimethyl sulfide; methane; methanethiol; organosulfur derivative; volatile organic compound; odor; Waste management; Wastewater treatment; anaerobic digestion; Archaebacterium; article; biosolid; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; dewatering; DNA determination; land use; Methanobacterium; methanogenesis; nonhuman; odor; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative analysis; recycling; storage temperature; waste water management; Archaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25144479310

Forest absorbed carbon Is 1057.90 × 10 4t In 1990, and in 2002, the amount Is 1280.61 × 10 4t, the rise ratio Is 18.56 × 10 4t. However, Pinus Elliottii and Pinus Massoniana biomass act as an Important role, occupied 39.12%and 21.38%, and Broad-leaved forest 15.39 %, Eucalyptus 9.08 %, and sugl (Cryptomeria japonlca D.)7.97 %, other forest species 7.06 %. In order to Improve forest biomass and take full advantage of forest service function, local broad-leaf tree species and great biomass tree species should be selected to reform forest construction. (2) Fossil energy's carbon release amount and economic development is positive relation. In 1990, fossil energy carbon release amount is 95.08 × 10 4t, while In 2002, this amount rise to 185.62 × 10 4t, the release ratio Is 7×10 4t, and this 34.06 × 10 4t diversity between 2002 and 2003. (3) energy using efficiency Is low and 104 yuan GDP per energy consumption Is high. In 2002, 104 yuan GDP per energy consumption of Tanjlang river basin Is 2.21t standard coal, higher than average consumption of pearl delta. If 10 4 yuan GDP per energy consumption of Tanjiang river basin equal to average consumption of pearl delta(1.81 t standard coal), the carbon release amount would reduce 33.60 × 10 4t, which was higher than forest absorbed carbon of Tanjlang river basin. So, to raise energy using efficiency and improve energy using construction are important means of reducing carbon release. (4)From carbon balance, forest of Tanjiang river basin can absorbed energy release carbon from 1990 to 2002. But In 2003, energy consumption release carbon ratio overcomes the forest absorbed carbon ratio.

A plasma-assisted catalyst system that is capable of reducing NOx under highly lean conditions using E-diesel or ethanol as the reductant was presented. The system consists of a compact, energy-efficient hyperplasma reactor followed by a dual-bed catalytic reactor containing BaY (or NaY) and CuY. The emission reduction potential of the system for NOx reduction in diesel engine exhaust has been evaluated by both steady-state laboratory reactor experiments and engine dynamometer tests, under a wide range of operating conditions by varying the operating parameters such as plasma power density, catalyst temperature, gas space velocity, HC/NOx feed ratio, fuel sulfur contents, etc. The plasma/catalyst system can achieve a good NOx conversion (above 90% on average) over a wide temperature range of 200°-400°C under steady-state optimum operating conditions, by using a sidestream hyperplasma reactor coupled with E-diesel as the reductant at a diesel engine exhaust gas space velocity of 5000/hr for BaY and 20,000/hr for CuY on monolithic honeycomb substrates.

NO is a precursor in the formation of tropospheric ozone which can directly impact public health and the environment. Understanding and controlling of NO flux from soils to the troposphere can thus be advantageous, protecting air quality as well as conserving valued nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural settings. Comprehensive laboratory protocols have been developed, conducted, and published that consider the influence of mineral fertilizer, municipal wastewater, municipal wastewater treatment biosolids, swine waste, and toluene on NO emissions with varying soil temperature, moisture content, and pH. Laboratory results indicate that NO emissions from wastewater-amended soil have the highest mean emission rate (63 ng-N/m2s) followed by toluene-amended soil (47 ng-N/m2s), biosolid-amended soil (46 ng-N/m2s), mineral fertilizer-amended soil (44 ng-N/m2s), and then swine waste-amended soil (4 ng-N/m 2s). Results suggest that emissions of NO from soil are an important source of tropospheric NO that further must be considered in soil and air pollution control, research, and policy determinations.","Nitric oxide; Nitrogen fertilizers; Ozone precursor; Soil amendment","Air pollution; Moisture; pH effects; Soils; Thermal effects; Troposphere; Wastewater treatment; Nitric oxide; Public health; Tropospheric ozone; Nitrogen compounds; fertilizer; nitric oxide; air pollution; air quality; article; environmental impact; environmental protection; policy; pollution control; soil amendment; soil fertilization; troposphere; waste water; waste water management; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11444268039

As a result, the use of electronic engine control systems will be indispensable to diesel-powered vehicles. The conventional map-based control scheme is inadequate to meet the emission requirements. A mathematical model-based control scheme for a turbocharged diesel engine, on the other hand, can improve performance in terms of power and emissions during the steady state and the transient engine operations. In this study, a dynamic model of a turbocharged common-rail direct injection diesel engine is developed for control applications. This model is composed of differential and algebraic equations, which are derived from the filling and emptying method and the quasi-steady method, respectively. The dynamic subsystems include the air intake subsystem, the exhaust subsystem, and the rotational subsystems of the turbocharger and crankshaft. The compressor and the turbine models of a turbocharger are obtained based on the empirical data from the manufacturer. The developed engine model is evaluated through engine tests.

Its main target was to define and evaluate measurement, analysis and control criteria for the emission of chemical and physical pollutants from non-metal mining industries, with particular reference to noise and airborne particulates. Any industrial activity needs to be carefully planned and managed, in order to reduce, for workers and neighbouring population, both risks and annoyance phenomena, and these issues are particularly relevant when high population density areas are concerned. But in a sustainable development approach it should be appropriate to go beyond the simple application of laws, often incomplete or not updated (especially referring to the mining sector), and to look for technical and procedural solutions - The so called ""good practices"" or ""best available techniques"" - with the final target of minimising the impact on the environment. Direct assessment of real situations are, of course, essential to point out critical aspects and to derive viable solutions. A quite ""simplified"" monitoring system has then been proposed and tested, in order to get a first evaluation of the cross references among mining techniques and technologies, pollutant emissions and propagation data. A software-based database was developed to manage detailed info on the mining activities, and to store the measured emission data for any further management. One of the aims of the present work was also the development of a predictive system for noise and dust emission, able to provide a first approach - rough but acceptable - relationships between the different site activities and the pollutant levels. The output may provide suggestion on the critical situations and possible reduction methods, both at the planning stages, in the mine layout and during the evolution of the mining activities.","Control and reduction of emissions; Noise and dust; Non-metal non-energy mining","Analysis and controls; Best available techniques; High population density area; Impact on the environment; Industrial activities; Measurement management; Non-energy; Reduction of emissions; Chemical analysis; Computer applications; Dust; Environmental regulations; Population statistics; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892646865

As an example, while water sensitive urban design (WSUD) is widely accepted as a tool to manage the impacts of urbanisation by careful design at the house and street scale, its focus has largely been on managing and re-using the runoff (stormwater and wastewater) component of the water balance.

Evapotranspiration is the process that links the movement of water through a landscape with the local climate, with the process using energy that would otherwise contribute to elevated air temperatures. This passive control of the local climate via urban vegetation and ET has a direct influence on quantities of energy used in space heating and cooling through the role of urban ET and also because trees provide shade and shelter. This link between the urban water and energy balances, and microclimate, is demonstrated by considering the following simplified expressions for i) the urban water balance: P + I = ET + D + ΔS (1) where the inputs are: P = precipitation; I = piped water supply (for external and internal uses); and the outputs are: ET = urban evapotranspiration; D = stormwater and wastewater; ΔS = change in stored water on and within the surface materials; and ii) the urban energy balance: Q* + QF = QH + QE + ΔQS (2) where the energy inputs and outputs are: Q* = net all-wave radiation; QF = anthropogenic energy sources (space heating, cooling etc.); QE = energy used to evaporate the water flux E; QH and ΔQ S = energy used to heat the air, soil and built surfaces. Urban ET also contributes to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, directly because water loss via transpiration is the consequence of the uptake of CO2 during photosynthesis, and indirectly because reduced energy consumption reduces greenhouse gases consumed in burning fossil fuels to generate electricity. Maintaining urban greenspace via irrigation is therefore a quantifiable benefit of water use in terms of reduced energy consumption and net greenhouse gas emissions. Quantifying these benefits is critical if they are to be included in current discussions about urban water use. To address the gap in current WSUD practice, and investigate the potential to realise multiple benefits from urban vegetation, we use a calibrated urban water cycle model to quantify the impact of urbanisation and different suburban designs (layout, population, style and size of housing etc.) on the seasonal and annual urban water balance, especially ET, in an Australian city. We show that urban ET is the largest output term in the average urban water balance (almost twice the size of urban runoff) and is sustained during periods of low rainfall by the use of imported water to irrigate household gardens and larger urban parks. We show that this urban ET lowers air temperatures to reduce energy demand for cooling during peak air temperatures. The simulations demonstrate that the magnitude of urban ET can be manipulated through different suburban designs, e.g. urban consolidation reduces urban ET by about 50%, doubles the urban runoff, and increases afternoon air temperatures by about 1°C. Such an increase could increase energy consumption by 3%.","Evapotranspiration; Urban microclimates; Water balance","Air temperature; Economic benefits; Energy demands; Energy inputs; Energy source; Future climate; Generate electricity; Local climate; Passive control; Reduced energy; Simplified expressions; Stormwaters; Surface materials; Urban areas; Urban consolidation; Urban design; Urban energy balance; Urban microclimate; Urban parks; Urban runoff; Urban vegetation; Urban water balance; Urban waters; Water balance; Water demand; Water flux; Water loss; Water sensitive; Water use; Generate electricity; Heating and cooling; Simplified expressions; Surface materials; Urban consolidation; Urban energy balance; Urban water balance; Water sensitive urban design (WSUD); Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Design; Energy balance; Energy utilization; Evapotranspiration; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Parks; Runoff; Sewage; Space heating; Vegetation; Wastewater; Decision making; Energy balance; Energy utilization; Evapotranspiration; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Runoff; Sewage; Space heating; Storms; Vegetation; Water supply; Water supply; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960574895

Faeces, however, include both undigested plant matter and waste, hence accuracy of dietary calculations could potentially be compromised by shifts in plant isotopic values related to seasonal or spatial differences, or by variability in the isotopic differences between faeces and diet. A controlled feeding study of four ungulate species showed a small, consistent difference between diet and faeces of -0.9 ‰, irrespective of whether the diet was C3 or C4-based.

This distinction is important since reductions in pollution that are a result of changes to the product mix may simply reflect a transfer of pollution from one country to another, rather than a net reduction. We attempt to resolve this issue by applying the divisia decomposition technique to a new dataset of industry-specific emissions intensities for three common air pollutants, for four European countries. Our results generally indicate the dominance of the sectoral intensity effect although, for the UK in particular, evidence of an increasingly clean product mix is found. Copyright ©2005 by the IAEE.

In strategy 1, the residue of Material Recovery (MR) is fed directly to a grate combustor, while in strategy 2 the grate combustor comes downstream of light mechanical treatment. In strategies 3 and 4, the MR residue is converted into Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), in a fluidized cumbuster bed. The results of Part A, devoted to mass and energy balances, clearly show that pre-treating the MR residue in order to increase the heating value of the feedstock fed to the WTE plant has marginal effects on the energy efficiency of the WTE plant. When considering the efficiency of the whole strategy of waste management, the energy balances show that the more thorough the pre-treatment, the smaller the amount of energy recovered per unit of MR residue. Starting from the heat/mass balances illustrated in Part A, Part B examines the environmental impacts and economics of the various strategies by means of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Results show that treating the MR residues ahead of the WTE plant does not provide environmental or economic benefits. RDF production worsens almost all impact indicators because it reduces net electricity production and thus the displacement of power plant emissions; it also increases costs, because the benefits of improving the quality of the material fed to the WTE plant do not compensate the cost of such improvement. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The design and performance of such systems have been commercially proven to the point that the application of these technologies is a cost effective means for states to effectively meet pollution reduction goals. One of the reasons that these technologies are so widely applied is because they can be sized and fitted based on easily measurable vehicle parameters and published engine emission information. These devices generally work passively with basic temperature and back pressure monitoring devices being used to alert the operator to upset conditions. The application of an effective NOx reduction technology in similar retrofit installation, is more complicated. There are no passive NOx reduction technologies that can be retrofit onto HDD vehicles. Because of the long useful life of existing HDD vehicles, a retrofit SCR technology that could provide 80% NOx reduction will be very beneficial. Previously, a retrofit CRDPF plus SCR technology was demonstrated for NOx reductions of 80% [1]. However, this system was primarily designed for development and demonstration purposes and there is a need for a truly commercialized retrofit product. In order to be widely acceptable, a retrofit SCR technology needs to be flexible in its control and installation, allowing it to fit on to a large cross section of vehicles. It must also be durable and cost effective. This paper will discuss the development of a commercially available four-way (NOx, PM, CO and HC) emission reduction product for retrofit on HDD vehicles. The system combines the Johnson Matthey CRT ® filter with a urea SCR system and is known commercially as SCRT® system. This paper will discuss the development of such a system through integration of the injection system hardware, control algorithm and catalysts. The SCRT® system utilizes a urea injection system that is deployed on the vehicle as components giving the product more flexibility and lower cost. The urea injection components are: urea pump, air regulator, dosing unit and nozzle. The system utilizes a control system that allows the application engineer to customize it to the engine and catalyst size. It can also use either an engine map or NOx sensor for urea injection control. Transient and steady state test cell data demonstrating > 80% NOx reduction with this system are presented. In addition, chassis dyno emissions results and field data from Europe are reported, demonstrating successful on-road performance of the system.

More than half of the sequestered carbon is allocated to leaves and twigs and ∼20% to wood. Only ∼25% is retained in the live trees with leaf and twig fall accounting for 80-84% of the total transfers to the environment. An alternative method of calculating sequestration rates from consideration of water use and carbon-isotope discrimination data had a close to 1:1 match with estimates from allometric relationships.

Experimental data sets relative to Boreal, Tropical, Temperate and Mediterranean ecosystems are used to estimate the robustness of the scheme at the canopy scale, and over contrasted climatic and ecological conditions. A good agreement is generally found when comparing field measurements and simulated emission fluxes, encouraging us to consider the model suitable for regional application. Limitations of the scheme are nevertheless outlined as well as further on-going improvements. In the second part of the article, the emission scheme is used on line in the broader context of a meso-scale atmospheric chemistry model. Dynamically idealized simulations are carried out to study the chemical interactions of pollutant plumes with realistic isoprene emissions coming from a Mediterranean oak forest. Two types of anthropogenic sources, respectively representative of the Marseille (urban) and Martigues (industrial) French Mediterranean sites, and both characterized by different VOC/NOx are considered. For the Marseille scenario, the impact of biogenic emission on ozone production is larger when the forest is situated in a sub-urban configuration (i.e. downwind distance TOWN-FOREST &lt;30 km, considering an advection velocity of 4.2 m.s-1). In this case the enhancement of ozone production due to isoprene can reach +37% in term of maximum surface concentrations and +11% in term of total ozone production. The impact of biogenic emission decreases quite rapidly when the TOWN-FOREST distance increases. For the Martigues scenario, the biogenic impact on the plume is significant up to TOWN-FOREST distance of 90 km where the ozone maximum surface concentration enhancement can still reach +30%. For both cases, the importance of the VOC/NOx ratio in the anthropogenic plume and its evolution when interacting with the forest emission are outlined. In complement to real case studies, this idealized approach can be particularly useful for process and sensitivity studies and constitutes a valuable tool to build regional ozone control strategies. © 2005 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; forest; isoprene; modeling; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24644454723

The result of air quality monitoring says that the air in 70 percent of Chinese cities does not meet standards. In 2003, the total amount of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emission reached about 2.5 times, 2.0 times and 3.0 times that of 1995 respectively. In the same period, the emission of other air pollutants like sulphur dioxide, soot and industrial dust dropped by 15 percent. This paper focuses on the application to an ongoing project in Shanghai about ""Motor Vehicle Emission Urban Pollution"" (MoVE-UP). In the framework of the Sino-Italian Cooperation Program for environmental protection, the Institute for Atmospheric Pollution of the Italian CNR is assessing the future trends in emissions and air quality in the urban area of Shanghai. The main topic is establishing a consistent framework in order to reduce emissions using the principles of cost-effectiveness, sound science and transparency, and to provide a foundation (in terms of data and modelling tools) for the transition towards longer-term air quality studies covering all emission sources. Priority has been given to a quantitative analysis of traffic emission and its effects on the urban environment of Shanghai, with the supply of a comprehensive strategy for vehicle-based pollution control. Besides the main ""conventional"" pollutants investigation, air quality modelling at urban and local scale have been employed to predict roadside air quality and to mitigate impacts.

The Plasma Fuel Reformer (PFR) has the ability to rapidly convert diesel fuel (with air), to a hydrogen rich gas on-board a vehicle, which is then utilized to efficiently regenerate a NOx trap. We have made several advances on the PFR as well as on the NOx reducing system. The Plasma Fuel Reformer operating range has been extended by 120% up to 1.5 g/s fuel flow rate while retaining the high hydrogen and low soot characteristics. The plasma power consumption has been further reduced and the high voltage design has been made more robust. The T90 start-up time during regenerations has been reduced to less than 4 seconds. The NOx reducing system utilizes a novel algorithm for NOx trap regeneration that reduces the fuel penalty by 25% while increasing NOx conversion by 10%. The new method can also be utilized to reduce the NOx trap volume significantly in a dual leg arrangement. Based on a detailed understanding of the NOx trap regeneration process, a new method to reduce the magnitude of NOx spikes has also been developed. Finally, optimization was performed at some steady state points utilizing maps on trap capacity and reductant breakthrough.

Several general circulation models used to predict climate change have or are being modified to include interactions of ecosystems with climate. Climate change necessitates that parameters within ecosystem models must change during long-term simulations, especially mortality parameters that increase as organisms are pushed toward the boundaries of their thermal tolerance. There is therefore a pressing need to understand the influence of varying mortality parameters on the long-term behaviour of ecosystem models. Mortality terms have been identified as important determinants of ecosystem model dynamics. Although many forms of mortality have been proposed for use in ecosystem models, linear mortality forms are often used because they are simple, require only one parameter each (parameters are often poorly known), and there is little empirical data to support alternative forms. Mortality parameters have also proved to be useful bifurcation parameters for simple ecosystem models. We consider an ecosystem model originally developed to reproduce marine plankton and microbial dynamics that was subsequently developed to include dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) and DMS for use in climate change simulations. This model has proved useful in reproducing spatial distributions and depth profiles of DMS observed in the ocean and in predicting the potential for biogenic DMS to ameliorate climate change. Reproducing observed data is often the only validation available for ecosystem models. The model is composed of five biotic compartments: phytoplankton (P), zooplankton (Z), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N), bacteria (B) and zooflagellates (F). The model is composed of five coupled differential equations that together with the mass conservation constraint B + F + N + P + Z = 1 form a four degrees of freedom system where each scaled variable is a concentration satisfying 0 ≤ B, F, N, P, Z ≤ 1 for all time t > 0. The model has fourteen critical points of which seven lie in the ecologically feasible region of the state space for measured parameter values. The location and stability properties of these critical points substantially control the dynamics of the model. The model has a very complicated, robust and highly nonlinear limit cycle attractor. This attractor is composed of two distinct components; a BFN component and an NPZ component. Mostly the model circulates on planes where B + F + N = 1 and N + P + Z = 1 rather than in the full four-dimensional state space. We examine the effects of varying three linear mortality coefficients. Although the limit cycle of the model is very robust with respect to variations in the values of the mortality parameters, significant changes in dynamics can be induced by parameter variations. Stable spiral points and asymptotically stable nodes are observed for moderate one-at-a-time variations in mortality. A climate change scenario, in which all mortality parameters are increased simultaneously, indicates the ecosystem will reach a final stable state where only phytoplankton exist. This state is a result of the model not containing an explicit phytoplankton mortality term. The inclusion of a phytoplankton mortality term to the model has little effect on the dynamics, and hence its ability to reproduce observed data, but has a significant effect on the bifurcation behaviour. Rather than predict an phytoplankton-dominated final state, the model now predicts the extinction of all biota. This research suggests that the specific formulation of ecosystem models must be considered very carefully if they are to be applied in simulations of climate change.","Bifurcation; Climate change; Ecosystems; Mortality","1-forms; Asymptotically stable; Bifurcation parameter; Biotic compartments; Climate change scenarios; Climate change simulations; Coupled differential equations; Critical points; Depth profile; Dimethylsulphide; Dissolved inorganic nitrogens; Ecosystem model; Empirical data; Feasible regions; Final state; Four-degrees-of-freedom; General circulation model; Highly nonlinear; Limit cycle; Limit cycle attractors; Long term simulation; Marine planktons; Mass conservation; Measured parameters; Microbial dynamics; Mortality; Observed data; Parameter variation; Spiral points; Stability properties; Stable state; State space; Thermal tolerance; Bifurcation parameter; Climate change scenarios; Climate change simulations; Coupled differential equations; Dissolved inorganic nitrogens; Four-degrees-of-freedom; General circulation model; Limit cycle attractors; Algae control; Bifurcation (mathematics); Climate models; Computer simulation; Decision making; Diamonds; Differential equations; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Marine applications; Marine biology; Ocean habitats; Particles (particulate matter); Phytoplankton; Stability; Structures (built objects); Bifurcation (mathematics); Climate models; Decision making; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Differential equations; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Marine biology; Phytoplankton; Plankton; Stability; Structures (built objects); Climate change; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053128570

On the other hand, we indicated that a third flow component shows up in the reaction plane as an enhanced emission, which is orthogonal to the directed flow. This is not shadowed by the deflected projectile and target, and shows up at measurable rapidities, YCM = 1-2. To study the formation of this effect initial stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions are tudied. An effective string rope model is presented for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Our model takes into account baryon recoil for both target and projectile, arising from the acceleration of partons in an effective field. The typical field strength (string tension) for RHIC energies is about 5-12 GeV/fm, what allows us to talk about ""string ropes"". The results show that QGP forms a tilted disk, such that the direction of the largest pressure gradient stays in the reaction plane, but deviates from both the beam and the usual transverse flow directions. The produced initial state can be used as an initial condition for further hydrodynamical calculations. Such initial conditions lead to the creation of third flow component. Recent v1 measurements are promising that this effect can be used as a diagnostic tool of the QGP. © 2005 Akademiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Effective string rope model; Fluid dynamical model; QGP signal; Third flow component","Flow measurement; Fluid dynamics; Plasma collision processes; Plasmas; Pressure effects; Projectiles; Quantum theory; Effective string rope model; Fluid dynamical model; QGP signal; Third flow component; Heavy ions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23144444583

Open-top, up-flow bio filters with a packing based on bark or soil-bark mixtures is the predominant design. The first installations were designed for odor control at wastewater treatment facilities in the 1970s (Archer and Fullerton 1992). Typical applications of bio filters in New Zealand include meat rendering plants, wastewater treatment facilities, compost production, food processing, and hide-processing plants. A combination of standard practice and present New Zealand air pollution laws have resulted in virtually no bio filters being installed for non-odor-based applications. While odor control is often considered an ""easy"" bio filter application, the success of this technology in New Zealand has ranged from poor to very good, and the reasons for this range of experience is generally related to different bed designs and or level of pretreatment of air ahead of the bio filter. Other types of bioreactors, such as bio trickling filters, are not widely used for odor control for several reasons. Firstly, there is often sufficient land to construct simple open-top, up-flow bio filters. Additionally, bio trickling filters typically require a higher level of expertise to operate. Finally, bio trickling filters are normally offered by overseas vendors as a complete package in the same manner as chemical scrubbing equipment. By comparison, the vast majority of flat bed bio filter systems that have been installed in New Zealand to date are designed by engineering consulting firms or staff engineers, and the installation phase is undertaken by construction companies, local engineering contractors or the companys own engineering staff. The labor requirements for constructing and operating these designs are minimal. These aspects combine to make bio filters the least expensive bio logical odor control technology to install and operate for the New Zealand market. Although the style of bio filter typically installed in New Zealand is relatively simple to construct and operate, this more informal arrangement of design and installation requires careful management and clear contractual obligations, so that any non-performance can be clearly attributed to design, installation or operational deficiencies. It is the early success of soil bio filters that has led to the almost universal use of soil-based bio filters in New Zealand. This compares to the UnitedStates, where compost-based bio filters are used more often than soil-basedones for odor applications (Solomon 1994; Easter and Okonak 2000; Iran pour et al. 2001). This success is most likely due to soil-based bio filters performing better in the open-top style preferred in New Zealand. Open-top bio filters can potentially see higher moisture variations due to solar heating and rain fall or heavy frost events, and are more easily rewetted. They also are potentially more physically stable and have a higher buffering capacity. Because the flow direction has to be upward, the acid production normally associated with odor control is more easily washed from the bottom of the bed where the highest loadings are experienced (Devinny et al. 1999; Easter and Okonak2000). In this chapter, the authors will review the typical bio filter design use din New Zealand and, where appropriate, compare it to practice as reported else where. We will cover stream characterization, pretreatment, bed design, and operational issues. The chapter will conclude with a number of common mistakes observed in the field. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960834458

RSSCTs were conducted using three to five commercially available media on six ground waters in Arizona. Testing was done following a protocol developed by Arizona State University. RSSCTs were originally developed to quickly evaluate the organic removal performance of activated carbon, and similar protocols have been developed for Arsenic removal with metal-oxide sorbents. The results from the RSSCTs allowed comparison of run lengths (measured in bed volumes (BVs)) from each media before the Arsenic concentration in treated water was greater than 10 μg/L or a specified target goal. These tests simulate operation of a full-scale Arsenic adsorption treatment system. Due to the rapidly approaching implementation of the Arsenic rule, several municipalities have been working to expedite Arsenic treatment system selection and implementation. RSSCT durations range from 2 to 8 weeks rather than 6-months to 12-months required for pilot testing. RSSCTs were used at different groundwater wells to confirm the effectiveness of adsorption media for Arsenic removal in specific water matrices. Groundwater tested covered a range of water quality parameters. Arsenic concentrations ranged from 11 to 50 μg/L. Field pH ranged from 7.5 to 8.6. Silica concentrations ranged from 15.4 to 47.6 mg/L. In some cases Arsenic breakthrough curves showed notable differences based upon differing water matrices and in other cases media performance was similar. Based upon a fast approaching compliance deadline, bench scale testing using RSSCTs was specified by each of three water systems in lieu of pilot testing. RSSCTs were not only utilized to ensure that the media selected adequately removed Arsenic, but testing was also used to prescreen vendors for bidding purposes and help establish anticipated media change-out frequencies and associated operation and maintenance cost projections. This paper will benefit water systems that have struggled to meet compliance by January 2006, with the introduction of a tool that will aid in making secure decisions on technology selection. RSSCTs may also be used in forth coming years to test new media on specific water matrices as they become available on the market. © 2005 American Water Works Association WQTC Conference All Rights Reserved.",,"Arizona; Arizona state university; Arsenic adsorption; Arsenic concentration; Arsenic removal; Associated costs; Bed volume; Bench-scale testing; Break through curve; Groundwater wells; Maximum contaminant levels; Metal-oxide; New media; Operation and maintenance; Organic removal; Pilot testing; Rapid small-scale column tests; Run length; Silica concentrations; Technology selection; Treatment systems; Treatment technologies; Water matrices; Water quality parameters; Water system; Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Groundwater; Pollution control; Silica; Technology; Water quality; Waterworks; Arsenic",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874319553

Small scooters, which are very much used in the congested centers of several cities are a remarkable source of air pollution. Therefore every effort to reduce the emissions is an important contribution to improve the air quality in urban centers. In the present work detailed investigations of particle emissions of a Peugeot scooter with TSDI (Two Stroke Direct Injection) were performed. The nanoparticulate emissions with different lube oils and fuels were measured by means of SMPS, (CPC) and NanoMet*). Also the particle mass emission (PM) was measured with the same method as for Diesel engines. It can be stated, that the oil and fuel quality have a considerable influence on the particle emissions, which are mainly oil condensates. Not all influences can be explained and more detailed knowledge about the oil composition and about the used additive packages is necessary. The use of non active catalyst leads to strongly increased particle emissions values, both mass and counts. Since the particulate emission of the 2-S consists mainly of lube oil condensates the minimization of oil consumption stays still an important goal.

The FTIR was installed in a medium class EURO1 spark ignition passenger vehicle in order to measure on-road emissions. The vehicle was also instrumented to allow the logging of engine speed, road speed, global position, throttle position, air-fuel ratio, air flow and fuel flow in addition to engine, exhaust and catalyst temperatures. This instrumentation allowed the calculation of mass-based emissions from the volume-based concentrations measured by the FTIR. To validate the FTIR data, the instrument was used to measure emissions from an engine subjected to a real-world drive cycle using an AC dynamometer. Standard analyzers were operated simultaneously for comparison with the FTIR and the standard analyzer results showed that most pollutants (NOx, CO 2, CO) were within ∼10% of a standard analyzer during steady state conditions and within 20% during transients. The exception to this was total HC which was generally 50% or less than actual total HC, but this was due to the limited number of hydrocarbons measured by the FTIR. In addition to the regulated emissions, five toxic hydrocarbon species were analyzed and found to be sensitive to cold starts in varying proportions. Finally, FTIR data was compared to results from a commercially available on-road measurement system (Horiba OBS-1000), and there was good agreement.

The protocol imposes the counties, a reduction of 5% (On the level of 1990) of the emissions of six gases that cause the greenhouse effect: CO2 (carbon dioxide or carbon gas), CH4 (methane), Nitrilic oxide (N2O) and three fluor gases (HFC, PFC and SF 6). The use of alcohol by Flex fuel vehicles contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect reduction, once CO2 emitted by theses vehicles when fueled with ethanol were previously absorbed form atmosphere during the photosynthesis on the plantation process. The CO 2 reduction in the exhaust and his absorption during plantations gets the world attention on the FLEX engines and on the Brazilian alcohol-business. They blunt as a strong technology, already available, that can shared with other counties in all economical options. Be in the export of fuel injection systems of Brazilian Flex engines; be in the export of the alcohol fuel, or for credits on the sugar cane plantations that can assure the country to obtaining carbon credits, since countries can compensate his pollution paying for the rescue of CO2 quotes through reforestation or projects. The flex vehicle in its day by day can be fueled with any mixture of alcohol or gasoline, and the form to establishing the amount avoided CO2 will be though the evaluation of the amount of alcohol used in the moment that the mixture is burned. The amount of avoided CO2 should be permanently stored in the memory of Engine Control Unit - ECU for consultation through diagnosis equipments. This work demonstrates the calculation for the avoided CO2 in atmosphere, taking into account limits established by the Kyoto protocol. The combustion equations analyses were confirmed with practical results in vehicle laboratory.

There are two distinct phases in which the application of the knowledge of weather and climate can reduce the impact of drought on the communities. The first is the long term planning in which strategies can be devised, and precautions taken to reduce impact. The second phase is the action taken during the onset of the event to reduce adverse effect. Efforts were made to stabilize dryland agriculture by evolving contingent crop production strategies in rainfed areas of India. Drought management policies included agricultural planning and practices with consideration of overall water requirement within the individual agroclimatic zones. The ill effects of drought, to a considerable extent, can be alleviated by adopting proper crop management strategies. These strategies may vary from moisture conservation to manipulation of plant population, and even mid-season corrections. Rainfall also can be harvested in either farm ponds or in village tanks and can be recycled. In case of drought mitigation, it was recommended that economies diversify to include agro-industry or various tertiary products, which could create new forms of income. The focus in mitigation should be on measures like improvement in agriculture, management of rangeland, development of water resource and animal husbandry. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate policies and strengthen institutional mechanisms for drought preparedness and mitigation accompanied by concrete programs. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892324101

It was recognized early that for carbon dioxide to be sequestered into coal seams, the carbon dioxide would be in a supercritical state (greater than 31°C, 7.3 MPa). Although coals have long been known to absorb carbon dioxide strongly at pressures below 5 MPa, relatively little work has been done measuring the effect of supercritical carbon dioxide on coals. Some studies on the adsorption of gases onto activated carbons have indicated that, at high pressures, where the gas density approaches the density of the adsorbed phase, the excess (or Gibbs) absorption is more useful and more accurately determinable than the absolute adsorption. The excess adsorption for carbon dioxide on dry activated carbon at 45°C reaches a maximum at about 8 MPa and then decreases linearly with increasing gas density (not pressure), reaching zero when the gas density is the same as the adsorbed phase density. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These technologies produce energy from a diverse set of biological resources - traditional crops, crop residues, energy-dedicated crops, dung, and the organic component of urban waste. The results are bioenergy products that provide multiple energy services: cooking fuel, heat, electricity and transportation fuels. It is this very diversity that holds the potential of a win-win-win for the environment, social and economic development.

In POX-MeO the required oxygen for the partial oxidation of methane is provided by a transition metal oxide (MeO). First, H2 is produced through CH4+MeO = CO+H2+Me. Secondly, Me is re-oxidized through Me+O2 = MeO to regenerate the oxygen carrier. In the CL process, CH4 is being completely oxidized through CH2 + MeO = CO2 + H2O + Me producing heat and CO2 ready for sequestration. Finally, Me is re-oxidized using air to regenerate the Me back to MeO. In both processes the regenerated MeO is sent back to the initial step to result in a cyclic operation. Continuous exposure of MeO to Redox cycles frequently produces sinterization and MeO stabilization is needed to avoid loss of activity. The objective of this study is to investigate the stabilization effect of TiO2 in Co3O4 during Redox cycles to be used as an oxygen carrier using CoxTiOy, type spinnels. Characterization of the synthesized samples included XRD, TPR, and SEM. Co 2TiO4 and CoTiO3 spinnels were synthesized by solid state reaction.

The main issues of these vehicles are the energy management system and the overall fuel economy. An overview of the existing solutions with respect to their overall efficiency is reported in the paper. On the bases of the literature results the more efficient power train scheme has been selected. The present investigation aims at identifying the best control strategy to power a vehicle with both fuel cell and battery to reduce fuel consumption. The optimization of the control strategy is achieved by using a genetic algorithm. To model the powertrain behaviour an on purpose made simulation program has been developed and implemented in Matlab/Simulink. In particular, the fuel cell model is based on the theory of Amphlett, whereas the battery model also accounts for the charge/discharge efficiency. The analyzed powertrain is equipped with an energy recovery system. During acceleration, power is demanded to the storage system, while during deceleration the battery is recharged. All the tested control strategies assume that the battery SOC can vary between a minimum and a maximum value and that the fuel cell system has to work around its maximum efficiency. All the tested strategies have been validated on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and on the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS).",,"Fuel-cell electric vehicle; New European Driving Cycle (NEDC); Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS); Control systems; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Mathematical models; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646564024

Here, the term biomass includes organic matter produced as a result of photosynthesis as well as municipal, industrial and animal waste material. Brief summaries of the basic concepts involved in the combustion of biomass fuels are presented. Renewable energy sources (RES) supply 14% of the total world energy demand. RES are biomass, hydropower, geothermal, solar, wind and marine energies. The renewables are the primary, domestic and clean or inexhaustible energy resources. The percentage share of biomass was 62.1% of total renewable energy sources in 1995. Experimental results for a large variety of biomass fuels and conditions are presented. Numerical studies are also discussed. Biomass is an attractive renewable fuel in utility boilers. The compositions of biomass among fuel types are variable. Ash composition for the biomass is fundamentally different from ash composition for the coal. Especially inorganic constituents cause to critical problems of toxic emissions, fouling and slagging. Metals in ash, in combination with other fuel elements such as silica and sulfur, and facilitated by the presence of chlorine, are responsible for many undesirable reactions in combustion furnaces and power boilers. Elements including K, Na, S, Cl, P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Si are involved in reactions leading to ash fouling and slagging in biomass combustors. Chlorine in the biomass may affect operation by corrosion. Ash deposits reduce heat transfer and may also result in severe corrosion at high temperatures. Other influences of biomass composition are observed for the rates of combustion and pollutant emissions. Biomass combustion systems are non-polluting and offer significant protection of the environment. The reduction of greenhouse gases pollution is the main advantage of utilizing biomass energy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The ""Current Legislation"" (CLE) scenario reflects the current perspectives of individual countries on future economic development and takes the anticipated effects of presently decided emission control legislation in the individual countries into account. In addition, we developed a ""Maximum technically Feasible Reduction"" (MFR) scenario that outlines the scope for emission reductions offered by full implementation of the presently available emission control technologies, while maintaining the projected levels of anthropogenic activities. Whereas the resulting projections of methane emissions lie within the range suggested by other greenhouse gas projections, the recent pollution control legislation of many Asian countries, requiring introduction of catalytic converters for vehicles, leads to significantly lower growth in emissions of the air pollutants NOx, NMVOC and CO than was suggested by the widely used and more pessimistic IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 2000), which made Business-as-Usual assumptions regarding emission control technology. With the TM3 and STOCHEM models we performed several long-term integrations (1990-2030) to assess global, hemispheric and regional changes in CH4, CO, hydroxyl radicals, ozone and the radiative climate forcings resulting from these two emission scenarios. Both models reproduce broadly the observed trends in CO, and CH4 concentrations from 1990 to 2002. For the ""current legislation"" case, both models indicate an increase of the annual average ozone levels in the Northern Hemisphere by 5 ppbv, and up to 15 ppbv over the Indian sub-continent, comparing the 2020s (2020-2030) with the 1990s (1990 2000). The corresponding higher ozone and methane burdens in the atmosphere increase radiative forcing by approximately 0.2 Wm-2. Full application of today's emissions control technologies, however, would bring down ozone below the levels experienced in the 1990s and would reduce the radiative forcing of ozone and methane to approximately -0.1 Wm-2. This can be compared to the 0.140-0.47 Wm-2 increase of methane and ozone radiative forcings associated with the SRES scenarios. While methane reductions lead to lower ozone burdens and to less radiative forcing, further reductions of the air pollutants NOx and NMVOC result in lower ozone, but at the same time increase the lifetime of methane. Control of methane emissions appears an efficient option to reduce tropospheric ozone as well as radiative forcing. © 2005 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; climate modeling; emission control; methane; ozone; radiative forcing; troposphere",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24644442645

The European Community/Commission introduced environmental action programmes in 1972 (Statement from the Paris Summit 1972). However, the real breakthrough occurred with the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1992, where environmental protection was set as a priority. In support of environmental assessment, the need for updated information on land cover (LC) has become important both at the European and national levels. The growing interest in such information can be ascribed to the important role of LC in processes taking place on the Earth's surface, such as absorption of solar radiation, utilization of carbon dioxide by plant associations and evaporation. Landscape changes at the national and global levels are becoming even more topical, and their importance acquires new dimensions not only in research, but also in environmental management. That is why harmonized and standardized spatial reference data are considered mandatory in support to the following environmental management in the European Union policies: - Environmental assessment and sustainable development (European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development COM (European Commission 2001). - Territorial impact assessment and regional planning (Structural Funds, European Spatial Development Perspective). - Impact of agricultural policies on the environment. - Nature Conservation and Environmental Protection (the Natura2000 network and LIFE programme). - Water Framework Directive. - Integrated coastal management. - Strategic environmental assessment of the Trans-European network. In response to the need for environmental assessment, the IMAGE 2000 & CORINE Land Cover 2000 (I&CLC2000) project was launched by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC). The I&CLC2000 project aims to provide a satellite image mosaic of Europe (IMAGE2000), an up-to-date LC database for the year 2000 (CLC2000), and information on general LC changes in Europe between 1990-2000 (Steenmans and Perdigao 2001). The I&CLC2000 is a joint three-year project between the EEA and the JRC, co-funded by the European Commission and the participating countries. Initiated in 2000 in Member States, the project was extended in 2001 to accession countries and currently covers 29 countries.","Change detection; Digital; Environment; International; Interpretation; Inventory; Land cover; Updating","Change detection; Digital; Environment; International; Interpretation; Inventory; Land cover; Updating; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental management; International law; Landforms; Planning; Plants (botany); Regional planning; Remote sensing; Space optics; Sun; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Environmental protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866071128

There is, however, no single method that allows one to access the full stress tensor. In this paper, we present a case study in a carbonate/shale sequence where the full stress tensor was determined as a function of depth with a combination of microhydraulic fracturing and wellbore image analysis applied to vertical, deviated, and horizontal wellbores. Vertical wells are the best starting point for the determination of the complete stress tensor. In this setting, openhole hydraulic fracturing is the most robust method for determining the magnitude of the minimum in-situ stress. The use of a wireline formation tester and a special methodology allows one to determine the precision of the measurement. Image analysis completes this technique by providing the orientation of the minimum stress. Once this information is known, the combination of hydraulic fracturing and image analysis in deviated and horizontal wells allows for the determination of the complete state of stress. In horizontal wells drilled parallel to the direction of a principal stress, the combination of hydraulic fracturing and packer fracturing allows for measuring the two stresses acting perpendicular to the wellbore. In the case study, where the well was drilled parallel to the minimum stress, the technique also provided the minimum stress magnitude. In such a setting, image analysis is crucial to confirming the orientation of the created fractures and thus which stress is measured. This case study demonstrates that these two methods are quite complementary.

A representative area was schematized using the hydrological model SIMGRO. Under actual land use, climate change would increase discharge. Under a 5% precipitation increase scenario, afforestation in the lowlands will reduce discharge enough to control flooding.

The MWNTs are virtually free of nonnanotube carbon impurities but contain residual iron catalyst particles. The MWNTs are also highly graphitic. No hydrogen adsorption is observed at near ambient temperatures for purified MWNTs that are free of iron particles. However, hydrogen adsorption is also not observed on bare iron particles even following reduction in the presence of hydrogen at 775 K. These results imply that a special synergy occurs when small iron particles or atoms are in intimate contact with sp 2-hybridized aromatic carbon. Interestingly, reducing the assynthesized MWNTs in H 2 at 573 K results in an increased hydrogen capacity. Understanding this hydrogen storage mechanism could facilitate the economical engineering of a hydrogen storage material that meets the United States Department of Energy targets for vehicular fuel cell applications. Recent theoretical studies have shown that an iron ad atom forms a complex with a C 36 fullerene and shares charge with four carbon atoms of a bent five-membered ring. Three H 2 ligands then coordinate with the iron forming a stable 18-electron organometallic complex. Here the binding energy of the molecular hydrogen ligands is ∼43 kJ /mol.

Each of these methods has unique strengths. In this paper, we present a concept for integrating these approaches into a unified sensor. Design goals include spectral coverage from the near-UV to the shortwave infrared; intensity and polarimetric imaging simultaneously at multiple view angles; global coverage within a few days; kilometer to sub-kilometer spatial resolution; and measurement of the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) for a subset of the spectral complement with an uncertainty of 0.5% or less. This high polarimetric accuracy is the most challenging aspect of the design, and is specified in order to achieve climate-quality uncertainties in optical depth, refractive index, and other microphysical properties. Based upon MISR heritage, a pushbroom multi-camera architecture is envisioned, using separate line arrays to collect imagery within each camera in the different spectral bands and in different polarization orientations. For the polarimetric data, accurate cross-calibration of the individual line arrays is essential. An electro-optic polarization ""scrambler"", activated periodically during calibration sequences, is proposed as a means of providing this cross-calibration. The enabling component is a rapid retardance modulator. Candidate technologies include liquid crystals, rotating waveplates, and photoelastic modulators (PEMs). The PEM, which uses a piezoelectric transducer to induce rapid time-varying stress birefringence in a glass bar, appears to be the most suitable approach. An alternative measurement approach, also making use of a PEM, involves synchronous demodulation of the oscillating signal to reconstruct the polarization state. The latter method is potentially more accurate, but requires a significantly more complex detector architecture.","Aerosols; Imaging; Multiangle; Multispectral; Photoelastic modulator; Polarization; Remote sensing","Microphysical properties; Multiangle; Multispectral; Photoelastic modulators; Data acquisition; Infrared imaging; Polarimeters; Refractive index; Remote sensing; Space research; Spectrum analysis; Aerosols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344375217

An interactive spreadsheet-based model allows the analysis of reduced greenhouse gas emission scenarios for electricity supply by changing assumptions for: the efficiency of new power plants; the rate of capital stock turnover; the rate of deployment of carbon dioxide capture and storage; and the rate of deployment of renewable energy systems, and other parameters. Cases are presented that show the potential impact that advanced CO2 capture and storage technology could have on net greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensity. With lower cost CO2 capture technology, reliable long-term storage options, and economic incentives the deployment of coal-fired power plants with CO2 sequestration could reach 80 GW in 2025. Similarly, the use of CO2 sequestration by natural gas-fired plants could reach 20 GW in 2025. The analysis framework shows that the application of carbon capture and storage to coal-fired power plants could strategically transform them into critical assets that are consistent with speculative, future atmospheric stabilization scenarios. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This investigation explores the potential use of MIM devices as a hot electron source in the development of plasma technologies for hypersonic travel. An array of 24 MIM devices was fabricated in vacuum using electron beam evaporation. A nanolaminated MIM structure (thickness ≈100 nm) was formed by deposition of the metal (titanium and gold) and insulator (silicon dioxide) layers. A combinatorial approach, that enabled independent control of thickness and composition of each layer, was used to identify the optimal deposition parameters. The MIM devices were biased between 0-15 V, and both the total emission current and energy distribution of the emitted electrons were measured using a collection grid and a hemispherical energy analyzer, respectively. The emission current density was in the range of 1mA/m 2. The energy distribution indicated that the kinetic energy of the electrons was quasiballistic with minimal loss due to inelastic scattering, and the maximum in the energy distribution could be tuned by changing the voltage bias across the device. The MIM devices were cycled through multiple voltage ramp cycles, both positive and negative, to study device endurance and performance with time. The emission current was found to increase with the number of voltage cycles in most cases. The asymmetry in emission for positive versus negative voltage ramp suggests that the migration of defects in the insulator plays a role in electron transport mechanism across the insulator.

There are two ways that convection affects O3. First, convection affects O3 by vertical mixing of O3 itself. Convection lifts lower tropospheric air to regions where the O3 lifetime is longer, whilst mass-balance subsidence mixes O3-rich upper tropospheric (UT) air downwards to regions where the O3 lifetime is shorter. This tends to decrease UT O3 and the overall tropospheric column of O3. Secondly, convection affects O3 by vertical mixing of O3 precursors. This affects O3 chemical production and destruction. Convection transports isoprene and its degradation products to the UT where they interact with lightning NOx to produce PAN, at the expense of NOx. In our model, we find that convection reduces UT NOx through this mechanism; convective down-mixing also flattens our imposed profile of lightning emissions, further reducing UT NOx. Over tropical land, which has large lightning NOx emissions in the UT, we find convective lofting of NOx from surface sources appears relatively unimportant. Despite UT NOx decreases, UT O3 production increases as a result of UT HOx increases driven by isoprene oxidation chemistry. However, UT O3 tends to decrease, as the effect of convective overturning of O3 itself dominates over changes in O3 chemistry. Convective transport also reduces UT O3 in the mid-latitudes resulting in a 13% decrease in the global tropospheric O3 burden. These results contrast with an earlier study that uses a model of similar chemical complexity. Differences in convection schemes as well as chemistry schemes - in particular isoprene-driven changes are the most likely causes of such discrepancies. Further modelling studies are needed to constrain this uncertainty range. © 2005 Author(s).

The system model 'Natural Gas' describes production, distribution, and combustion of natural gas. Methods. Comprehensive life cycle inventories of the energy systems were established and cumulative results calculated within the ecoinvent framework. Swiss conditions for the nuclear cycle were extrapolated to major nuclear countries. Long-term radon emissions from uranium mill tailings have been estimated with a simplified model. Average natural gas power plants were analysed for different countries considering specific import/export of the gas, with seven production regions separately assessed. Uncertainties have been estimated quantitatively. Results and Discussion. Different radioactive emission species and wastes are produced from different steps of the nuclear cycle. Emissions of greenhouse gases from the nuclear cycle are mostly from the upstream chain, and the total is small and decreasing with increasing share of centrifuge enrichment. The results for natural gas show the importance of transport and low pressure distribution network for the methane emissions, whereas energy is mostly invested for production and long-distance pipeline transportation. Because of significant differences in power plant efficiencies and gas supply, country specific averages differ greatly. Conclusion. The inventory describes average worldwide supply of nuclear fuel and average nuclear reactors in Western Europe. Although the model for nuclear waste management was extrapolated from Swiss conditions, the ranges obtained for cumulative results can represent the average in Europe. Emissions per kWh electricity are distributed very differently over the natural gas chain for different species. Modern combined cycle plants show better performance for several burdens like cumulative greenhouse gas emissions compared to average plants. Recommendation and Perspective. Comparison of country-specific LWRs or LWR types on the basis of these results is not recommended. Specific issues on different strategies for the nuclear fuel cycle or location-specific characteristics would require extension of analysis. Results of the gas chain should not be directly applied to areas other than those modelled because emission factors and energy requirements may differ significantly. A future update of inventory data should reconsider production and transport from Russia, as it is a major producer and exporter to Europe. The calculated ranges of uncertainty factors in ecoinvent provide useful information but they are more indications of uncertainties rather than strict 95% intervals, and should therefore be applied carefully.","Ecoinvent; Electricity; Gas combined cycle; Industrial gas; Life cycle inventory; Natural gas system; Nuclear fuel cycle; Nuclear system; Switzerland; Uncertainty","natural gas; nuclear fuel; uranium; article; climate; computer program; electric power plant; electricity; energy consumption; energy resource; energy yield; greenhouse gas; heating; information processing; information system; life cycle assessment; nuclear fuel reprocessing; nuclear power plant; priority journal; Switzerland; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944385896

It focuses on the cost of capturing CO2, with the implicit assumption that storage options would be relatively cheap, plentiful, and located in close proximity to future CO2 point sources. It provides an initial examination of the consequence of regionally disaggregated demand for, and supply of, CO2-storage reservoirs within the context of a globally disaggregated, long-term analysis of both the geology and economics of capture and storage (CCS). It is suggested that some regions see their ability to deploy CCS systems constrained by a lack of quality target reservoirs relative to major sources in that region. Other regions appear to have sufficient storage capacity to easily carry them through the 21st century. It also examines the degree to which the relative abundance of CCS opportunities in a region influences the adoption of other emissions-mitigation technologies. This chapter confirms that CCS is an important potential response to climate change throughout the 21st century and a technology that can help control the cost of addressing climate change. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

But according to the above analysis, following the WRE450 emissions pathway would result in the retirement of 769 plants in the space of 60 years (2005-2064), an average of 13 coal plants per year for six decades, resulting in a nearly complete decommissioning and rebuilding of the entire U.S. coal-fired fleet, with additional turnover in oil- and gas-fired generation. In either the WRE450 or WRE550 case, it is clear that the measures necessary to bring about stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of CO2 for just one sector of the U.S. economy, the electric utility sector, will require a massive effort on the part of industrial and public entities. Even if such a large-scale deployment of CCS within the U.S. electric power sector were to be undertaken, it must be coupled with similar aggressive emissions strategies in all economic sectors and in all nations to have the desired impact of bringing about stabilized atmospheric concentrations of CO2. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The streams have acted as a sink for organic and inorganic loads from several origins: domestic and industrial sewage and agricultural waste. The contents of the heavy metals Cr, Cd, Ni, Cu, Pb, and Zn were studied by sequential chemical extraction of the principal geochemical phases of streambed sediments, in the <63 μm fraction, in order to assess their potential availability to the environment, investigating the metal concentrations, assemblages, and trends. The granulometric and mineralogical characteristics of this sediment fraction were also studied. This study revealed clear pollution by Cr, Cd, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb, as a result from both natural and anthropogenic origins. The chemical transport of metals appears to be essentially by the following geochemical phases, in decreasing order of significance: (exchangeable + carbonates) ≫ (organics) ≫ (Mn and Fe oxides and hydroxides). The (exchangeable + carbonate) phase plays an important part in the fixation of Cu, Ni, Zn, and Cd. The organic phase is important in the fixation of Cr, Pb, and also Cu and Ni. Analyzing the metal contents in the residual fraction, we conclude that Zn and Cd are the most mobile, and Cr and Pb are less mobile than Cu and Ni. The proximity of the pollutant sources and the timing of the influx of contaminated material control the distribution of the contaminant-related sediments locally and on the network scale.","Fluvial sediments; Hydrographic basin; Metal pollution; Sequential extraction","Agricultural wastes; Environmental engineering; Extraction; Geochemistry; Heavy metals; Mineralogy; Rivers; Sediments; Sewage; Chemical transport; Geochemical phases; Metal concentrations; Pollutant sources; Sedimentology; cadmium; chromium; copper; lead; nickel; zinc; conference paper; environmental monitoring; geology; hydrography; mineralogy; Portugal; river basin; river ecosystem; seasonal variation; sediment; water contamination; Biological Availability; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Metals, Heavy; Portugal; Rivers; Water Pollutants; Extraction; Geochemistry; Heavy Metals; Rivers; Sediments; Sewage; Wastes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13144273812

After a period of about 10 years when the FBC technology was rejected as a solution for power generation, due to the new environmental restrictions, the market is open again. Potential users are especially industrial units with high energy consumption, having combustibile wastes resulting from the technological processes. Two case studies are presented. The first is the utility from the city of Motru, producing thermal agent for hte town district heating. It is currently equipped with one FB boiler (11.6 MWt hot water) and two pulverized coal boilers (50 t/h steam). The equipment is more than 40 years old, and is no longer acceptable in terms of thermal efficiency and pollutant emmissions. Taking into consideration the important biomass resources from the area, it was decided to build a new CFB boiler firing a mixture of local fuels - lignite and biomass waste. The second case study is ELECTROCARBON S.A. Slatina, the second important polluter from Olt county, producing carbon electrodes for use in metallurgy. Carbon waste resulting from the technological process have been deposited for many years in a nearby landfill, amounting to about 1.2 million tons. In spite of its high calorific value, because of the low volatile content and the grinding difficulties, little use was found for this material. Investigations are carried out to bum it in a fluidized bed boiler located near the site, that would replace two existing heat recovery steam generators producing electricity for the internal consumption.

For the seven basins as much as possible established modeling frameworks were used, where the focus was on the linkage between field scale models to explore farm scale water management and basin scale models dealing with water resources issues. Climate change projections were scaled to local conditions where the HadCM3 and the ECHAM4 General Circulation Models as well as the seven basins required different adjustment factors in this downscaling. For the seven basins selected, impacts and adaptation strategies at field scale indicated that overall food production will increase in the future as a result of enhanced CO2 levels, but that variation in yields will increase too. Linking this to the basin scale and including also environment focused adaptation strategies showed for the one example basin presented here, Walawe in Sri Lanka, that food security was more difficult to maintain than total food production and that environmental quality can be maintained by selecting the appropriate adaptation strategies. Results from the relatively complex modeling framework were converted to easily understandable graphs that have been used in discussions regarding adaptation strategies with various stakeholders. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate this hypothesis, longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus) were collected from four sites along the Athabasca River, Alberta (upstream reference site, two sites downstream of effluents from two pulp and paper mills, and a site downstream of effluent from a municipal sewage treatment plant). Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine were analyzed in bone, gonad, liver and white muscle tissues of the fish. In general, most sites and tissues differed according to δ13C, δ15N and δ34S values. Also, an interaction between site and tissue was observed for δ 15N values. A better insight into the usefulness of stable isotopes was obtained through the use of multivariate discriminant function analysis. δ15N and δ 34S signatures of gonad and liver tissues of males were most effective at classifying fish according to site (∼70% for both tissues). For all tissues except bone, fish from the upstream reference site were most separable from all others, especially females. δ 37Cl values for female gonads and male livers were related to sites downstream of the pulp and paper mills. Future research should routinely include SIA of fish tissues, but also of effluents, receiving waters and food web components to better resolve links between specific effluents and fish exposure.

While methane-based co-generation has been widely implemented at large wastewater facilities, it is generally not considered to be cost-effective for smaller plants. The Village of Essex Junction, with the support of Efficiency Vermont, has successfully implemented microturbine technology at its 2.0 million gallon per day (MGD) average-flow, municipal wastewater treatment facility, and can provide firsthand information on its financial benefits. The Essex Junction facility design is 3.3 MOD with flows at 2.0 MGD. This clarification is often important to design professionals as flow growth lends conservatism to the numbers. The Essex Junction co-generation project installed two, 30 kilowatt (kW) microturbines that combust waste methane gas to generate electricity. Waste heat from the microturbines is used to maintain 100-degree Fahrenheit temperatures for the site's anaerobic digestion process. Total system efficiency of electricity and heat generation is greater than 80%. With nearly 100% use of its waste methane, the facility now saves approximately 450,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) (45% of annual usage) and $43,000in electricity costs per year. As a result, more than 600,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants will be prevented because of this project. The Essex Junction project is the first of its kind at a small New England wastewater facility. Similar projects could likely be implemented at 5-15% of the nation's 16,000 publicly-owned wastewater treatment facilities. Efforts to expand methane-based co-generation at wastewater facilities would yield significant energy savings, while also supporting pollution prevention, renewable energy, and distributed generation efforts. This paper will describe the benefits of methane-fueled microturbine co-generation, provide lessons learned from the experience of a 2.0 MGD facility, and show the cost-effectiveness of this innovative technology. © 2005 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry.",,"Co-generation; Essex junction projects; Rewenable energy technology; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Pollution; Power generation; Renewable energy resources; Turbines; Wastewater treatment; Methane",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31844448420

Computer modeling is being applied to increasingly small physical scales and increasingly large domains, facilitating the generation of advanced phenomenological models and models based on first principles. These developments have been especially valuable in fields where highly complex micro-scale events are observed or modeled, such as combustion studies, allowing (for instance) the incorporation of complex chemical combustion kinetics into engine spray combustion models. The crude models and global curve fits that were previously used to represent combustion phenomena have now been largely replaced by models based on ""first principles"". These modeling developments have coincided fortuitously with a shift in the focus of combustion concepts, from mixing-oriented combustion modes like Diesel and stratified charge Otto combustion to the kinetically controlled combustion modes usually referred to as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). The driving forces behind the development of the HCCI concept are environmental considerations, manifested in the form of emission legislation. Theoretically, HCCI combustion (characterized by fuel lean mixtures and low peak temperatures) has the potential to reduce soot and NOx emissions to current emission legislation levels even without after-treatment systems. In practical production engine applications, due to current drawbacks such as poor high load capability, the capacity to switch to conventional mode at high load operation is required. For the above reasons, computer modeling that is capable of describing both old and new combustion modes is required. In the work underlying this thesis, CFD modeling was applied to the passenger car Dl Diesel engine operated in both HCCI and conventional Diesel combustion modes. The aim was to couple chemical combustion kinetics and turbulent mixing in order to capture relevant phenomena related to ignition and emission formation for both modes. The resulting, coupled model is referred to as the Partially Stirred Reactor model (PaSR), and is the main component in the Detailed Chemistry Approach currently utilized in combustion modeling at Chalmers University of Technology (CTH). Other essential components of the Detailed Chemistry Approach are the Reference Species Technique (used to determine the relevant chemical timescales) and the Diesel fuel surrogate model (constructed to facilitate realistic treatment of the fuel in both liquid and gaseous states). The gaseous kinetic treatment of the Diesel fuel surrogate model, represented by a blend of aliphatic and aromatic components, consists of a chemical kinetic mechanism considering -75 chemical species participating in -330 elementary or global reactions describing n-heptane and toluene oxidation. Although most of the modeling was done in the CFD code KIVA-3V rel2, the development and validation of the chemical kinetic combustion mechanism was done using the SENKIN code and the CHEMKIN package. The chemical kinetic modeling has provided a kinetic mechanism for Diesel combustion that is capable of reproducing experimental ignition delay characteristics of both n-heptane and toluene oxidation in both low and high pressure regimes. In addition, it reproduces the negative temperature coefficient behavior that is an important feature of commercial Diesel fuels. It has also been able to reproduce cool flame phenomena, which play important roles in HCCI combustion. Results from the constant volume spray modeling have shown that the spray development, liquid and gas penetration and ignition characteristics observed in high pressure Diesel spray experiments are properly reproduced. Furthermore, major combustion variables such as ignition timing, heat release and pressure traces generated in engine simulations have satisfactorily reproduced experimental data acquired in tests using a single cylinder engine at Chalmers University of Technology.",,"Computational fluid dynamics; Computer hardware; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Thermal stratification; Toluene; Computer modeling; Engine spray combustion models; Combustion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144455758

Several coupled physical and chemical processes may occur during the injection depending on time and location within the reservoir. Far field regions are facing long term reaction in a situation where flow of gas and water at a reduced rate may induce near fluid-rock equilibrium. In contrast, near well-bore regions are subjected mainly to gas at a high flow rate where dissolution/reprecipitation phenomena may increase/decrease drastically the injectivity. The purpose of this study is to investigate experimentally the various situations in representative reservoir conditions with the objective of achieving knowledge and data for future physical and numerical modeling and reservoir numerical simulations of CO 2 re-injection. Experiments consist in the co-injection of CO 2 and brine in carbonate cores (limestone). The temperature and pressure conditions are such that the CO2 is in supercritical state. Results show that the flow rate and the composition of the fluids initially present in the core play a major role in the fluid-rock interaction leading to various non-uniform dissolution facies and in some cases to re-precipitation and permeability reduction. These phenomena have been observed and quantified using various non destructive techniques (NMR, CT-scanner) and chemical analyses of the producing fluids, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the coupled mechanisms taking place.

In this article, we explore the cost-efficiency issues associated with such a generous allocation of allowances to the trading sectors in combination with the ban on banking. It is argued that allocation to the trading sectors is higher than implied by a cost-minimization approach. Moreover, due to the reduced level of flexibility, a ban on banking increases overall compliance costs. In addition, the results of a simulation game conducted with real company participants and with a student control group suggest that a generous primary allocation in the first phase combined with a ban on banking also leads to a cost-inefficient choice of abatement measures within periods. The results of the simulations are also consistent with the conjecture that forward markets and auctioning off a part of the total quantity of allowances result in more reliable price signals and more cost-efficient outcomes. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Auctions; Banking; Climate policy; Efficiency; Emissions trading; Experiment; Forward markets","emissions trading; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22244434951

Most of the countries (developed and developing countries) are working toward zero pollution not only in industrial sectors but also in vehicle emissions to reduce the gaseous emissions to the allowable limits, as well as other sectors such as construction sector and agricultural sector. To approach zero pollution, the industry has to prevent all pollutants from its effluent. One of the major problems facing developing countries is the cost of environmental protection and its return. The current practice of agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, industrial waste, municipal waste water, etc., can be considered disastrous all over rural communities and developing countries. Thus, any solution should suit the rural communities and developing countries, and should include the economical benefits, technological availability, and environmental and social perspectives, to become sustainable. The environmental and health impacts of landfill and incineration are becoming more dangerous and disaster for developing countries and rural communities. Establishing industrial ecology within the industrial activity will avoid landfill, incineration, and treatment; can help in full utilization of raw material; and consider the waste as a by-product. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The considered strategies include using cleaner fuel, implementing inspection and maintenance programs and adopting emission standards for new vehicles. Design/methodology/approach - The strategies were evaluated in terms of the expected reductions of particulate matter (PM) and ozone precursors due to the future implementation. Emissions were estimated utilizing a mix of the relevant national and international. Accordingly, a three-phase integrated strategy is recommended, considering the local technical and institutional aspects. Findings - In case of no actions taken, emissions of PM and ozone precursors could increase at the year 2013 by 95 and 50 percent, respectively. Implementing the proposed integrated strategy could result in reducing the emissions of PM and ozone precursors by about 53 and 49 percent, respectively. Practical implications - The proposed strategy is applicable because the targets are set considering the local aspects. However, the estimated emission reductions could almost compensate for the increase in the fleet size over the time. Therefore, achieving real reductions of emissions requires additional strategies to be considered. Originality/value - Owing to the lack of local emission factors and measurements, this original work highlights the expected impacts of the potential strategies for controlling vehicle emissions in Cairo. Also, the findings indicate the need to consider other additional strategies in the long term planning process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Egypt; Road transport; Road vehicles; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24144499421

H3A 2B2, Canada","Biomass is clean, stored solar energy. Not only is it a plentiful fuel, but its use also reestablishes the natural carbon cycle helping mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This renewable energy source is nearly CO2 neutral. Overall, it is possible to achieve a 93% reduction in net CO2 emissions per unit heating value by switching from coal to biomass and a 84% reduction by switching from natural gas-fired cogeneration to biomass. Due to inherent advantages of the biomass in substituting fossil fuels, and increasing legislative pressures against CO2 emissions (Kyoto Protocol), biomass-based power is genuinely considered. It seems practically impossible to meet Kyoto requirements by replacing fossil fuels combustion with nuclear energy, hydropower or fuel cells. Simply, there is not enough time. In this context, there exists a niche for the biomass-based power generation. This paper compares interactions between metals and solid particles evolving from biomass during the classical Fluidized Bed Combustion (FBC) and a new Low-High-Low temperature (LHL) combustion. Experiments, conducted at a pilot-scale, reveal a clear pattern of surface predominance of light metals (Ca, K) and core predominance of heavy metals (Cd, Cr) within the LHL-generated particles. No such behavior was induced by the classical FBC approach. Metals migration is linked to the evolution of inorganic particles. A composite picture of the metals rearrangements in the particles was obtained by the combination of independent analytical techniques including electron probe microanalysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy, inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry and X-ray diffractometry. It is suggested that the combination of (i) the high-temperature region in the LHL and (ii) changes in the surface free energy of the particles is the driving force for the metal-particle behavior. Important practical implications of the observed phenomena are proposed including removal of hazardous submicron paniculate and reduction in fouling/slagging during biomass combustion. These findings may contribute to re-designing currently operating FBC units in order to generate non-hazardous, non-leachable, re-usable particles where heavy metals are immobilized while environmental and technological problems reduced.

The implied equations of state yield 9.1% average error in vapor pressure and 4.7% error in liquid density for compounds ranging from propane to triacontane. Further simulations extend to nC80, but there are no experimental data to which comparisons can be made. With reliable TPT terms from molecular simulation, it is possible to analyze the trends with respect to molecular weight. Each TPT contribution is shown to approach an asymptote in the long chain limit. The asymptotes and the approaches to them are quantitatively characterized. A0 and A1 approach their asymptotes at relatively short chain lengths (nC30). A2, on the other hand, approaches its asymptote slowly (nC80). Simulation-based TPT terms also permit unambiguous interpretation of the number of coarse-grained segments relative to the number of carbons in the chain. Previous attempts have relied on characterizations that included the repulsive and attractive contributions simultaneously in a manner susceptible to a cancellation of errors. In this work, the reference fluid alone provides the characterization and the result is shown to be consistent with expectations for the A1 term. The conclusion is that the number of carbons per segment approaches roughly 10 in the long chain limit, much larger than previously reported.

Rendezvous and Docking manoeuvres are always a delicate and uncertain part of an interplanetary mission, especially when taking place millions of miles away from the Earth. The mission planning must be analyzed in detail, since high financial costs are involved. Examples of possible scenarios demanding Rendezvous and Docking sequences are for instance, sample return missions from other planets or natural satellites, manned missions around Earth or other celestial bodies, in-orbit construction of space stations or macro-satellites, and in orbit maintenance operations of spacecraft. Despite this clear tendency, a lack of software tools able to support the required analysis was highlighted. LAREDO has been designed and implemented by GMV S.A., Spain, under GSTP contract with ESA/ESTEC with the aim of covering these new necessities from mission analysts. The goal of LAREDO tool is to reproduce the Rendezvous and Docking sequences applicable to different exploration mission-scenarios. Among those, it is possible to select: Earth, Moon, Mars, Venus, Deimos, Triton and Europa mission scenarios. LAREDO has been developed using the powerful Matlab/Simulink based environment. The use of more than one spacecraft to perform a mission makes the Rendezvous and Docking manoeuvres important. These manoeuvres are traditionally performed in circular orbits, but nowadays the interest in Rendezvous and Docking in elliptical orbits is growing up. LAREDO is able to provide a very accurate analysis in both circular and elliptical orbits, estimating the delta-V, the fuel consumption and other important features. To achieve the Rendezvous and Docking between the two spacecrafts, the mission analyst is able to plan and execute a sequence of manoeuvres. The specialist can chose among an extensive set of manoeuvres. The manoeuvres for Rendezvous and Docking in circular orbits are based in the Clohessy Wilshire equations, including an impulsive Hohmann transfer, Hohmann re-phasing, two point transfer, hopping on V-bar, single applied delta-V, continuous tangential transfer and hopping on V-bar. There are also implemented manoeuvres based on a linear quadratic Gaussian control algorithm, such as station keeping and forced motion. The Clohessy Wilshire equations are not longer valid when Rendezvous in elliptical orbits is desired. The formulation in this case uses the transition matrix to cope with the non-linearity of the problem. LAREDO performs Rendezvous and Docking in elliptical orbits, being able of performing hopping on V-bar, rephasing in time, height transfer, two points transfer, forced motion and station keeping elliptical manoeuvres. The small relative satellite distances makes the Rendezvous and Docking a very risky part of the mission, as any failure could cause satellite damages. In order to avoid any spacecraft collision, the tool includes a Collision Avoidance Manoeuvre that is automatically activated if the satellites trespass certain safety limits. The safety limits can by defined by two safety areas. The first safety area is a sphere, applied only when the satellites are far away, whereas the second one is an approach corridor, which is used when the satellites are very close together and Docking phase is going to take place. LAREDO tool not only simulates orbital motion, but also the spacecraft rotation. The analyst has the possibility to choose weather attitude propagation is desired to be performed or not. Attitude manoeuvres are very important for the Docking phase, as docking ports must be oriented in the right direction. The relative satellites disposition is also very important to ensure that relative sensors can operate, as if one of the satellites is not disposed in the right direction no measurements can be provided. Several attitude guidances are available on the simulator, such as sun pointing, relative pointing, inertial pointing, yaw steering, nadir pointing and ground station pointing. The control of the attitude is performed using a proportional-derivative controller. LAREDO simulator propagates the orbital motion computing the aerodynamic drag force, the non-sphericity of central body, the third body perturbation and solar radiation force. These perturbing forces drift the manoeuvres from its ideal trajectory, requiring a set of corrective manoeuvres in order to compensate the perturbations effects. The aerodynamic drag is simulated using atmospheric models, which are dependant on the selected central body: Venus: Pioneer Venus Thermospheric model. Earth: US Standard Atmosphere 1976, GRAM99 and MSIS-86 atmospheric models are combined, covering the different atmosphere layers. Mars: GRAM 1990 and 2001 atmospheric models are available. It is also provided the possibility to externally consider the Mars Climate Database. Triton: Exponential approach has been considered for the very thin atmosphere of Triton. The non-sphericty of the central bodies is also modelized, considering the following gravity models: Venus: NASA technical memo (2 zonals and 2 tesserals) Earth: GEMT3 (50 zonals and 50 tesserals) Mars: Goddard Mars model- 2B (50 zonals and 50 tesserals) Moon: Ferrary 1977 (4 zonals and 4 tesserals) The gravitational effects from third bodies is computed using the solar system planets JPL ephemeredes. The software also takes into account the gravity fields of a few major natural satellites such as Moon, Nereid, Deimos, Phobos, lo, Ganymede and Callisto. Canon-ball model is considered to compute the solar radiation pressure perturbation, of course taken into account the eclipse times caused by the central body. Furthermore, within the scope of optimizing the launching phase of the second spacecraft involved in the Rendezvous and Docking phase, the tool is able to simulate the ascent trajectory of a vehicle from the Earth, Moon and Mars surfaces. The software is able not only to fully simulate the dynamics of the rocket (non-sphericity perturbations, as well as the rocket stages and the fuel mass losses), but also to optimize the trajectory to reach the desired final orbit. The rocket trajectory is optimized to deliver the spacecraft in the required orbit, as well as with the required relative argument of latitude with respect to the other satellite that is awaiting. A coast arc can be inserted between the two stages, being its duration time an optimization variable. LAREDO includes the full guidance, navigation and control simulation modules. The sensors provides the required measurements to feed up all the GNC modules. The sensors measurements are filtered using a Kalman filter, providing the estimation of the orbital and attitude state. The state vector is internally propagated by the filter when no measurements are available. The simulation of the sensors considers fully configurable parameters like white noises, bias, mounting errors, range limits and others. The user is able to choose between a different set of position and attitude sensors for each Rendezvous and Docking manoeuvres, such as accelerometers, radiofrequency, infrared sensor, camera, star tracker, gyroscope and lidar. The tool posses a Communication module, simulating the communication with ground stations. This module computes which ground stations are visible for communication. LAREDO tool is able to compute the visibility of any set of a ground stations contained within its database or any user defined ground station. The computation of the visibility takes into account the beamwidth, minimum elevation, and signal delays. To simulate in a very realistic way the behaviour of the attitude and orbital manoeuvres the tool also incorporates the thrusters simulation, considering their response delay, mounting errors, thrust quantization, thrust saturation and thrust white noise error. The algorithm complexity of LAREDO tool is managed with a user-friendly graphical interface based in Matlab. The man machine graphical interface is used to define inputs, run simulations and to exploit results. The inputs are stored in a database structured in ASCII files, which may be read by any text editor, whereas the output files are binary files. Both the inputs and the outputs files can be directly displayed using the LAREDO graphical user interface. LAREDO software has been thoughtfully tested. Test plan includes launch ascent optimization, phasing and closing Rendezvous and Docking scenarios in several central bodies such as Mars, Moon, Venus and Earth. This paper presents the simulation results obtained for a Mars Sample Return mission scenario, including the launch ascent trajectory optimization, and the complete Rendezvous and Docking phase in circular and elliptical orbits.",,"Algorithms; Collision avoidance; Computer simulation; Control equipment; Graphical user interfaces; Infrared devices; Orbits; Sensors; Space flight; Space research; Docking simulator tools; Exploration missions; Gaussian control algorithms; LAREDO tool; Satellite simulators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26944496774

The conventional view flows from Garrett Hardin's classic ""Tragedy of the Commons"" analysis, in which commons preservation, though collectively desirable, is economically irrational when undertaken by individuals, hence the tragedy. Motivated by the unexpected actions of many individual nations and states to address climate change (a classic global commons problem) even in the absence of an unambiguous global framework, the authors show that the market imperfections that characterize some global commons problems, including those of climate change, can diverge from those underpinning the standard ""Tragedy of the Commons."" The authors argue that this divergence makes room for significant rational unilateral action towards commons preservation, and that this has been underappreciated by many scholars who instinctively disparage unilateral action. In place of the conventional wisdom, the authors suggest that short of the ideal ""full glass"" of optimal collective action, there exists a ""glass half full"" of suboptimal unilateral action by larger subglobal governments that is better than no regulation (and hence no benefits) at all, and, indeed, the evidence shows that some larger subglobal governments, the United States in particular, should actually be doing more to address climate change. Furthermore, action by both large and small subglobal governments may function as a mechanism by which individual governments can help trigger the implementation of the preferred solution of an international framework for collective action.

The U.S. has moved from end of pipe/stack controls, to the concepts of pollution prevention and integration of approaches in interdisciplinary fashion, thereby avoiding the transfer the mercury problem from one medium to another, and to the recognition of mercury as a global problem. Mercury has been of concern to EPA since its inception in December 1970. In fact, concern over mercury was even a factor in the formation of the Agency. At that time, there was much public attention to mercury contamination of the U.S. waters. It was recognized that many industries discharged mercury to surface waters. Likewise, the first worker health standard developed by the new Occupational Health and Safety Administration pertained to inhalation of mercury vapor. We recognize that many countries, in particular Sweden and other Nordic countries, have had a lengthy acquaintance as well with mercury and are continuing to identify new and important areas in which to focus our attention. The sad mercury experience in Minimata, Japan in the 1960's contributed to an appreciation of how disastrously mercury entering a water body as methylmercury, or subsequently being methylated by bacteria, can transport up the food chain to man and cause a range of adverse effects linked to dose and time of exposure. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Second Annual Report of 1971 included mercury in a short list of environmental toxins attributed to being a causal agent in the deaths of the American eagle and stated: some problems are emerging with portentous implications. The accumulation of mercury in our waters is a serious problem that may become even worse as organisms continue to concentrate mercury through the food chain. The increases in complex toxic materials-both heavy metals and organic chemicals-may be serious long-term threats to human health and the life cycle upon which all men depend. While EPA recognized that many industries discharged mercury to surface waters, with some facilities discharging tons each year, and that some sources emitted mercury to air, there was little understanding or appreciation of the dimensions of mercury's behavior in the environment. There was little recognition of its international aspects or of its expected health risks from eating fish, since an adequate health assessment was not available for use in estimating risks of in utero exposures. Since then, the focus has grown not only to incorporate awareness of the domestic sources and deposition sinks, but also the international scope of this truly globally cycling, persistent bioaccumulative toxic substance, whereby all countries are seen to be both sources and repositories through deposition. Research monitoring and modelling have shown the linkage of coal burning and other emissions sources to atmospheric transport and deposition in water bodies with resultant uptake and bioconcentration in fish and exposure to humans and other living organisms. The U.S. EPA's 1997 Mercury Study Report to Congress, wherein this linkage was first reported in the U.S., was a big impetus for the most recent high priority given to mercury at EPA. It is timely that this workshop will further better information sharing and awareness of developments as well as needs of scientists in the monitoring and modelling sphere and that of the health community. EPA has been committed to enhancing government, industry and public awareness of mercury and its behavior in the environment, and effects to man. Mercury has been intriguing to man and utilized by him for hundreds, if not thousands, of years: the first Emperor of China died drinking mercury while thinking it was a source of youth and longevity, and of medicinal value; and beginning over 500 years ago, the Almaden mine in Spain supplied mercury to the new world to help extract the gold and silver contributing to Spain's wealth and stature over a significant span of time. The Almaden mercury was sent as the ballast in ships and the mined metals were the ballast on the return trip. Due to this practice of Almaden mining, it is in the mid 16th century that modern scientists begin to see a widespread distribution of anthropogenic mercury. The U.S.'s California goldrush in the mid nineteenth century also helped distribute mercury all over the globe due to the open burning of mercury used to amalgamate the gold (Schuster et al, 2002). Eighteenth and nineteenth century hat makers in Europe were known as mad hatters due to what later became recognized as the neurological effects of direct inhalation exposure to mercury in the processing. Fortunately, the new UNEP global mercury program, established in February 2003, provides an international mechanism which can further shape cooperation between counties. It is clear that cooperation between scientific disciplines and between the public and private sectors on a global scale is essential to better understand the linkage of emission sources and receptors, especially most vulnerable populations. This leads to more informed decisionmaking, buttressed by legislation, which can ultimately lead to reduced uses, emissions and deposition around the world. All countries contribute to the problem and can aid the solution by reducing use and emissions of mercury within their countries. EPA is committed to a strong mercury program at home and to an ongoing international engagement in concert with the UNEP global program and other bilateral and regional mechanisms. EPA is increasingly concerned about international as well as domestic sources of mercury. International uses and emissions of mercury account for a significant portion of mercury circulating in the atmosphere. An estimated one-third of all global mercury releases comes from fossil-fuel burning in Asia. Therefore, in order not only to take actions on mercury emissions at home but also provide leadership abroad, EPA's vision is to reduce uses and releases of mercury as much as possible, and make progress in collaborative monitoring, modelling and health activities, as well as in information sharing across these disciplines. EPA and the U.S. not only have lessons-learned to contribute, but much to benefit from others' experiences as well.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64949102521

Industrial ecology explores the assumption that the industrial system can be seen as a certain kind of ecosystem. The scope of industrial ecology goes well beyond waste exchange to the optimization of resources flowing through the economic system. Among the various specific aspects of developing countries, which have to be born in mind, is the fact that the pattern of resource flows in developing countries, and hence, the resultant environmental threat could be very different than what it is in the industrialized west. Typically, the flow of materials through the large, organized manufacturing facilities in the developing countries could be very small in relation to the overall material flow as the small, informal ""industry"" plays a key role and forms a very significant portion of the economic activity. The case studies of the Tirupur textile industries, and the leather industry in India, illustrate how redefining the problem from a perspective of resource conservation, and on the basis of resource flow data could point to totally new directions for strategy planning. The case study of the Damodar Valley region amplifies the importance of looking beyond formal industry to solve an environmental problem. It shows that even for globally critical programs, such as climate change program in developing countries, it is just not enough to estimate the emissions from the formal industrial sectors. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In the Marchean region, these phenomena have been observed only in the peri-Adriatic sector where Pliocene and Pleistocene formations crop out; they are well represented with respect to typology, number and extension. The present paper proposes several strategies for their preservation and protection: In particular these aim to avoid the characteristic morphologies, produced by leaking mud (also several times per year in some cases), being suddenly demolished by anthropic or natural agents. Mud leakage generally occurs on a flat surface called ""piano della salsa"" prevalently on a thalweg or along a very gentle portion of the slope. Typical, in mud volcano morphology, is the presence of one or more cones of different height and extension with emission of mud with different fluidity; sometimes natural boundaries exist and the leakage remains confined inside a depression, but in other cases the mud emissions can reach the hydrographic network. The Marches Region Administration, as those of other Italian Regions, have no rules yet (except for some indications in the PPARRegional Plan for Landscape and the Environment) for preventing and protecting these geo-sites. The procedure for safeguarding them should start from an analysis of the territory and a study of its resources, in particular defining characteristics, potential risks, and the objectives to be reached; in addition, it should formulate proposals for their use and enhancement, also indicating possible thematic routes (geological and geomorphologic pathways) in particularly significant areas.","Defence and preservation; Marches Region; Mud volcanoes; Periadriatic area; Pliocene sediments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028036369

Several Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) systems were proposed to reduce such emissions. But the reliability and the durability of the current DPF systems remain an issue, due to the lack of the filter regeneration control during the ""stop & go"" duty cycles. To fit particular this duty cycle requirements, a new active Diesel particulate filter system was developed with a new regeneration strategy in order to achieve the durability and reliability issues. The DPF system consists of: particulate filter units; an oxidation catalyst placed in front of the filters; valves and actuators allowing thermal insulation of the filter units; temperature and pressure sensors; and an electronic control unit to control the positions of the insulation valves. The strategy principle is based on an adjustable volume of filtration in combination with a global thermal management allowing the filters to regenerate in all driving conditions. Furthermore, in order to fully control the filters regeneration, an additional heat injection strategy, based on Diesel fuel injection over the oxidation catalyst, heats up the filters individually, according to the position of the insulation valves. The DPF System was evaluated by the ADEME (French Agency for Environment and Energy Management) on refuse trucks (EURO2) applications over more than a 12 months program, using a standard European Diesel fuel (350ppm of Sulfur). The DPF System demonstrated high efficiency and durability, with more than 89% of particulate reduction (in mass per kilometer) over the duty driving cycle reference. In parallel, in order to extend the field of applications, further improvements have been developed, such as association with a fuel-borne catalyst (FBC) to control the filters regeneration and limit the maintenance. The experiments have demonstrated the positive effects of FBC in the trap loading as well as the filter regeneration. In addition, the combination of the basic process and the FBC leads to a limitation in FBC dosing rate. Details of experiments and results will be presented in the paper, as well as the VERT evaluations for European certification.

A modal HDDV modeling approach designed to predict second-by-second emissions from onroad vehicle operations was proposed. The proposed model was expected to significantly improve the accuracy of emissions evaluation for HDDV. Emissions from HDDV were more likely to be a function of brake-horsepower load on the engine (especially for NOx) than light-duty gasoline vehicles. Diesel engine worked at high compression ratios of 14:1 to ≤ 25:1 (significant excess air) and did not suffer from the same air/fuel ratio issues as gasoline engines.

In hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) an internal combustion engine is combined with one or more electric machines, with the aim of extending the range of the electric and making the entire vehicle more energy-efficient. The architecture of a hybrid drive train is complex, comprising at least two different energy conversion devices (i.e. internal combustion engine and electric machine) drawing energy from at least two different energy storage devices (i.e. fuel tank and battery). Moreover, complex control strategies must be defined in order to properly control the division of load between the thermal engine and the electric machines. To meet increasing global competition, which means reducing lead-time and costs for hybrid vehicles design, it is necessary to develop methods that wouldquickly evaluate various design concepts. Even if many computational models are available to simulate the performances of HEVs, there's still a lack of generalized mathematical analyses. An analytical model has been developed in order to study power flows in hybrid vehicle drive trains. The mathematical formulation allows a quick analysis of the complete energy cascade from fuel energy to tractive power, comprising electricity generation and consumption and energy recovery from braking. As a result a general formulation of the total tractive energy and of the global efficiency of hybrid electric vehicles in function of the main characteristics of its components is provided. The goal of the analytical model is to enable a quick exploration of design possibilities of hybrid powertrains. Some results are presented in order to show how the present model allows a quick insight into the effects of the main system characteristics on the power flows and the corresponding component losses of the drive train.",,"Analytical models; Automobile engines; Automobile fuel tanks; Combustion; Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric machine control; Electric machinery; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Powertrains; Computational model; Electricity generation; Energy conversion devices; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Mathematical analysis; Mathematical formulation; Powertrain configuration; System characteristics; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925856886

The deformations of a steel-frame planked with an aluminum panel under a cathodic dipping varnishing (kathodische Tauchlackierung, KTL)-load were studied. During the simulated KTL test with a sample of edge length 800 mm by 500 mm the maximum buckle height was 5-10 mm. At the end of the treatment, the deformations decreased to 4 mm using component 1 and to 1.4 mm for the remaining components. These deformations were due to the different coefficients of expansion of the steel and aluminum. During heating, the blind rivets restricted the free deformation of the aluminum. Different temperature distributions during the heating and cooling also caused relative movements between the steel and aluminum assembly components. The Kyoto protocol that went into effect on February 16, 2005 relates to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 21% by 2012 versus 1990 in Germany. This is allied to reducing the fuel consumption of new automobiles by 25% by 2005 versus 1990. This may be attained by alternative motor drives and by lightweight automobile construction. To take advantage of lightweight construction, mixed materials are also considered. In the body of the BMW 6 Coupé, for example, plastics were used in addition to steel and aluminum. To join different materials adhesive bonding can join different materials easily. Adhesive joints also provide more uniform stress distribution versus localized spot welding and riveting. The newer adhesives must be examined for service life and dimensioning. Conventional mechanical joining is often used with adhesive bonding to provide a higher joint stiffness and provide information on the durability of the adhesive. Discussion topics include intelligent lightweight constructions as requiring an increasing mixing of materials; optical measurement of deformation fields; temperature measurement by thermography; and summary and perspectives.",,"Aluminum panel; Cathodic dipping varnishing; Hot curing; Aluminum; Bonding; Computer simulation; Curing; Deformation; Varnish; Adhesives",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29344449925

States achieve increased resiliency via direct security measures such as increased surveillance, but more importantly by altering the structure of energy and economic systems. Such alterations include reducing risk by increasing redundancy in each system and by increased fuel and sectoral diversity in addition to increased relative supply of fuels, potentially by increasing energy efficiency. Also, an increase in the use of domestically produced fuels such as renewable energy, reduces security risks. Because energy security is an important policy consideration in overall energy policy planning, states may reasonably consider the energy security implications of how their economy has changed over time, in addition to the energy security implications of their energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon efficiency enhancing programs. Thus, the objective of this paper is to analyze at the state level, changes between 1980 and 2000, in fuel and sectoral diversity, energy efficiency and use of renewable fuels, focusing on industrial and electric utilities sectors The results in this paper reveal substantial state level differences and demonstrate that energy security has overall increased in only two states, based on a simultaneous favorable movement in the three parameters analyzed. Only one state exhibits a non-favorable movement in all parameters and thus reduced energy security. © 2005 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry.",,"Energy security; Environmental quality; Fuel mix diversity; Carbon; Economics; Electric utilities; Renewable energy resources; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31944439633

Thus, the rapid relaxation and the ballistic transport of excited electrons within the conduction band of a wide gap insulator occurs over femtoseconds. The field-dependent transport and trapping parameters allow us to model the selfconsistent charge transport and charging-up of SiO2 thin layers as well as bulk Al2O3 samples during electron bombardment. The resulting distributions of currents, charges and electric fields within these samples explain, e.g. the phenomena of field-enhanced and field-blocked secondary electron emission. In order to prove the accessible quantity of the surface charging-up potential we have chosen the X-ray bremsstrahlung (BS) spectra, i.e. the shift of the short wavelength threshold due to the negative surface potential V0 and respective retarding of the incident electron beam.

Senate Bill 700 made agricultural sources of air pollution subject to air quality permitting and specified emission mitigation requirements. It required the ARB to develop a definition for large confined animal facilities (CAFs) that would trigger the requirement for an emission mitigation plan. In addition, SB 700 also required the ARB to approve livestock emission factors for use in the emission mitigation plans. The local air pollution districts, which are responsible for permitting sources of air pollution, are required to permit CAFs and adopt a rule requiring an emissions mitigation plan. Cattle and poultry operations are the main types of CAFs in California. Existing estimates show that dairies are a significant source of volatile organic compounds in the San Joaquin Valley. Dairies are also the largest source of ammonia emissions in California. In developing a definition for large confined animal facilities, ARB staff worked with the livestock industry, environmental and community representatives, local air districts, the public, other state and federal agencies, and academic researchers. Dozens of meetings, several workshops, and a research symposium were held to help the public to fully understand all relevant issues and viewpoints. Scientific and statistical information about California's livestock industries were also collected to evaluate the magnitude of the industry, its possible air quality impacts, and the potential impacts of regulating large CAFs. The definition adopted by the ARB provides a foundation to begin significantly reducing livestock air emissions in California.","California; Dairies; Emissions; Large confined animal facilities; Poultry; Volatile organic gases","Emission mitigation plan; Large confined animal facilities; Air pollution; Air quality; Dairies; Laws and legislation; Particulate emissions; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Air Quality; Legislation; Particulate Emissions; Poultry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847399586

The planned launch date is set at the spring of 2006. The scientific goals for FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC are to (a) improve global and regional weather forecasting by collecting data for atmospheric and Ionospheric application; (b) improve global space weather monitoring and forecasting, especially in data sparse regions including the oceans and near the poles; (c) provide data sets for climate change and global warming detecting research, this system will provide valuable information for predicting magnetic storms and other important space weather effects; and (d) advance earth gravity field knowledge and engineering sciences. The satellites constellation will promise global atmospheric monitoring at some 2,500 points spread uniformly around the globe, with high accuracy. The mission operation of this program is divided into three major phases: (1) Launch and early orbit (L&EO) checkout, (2) Orbit transfer and constellation deployment, and (3) Real-time operational demonstration. Each phase offers an opportunity to address specific challenges in metrology and climate, space weather, and geodesic science.

The program is jointly undertaken by the National Space Organization (NSPO) in Taiwan and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in the U.S., in collaboration with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and with the participation of many government, academic and private organizations. The planned launch date is set at the spring of 2006. The scientific goals for FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC are to (a) improve global and regional weather forecasting by collecting data for atmospheric and Ionospheric application; (b) improve global space weather monitoring and forecasting, especially in data sparse regions including the oceans and near the poles; (c) provide data sets for climate change and global warming detecting research, this system will provide valuable information for predicting magnetic storms and other important space weather effects; and (d) advance earth gravity field knowledge and engineering sciences. The satellites constellation will promise global atmospheric monitoring at some 2,500 points spread uniformly around the globe, with high accuracy. The mission operation of this program is divided into three major phases: (1) Launch and early orbit (L&EO) checkout, (2) Orbit transfer and constellation deployment, and (3) Real-time operational demonstration. Each phase offers an opportunity to address specific challenges in metrology and climate, space weather, and geodesic science. With the demonstration of real-time operations, FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC data will complement other earth observing systems and improve global weather analyses, particularly over the oceans and polar regions, and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts. The success of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission will inaugurate an age of operational GPS sounding for weather forecasting, climate prediction, ionospheric monitoring, and a suite of related earth science pursuits.

Initial planning called for up to 25 vertical wells to develop the thin Carboniferous reservoir. To reduce development costs, feasibility studies were performed on the option of drilling 6-8 horizontal wells, which included 2-3 CO2 injection wells. This option was later adopted in the Development Plan. The horizontal wells were planned with 1000m horizontal legs, but in the execution phase this target was increased to 1500m to increase well deliverability and injectivity. Due to the variable sand quality, sophisticated LWD tools were used to geosteer the horizontal section through zones of the best porosity, maximizing the productivity of the wells. Real-time reservoir modelling and visualization software was used at the rig site and in the Subsurface team in Sunbury (London), to aid decision making while drilling the horizontal section and to effectively communicate changes in the plan. The existence of high tectonic stresses in the area necessitated a wellbore stability study that was performed before the start of drilling, however, severe instability problems were encountered in the first well, requiring a major re-design of the programme. Despite this, the well successfully reached a horizontal length of 1300m. These design changes were agreed at a peer review meeting, which brought together expertise from within Sonatrach and BP to analyse and review the development team's experiences and plans. Subsequent wells using the new design demonstrated a remarkable improvement in drilling performance. This achievement was due in no small part to the efforts of the Drilling and Petroleum Engineering, and Subsurface teams to maintain a close working relationship, despite being geographically widely separated between Sunbury, Hassi Messaoud, and Teguentour.",,"Decision making; Empowerment of personnel; Exhibitions; Oil well drilling; Petroleum engineering; Well drilling; Drilling performance; Feasibility studies; Instability problems; Reservoir modelling; Visualization software; Well deliverability; Wellbore stability studies; Working relationships; Horizontal wells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898487808

We measured excretory release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonia (NH4), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from consumers fed senesced leaves of Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) trees grown under elevated (720 ppm) and ambient (360 ppm) CO 2. Contrary to predictions based on ecological stoichiometry, elevated CO2 leaves caused greater NH4 and SRP release from both animals but did not affect the release of DOC. Elevated CO2 leaves reduced DOC:NH4 and DOC:SRP ratios released from Asellus but did not affect these ratios from Gammarus. Both animals showed lower NH 4:SRP release ratios after eating elevated CO2 leaves. A mass balance model of consumer N and P release demonstrated that increased excretion rates likely resulted from reduced absorption efficiencies (and unchanged or higher digestive efficiencies) in these aquatic detritivores. Our results indicate that changes in leaf biochemistry resulting from elevated atmospheric CO2 will strongly affect the ability of stream consumers to retain important biogenic elements. Increased release rates of NH4 and SRP are another indication, along with reduced growth and reproduction, that litter produced under elevated CO2 has strong effects on key physiological processes in detritivores with potentially strong consequences for nutrient cycling in streams of forested regions. © 2005 E.

This paper describes these development efforts, which included non-reacting Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and component and engine tests. The emissions target is less than 24 ppm nitrogen oxides (NOx), 60 ppm carbon monoxide (CO) and 60 ppm unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs) at dry 15% O2 correction for kerosene, while operating above 50% load. A lean premixed, pre-vaporized, axially staged combustion concept is used to minimize emissions levels to the strictest emissions regulations in urban areas such as Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, Yokohama, and Osaka. This combustion system involves two pilot burners and two main mixture injection tubes that are extending into the combustion chamber to inject lean to ultra-lean premixed mixtures into the hot burned gas from pilot burners. Counter rotational swirl vanes are provided to pilot burners and main mixture injection tubes to prevent flashback into the premixing tubes. The RGT3R gas turbine engine operates smoothly with the developed DLE combustion system from idle to full load without combustion-driven pressure oscillations. A two-stage fuel control system employs liquid fuel supply for the pilot and main atomizers. As this paper describes, the emissions data from this engine meet the emissions goals.

The rules imposed purchase restrictions on certain fleet owners that prevented them from purchasing a diesel powered vehicle if a clean-fueled alternative vehicle was commercially available. In Engine Manufacturers Ass'n v. South Coast Air Quality Management District, the Supreme Court held that such purchase restrictions were expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act. In contrast with the Court's traditional insistence that congressional intent is the critical inquiry in preemption cases, the majority based its decision solely on what it considered to be the ""plain-meaning"" of the text of the statute and abandoned the long-standing presumption against preemption. This Note scrutinizes the reasoning of the Court's opinion and finds its holding unsupported by either the text or the history of the Clean Air Act. It argues not just that the Court erred in finding the terms of the statute unambiguous, but that the ""plain meaning"" approach to statutory interpretation, which presupposes a degree of verbal precision and stability our language has not attained, has no proper place in preemption analyses. Finally, as the decision has important implications for the future of federal preemption and the continued viability of local control, especially in the context of environmental law, this Note attempts to predict the circumstances under which the Court will fail to apply the presumption against preemption in the future.

In the past 20 years, the climate and land-use in China have changed significantly and have had important ecological consequences, especially in ecologically sensitive regions, e.g. the cropping-grazing transition zone (CGTZ). Here we present a study that used a process-based ecosystem model and data of land-use changes based on remote sensing and of climate change at high spatial and temporal resolution to estimate the impacts of land-use and climate changes on net primary productivity (NPP), vegetation carbon storage, soil heterotrophic respiration (HR), carbon storage and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the CGTZ of China. The results show that the warming and decreases in precipitation in CGTZ reduced NPP by 3.4%, increased HR by 4.3%, and reduced annual mean total NEP by 33.7Tg from the 1980s to the 1990s. Although carbon storage in vegetation and soil was increasing because the mean NPP for the period was higher than HR, the decreasing NEP indicate that climate change reduced the carbon uptake rate. However, land-use changes in this zone caused increases in NPP by 3.8%, vegetation carbon storage by 2.4%, and annual total NEP by 0.59Tg. The land-use changes enhanced ecosystem carbon uptake, but not enough to offset the negative effect of the climate change. The climate change had greater impacts than the land-use change for the whole CGTZ zone, but had smaller impacts than the land-use change in the regions where it occurred.

In nationwide conventions (such as Rio, 92; Kyoto Protocol, 1997), a common conclusion has been the need to reduce greenhouse emissions, especially those due to CO2 from burning fossil fuels. For example, Kyoto protocol has established that industrialized nations should reduce their emissions over 2008-2012 by at least 5.2% compared with the 1990 levels. An alternative USA proposal is based on reducing greenhouse emissions by capturing and stockpiling CO2 in natural sites like oceans, caverns, depleted oil reservoir, etc. This paper presents a physical description and an economic analysis of a project to capture and inject CO2 in oil production and its storage in the depleted oil reservoir located in a mature field in Brazil. The Stella® Software has been used in order to analyze de dynamics of the whole process of CO2 sequestration in enhanced oil recovery, considering each step of the process with its respective energy requirements. The main findings of this have the following benefits: i) reduction in the emission of CO2; ii) extension of the operational life of the reservoir; and iii) improvement and development of technology to promote EOR in mature fields. Results indicate that project NPV is around USS 3.2 million, what is significant for a small mature field. Additionally, it contributes by removing greenhouse gases (GHG) from the atmosphere by storing 0.73 million tons of CO2 over a period of 20 years. Project feasibility, as expected, was found to be very sensitive to oil price, oil production, and CAPEX.

However, many specific questions remain to be answered before we can understand the ocean-atmosphere-land interactions within the climate system and reduce uncertainties in changes relevant to human societies. Indeed, the regional responses to global climate change are still poorly known owing to geographical gaps in data coverage and to the scarcity of high-resolution records over large areas such as central Asia or the southern tropics. How does the continental hydrologic cycle responds to global climate change and how does the latter affect the Earth's climate system? How are decadal to century-scale climate events, such as drastic droughts in the tropics or the ""Little Ice Age"" in medium latitudes, related to global change? What is the response time of a given water body to mean annual or seasonal climate changes? Lake deposits represent a powerful proxy source for continental palaeoclimatology because (i) lakes are present at all latitudes; (ii) the reservoirs are small compared to the oceans, so that geochemical perturbations are large; (iii) their response time to external perturbations is relatively short; (iv) a great range of ""proxy"" signatures is decipherable from lake sediments using stable isotope analysis combined with microfossil, sedimentological, and geochemical studies; (v) sedimentation rates are high and thus high-resolution signals are possible. Even seasonal hydrologic changes can be analysed in the case of annually laminated sediments.

Although recent observations show that nucleation is widespread in the eastern United States, the corresponding pathways remain uncertain. Combining extensive field measurements in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with an aerosol dynamics and chemistry model assuming ternary NH3-H 2SO4-H2O nuclei formation, we show excellent model-measurement agreement and predictive capability. The ternary NH 3-H2SO4-H2O nucleation model is successful in predicting the presence or lack of nucleation on 19 out of 19 days with complete data sets in July 2001 and on 25 out of 29 days in January 2002. Reductions of ammonia emissions are predicted to decrease the frequency of nucleation events during both summer and winter, with a more dramatic effect during the summer. The response to changes in emissions of sulfur dioxide during the summer is counterintuitive. Reductions of sulfur dioxide and the resulting sulfate by up to 40% actually increase the frequency of the summer nucleation events. Modeling predicts the opposite effect in winter, with reductions of sulfur dioxide leading to fewer nucleation events.

Travel has become faster, communication has become easier. However, there are externalities that we need to face due to urban development; the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and its recent enforcement has led signatory countries to limit and propose ways on how to achieve the reduction in emissions by 2012. One aspect of proposed reduction is to make urban development sustainable. Urban development is related to infrastructure systems that generations build for the improvement of the quality of life. Construction of residential and non-residential buildings in cities is part of the infrastructure systems that we need to assess to be able to achieve the 6% reduction limit of carbon emissions. This paper studies the changes of carbon emissions induced by residential construction. To be able to assess the future requirements of society in terms of infrastructure facilities and its sustainability, a study on the historical changes of carbon emissions and the relationship of material requirements to emissions are necessary. The Input-Output Approach coupled with Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) is used to analyze the impacts of Japanese residential construction on the environment. The changes in construction technology, emission structure and material manufacturing technology are studied in this paper.

The Conchos River Basin is one of the most important river systems in northern Mexico, and the most important tributary of the Lower Río Bravo/Rio Grande. The Conchos contributes approximately 2/3 of the total inflows to the Lower Rio Bravo/Rio Grande. As such, the flows are subject to the 1944 International Treaty between the United States and Mexico. Irrigation is the largest consumptive use in the basin, followed by industrial and municipal use. In addition there are flows required to satisfy the treaty. The region had a significant population growth in the last two decades, which combined with a severe drought in the 1990s, significantly impacted management of the water resources in the basin. The flows are regulated by a system of multiple reservoirs, one of them as large as Elephant Butte. In this work, an optimal water resources policy management is developed for a complex multi-reservoir system in a semi-arid region like the Conchos. The policy is adjusted for current climate conditions. To analyze its resiliency, this policy is simulated under predicted climate change scenarios. Using the MAGICC software package, variations in mean precipitation and temperature are estimated for several GCMs models, with different greenhouse emission scenarios, and for the following time horizons: 2025, 2050 and 2100. For each time horizon, the probability of variation in precipitation and temperature are estimated. The study evaluates the resilience of the current optimal policy to predicted climate changes.

The present paper is focused on three key aspects related to the capabilities of remote sensing data to help in monitoring forests as carbon sinks. The first one attends to find statistical relationships between satellite and field measurements from the National Forest Inventory. The second is focused on elaborating forest cartography in order to produce a forest mask for filtering the areas of interest. The third one tries to evaluate the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere in case of forest fire. These three tasks were carried out using several MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) images of the Spanish territory among other data (sample plots, cartography and images from different sensors). 1.

Using appropriate typical dimensions for each configuration, the magnitude of the electric field over the cathode area under the probe was obtained, and especially near critical (i.e., sharp) regions that could lead to residual gas ionization, dielectric breakdown and emission of electrons from unintended areas. The results indicate that the V dCA approximation is far from being universally applicable to all the field emission measuring configurations. In particular, the cylindrical probe anode with flat tip gives the most uniform ES, which nearly equals V dCA over most of the cathode area under the probe. Spherical and hemispherical probes, on the other hand, result in ES close to V dCA only locally near the center, and much lower anywhere around the center. Moreover, the parallel-plate configurations lead to significantly detrimental field enhancement effects near the edges that discourage their use.

The storms, extreme heavy rain falls and floods of the last time require water management more than ever for extreme conditions and long-term climatic changes. Hence new strategies are needed to secure requirements of society and environment. On an international level comparable results and intergovernmental water management is required which means to learn from each other experience. To ensure sustainable water management strategies a holistic approach is emphasized. The bases of a modern water management system are computer based Decision Support Systems (DSS) including computer simulation tools with active graphical user interface. By using of modern mathematical solutions (e.g. Fuzzy-systems, GIS, Neuronal Networks) the prognosis of water level and flood prevention and control is possible. A DSS requires a coupled analysis of all kinds of data to describe the long-term scenario of global and local changes. To get measurable results benchmarks are defined to evaluate performance of the developed simulation tool.

The duration of the pulses is so small that the phonon sub-system practically does not take part in the processes occurring during the direct action of laser pulse. It means that the process of direct damage starts with a certain delay after the laser pulse. We have come to conclusion that it is reasonable to separate out three main stages of the process of macroscopic damage: 1) the direct laser-solid interaction during pulse action including multiphoton absorption, excitation of the electron subsystem near the material surface and fast leaving of the irradiated area by electrons (e.g., through photoelectron emission); 2) fast after-action including breaking of electrical neutrality in thin near-surface layer and acceleration of ions; 3) slow or delayed after-action including moving of fast ions into bulk accompanied by heating up of the material through collisions resulting in macroscopic thermal damage. In this presentation we focus on the first two stages, i.e., excitation of the electron sub-system, electron emission and development of electrostatic instability often referred to as Coulomb explosion. Estimations performed on the basis of the Keldysh formula show possibility to reach extremely high density of electrons in conduction band (up to 50% of total number of valence electrons) at laser intensity slightly above 10 TW per sq. cm. The electrons can leave the irradiated area before the laser pulse ends. We utilize Keldysh formula to estimate the total number of electrons lost through emission and show the number to be high enough for significant breaking of electrical neutrality and formation of relatively large positive charge localized in the irradiated area. Assuming the multiphoton ionization to give the dominant contribution to absorption, we estimate the characteristic thickness of the ionized layer and show the positive charge to be localized in the layer which is approximately 1 micrometer thick. Then we estimate velocities and energies of ions accelerated by the laser-induced charge and show possibility of appearing ions with MeV energies. The penetration depth characteristic of those ions is an order of 10 micrometers what implies possibility of heating and thermal damage of the material with formation of deep craters.","Damage mechanisms; Ionization; Laser-induced ablation; Laser-induced damage; Transparent solids","Electromagnetic wave propagation; Electron emission; Ionization; Irradiation; Laser ablation; Laser pulses; Optical materials; Damage mechanisms; Electrical neutrality; Laser-induced ablation; Transparent solids; Laser damage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18744410678

By sequential injection, soak, and production tests, along with accurate bottom-hole pressure and produced-gas composition monitoring, an understanding of the enhanced coalbed methane-CO2 storage process is increased. The detailed data resulted in conclusions that were opposite to general beliefs before the project started. It was generally thought that CO2 injection would be hindered by coal swelling caused by CO2 sorption. It is found that the opposite to be the case as CO2 injectivity is greater through the use of alternating injection shut-in sequences and perhaps as a result of coal weakening. Data is found to be very useful to investigators who are developing reservoir simulation software to model primary and enhanced recovery from coal seams. These data can serve as history-matching files to test the accuracy of the modeling methods. The calibration of the numerical simulators using these field data allows predictions to be made on commercial opportunities for CO2 storage production for Mannville coals. The combination of these three observations suggests that low-permeability coal seams that may not be commercial under primary production could still be CO2-storage sites with the added benefit of improving the possibility for commercial gas production. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. The results show that the addition of hydrogen can significantly enlarge the flammable region and extend the flammability limit to lower equivalence ratios. If the equivalence ratio is kept constant, the addition of hydrogen increases the emission of NO in a flame due to the enhancement in the rate of the NNH or N2O intermediate NO formation routes. The addition of hydrogen causes a monotonic decrease in the formation of NO2 and N2O, except flames near the extinction limits, where the emission of NO2 and N2O first increases, and then decreases with the increase in the fraction of hydrogen. Overall, hydrogen enrichment technology allows stable combustion under ultra lean conditions, resulting in significant CO2 and NO emission reduction. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

Since the 1950s, attenuation has been the major trend of discharge variation of most karst springs at Shanxi. Based on the case study of 7 karst springs including Niangziguan, Xin'an, Guozhuang, Shentou, Jinci, Lancun, and Hongshan springs, the discharge variation process of karst springs was divided into natural fluctuation phase and anthropogenic impact phase. Discharge attenuation of the 7 karst springs was controlled mainly by climate and human activities, with their contributions being respectively about 60% and 40%. According to the difference of the effect of climate and human activities for each spring, attenuation modes of spring discharge fall into three types: natural process dominated attenuation type, exploitation induced process dominated attenuation type, and mixed attenuation type.

According to the International Energy Agency's predictions, world's electricity demand will be doubled between now and 2030. During this period, nearly 1400 GW of new coal-fired power capacity will be required worldwide. Presently, most of the world's coal-fired power generation capacity is based on pulverized coal (PC) combustion, which is considered as a very reliable technology. With the emission standards becoming more stringent, coal-fired power plants are expected to significantly reduce their emission intensity by utilizing advanced clean coal technologies (CCTs). Oxy-fuel combustion is one of the promising CCTs, which provides a means for electricity generation with minimal environmental footprints. The oxy-fuel combustion carries significant potential for adaptation in the existing fleet of PC combustion infrastructure through retrofit, as well as through the new state-of-The-Art green-field plants with near-zero emissions. In this paper, the recent techno-economic studies are reviewed and a comparative analysis is made on the oxy-fuel combustion with and without CO2 capture. It is observed that oxy-fuel combustion offers a competitive economic performance when compared to other advanced power generation cycles with CO2 capture, such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and PC combustion with amine scrubbing. © (2005) by the International Pittsburgh Coal Conference.",,"Clean coal technologies; Coal-fired power generation; Environmental footprints; Global electricity demands; Integrated gasification combined cycle; International energy agency; Power generation cycles; Techno-economic assessment; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Electric power generation; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883107427

However, little effort has been focused on the beneficial use of precipitated metals in these systems. The metals are usually retained in passive systems as oxides, carbonates, or sulfides - probably forming a mineral suite similar to the deposit mined. Recovery of mineral resources retained in the passive systems will probably not be as profitable as the mine itself, primarily because of the typically slow kinetics of the process. However, a market for the minerals does exist; e.g., iron oxide recovered from passive systems associated with coal mines is being recovered and processed for paint pigment and similar uses. A similar effort may be possible for the recovery of sulfides or carbonates from sulfate reducing bioreactors, an alternative passive technology. This passive treatment situation is an obvious opportunity for sustainable development at mines, whether currently operating or approaching closure. In many instances, some amount of ARD will result no matter what prevention measures are implemented. In many cases, treatment of ARD will be required in perpetuity, along with its long-term O & M responsibilities. Developing a sustainable cottage industry of metal recovery from these systems may effectively transfer these responsibilities to a local company. Opportunities for a metal recovery business may actually transform the treatment system liability cost into an asset. Benefits include enhancement of a given mining property's profitability and increased community acceptance of the operation because it will result in sustainable employment. The mine plan may even be altered to enhance the profitability of the metal recovery effort by selective placement of wastes containing desirable metals (e.g., leaching of copper waste dumps). The question is, what does the mining industry need to do to integrate this concept into its sustainable development initiatives?","Beneficial uses; Metals; Recycling; Sulfate reducing bioreactors","Bioreactors; Carbonates; Coal mines; Hydrated lime; Iron mines; Iron oxides; Lime; Metals; Mineral resources; Minerals; Planning; Profitability; Recycling; Sulfur compounds; Sustainable development; Acid mine drainage; Beneficial use; Cottage industries; Passive technologies; Passive treatment; Prevention measures; Sulfate reducing; Treatment systems; Metal recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866018619

The ability to locally make propellants, life support consumables, and fuel cell reagents will significantly reduce mission cost by reducing launch mass, and reduce risk through reduced dependence on Earth-supplied materials. The presence of water/hydrogen on the Moon will significantly impact the design of space exploration hardware and systems, but the form and concentration of these resources are unknown. The goal of the first robotic lunar lander mission in 2009/2010 will likely be to determine what is in the permanently shadowed craters of the lunar poles. To meet this goal, the NASA/JSC-led RESOLVE project will develop and integrate an experiment package that can perform the following objectives: (1) obtain ""ground truth"" data for resources at lunar pole; (2) obtain bulk and fine-grained regolith characteristic and environment data; (3) extract and collect volatiles from regolith; (4) produce oxygen from regolith; and (5) perform a hydrogen/water resource processing demonstration after it has been evolved and collected. ORBITEC, an industry partner in the RESOLVE project, is developing a small chemical reactor that will produce oxygen from the lunar regolith using the carbothermal reduction process. The carbothermal reduction process uses a carbonaceous source (such as methane gas) at high temperatures (∼1625 °C) to reduce ilmenite and silicates present in the lunar regolith. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751695165

According to Population Action International the West African country of Benin has not suffered from either water stress or water scarcity in the past nor will it belong to water-short countries by 2025 [PAI (Population Action International), 2000. Available from: <http://64.224.182.238/ resources/publications/peopleinthebalance/downloads/ people_balance.pdf> (accessed 23.08.04)]. The national average daily water consumption is given as 20 1 [World Water Council, 2003. Available from: <http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/Vision/Documents/ WestAfrica2.PDF> (accessed 23.08.04)]. This interdisciplinary micro-study of patterns of water consumption in the north of the country shows, however, that in some cases at the level of the household, per capita consumption is much less than the minimum standard quantity of 20 1 published by the WHO. The average per capita consumption in the households investigated is 18.7 1. If one deducts consumption by visitors (5%), the value comes to 17.2 1 per person. The lowest consumption occurred during the dry season, at only 5.2 1. This discrepancy with national consumption is caused largely by the great influence of the following indicators: seasonality, size of household, access to resources and differences between urban and rural areas. The latter relates not only to differences in the quantities of water consumed and their purposes, but a marked role is also played by the differing consumption of poor and rich households in the urban units of investigation. The correlations identified here between local influences and water consumption show that the scientific investigation of water management and the search for approaches to finding solutions, will in future require more interdisciplinary approaches combining hydrological, climatological, economic and anthropological findings. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Several chemical and biological agents have been identified that could constitute a credible threat against a water distribution system. In order to protect drinking water supplies, The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated a program in 2003 to investigate real time sensors that may be used to trigger a contamination event and support early warning systems (EWS) within a water distribution system. These sensors monitor for standard drinking water parameters such as pH, free chlorine, oxygen reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, total organic carbon, chloride, ammonia, and nitrate. The research was conducted on a recirculating pipe loop at the EPA's Test and Evaluation Facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. The experimental results indicate that the parameters of free and total chlorine, total organic carbon (TOC), Oxygen Reduction Potential (ORP), specific conductance and chloride were consistently able to indicate a change in water quality due to injections of various contaminants into the pipe loop. Research is also being conducted to determine the minimum contaminant dose required to trigger a sensor alarm. Contaminants tested to date include secondary effluent from a waste water treatment plant, potassium ferricyanide, arsenic trioxide, nicotine, aldicarb, E. coli K-12 strain with growth media, insecticide containing malathion, and a herbicide containing glyphosate.

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the performance and NOx emissions of selected biofuels in a turbocharged and intercooled diesel engine using a steady state nonroad ISO 8-Mode test schedule. Test fuels included traditional No. 2 diesel and four biofuels comprising 100% soy methyl ester biodiesel, 2% biodiesel, 10% ethanol-diesel fuel, and 5% ethanol in biodiesel. Exhaust NOx emissions were monitored with a Horiba NOx analyzer. Biodiesel fuel showed a 12% increase in NOx emissions while 2% biodiesel fuel increased emissions 2.3%. The ethanol-diesel fuel blend reduced emissions by 2.7% and was highly sensitive to load with increased temperature and NOx emissions at light load. Addition of only 5% ethanol to biodiesel suppressed emissions, with only a 2.6% increase in NOx production. It was concluded that ethanol could act as an effective NOx emissions reducing additive.","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Blend, performance; Diesel engine; Ethanol; Nox emissions","Bio-diesel fuel; Blend, performance; Diesel engine performance; Diesel fuel blends; Highly sensitive; Increased temperature; Intercooled; Light loads; Mode test; Nox emissions; Non-road; Petroleum diesel; Soy methyl esters; Steady state; Agricultural products; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Esters; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Machine design; Particulate emissions; Synthetic fuels; Biodiesel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349154643

The SO2 emission contributions of coal burning in power plants, industrial and heating sectors were 49%, 26% and 24% respectively. The vehicle exhaust contributed 74% of the NOx concentration. As to PM10, the industrial sector was the largest emission (28%) and concentration (21%) contributor despite of the fugitive sources.

This paper also analyzed the control strategies of energy consumption and vehicle sources, based on which the control scenario in 2008 was established and the change of emission and concentration contribution were estimated. The results show that the cleaner energy use, industrial structure improvement, transportation mode modification and single vehicle emission control will greatly improve air quality.

Given the global impacts of climate change and world-wide pattern of increasing losses from natural hazards we necessarily adopt an international perspective. The specific goals of the special issue are to: (a) encompass experiential aspects, emphasizing current practice of mitigation and its associated measures, and their results; and (b) explore primary or root causes of alarming shifts in human and economic costs of environmental extremes. Special emphasis is placed on how human activities are playing a key role in enhancing vulnerability to NTEE (nature-triggered environmental extremes), quite independently from the anthropogenic causes of climate change. The goals are also (c) to examine costs, risks, and benefits (of all kinds including social, political, ecological) of mitigation, and adjustment and adaptation measures; and (d) analyze policy implications of alternative measures. These components are expected to make significant contributions to policy considerations-formulation, implementation and evaluation. There is much uncertainty about the rate of climate change; however, the fact of increase of the atmospheric temperature in the last century is no longer a subject of scientific or policy debate. Due to such changes in the geophysical parameters, certain types of nature-triggered environmental extreme events are likely to continue to increase. How global warming will affect regional climates and pertinent variables is not well known, limiting our ability to predict consequential effects. This factor poses serious constraints against any straightforward policy decisions. Research findings of the work of this volume reaffirm that human dimensions, specifically our awareness and decision-making behavior, are powerful explanatory factors of increasing disaster losses. Disaster mitigation through addressing human, social, and physical vulnerability is one of the best means for contributing to 'climate change adaptation plans', and sustainable development goals. Recent lessons from various countries have depicted that the formulation of mitigation strategies cannot be exclusively top-down as it requires social, political, and cultural acceptance and sense of ownership. An interactive, participatory process, involving local communities, produces best expected outcomes concerning mitigation, preparedness, and recovery. An emerging consensus is that there is a need to move towards the 'mission' of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction which aims at building disaster resilient communities by promoting increased awareness of the importance of disaster reduction as an integral component of sustainable development, with the goal of reducing human, social, economic and environmental losses due to natural hazards and related technological and environmental disasters. Sharing of best practices and lessons globally is certain to produce more efficiency and understanding in policy and decision making. © 2005 Springer.","adaptation; climate change; environmental extremes; loss; mitigation; policy; resilience; vulnerability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650178901

Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin (UTEX 642) grown in 5% CO2 were transferred to air-level CO2 in the light or dark and allowed to acclimate to air. No accumulation of the transcript of the P. tricornutum β-carbonic anhydrase 1 (ptca1) was detected in 5% CO2-grown cells, but ptca1 mRNA accumulated and reached a peak after 6 h acclimation to air but decreased over the next 18 h. A similar accumulation time course was observed in cells air-acclimated in the dark, except that levels of mRNA were &lt;50% those in the light. These results suggest that air-level [CO2] is required to trigger the transcription of ptca1 and that light affects the extent of acclimation. During acclimation to air for 120 h in the light, levels of ptca1 mRNA exhibited a periodic oscillation with a cycle of about 24 h, which, however, was not reflected in protein accumulation levels. A 5′-upstream region from the transcription-start site toward -1,292 bp of ptca1 was cloned by inverse polymerase chain reaction, and 5′-truncations were carried out on this fragment. The truncated promoter regions were fused with the β-glucuronidase gene (uidA) and introduced into P. tricornutum. The promoter fragments, truncated at positions -1,292, -824, -484, -225, and -70 bp, conferred on transformants clear CO2-responsive β-glucuronidase expressions. In contrast, the CO2-responsive regulation was severely impaired or completely abolished by truncations, respectively, at position -50 or -30 bp. These results indicate that critical cis-elements required for CO2-responsive transcription of ptca1 may be located between -70 and -30 bp relative to the transcription start site. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Carbon dioxide; Marine biology; RNA; Carbonic anhydrase; Glucuronidase genes; Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin; Enzymes; Carbon Dioxide; Enzymes; Nucleic Acids; Bacillariophyta; Nitzschia alba; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; algal DNA; algal RNA; beta glucuronidase; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; messenger RNA; article; diatom; drug effect; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; kinetics; light; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; radiation exposure; reporter gene; Base Sequence; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Diatoms; DNA, Algal; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Genes, Reporter; Glucuronidase; Kinetics; Light; Molecular Sequence Data; RNA, Algal; RNA, Messenger",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644637675

In addition to wood products, trees could provide new products, such as bioenergy, environmental services, such as the sequestration of carbon, reductions in recharge to groundwater and biodiversity protection. Before marketing these services, it is necessary to determine the optimal distribution of trees across the landscape, in terms of land suitability, their productivity, and proximity to existing processing and transport infrastructure. Similarly, understanding how recharge varies across landscapes will allow the targeting of trees to areas where they are most needed for salinity control. Catchment scale (1:100000) soil and landform datasets are now available across much of the agricultural area of Australia. While these data are at a scale inappropriate for management at the enterprise (farm) scale, they will allow broad planning for new plant-based industries, such as whether there is sufficient suitable land available before embarking on a new enterprise and the likely productivity of that land. In this paper, we outline an approach that combines existing soil and landform data with estimates of climate to produce estimates of likely wood yield, carbon sequestration and potential for recharge to groundwater. Using the 283686 ha Collie catchment of southwestern Australia as an example, this analysis indicated broad areas where land is suitable for forestry, where forestry is unlikely to succeed, or where it was not required because leakage to groundwater is negligible. It also provides broad estimates of wood production and carbon sequestration. The approach is applicable to the integration of deep-rooted perennial plants into farming systems in other regions confronted with multiple natural resource management issues. © CSIRO 2005.","Forestry; Industry development; Land evaluation; Pedotransfer functions; Salinity","agroforestry; carbon sequestration; catchment; farming system; recharge; salinity; tree; Australasia; Australia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144444000

The sealing theory of an O-ring is that when an O-ring is installed in a groove of a given size, it can produce sealability against a fluid by means of a compression stress that is produced by crushing at a predetermined compressive rate. For this reason, an O-ring is subjected to constant stain when in service. In addition, there is a need to select the materials to be used for O-rings in match with the fluid to be sealed against. For selection of materials, one of the critical properties is oil resistance. There is a method of determining a degree of swelling in rubber (the rate of change in volume) as one of the indicators that represent oil resistance. O-rings made of fluorine rubber materials are often selected for use in fuels for motor vehicles because of excellent fuel-oil resistance and less swelling as compared with other types of rubber materials. On the other hand, with the increasing globalization of automobile industries, the international standardization of functional parts is called for. Fuels for motor vehicles, used as sealing fluids, are different in the methods of refinery and the types and quantities of additives from one geographical region to another. Moreover, as a countermeasure for environmental problems in recent years, there has been a growing trend toward a shift from conventional gasoline fuels to alcohol-contained fuels. The use of alcohol-contained fuels provides advantages in that alcohol can be produced from grains or woods, and that the effective use can be made of alcohol as an alternative fuel in light of the availability of limited petroleum resources. Alcohol also offers various advantages in terms of the emission of exhaust gas, including the significant reduction of CO 2 emissions, the reduction of sulfur oxides SOx, and the mitigation of soot and black smoke. However, it is shown that an alcohol-contained fuel causes fluorine rubber to be subjected to swelling as compared with gasoline. If a fuel in service is shifted from conventional gasoline to an alcohol-contained fuel, the amount of swelling in an O-ring increases, whereby internal strain increases, and the amount of crushing also increases seemingly. If internal strain increases to a higher level beyond a material strength limit, an O-ring may be subjected to compression cracks (damage) [Figure 1]. In contrast, if an O-ring is developed with product design that assumes a given compression rate after swelling, possible damage may be prevented, but the amount of crushing may decrease during an initial stage or at the time of drying, thus resulting in a loss of sealability. As a countermeasure, there is a need to develop an O-ring made of fluorine rubber materials, showing a small amount of swelling in an alcohol-contained fuel. On the other hand, standardization is called for the low-temperature properties of O-rings so that O-rings can be used in all and every geographical regions. However, it was difficult to improve both the low-temperature properties and alcohol resistance of conventional fluorine rubber. In general, alcohol-fuel resistance of fluorine rubber can be improved by increasing the fluorine contents in a polymer. However, there is a conflict between an increase in fluorine contents and a deterioration in the low-temperature properties of rubber materials. Fluorine rubber materials having excellent resistance to alcohol-contained fuels cannot be put into service where low temperatures are required. To establish such a conflicting relationship, there is a need to develop a fluorine rubber material having excellent resistance to alcoholic-contained fuels and excellent low-temperature properties. In this study, a low-temperature sealing test and a compression cracks test were performed on O-rings to verify the effectiveness of newly-developed fluorine rubber materials that have both resistance to alcohol-contained fuels and low-temperature properties.

It has been found that targets containing below 15% tin atoms by number emit more brightly in the spectral region around 13.5 nm than pure tin targets. Furthermore, if the remaining material in the target is composed on primarily low-Z atoms, then both plasma continuum radiation and Bremsstrahlung radiation are greatly reduced. In addition, if the target is illuminated with a prepulse, the conversion efficiency shows a distinct increase. The third parameter under examination is the laser power density, which controls the ion distribution in the plasma. The influence of low-Z atoms on the tin ion distribution in the plasma has been investigated and found to be of little consequence. Measurements were made in the region from 9-17 nm on an absolutely calibrated 0.25-m flat field grazing incidence spectrograph, and on two 2-m grazing incidence spectrographs.

This paper presents the results of mobile school bus testing that has been performed to quantify the emission reduction capabilities of various alternative fuels, such as B20/#2 diesel, ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD), and B20/ULSD, when applied to school buses that are representative of those currently in use in the state of NJ. Three school buses equipped with an International T444E, an International DT466E, and a Cummins 5.9L ISB engine were instrumented and tested at the Aberdeen Test Center at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. Exhaust gas emission measurements were made using a Semtech-D mobile emissions analyzer to measure CO, CO2, NO2, NO, O2, and unburned hydrocarbons, along with a Sensors PM-300 to measure PM. In addition to the exhaust emissions measurements, operating parameters such as instantaneous vehicle speed, engine speed, percent load and fuel flow rate were acquired from the engine electronic control module (ECM) during testing. To ensure repeatability of testing under conditions that accurately reproduce actual school bus operating conditions, a new composite mobile school bus cycle was developed. The cycle was developed by acquiring Global Positioning System (GPS) data from actual school bus routes from 5 different municipalities within the state of New Jersey. For all three buses, HC emissions were significantly reduced for each of the three alternative fuels tested. Emission reductions of NOx, PM and CO varied for each bus tested. For example, both the ULSD and the B20/#2 diesel blend reduced CO and PM emissions by over 30% for the T444E and Cummins engines. The ULSD/B20 blend reduced CO and PM emissions by 20% to 50% for the T444E and DT466E engines. Generally, the B20 blends resulted in slight increases in NOx emissions, with the exception of the DT466E engine with B20/ULSD blend, which resulted in decreased NOx emissions.

The inclusion of this chapter is evidence of the progress made in fields as diverse as analytical methods and instrumentation, chemical kinetics and atmospheric chemistry modelling, as well as of the ever increasing interest in mercury (Hg) within both the scientific and environmental policy communities. The reason for the current interest in Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) processes and their influence on Hg was the discovery of higher than expected concentrations of Reactive Gaseous Mercury (RGM or RGHg or Hg11(g)) at coastal sites (Mason et al., 2001, Wangberg et al., 2001) and in the MBL of both seas (Sprovieri et al., 2003) and oceans (Mason et al., 2001, Laurier et al., 2003). The Hg11(g) concentration was also found to vary diurnally with a maximum occurring with maximum solar radiation intensity and a minimum at night. Hg11(g) is not a single compound, it is an operationally defined quantity which refers to the oxidised inorganic mercury compounds present in the gas phase which are collected on KCl denuders, see chapter 7. The most probable components of Hg11(g) are HgCl2and HgBr2, possibly with HgO and Hg(OH)2. Hg11(g) is fundamental to Hg cycling because its chemical and physical characteristics differ so greatly from those of Hg(g). Where Hg(g) is volatile and sparingly soluble, the compounds which make up Hg11(g)) are far less volatile and far more soluble, thus Hg deposition is almost totally dominated by Hg11(g) whilst Hg emission, even industrial emission, is predominantly Hg(g). Modelling studies had suggested that the sea salt aerosol could be important in Hg cycling in the MBL because of its ability to form a range of Hg11 complexes due to its high chloride ion content (Pirrone et al., 2000). Further modelling studies suggested that Hg11 produced in the gas phase (Hg from the reaction of Hg + O3) could be scavenged and then cycled via the sea salt aerosol to HgCl2, which is more volatile than HgO, thus providing an MBL source of Hg11(g), (Hedgecock and Pirrone, 2001). The development of our understanding of Hg chemical and physical processes in the MBL, is intertwined with the study of Hg in the Arctic, and has gained very much from the study, both in the field and modelling, of tropospheric O3 in remote areas, specifically the Arctic and the remote MBL. Taking things in chronological order, it was in the late 80s that ozone depletion events were first reported during polar spring, (Bottenheim et al, 1986), these events were linked to photochemical processes, (Barrie et al., 1988). In the years that followed there were a number of field and theoretical investigations into the mechanism behind the rapid O3 destruction, which pointed to the involvement of bromine containing radicals, (Fan and Jacob, 1992, Barrie and Platt, 1997, Foster et al, 2001). Measurements of Hg (g) over a number of years at Alert in Canada showed that when O 3 depletion events occurred, the concentration of Hg(g) also decreased rapidly, often to below the detection limit of the measurement techniques employed (Schroeder et al, 1998). This observation led to the suggestion that it was likely to be the Br radical compounds which were responsible for the Hg depletion events. At around the same time model studies were performed to see what effect, if any, the halogen radical chemistry seen in the Arctic may have in the MBL, (Vogt et al, 1996, Sander and Crutzen, 1996). Model predictions suggested that halogen compounds (Br2 and BrCl) would be released to the atmosphere as a result of the acidification of the sea salt aerosol, and that the radicals produced by their photolysis would destroy O3. Since then the phenomenon known as 'Sunrise Ozone Destruction' has been observed in the sub-tropical Pacific (Nagao et al., 1999), and a number of studies have observed depletion of Br containing species in supermicrometer sea-salt aerosol, and enrichment of the same species in submicron marine aerosol, (Sander et al., 2003). The link between O3 destruction at polar dawn with Hg(g) depletion and the measurement of elevated RGM concentrations in marine air masses hinted that Hg oxidation processes were also at work in the MBL. The recent measurement of the reaction rates of Hg (g) + OH(g) (Sommar et al., 2001) and subsequently of Hg(g) + Br(g) (Ariya et al, 2002), have been included in a box model, AMCOTS (Atmospheric Mercury Chemistry Over The Sea, Hedgecock and Pirrone, 2004)) of multiphase MBL photochemistry along with previously known Hg gas and aqueous phase chemistry (Pleijel and Munthe, 1995, Lin and Pekhonen, 1999). The AMCOTS results can be compared directly to results from measurement campaigns, (Hedgecock et al., 2003, Hedgecock and Pirrone, 2004). The high measured concentrations of RGM coupled with the modelling support have meant that the cycle of Hg in the MBL, its emission, transport, chemistry and deposition have had to be reconsidered, and the role of the ocean-atmosphere in the global Hg cycle and the global Hg budget reassessed (Mason and Sheu, 2002). The MBL chemistry of Hg therefore cannot be removed from the transport and physical processes which ultimately have an influence on the concentrations of Hg species in the MBL. Where Hg in the MBL comes from, and which chemical species are emitted or transported with it, can directly or indirectly affect Hg chemistry. The scavenging of Hg compounds by deliquesced aerosol particles or rain droplets, and the dry deposition of oxidised Hg compounds not only exert a major influence over the concentrations of Hg species in the MBL but also on the marine emission/deposition budget. The chemistry of Hg is however not only the central theme of this chapter, but also the central process which links emissions to deposition, governs the lifetime of Hg(g) in the MBL, and therefore the influence that marine emissions may have on the global Hg budget.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42249087334

Despite the widespread attention of researchers, however, there are no reliable methods of predicting the failure of the repaired and strengthened beams by peeling of the fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) material from the parent concrete. To better understand peeling failure, several investigators have presented analytical work to predict the distribution of stresses along the interface between the FRP and the concrete. Several closed-form solutions can be found in the literature to predict the levels of shear stress present between the bonded composite plate and the parent concrete beam. However, there has been very little experimental verification of these analytical predictions because few experiments on large-scale beams have had sufficient instrumentation to facilitate the comparison. Some experiments have been presented1 in which electrical resistance strain gages were placed along the length of the carbon plate in order to deduce the interfacial shear stress using first differences. This method, though very crude, demonstrated that there are substantial differences between the distributions of interfacial shear stresses in actual repaired beams versus the analytical predictions. This paper presents a new test program in which large-scale carbon-fiber-strengthened reinforced concrete beams are load-tested to failure, while employing digital image correlation (DIG) to record the strains in the carbon fiber plate. Relying on the linear elasticity of carbon fiber, the interfacial shear can be determined and compared with the analytical predictions of the literature. The focus of this paper is the presentation of the experimental shear stress distributions and comparisons of these distributions with previous results available in the literature. © 2005 SPIE and IS&amp;T.","Digital image correlation; Fiber reinforced polymers; Reinforced concrete; Stress analysis","Carbon carbon composites; Concrete beams and girders; Elasticity; Image analysis; Optical correlation; Shear stress; Stress analysis; Digital image correlation; Fiber reinforced polymers (FRP); Interfacial shear; Steel reinforcement; Reinforced concrete",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21944454323

This bank forms the topmost and youngest interval of a larger, extensively karsted, buried carbonate platform. A three-dimensional (3-D) seismic survey of Liuhua field yielded a very high-resolution data set (>200 Hz), allowing a spatial resolution less than 5 m. This data set was subsequently used to produce a reservoir model that closely linked petrophysical, log, and seismic data. The carbonate stratigraphy suggests several subaerial exposure events that significantly modify primary stratification of the carbonate bank through diagenesis. These include freshwater leaching, burial compaction, cementation, and late diagenetic flushing of the bank. The combined diagenetic changes had three principal effects: (1) exacerbation of primary facies-dependent differences in porosity through a series of dissolution-reprecipitation steps; (2) widespread incipient carbonate collapse at or below the scale of seismic resolution; and (3) formation of numerous regionally occurring karst sinkholes of as much as 400 m diameter shortly before final drowning of the platform. Incipient collapse of the friable carbonate framework is expressed seismically by a reduction in amplitude. Carbonate dissolution appears to be ongoing because sagging continues to affect all strata overlying the reservoir to the seafloor.

As natural gas prices have more than tripled over the last five years, landfill gas can be purchased on a cost effective basis under the correct location and development conditions. This paper will discuss the criteria that determine the optimum conditions for direct landfill gas use at industrial plants from an environmental, operations, and business perspective.

The task ahead is unprecedented and it would be foolish to think that the big solution is just around the corner. No one technology, approach or initiative can possibly be sufficient. Our challenge now lies in determining where to go from here. Many meetings and discussions are underway to describe what a post-Kyoto climate regime might look like. Canada is hosting the next United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Montreal in November 2005, and Prime Minister Martin has asked the National Roundtable on Environment and Economy to advise Parliament on what Canada's position should be. Given how long it took to get Kyoto off the ground, it's safe to say that no one should hold his or her breath waiting for an international consensus on climate policy. But maybe we need to worry a little less about Kyoto and keep our eye on the real task at hand - namely, learning how best to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.",,"climate change; climate prediction; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344462737

The summit region of Ridnitšohkka is an extensive area representing morphological features related to recent periglacial activity. The basal till at the summit plateau is devoid of vegetation cover and displays patterned ground features. At the end of July during several summer seasons, frozen ground conditions have been found in the till at a depth of 0.85-1.9 m. Typical morphological features of the slopes are solifluction terraces and lobes. The eastern flank of Ridnitšohkka has the most extensive area of permanent snow (3 km2) in Finland. The present thickness of th e snowfield is about 6 m, and according to radiocarbon dating of plant remnants found in the snow at a depth of about 4 m, the age of the snow is only a few decades. According historical records and aerial photographs, the snowfield has existed for at least one hundred years, but during the last few years the size has considerably diminished. During deglaciation of the Weichselian ice sheet the ice terminus retreated to the south, leaving small mountain glaciers in the area. The most distinct morphological feature is the cirque on the eastern flank of Kovddoskaisi. The valley glacier that occupied the Kovdajohka valley is well indicated by a set of more than ten end moraines. Surface boulders and stones of olivine gabro type, originating from the Halti fell, also indicate the extent and ice-flow direction from north to south, i.e. opposite to the main ice flow direction of the Scandinavian ice sheet in the area.","Cirques; End moraines; Enontekiö; Finland; Patterned ground; Periglacial features; Permafrost; Solifluction; Till","periglacial environment; permafrost; Enontekio; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Lappi [Finland]; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33244473730

Many of these companies are agnostic about the science of climate change or the social responsibility of protecting the global climate.

Typically these targets focus on transit modal shares or transit use; however, approaches for developing the actual targets vary considerably. Some municipalities ""back-calculate"" required mode split targets by examining future peak hour road capacity deficiencies on a screenline basis. Other areas adopt a broader approach and simply assume that if rapidly growing auto use is bad, than more transit use must be good, and consequently set very high goals for transit mode shares. While there appears to be little consistency in approaches for setting transportation demand targets, there is some consistency in the fact that modal share targets are generally not being achieved. At best, most urban transit systems struggle to maintain existing mode shares, let alone increase their mode shares. Perhaps more alarming is the fact that auto use continues to grow at a staggering rate. The most recent Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) Urban Indicators Survey [1] revealed that gasoline fuel use per capita, a measure of auto dependency, grew by more than 11% between 1991 and 2001. This paper will present a critical review of how and why traditional transportation mode share targets are failing to result in more sustainable transportation, as measured by reduced growth in auto usage and increased transit use. A proposed approach is outlined for establishing and achieving urban transportation targets, including a framework that bases transportation targets on auto use as well as transit mode shares. It is argued that this fundamental target better reflects the objectives that most municipalities are trying to achieve when they are setting targets. It is also expected that this approach will assist municipalities in establishing transportation policies and plans that help achieve federal commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, address a growing link between auto dependency and health problems, and prepare for a possible future wherein the availability of energy supply may not sustain current auto behaviour.","Mode split targets; Sustainable transportation; Transportation planning; Transportation targets","Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Mode split; Sustainable transportation; Transportation Association of Canada; Transportation demand; Transportation demand management; Transportation planning; Transportation policies; Urban transit system; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898458695

A CO2-transportation module calculates the transportation costs for CO2 from export terminals to the oil provinces. An EOR module predicts the increased oil recovery due to CO2 injection in water-flooded reservoirs. In order to convert from a water-injection scheme to CO2 injection large modifications of the oil production installations are needed.

While these products provide features consumers value, they consume considerable quantities of electricity. Residential electricity use by consumer electronics products has essentially doubled over the past decade, and is now responsible for up to 15% of household electricity use. Unlike consumer white goods, (i.e. refrigerators and clothes washers) which have over time made dramatic reductions in their annual energy use, most classes of new electronics products use more power than the ones they are replacing. Part of the reason for this category's escalating power use is that energy efficiency is typically not a consideration during the manufacturer's design process. For example, TV set top boxes used to receive and decode cable or satellite signals operate at essentially full power levels in the middle of the night even though the user is not watching or recording a show. For other product categories such as TVs and computers, the power used during periods of extended inactivity has been successfully reduced, but little progress has been made to address the more significant energy use when the product is being operated. In this paper, we summarize the work the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Ecos Consulting have performed to assess the power consumption of selected consumer electronics products. Per our analysis, if all of today's computers, TVs, and TV set top boxes (STBs) were to meet minimum efficiency requirements recommended by NRDC/Ecos, their combined energy consumption would drop by more than 25%. This has the effect of preventing the need to operate seven large (500 MW) power plants and eliminates the emission of approximately 22 million tons/yr of carbon dioxide, a key global warming pollutant. © 2005 IEEE.","Computers; Energy efficiency; ENERGY STAR; Global warming; NRDC; Set top boxes; TVs","ENERGY STAR; NRDC; Set top boxes; TVs; Electronic equipment; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global warming; Signal receivers; Television systems; Videodisks; Consumer electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28744455459

First, Israel is at a turning point. The current wave of immigration began at a time when the country was undergoing change. Israeli society is less collectivist and more individualistic than in previous decades, less Zionist, less idealistic and more pragmatic. The economy is less rigidly structured. In other words Israel has become socially, culturally and economically diverse. As a result there are more communities and more identities within the territorial and political entity. Second, most paradigms for the integration of immigrants deal with immigrants moving from non-developed countries to developed countries. In contrast, the case of Russian immigration to Israel is in a sense a Brain Drain of educated people from Russia. Third, in most immigration countries the immigrants are a small minority. In Israel Russian immigrants make up 20 per cent of the population. Three factors account for the integration of Russian immigrants in Israeli society: policies, climate of opinion and the immigrants' ability to organize themselves. Analysis of the interplay between the three factors reveals that the different factors are pushing in different directions. The official policies encourage assimilation. The climate of opinion, especially in some sectors of the Israeli society, creates among many immigrants the feeling that they are not welcomed by Israeli society, and the ability of the community to organize itself is pushing, sometimes, towards segregation of the community. The main conclusion of this article is that it is impossible to identify models of integration.We have to try to identify scripts which are more fluid than models. There are four main scripts of integration of Russian immigrants: Assimilation Script, Separation Script, Transnational Script and Hybridity Script. None of these scripts is dominant; they can coexist with one another. © 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066229592

An analysis of various types of emissions control technologies that may be available to reduce air emissions from ocean going vessels while they are docked was presented. The study was conducted based on vessels (tanker, cruise, container, reefer, etc.) calling at the Port of Long Beach. The study focused on the cost effectiveness of using shore-side electricity to power the various activities of these vessels while they are at berth. The study also considered the feasibility of using alternative approaches (e.g. clean fuel, exhaust treatments, and engine replacement). Cold ironing was generally cost effective with vessels that spend a lot of time docked at a port (i.e., hotelling), and thus have high annual power consumption that could be supplied by shore power. There were significant regulatory, legal, and logistical challenges to overcome if a government agency, particularly local agency, wanted to mandate the use of the various technologies including cold ironing. Of 19 ton/day of NOx emitted from a vessel approaching, 5.3% ton/day of that NOx was emitted from the vessel's auxiliary engines operating in hotelling mode.

The primary mechanism of toxicity of perchlorate is inhibition of normal iodide uptake by the thyroid glands. Due to lack of carbon source and public concern about unknown pathogens, biological treatment has its own limitation in drinking water treatment and groundwater remediation. Therefore, an effective chemical reduction processes which is favorable for drinking water treatment and groundwater remediation is necessary. The chemical reduction of perchlorate is retarded by its high activation energy. Many common reducing reagents have been tested without observable reduction of perchlorate. The key is to find a way that can overcome the energy barrier. According to the established hypo-theories which states that in the reaction at the iron surface, iron serves as a reducing agent and catalyst simultaneously. The most common application of zero valent iron is to pack iron filings as a permeable reactive barrier to reduce the chlorohydrocarbon in the environment. In this study, batch and column experiments for perchlorate reduction by two types of iron filings were conducted. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the kinetics of the reduction of perchlorate by considering the impact of iron surface treatment and pH. Flow-through experiments in a fixed-bed column were conducted to study the performance of permeable reactive barrier on a lab-scale. Iron filings were obtained from two different manufacturers designated as ""A"" and ""B"". Both types of iron filings were washed by acid prior to use. The analysis of perchlorate was performed on a Dionex DX600 ion chromatography system (Sunnyvale, CA) following EPA method 314.0. Batch experiments were performed in 16-ml sealed glass vials. Acid washed iron filings from both manufacturers were tested under two pH values 7 and 5. Unwashed iron filings were also tested under pH 7. In these experiments the dosage of iron filings per vial was 1g/mL and the initial perchlorate concentration was 1000 μg/L. For each condition two replicates were conducted in order to determine data precision.

To study the origin of improvement, depth-resolved CL has been carried out to map out the emissions at different depths. It shows that the improvement occurs primarily at the film surface, which indicates the cap layer acts as a passivation layer that suppresses the detrimental surface states. The PC measurement on the capped ZnO at room temperature shows a distinctive excitonic feature at 3.29 eV and an overall increment of photoresponse above the band gap.

For new orchards to succeed, reliable cultivar information must be made available. Beginning in 1996, a repository of 20 cultivars and accessions (generally 2 replications) of Chinese chestnut and chestnut species hybrids was established at the Horticulture and Agroforestry Research Center (HARC) at New Franklin, Missouri, in fertile, well-drained, erodible, loess 'River Hill' soil. Chestnut cultivars and accessions have been added on a yearly basis to total 56 currently. Cataloging descriptors such as bud break date, flowering date, nut size, nut weight, nut maturity and nut yield has been a primary focus. Early results clearly indicate strong differences among cultivars in form, precocity, nut size and date of nut maturity. Further, as yields increase nut size appears to be declining. A second planting of Chinese chestnut cultivars was established in fall 1999 at two locations in central Missouri including HARC (12 cultivars, 5 replications) and in spring 1999, at Mexico, Missouri, a site with a claypan soil (5 cultivars, 5 replications). Based on very preliminary observations, a third orchard planting was established at HARC in the fall of 2001 consisting of 3 cultivars - 'Peach', 'Qing' and 'Willamette' (8 replications, 6 trees per replication). Knowledge gained in these studies will be utilized for refining cultivar recommendations and orchard management strategies in a continental climate.","Castanea germplasm; Castanea mollissima; Castanea species hybrids; Chestnut size; Chestnut yield",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879710348

Prior to World War I, carbon emissions grew faster than economic growth by 2.3% per year. As electricity use expanded and steam engines became much larger, carbon emissions began to grow slower than economic growth by 1.6% per year. Adjusting to this technological shift, an expanding economy continues to increase carbon emissions by about 9% for each 10% faster growth. There is little evidence of a decline in this elasticity as the income level rises. These results suggest that the USA today will need to find additional policies to curb carbon emissions if it wishes to prevent any further increase in its per capita emissions, and if its per capita economy grows by more than 1.8% per year.

Associated with this has been widespread adoption of the eddy covariance method to provide direct estimates of mass and energy exchange between vegetation surfaces and the atmosphere. With the eddy covariance method, fast-response instruments (10-20 Hz) are typically mounted above plant canopies and the fluxes are calculated by correlating turbulent fluctuations in vertical velocity with fluctuations in various scalars such as CO2, water vapour and temperature. These techniques allow the direct and non-destructive measurement of the net exchange of CO2 owing to uptake via photosynthesis and loss owing to respiration, evapotranspiration and sensible heat. Eddy covariance measurements have a high temporal resolution, with fluxes typically calculated at 30-min intervals and can provide daily, monthly or annual estimates of carbon uptake or loss from ecosystems. Such measurements provide a bridge between 'bottom-up' (e.g. leaf, soil and whole plant measures of carbon fluxes) and 'top-down' approaches (e.g. satellite remote sensing, air sampling networks, inverse numerical methods) to understanding carbon cycling. Eddy covariance data also provide key measurements to calibrate and validate canopy- and regional-scale carbon balance models. Limitations of the method include high establishment costs, site requirements of flat and relatively uniform vegetation and problems estimating fluxes accurately at low wind speeds. Advantages include spatial averaging over 10-100 ha and near-continuous measurements. The utility of the method is illustrated in current flux studies at ideal sites in northern Australia. Flux measurements spanning 3 years have been made at a mesic savanna site (Howard Springs, Northern Territory) and semi-arid savanna (Virginia Park, northern Queensland). Patterns of CO2 and water vapour exchange at diurnal, seasonal and annual scales are detailed. Carbon dynamics at these sites are significantly different and reflect differences in climate and land management (impacts of frequent fire and grazing). Such studies illustrate the utility of the eddy covariance method and its potential to provide accurate data for carbon accounting purposes. If full carbon accounting is implemented, for ideal sites, the eddy covariance method provides annual estimates of carbon sink strength accurate to within 10%. The impact of land-use change on carbon sink strength could be monitored on a long-term basis and provide a valuable validation tool if carbon trading schemes were implemented. © CSIRO 2005.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide enrichment; eddy covariance; land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28644432362

The technology corresponding to these demands in the engine management system for motorcycles is being developed under such a situation. With the changing from carburetors system to electronic fuel injection system, various devices are installed; it can be said that technology for engine management system control has advanced remarkably these days. As for the microcomputer within the ECU that controls the system, microcomputer installed in ignition units had only 8 bits and the capacity of ROM was about 16 kB in 1990, but the microcomputer installed in fuel injection units is so efficient that it has 32 bits and the capacity of ROM is increased up to 256 kB in 2004. This means it is necessary to process various engine information at high-speed and in real time in order to execute a proper fuel injection and control ignition timing, especially while the engine is in a transient state. ECU will be provided with control that achieves both correspondence to the restriction on exhaust emission and responsive driving performance, which is very important for motorcycles in the future. We introduce fuel cut when decelerating and control when accelerating as an example for control to reduce exhaust emission and improve driving ability. It is necessary to cut fuel in order to reduce HC and improve fuel efficiency, but it sometimes makes it difficult to reaccelerate. Also you sometimes feel a shock when the throttle is opened suddenly for acceleration from steady driving state. We improved these problems by fuel control and ignition timing control.

The experimental system (hereinafter called the ""dual DPNR"") consists of two DPNR catalysts arranged in parallel, each provided with an exhaust throttle valve downstream to control the exhaust gas flow to the catalyst, plus a fuel injector that precisely controls the air-fuel ratio and the catalyst bed temperature. The fuel injector is used to supply a rich mixture to the DPNR catalyst, and the flow of exhaust gas is switched between the two catalysts by operating the exhaust throttle valves alternately. Tests were conducted with the engine running at steady state. The results indicated that the NOx reduction performance dramatically improved and the loss of fuel economy from the NOx reduction reduced. This was achieved by using the exhaust throttle valve to lower the Specific Velocity (SV) ratio on the catalyst therefore maintaining a rich atmosphere for the optimum length of time. The dual DPNR system is also expected to improve NOx reduction performance during forced PM oxidation, which is difficult for a conventional system, and also to improve recovery performance from catalyst poisoning due to sulfur. The main issues for commercialization are dealing with transient operation. In this paper, the durability of the catalyst is also reported as the major issue of DPNR in the APPENDIX. Specifically, a long-term endurance evaluation equivalent to 250,000km running was carried out using a mass-production engine. This was to clarify the effects of the sulfur concentration in the fuel by reducing the amount of NOx stored in the catalyst, as well as the effects of low-ash oil that clogged the catalyst. Research has yielded basic data on the use of DPNR catalysts in commercial vehicles which require better catalyst performance and durability.

We begin by examining concurrent interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR) data from Cassini together with images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) from an interval in January 2004, which show the effect of the arrival at Saturn of a corotating interaction region (CIR)-related compression region. We then examine the IMF data obtained over five solar rotations bracketing the SOI fly-through . and show that a similar CIR compression and embedded crossing of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is expected to have impinged on Saturn's magnetosphere at some time during the fly-through. Examination of the IMF direction on either side of the fly-through confirms the HCS crossing. Observations of SKR show relatively weak emissions modulated at the planetary rotation period on the SOI inbound pass. Strong bursts extending to low frequencies, which are not in phase with the previous emissions, were observed on the outbound pass, similar to the CIR-related SKR bursts seen in the January data. We thus suggest that the inbound pass occurred under uncompressed conditions of SKR and auroral quiet, while much of the outbound pass occurred under compressed conditions of SKR and auroral disturbance, probably of the same general character as observed in association with CIR compressions during the HST-Cassini campaign in January 2004. We also examine the in situ magnetic field data observed outbound by Cassini in the predawn sector and find that the largest emission bursts are associated with concurrent variations in the predawn magnetic field, which are indicative of the injection of hot plasma at the spacecraft. Specifically, after an initial field strength increase, the field becomes depressed in strength and highly variable in time. These observations are consistent with an injection of hot plasma into the nightside magnetosphere from the tail, which we suggest is connected with auroral processes of the same nature as observed by the HST during the January 2004 campaign. The injection may be associated with compression-induced reconnection in the tail, as has been proposed to explain the auroral signatures observed in the HST-Cassini campaign data.

An important synergism between noble metal promoter and partially reducible oxide components has led to the postulation of at least two mechanisms, one involving surface formates as intermediates, having its roots in the catalysis of formic acid decomposition and another relying on a support-mediated redox process, whereby ceria is reduced by CO, generating CO2, with subsequent reoxidation of the reduced ceria by water, liberating hydrogen in the process. In this discussion, a link was established between a normal kinetic isotope effect (KIE) observed for low temperature WGS (CO + H2O and CO + D20) and that of water-assisted formic acid decomposition (HCOOH + H2O and DCOOH + H2O). The KIE for WGS is discussed in terms of the dynamic response of H and D labeled surface formate, as monitored by DRIFTS. The results suggest that the rate limiting step involves C-H bond rupture of formate. Isotopic tracers were employed to monitor the exchange of surface species at steady state reaction conditions. Isotopic transients were followed by DRIFTS for the forward shift, underlining the importance of the autocatalytic role of water in the decomposition of surface formate species. Based upon these mechanistic insights, structural property relationships were developed. The active site is strongly suggested to be bridging OH groups associated with Ce3+ in the surface shell. Increasing ceria surface area led to important increases in catalyst activity. Pt promoter loading was also explored. Increasing Pt loading facilitated ceria surface shell reduction, accompanied by removal of surface carbonates, such that the active bridging OH groups formed at lower temperature. DRIFTS results suggest that Pt may also assist in improving the formate decomposition rate.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Decomposition; Fuel cells; Isotopes; Radioactive tracers; Redox reactions; Surface chemistry; Ceria; Formic acid; Kinetic isotope effects (KIE); Water gas shift (WGS) catalysts; Catalysts",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22444444899

For diesel engines, FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester), coming from trans esterification of vegetable oils, have already shown their potential as fuel substitutes. Nevertheless, this trans esterification induces glycerol production as a co - product. At the same time, oxygenated compounds have been shown to have great potential for reducing diesel particulate emissions. So using glycerol as a basis to synthesize new oxygenated compounds, for diesel fuel formulation could be promising. This paper deals with the synthesis of oxygenated compounds coming from glycerol, such as acetals, ethers, or carbonates, and their evaluation as blending components in diesel fuel. The objective of this work is to evaluate their potential, in terms of pollutant emissions, with different engine technologies. Their impact on particulate emissions depends on the engine technology and the chemical structure of the glycerol derivatives. For the Euro II vehicle, the decrease in particulate emissions is up to 20% on NEDC cycle. Although the Euro III vehicle is less sensitive than the Euro II, with only 5% in volume of glycerol derivatives, up to 12% of particulate reduction is possible. The impact on NOx emissions is rather low especially for the Euro III vehicle. Tests with an HCCI engine have shown that some glycerol compounds could improve the running of HCCI engine.

In order to measure emissions, ventilation rates from each barn were periodically measured using a portable Fan Assessment Numeration System (FANS) unit, that measured airflow capacity of the six (5 - 122 cm and 1 - 91 cm diameter blade fans) exhaust fans at one end of each barn. During the first routine airflow measurements of the large (122 cm diameter) belt-driven fans it was determined that when the fan drive belts were slightly loose that belt slippage occurred and the fan airflow delivery was reduced by 30 to 60% of the fan airflow delivery when the belts were properly tightened. This large reduction in airflow delivery represents a significant reduction in the total ventilation rate for these sow facilities since a large majority of the airflow capacity was provided by these belt-driven fans. Belt-driven fans are commonly used to provide most of the airflow capacity in tunnel ventilated buildings in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. Belt slippage and dirty shutters can result in serious under ventilation of the barns, providing inadequate environmental control for the animals housed in these buildings.","Fan performance; Fans; Ventilation","Airflow reduction; Exhaust ventilation fans; Loose belts; Data mining; Environmental protection; Exhaust gases; Odors; Particulate emissions; Ventilation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645036872

As the 2005 deadline is approaching, Rowan University has been active on many fronts in an attempt to meet this challenging goal. One effort to help reduce emissions includes a multi-disciplinary group of engineers in the College of Engineering's innovative Junior/Senior Clinic program2,3 who have combined to site, design, permit, and install photovoltaic (PV) systems around campus. PV systems are a clean, renewable energy resource that use energy from the sun and convert solar energy to usable electricity. They have developed plans for installing these systems on roofs around campus, as well as one system on the ground for educational purposes. Lucrative financial incentives from the State of New Jersey have made these systems economically feasible for the first time. To further reduce overall system costs, students working on the project, as well as volunteers from the professional service societies of the College (IEEE, ASCE, etc.), will be installing the PV systems themselves. Early estimates are that the planned installations will save over 8.5 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually (estimated from the installation of 6-kilo Watts of PV. This paper describes the steps that the student volunteers undertook to perform resource assessment, site identification, site selection prioritization, presentation to administration, system design, system component procurement and ultimately system construction, permitting, and rebate application. Although Rowan University finds its 2005 deadline challenging, since, like many universities, it is growing very significantly each year, significant strides have been made in many areas (efficiency, cogeneration, and tree planting). This project is a key component of the overall plan for the coming years to enable Rowan University to become more environmentally responsible.",,"Engineering education; Environmental protection; Feedback; Greenhouse effect; Professional aspects; Solar cells; Students; Engineering students; Greenhouse emissions; Photovoltaic systems; Undergraduate service learning; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22544483844

The structural evolution of the marbles began with E-W subhorizontal shortening resulting in the tilting of the Cal-Dol layering (which had generally originated as a pre-tectonic and pre-metamorphic feature) and its transposition to a steeply dipping metamorphic SI foliation. The subsequent vertical flattening occurred at the temperature peak of regional metamorphism and produced the N-S trending tight, recumbent F2 folds. This event is also documented by the subhorizontal S2 axial-plane carbonate grain shape fabric and the parallel alignment of Phi-Ms ± Tr ± Czo in the marbles, and the S2 axial-plane schistosity in the adjacent mica schists. The temperature increase was associated with the progressive mineral sequence Phi → Tr → Di in the dolomite-bearing marbles, which probably initially equilibrated at low to moderate X(CO2). Under peak temperatures, the observed arrangement of the metamorphic zonation of the Stronie formation developed, overprinting the folded planes. Subsequently, under retrogressive conditions, younger deformations were localised in the dynamically recrystallised shear zones that mostly reactivated the S2 planes and were associated with a late top-to-the-N (NE) directed tectonic transport. The D3 mylonitisation was associated with the elongation and size reduction of carbonate grains within the S-C or S-C mylonites. It produced the S3 planes and the N-S trending L3 stretching lineation. Both groups of the tectonic structures and D2-established mineral isograds (Tr-in and Di-in) were together reoriented during the late compressional stages D4 and D5, related respectively to the SW-NE (WSW-ENE) and NW-SE (NNW-SSE) directed tectonic shortenings. This is visible in the large scale F4 folds, the diversity of the D2-and DS-related mineral assemblages, and the temperature estimations related to both tectonic stages, which indicate decreasing metamorphic conditions from ≥600°C in the SE to ≥ 490°C in the NE of the LSMU during D2, and from ca. 510°C to 430°C for the respective domains during D3. The incomplete pattern of the Di-in and Tr-in isograds, which still refers to the geometry of gneiss-schist boundary, confirms that the macrostructures of the LSMU mainly developed in tectonic event(s) following the temperature peak of metamorphism.","La̧dek- śnieżnik Metamorphic Unit; Marbles; Metamorphism; Sudetes; Tectonism; Variscan orogeny","brittle deformation; carbonate; ductile deformation; folding; gneiss; grain size; Hercynian orogeny; marble; mica; mylonitization; overprinting; recrystallization; schist; shear zone; tectonic evolution; tectonics; temperature profile; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Sudetes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249080791

Most probably low 13C value in calcite in eutrophic systems results from an advanced oxidation of organic compounds in turbulent or/and sulphate-rich conditions. Likewise, high 13C value in calcite from organic-rich sediments may evidence low red-ox potential of the freshwater system. More advanced studies might help to calibrate a new tool for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. Oxidation of methane and organic matter results in significant isotope effects in sulphates dissolved in water. Therefore, to better understand the origin of carbon isotope signal in carbonates, concentration and stable isotope measurements in dissolved sulphate (water column), bubble methane and calcite (freshwater sediments) have been carried out in 24 lakes, 2 ponds and 4 rivers in Poland. Dissolved sulphate is a major compound of freshwater systems and sulphur, being an important bioelement, controls many processes in lakes therefore quality of water (e.g. microbial sequestration of organic compounds, inhibitor of methane ebullitive flux). The highest concentration of sulphate has been detected in rivers (85.47 SO42- mg/ l) and an artificial lake (70.3 SO42- mg/l) located in the extremely SO42--polluted region called the ""Black Triangle"". The lowest concentration of sulphate are found in dystrophic and mountain lakes (from 0.5 to about 3 mg/l SO4 2-). The lowest δ34S(SO4 2-) and δ18O(SO4 2-) values occur in unpolluted lakes in Eastern Poland (-0.94 and 1.38‰, respectively). The highest δ 34S(SO42-) and δ 18O(SO42-) values are found in polluted lakes in western Poland and dystrophic lakes (12.95 and 16.15‰, respectively). It is proposed that δ 34S(SO42-) and δ 18O(SO42-) values in lakes represent a good tool to assess and quantify anthropogenic impact by acid precipitation and to monitor variations in the trophic state and redox processes controlled by biodegradation of organic compounds is sediments and water column. In contrast to clean lakes, an increase of the value with increasing depth of the δ 13C(CH4) water column, in a strongly SO42- contaminated lake, is observed. This is probably due to a loss of biological buffering potential of the lake accompanied by an active oxidation of methane precursors.","Anthropogenic impact; Carbon; Carbonates; Freshwater; Isotopes; Methane; Oxygen; Sulphates; Sulphur","anthropogenic effect; carbon isotope; carbonate; lake pollution; methane; oxidation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29544433319

We have previously demonstrated that fluorinated esters created in this manner may be hydrolyzed back to PHEMA by brief exposure to base. Controlled hydrolysis results in depth-dependent regeneration of PHEMA that can be subsequently refunctionalized to create a variety of copolymer films with tailored interfacial composition and barrier properties. In a second approach, we expose a PHEMA film to a mixture of alkyl and perfluoroalkyl acid chlorides to generate a copolymer film in a more random fashion. Phase separation of the pendant fluorocarbon side groups from the hydrocarbon side groups provides a film with nanoscale order in which the fluorocarbon groups dominate the outermost surface.

In order to utilize climate information with water resources management and planning, screening methodologies are necessary to determine the regions and conditions under which climate model simulations and predictions may be useful. We used a probabilistic methodology for measuring the comparison of model and observation climatology (means, standard deviations, sample frequency distributions) of large regions, which was recently proposed by Georgakakos (2003). Three different general circulation models (GCMs) with various spatial resolutions and model options operated by domestic and foreign agencies are used to clarify the usefulness of GCM for water resources applications in the study area. The formulation uses the significance probability of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for detecting differences between two variables. An estimator that accounts for climate model simulation and spatial association between the GCM data and observed data is used. Atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations done by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts), and METRI (Meteorological Research Institute, Korea) were used for indicator variables, while observed mean areal precipitation (MAP) data, discharge data and mean areal temperature data on the seven major river basins in Korea were used for target variables. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to establish the significance of the estimator values. Monthly analyses by season and tercile discrimination condition were used for the analysis. The results show that GCM simulations are useful in discriminating the high from the low of the observed precipitation, discharge, and temperature values. Temperature especially can be useful regardless of model and season.

For example, in the enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide flooding, the solubility of carbon dioxide in the connate water (brine) reduces the amount of CO2 available for miscible oil displacement, which in turn affects the oil recovery. Another example, the existence of electrolytes is known to affect the solubility and selectivity of CO2 and other natural gas components in the equilibrium phases, especially in the low-temperature region close to the hydrate formation, the knowledge of which has a potential application in gas separation technology. In the CO2 sequestration in saline formations and oceans, the knowledge of the solubility of carbon dioxide in brine is also an important factor. In this work, we use the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory coupled with Restricted Primitive Model (SAFT1-RPM) [1] for representing CO2-H2O-NaCl system. For pure components, CO2 molecule is modeled as a molecule with three association sites, i.e., two sites of type O and one site of type C and H2O molecule is modeled as a molecule with four association sites, i.e. two sites of type O and two sites of type H. Parameters of pure CO2 are fitted to vapor pressure and liquid density data. The parameters for H2O and NaCl have been obtained in our previous work [1]. For CO2-H2O system, we assume that there is only one type of cross association, i.e., between site of type O in CO2 and site of type H in H2O. The cross association between site of type C in CO2 and site of type O in H2O is considered weak and negligible. The temperature dependences of the binary interaction parameters for this system are fitted to the experimental equilibrium compositions of CO2-rich and H2O-rich phases from 12 to 200°C and pressure up to 600 bar. The SAFT1 model is found to represent the equilibrium data, including the minimum H2O concentration in the CO2-rich phase in the P-y diagram. For CO2-H2O-NaCl system, we use one additional constant binary interaction parameter for both CO2-Na+ and CO2-C1- pairs, which is needed to correct the short-range interactions. The SAFT1-RPM model is found to represent the equilibrium data up to molality of 6 mol/kg. The predictability of the model for the density calculations of these systems is also discussed.",,"Carbon dioxide; Composition; Electrolytes; Gas industry; Phase equilibria; Thermodynamic properties; Connate water; Gas separation technology; Saline formations; Equations of state",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645559209

The main goal of this research is to provide the first estimate of emissions of BC and particle-phase PAHs (PPAHs) from motor vehicles in Mexico City. The emissions of other pollutants including carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter of diameter 2.5 μm and less (PM2.5) are also estimated. As a part of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area field campaign in April 2003 (MCMA-2003), a mobile laboratory was driven throughout the city. The laboratory was equipped with a comprehensive suite of gas and particle analyzers, including an aethalometer that measured BC and a photoionization aerosol sensor that measured PPAHs. While driving through traffic, the mobile lab continuously sampled exhaust plumes from the vehicles around it. We have developed a method of automatically identifying exhaust plumes, which are then used as the basis for calculation of fleet-average emissions. In the approximately 75 h of on-road sampling during the field campaign, we have identified ∼30 000 exhaust measurement points that represent a variety of vehicle types and driving conditions. The large sample provides a basis for estimating fleet-average emission factors and thus the emission inventory. Motor vehicles in the Mexico City area are estimated to emit 1700±200 metric tons BC, 57±6 tons PPAHs, 1 190 000±40 000 tons CO, 120 000±3000 tons NOx, 240 000±50 000 tons VOCs, and 4400±400 tons PM2.5 per year, not including cold start emissions. The estimates for CO, NOx, and PPAHs may be low by up to 10% due to the slower response time of analyzers used to measure these species. Compared to the government's official motor vehicle emission inventory for the year 2002, the estimates for CO, NOx, VOCs, and PM2.5 are 38% lower, 23% lower, 27% higher, and 25% higher, respectively. The distributions of emission factors of BC, PPAHs, and PM2.5 are highly skewed, i.e. asymmetric, while those for benzene, measured as a surrogate for total VOCs, and NOx are less skewed. As a result, the total emissions of BC, PPAHs, and PM2.5 could be reduced by approximately 50% if the highest 20% of data points were removed, but ""super polluters"" are less influential on overall NOx and VOC emissions. © 2005 Author(s).

In this paper we investigated the effects of recent urban sprawl (1991-2001) in Beijing metropolitan region, People's Republic of China on ecosystem net primary production (NPP). The analysis employed a mechanistic model of NPP in combination with satellite-derived and ecological data. Our analysis shows that urban growth in the 10-year study period significantly altered the urban ecosystem component of the regional carbon cycle. The annual amount of atmospheric carbon assimilated into phytomass through NPP was reduced by approximately 50.71×104 Mg C (-15.08%). More than half of this reduction is attributed to the loss of cultivated land. Vegetation removal and road disturbance by the expansion of urban areas reduced the amount of carbon uptake.","Beijing; Carbon uptake; Net primary productivity; Urban sprawl","Carbon; Data reduction; Ecology; Ecosystems; Industrial economics; Mathematical models; Productivity; Beijing; Carbon uptake; Net primary productivity; Urban sprawl; Land use",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29244432190

In the feasibility study, lower concentrations of nutrients applied periodically were almost as effective as a single application using a larger concentration. The small-plot study indicated that treatment with added bacteria and nutrients offered the greatest reduction in hydrocarbons. Addition of bacteria alone provided no advantage. In the field remediation program, two- and three-ring compounds were completely degraded, while four-, five-, and six-ring compounds were more resistant.

Advanced ALSTOM concepts include ""the oxygen-fired CFB,"" which uses pure oxygen plus recirculated flue gas (mainly CO2) as a combustion medium, resulting in a flue gas stream with a high CO2 concentration. Consequently, CO2 can be separated from the flue gas stream relatively easily. As such, this technology is geared toward CO2 mitigation.Another advancement, ""the circulating moving bed (CMB™)"" system, uses a novel heat exchanger design that heats the energy cycle working fluid to the high temperature levels required for advanced power generation systems. The CMB™ combustion system is also an enabling technology for hydrogen production and CO2 capture from combustion systems utilizing innovative chemical looping gasification and syngas decarbonization. Chemical looping is another development path towards CO 2 mitigation. In ALSTOM's processes, oxygen (from air) is transported by a solid oxygen carrier for combustion or gasification of the fuel. CO 2 is captured in a separate chemical loop in the gasification process. The process can be used to produce nearly pure CO2 and steam for a Rankine cycle; or synthesis gas or hydrogen with CO2 capture for IGCC's, fuel cells, or industrial use.This paper will discuss ALSTOM's latest work and the technical and economic implications of these advanced CFB-based systems. These advanced power generation units can be built from proven fluid bed design features and systems and the same processes supporting current-state technology enable rational development of future-state power generation and CO2 capture.

The discussion is based on the evaluation of a novel concept dealing with the carbonation-calcination process of lime for CO2 capture from coal fired power plants compared to integration of CO2 capture in an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plant. In the novel concept, coal is gasified with steam in the presence of lime. Lime absorbs the CO2 released from the coal, producing limestone. The produced gas can be a low-carbon or even zero-carbon (H2) gas. depending on the ratio of lime added to the process. The produced gas can be used in state-of-the-art combined cycles for electricity generation, producing almost no CO2 emissions or other harmful pollutants. The limestone is regenerated in a second reactor, where pure CO 2 is produced, which can be either marketed to industry or sequestered in long term disposal areas. The simulation model of a Combined Cycle power plant, integrating the novel carbonation-calcination process, is based on available data from a typical natural gas fired Combined Cycle power plant. The natural gas fired power plant was adopted to firing with the low-C fuel, maintaining the basic operating characteristics. The performance of the novel concept power plant is compared to that of an IGCC with CO2 removal by means of Selexol absorption. Results from thermodynamic simulation, dealing with the most important features for CO2 reduction, are presented. The operating characteristics, as well as the main figures of the plant energy balances are included. A preliminary economic comparison is also provided, taking into account investment and operating costs, in order to estimate the electricity cost related to the two different technological approaches and the economic constrains towards the potentials for applications are examined. The cycle calculations were performed using the thermodynamic cycle calculation software ENBIPRO (ENergie-BIllanz-PROgram). ENBIPRO is a powerful tool for heat and mass balance calculations, solving complex thermodynamic circuits, calculating the efficiency, and allowing exergetic and exergoeconomic analysis of power plants. The software code models all pieces of equipment that usually appear in power plant installations and can accurately calculate all thermodynamic properties (temperature, pressure, enthalpy) at each node of the thermodynamic circuit, power consumption of each component, flue gas composition etc [1]. The code has proven its validity by accurately simulating a large number of power plants and through comparison of the results with other commercial software.",,"Coal-fired power plants; Emission reduction; Mass balance; Simulation models; Carbon dioxide; Coal fired boilers; Coal industry; Electricity; Gas emissions; Lime; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744517138

The production of high-quality bulbs and flowers in warm regions has become important during the last decade, and is encouraged by relatively cheap labor and the expansion of international trade. In spite of the fact that for commercial bulb production in warm-climate areas, species without chilling requirements are more suitable, thermo-periodic bulbs might also be grown successfully. Moreover, the potential for flower production in these regions is evident: since the light intensity is relatively high and winter temperatures are appropriate for flower development, cut flowers and potted plants can be produced in these areas during the off-season, and transported to markets in other countries. The Israeli experience in bulb and flower production provides a good example of the development of special strategies for warm climates. Bulbs of Hippeastrum, Narcissus, Anemone, Ranunculus, Ornithogalum and other species, adapted to relatively high temperatures, are grown commercially on a large scale. At the same time, the production of thermo-periodic bulbs with chilling requirements (Tulipa, Allium, Eremurus) allows us to meet specific market demands. Greenhouse flowers, produced during the winter and early spring are sold at high prices in the international market, but their production requires precise knowledge of the flowering physiology of the species, as well as a high level of growth technologies. Various aspects of the development of bulb and flower production in warm countries, as well as the research needed for this branch of the ornamental industry, will be discussed.","Asia; Cut flowers; Israel; Ornamental bulbs; Potted plants; South Africa; South America",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952687554

Sediment samples were collected using remotely operated vehicles from the bathyal to abyssal seafloors of Nankai Trough and Sagami Trough. A piston core sample from the West Philippine Basin seafloor was used as a non-seep reference. Sediment fatty acids were extracted as either total fatty acids or phospholipid fatty acids. Phosopholipid fatty acids represent the abundance and composition of 'living' microflorae. Compositions of total fatty acids and phospholipid fatty acids were cluster-analyzed to construct dendrograms. As a general result, high presence of fatty acid markers for sulfate-reducing bacteria and methane-oxidizing bacteria was associated with blown methane seepage. The fatty acid profiles of a tested (suspected) seep site were closely similar to those of known seeps, which strongly suggests that the tested site is an incipient seep yet-to-be colonized. As methane acts as a greenhouse gas or a biospheric poison, it should be important to probe, i.e., detect and localize, seafloor methane seeps associated with sub-seafloor gas hydrates.

The development of the model was motivated by the need to analyze international energy and environmental issues such as climate change, using a detailed, technology rich modeling framework. We then present three different types of application. First, the model is applied to conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission abatement, whereby constraints on CO2 emissions are added to the base case formulation. The model then computes the cost-efficient response of the energy system to these emission targets. Second, we address the issue of ""who pays"" for emission reductions (whereas the cost-effictiveness analysis addressed the ""who acts"" issue). More precisely, we use the model to devise and evaluate certain allocation rules for attributing initial emission rights to regions in a cap-and-trade system. Third, we use World MARKAL in a cost-benefit mode, i.e. we augment the model with damage costs resulting from climate change, and run the integrated model without any pre-set targets on emissions or concentration. We then analyse cooperative and non-cooperative decisions by regions when confronted to the threat of damages.

The 1-D engine and exhaust system models were developed using WAVE. The engine emissions model combines a phenomenological soot model with artificial neural networks to predict engine out soot emissions. Experimental data from a light-duty diesel engine was used to calibrate both the engine and engine emissions models. The DPF model predicts the behavior of a clean and particulate-loaded catalyzed wall-flow filter. Experimental data was used to validate this sub-model individually. Several model integration issues were identified and addressed. These included time-step selection, continuous vs. limited triggering of sub-models, and code structuring for simulation speed. Required time-steps for different sub models varied by orders of magnitude. A system of controllers were implemented which limited the triggering of sub-models with very small time-steps so that simulation speed was maintained while minimizing the adverse effects on calculation accuracy. Integration of the models allowed for the visualization of dynamic interactions between sub-models that were not seen when simulating individual components. An example of which was an interesting filter pressure drop overshoot during a speed-step transient simulation. In both steady state and transient simulations, overall model results fit expectations. Three steady-state cases (a baseline, an increased fueling, and an increased engine speed) and two transient cases (baseline to increased fueling and baseline to increased speed) were analyzed. While numerous results were studied, pressure drop across the filter was emphasized. Reasonable trends were observed. The system developed in this study will assist in the design and optimization of diesel automotive systems for reduction of tailpipe emissions.

Additionality assessment remains a central and persistent challenge in all programs. Concerns have been raised with methods currently used, such as investment analysis, barrier analysis, and performance thresholds. They have been variously critiqued for high costs, resistance to standardization, weak environmental integrity, and susceptibility to gaming. Technology penetration rates provide another means to infer additionality, and could be a potentially useful complement to other methods. The notion is that emerging technologies with low but increasing penetration rates typically require some type of support, as might be provided through offsets markets, to compete effectively in the marketplace. For penetration rate analysis to provide a useful tool for additionality assessment, several fundamental questions need to be addressed. What do penetration rates represent and how can they be measured? How can additionality evaluation utilize penetration rates? For which sectors and project types are the use of penetration rates most promising? This article shows that penetration tests have a mixture of pluses and minuses, with greater relevance in certain market niches and regions. Reasonable ranges for penetration thresholds are discussed, along with partial crediting approaches to reduce ‘knife-edge’ effects. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Additionality; Carbon offsets; Clean Development Mechanism; Emissions trading; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Penetration rate","carbon emission; clean development mechanism; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; mitigation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27244449791

A small-scale fuel cell with gasifier is one of the promising technologies for utilizing woody biomass. The reduction in primary energy consumption and CO2 emission by use of woody biomass in a fuel cell with gasifier is compared with that in a co-firing system. Sawmill wastes, pruned fruit tree branches, pruned road-side tree branches, and fallen leaves and branches in forests around city area in the mid-land area in Japan are taken into account as woody biomass available for electricity production. The overall energy efficiency of gasification and electricity generation process is assumed to be 25%. As for the reduction in primary energy consumption, only 35% of the total amount of woody biomass excluding fallen leaves and branches is efficiently used in a co-firing system relative to a small-scale fuel cell with gasifier, because no transportation energy is required in a small-scale distributed utilization of woody biomass. However, 74 % of woody biomass excluding fallen leaves and branches contributes to reduction in C02 emission by co-firing, because co-firing can reduce the consumption of coal being highest CO2 intensive fuel. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus Energy is critical for sustainable development because it is not only necessary for economic development, but also because this necessity drives societies towards environmentally unsound energy use and could severely compromise the planet itself. Sustainable low-carbon energy scenarios for the coming century emphasize the untapped potential of Decentralised /Renewable Energy (DE/RE) sources. Rural areas those away from the grid or not connected to the electrical network of the developing world can benefit from this transition. The increased availability of reliable and efficient energy services stimulates new development alternatives. A number of renewable energy initiatives are under way in developing countries, and India can contribute to rural development through the integrated operation of locally available RE sources. However due to the behavioral characteristics use of single source may not be able to supply energy safely, reliably and economically. An integrated renewable energy system composed of some renewable sources, and targets a small area such as a village or remote area for power supply. The system described here is meant to provide power for lighting during night hours. The system configuration of renewable energy varies with site location as these are generally intermittent in nature. Thus it may so happen that renewable power may not be sufficient to meet the regional demand in some hours. Such energy systems need to be provided with backup to support whenever the renewable supply is insufficient. In the present study it is targeted to a small village in the state of Madhya Pradesh in remote part of India, for examining the possibility of providing electrical energy with three kinds of renewable sources, such as Solar-PV, wind Power and small hydro power operated in an integrated way. The data of various energy sources was collected from the regional meteorological center for at least ten years were analysed in order to plan for the structure of the system. Finally the effects of integrated operation to store energy in the batteries with solar and wind sources are presented as the hydropower studies are underway.

This technique is illustrated using an aeolian sandstone core sample of the Rotliegendes Dethlingen Formation from the Southern Permian basin of northwest Germany. The methodology involves digitizing a series of densely spaced microfocus computer tomography (mCT) images with an appropriate sampling and processing the individual images, which are based on density contrasts, into a volume definition similar to seismic data. Once the volume file has been created the data can be visualized and analysed using virtual reality software. Visualization of scanned core samples has benefits with regards to both the qualitative interpretation of the rock as well as to the quantitative evaluation of the intergranular volumes, cements and pore space. Further advantages exist in terms of the effective communication and collaboration within relevant communities in exploration and production. A key requirement for this technology to be beneficial is calibration of the input slices with rock properties. In terms of the qualitative analysis of the rock, visualization offers the possibility to view slices of the rock samples in any direction. Consequently, bedding planes and fracture planes can be viewed orthogonally even if the physical sample has been cut oblique to these planes. Both slice and transparent volume views are possible, readily revealing the sedimentary and structural features of the rock. Provided that the scanning process has taken place with sufficient resolution, the views can separate grains from cement, matrix and pore space. In addition to the qualitative aspect of visualization, the 3D interpretation capabilities of the software are very valuable. Voxel-based technology allows measurement of grain sizes, cement, matrix and pore space, both in terms of volume as well as geometry. This provides important information in addition, and complementary, to conventional core analysis. In most cases the volume measurements can be expected to be more precise than traditional 2D methods, such as point counting, because they account for the three-dimensional anisotropy of the rock.

The soil-atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) are studied on two soil types (clay Oxisol and sandy loam Ultisol) over two years (2000-01) in both undisturbed forest and forest recently logged using reduced impact forest management in the Tapajos National Forest, near Santarem, Para, Brazil. In undisturbed forest, annual soil-atmosphere fluxes of N2O (mean ± standard error) were 7.9 ± 0.7 and 7.0 ± 0.6 ng N cm -2 h-1 for the Oxisol and 1.7 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.3 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Ultisol for 2000 and 2001, respectively. The annual fluxes of NO from undisturbed forest soil in 2001 were 9.0 ± 2.8 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Oxisol and 8.8 ± 5.0 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Ultisol. Consumption of CH4 from the atmosphere dominated over production on undisturbed forest soils. Fluxes averaged -0.3 ± 0.2 and -0.1 ± 0.9 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 on the Oxisol and -1.0 ± 0.2 and -0.9 ± 0.3 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 on the Ultisol for years 2000 and 2001. For CO2 in 2001, the annual fluxes averaged 3.6 ± 0.4 μmol m-2 s-1 on the Oxisol and 4.9 ± 1.1 μmol m-2 s-1 on the Ultisol. We measured fluxes over one year each from two recently logged forests on the Oxisol in 2000 and on the Ultisol in 2001. Sampling in logged areas was stratified from greatest to least ground disturbance covering log decks, skid trails, tree-fall gaps, and forest matrix. Areas of strong soil compaction, especially the skid trails and logging decks, were prone to significantly greater emissions of N2O, NO, and especially CH4. In the case of CH4, estimated annual emissions from decks reached extremely high rates of 531 ± 419 and 98 ± 41 mg CH4 m-2 day-1, for Oxisol and Ultisol sites, respectively, comparable to wetland emissions in the region. We calculated excess fluxes from logged areas by subtraction of a background forest matrix or undisturbed forest flux and adjusted these fluxes for the proportional area of ground disturbance. Our calculations suggest that selective logging increases emissions of N2O and NO from 30% to 350% depending upon conditions. While undisturbed forest was a CH4 sink, logged forest tended to emit methane at moderate rates. Soil-atmosphere CO 2 fluxes were only slightly affected by logging. The regional effects of logging cannot be simply extrapolated based upon one site. We studied sites where reduced impact harvest management was used while in typical conventional logging ground damage is twice as great. Even so, our results indicate that for N2O, NO, and CH4, logging disturbance may be as important for regional budgets of these gases as other extensive land-use changes in the Amazon such as the conversion of forest to cattle pasture.","Selective logging; Trace gas; Tropical forest","Conventional logging; Harvest management; Logging disturbance; Selective logging; Trace gas; Tropical forest; Undisturbed forests; Wetland emissions; Carbon dioxide; Land use; Methane; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Soil mechanics; Soils; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77249133646

This environment offers opportunities that lead down many environmental paths and opens up economic conditions for marketplace advancement of renewable energy sources. Since 2000, more than 1100 MW of wind farm (WF) electrical power has been added or announced to be added to the Texas electrical grid. New Mexico is now experiencing the benefits of renewable energy, with more than 200 MW being installed by the end of 2003. New Mexico has even entered the marketplace with wind power crossing the borders of ERCOT in a daring bid to power the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) own laboratory in Houston with Green-e tagged blocks of renewable energy from Clovis, NM. Oklahoma will install more than 175 MW, finally opening its door to what could be a most notable crossroads in wind power development. Now, overlay major environmental issues of another kind in water pollution and air pollution issues in rural and metropolitan areas coupled with changes in the national emissions inventory. The effect is that three new target areas come in the picture. These are concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) with new rules as of March 2003, publicly owned treatment works (POTW) who must now report emissions in more detail, and municipal solid waste landfills (MSW-LF) with the 2004 changes in landfill design of “bioreactors.” These older facilities create more than 500 million tons of manure, more than 110 million tons of municipal solid waste and more than 50 million tons of human waste for treatment. With more than 650 million tons of waste, energy projects on small and large scales are possible. The logistics are straight forward, and management in the industry does not always understand needs and methodology that must be followed to be a successful.

Building on its relationship with landowners in the United States where 70 percent of the land is in private hands, DU aggregates credits associated with the carbon/GHG (greenhouse gas) sequestered as a result of land restoration. As a result, DU can function as an offset provider, offering opportunities for energy companies to invest in its conservation projects as a way of offsetting power plant GHG emissions. Terrestrial sequestration is the enhancement of the uptake of CO2 by plants that grow on land and in fresh water, and very importantly, the enhancement of carbon storage in soils where it may reside more permanently. The primary focus of terrestrial carbon sequestration is land-use and ecosystem management at the landscape or regional scale, based on the premise that this approach offers the greatest potential for enhancing carbon storage in terrestrial systems.

Aging institutional buildings, especially those within extensive central campuses, cannot easily be disposed of or abandoned in favour of new facilities. Demolition followed by reconstruction is one alternative, however, this is highly disruptive and often these buildings are historically designated or their replacement value cannot be afforded. This paper examines the application of the CBIP Screening Tool software to help assess the issues, alternatives and strategies for sustaining institutional facilities within the context of an established campus at the University of Toronto, Canada's largest public university. The St. George campus of the University of Toronto is located on a 65-hectare site in the heart of the city and serves an academic community of some 8,000 faculty and staff, and more than 43,000 full and part-time students. Approximately 150 buildings comprise over 1 million square metres of occupied space, ranging in age from 145 years to the present, with a mean age of 75 years. Decades of government under-funding to the educational sectors in the province of Ontario have resulted in the neglect of proper maintenance, repair and replacement of building fabrics and equipment. As a result, an overwhelming backlog of deferred maintenance continues to financially burden the academic community, both in terms of maintenance and operating budgets. Further, this stock of buildings, which exhibits high non-renewable energy consumption patterns, continues to impair national goals to achieve greenhouse gas reductions under the Kyoto Accord. Research undertaken to identify sustainable future scenarios for the management of institutional facilities focuses on prudent investments in energy conservation measures integrated within necessary expenditures aimed at addressing a deferred maintenance deficit. The CBIP Screening Tool software developed by Natural Resources Canada was employed on a fleet averaged model and the results fed into a life cycle cost analysis to assess the cost effectiveness of various energy conservation strategies that also contribute to the restoration and improved durability of fabrics and equipment. Results presented in this paper indicate that while it is not possible in the short term to improve the energy efficiency of existing institutional facilities to a level approaching that of new buildings, significant improvements can be realized in the medium to long term, such that their economic and environmental viability can be sustained without compromising present needs.",,"Academic community; Averaged models; Conservation strategies; Consumption patterns; Energy conservation measures; Greenhouse gas reductions; Institutional building; Life cycle cost analysis; Mean ages; Non-renewable energy; Ontario; Operating budgets; Public universities; Screening tool; Short term; Sustainability strategies; University of Toronto; Education; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Repair; Societies and institutions; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869793890

The retrieval of SO 2 SCD in the UV spectral region is difficult due to strong and interfering ozone absorptions. It is also likely affected by instrumental effects. We investigated these effects in detail to obviate systematic biases in the SO 2 retrieval.

Independent operators have identified produced water as a major constraint in the production of hydrocarbons. The costs of lifting, separating, handling, treating and disposing of this water are substantial. In addition to the economic burden it imposes, water can also directly reduce hydrocarbon production. With these thoughts in mind and as partial fulfillment of a U. S. Department of Energy contract, the Petroleum Technology Transfer Council (PTTC) developed a manual as a reference source to assist independent operators in dealing with produced water. The manual addresses different technologies used for different water production issues operators face throughout the life cycle of a well. Many workshops conducted by PTTC have dealt with topics related to this subject. Much of the information in this manual was compiled from these workshop materials. The manual can be downloaded from the National PTTC website at http://www.pttc.org/pwn/produced_water.htm. Also attendees at the presentation will receive a CD of the manual and the updated slides of the presentation. This paper will address some specific items in the manual but not all.

This study attempts to estimate the environmental performance of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), from agricultural production through the PHA fermentation and recovery process - 'cradle to gate'. Two types of PHA production systems are investigated: corn grain based PHA and corn grain and corn stover based PHA. Methods. Corn cultivation data are taken from 14 counties in the Corn Belt states of the United States - Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The environmental burdens associated with the corn wet milling process, in which dextrose, corn oil, corn gluten meal and corn gluten feed are produced, are allocated to dextrose and its coproducts by the system expansion approach. Greenhouse gases include carbon taken up by soil, nitrous oxide (N2O) released from soil during corn cultivation, carbon contents in biobased products as well as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide released from industrial processing. The soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in corn cultivation are predicted by an agro-ecosystem model, the DAYCENT model. The environmental performance of the PHA production system is compared to that of a conventional polymer fulfilling an equivalent function. The environmental performance is addressed as nonrenewable energy and selected potential environmental impacts including global warming, photochemical smog, acidification, and eutrophication. The characterization factors are adapted from the TRACI model (Tools for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts) developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Results and Discussion. Global warming associated with corn grain based PHA is 1.6-4.1 kg-CO2 eq. kg-1. The primary contributing process to most environmental impacts except for photochemical smog and eutrophication is the PHA fermentation and recovery process. For photochemical smog and eutrophication, the primary contributing process is corn cultivation due to nitrogen related burdens from soil. The trend of PHA fermentation development shows that the PHA fermentation technology is still immature and continues to improve, thereby also decreasing the environmental impacts. PHA produced in an integrated system, in which corn stover is harvested and used as raw material for PHA along with corn grain, offers global warming credits (negative greenhouse gas emissions), ranging from -0.28 to -1.9 kg-CO 2 eq. kg-1, depending on the PHA fermentation technologies employed and significantly reduces the environmental impacts compared to corn based PHA. The significant reductions from the integrated system are due to 1) less environmental impacts in corn cultivation and wet milling, and 2) exporting surplus energy from lignin-rich residues in corn stover process. Conclusions and Outlook. Under the current PHA fermentation technology, corn grain based PHA does not provide an environmental advantage over polystyrene. Corn grain based PHA produced by the near future PHA fermentation technology would be more favorable than polystyrene in terms of nonrenewable energy and global warming due to improvement in the PHA fermentation and recovery process. However, corn grain based PHA produced in even the near future technology does not provide better profiles for other environmental impacts (i.e., photochemical smog, acidification and eutrophication) than polystyrene. One of the primary reasons for high impacts of PHA in photochemical smog, acidification and eutrophication is the environmental burdens associated with corn cultivation. Thus other approaches to reduce these burdens in the agricultural process (e.g., use of buffer strips, etc.) are necessary to achieve better profiles for photochemical smog, acidification and eutrophication associated with corn cultivation. PHA produced in the integrated system is more favorable than polystyrene in terms of most environmental impacts considered here except for eutrophication. © 2005 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Biopolymers; Corn; Corn stover; Pha; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Soil organic carbon; Wet milling","biopolymer; carbon; carbon dioxide; corn oil; glucose; gluten; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polystyrene; agroecosystem; conference paper; corn; environmental impact; eutrophication; fermentation; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; model; no tillage; organization; photochemical smog; priority journal; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344362177

According to the report by Inter-governmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), one of the main factors of the uncertainties are from lack of understanding the process between aerosols and clouds. In order to accelerate the understandings of the process, observation of the aerosol over land is crucial. On the other hand, from the monitoring point of view, we do not have sufficient data to distinguish the effect of human activities on and near the land. The results of previous mission; ADEOS-2 Global Imager (GLI) suggests the 1 km ground resolution is not enough for distinguish the effect of human activities, such as deforestation, land cover change, pollution in coastal area, and so on. In this study, we designed a new sensor of which main ground resolution is 250 m, has wide spectral range (0.38-12 miron), rather wide swath for global observation and polarimetry function. The sensor named Second generation GLI (SGLI) consists of two sensors. The first one is conventional push broom type imager for visible and near infrared region with polarimetry channels. The second one is whisk broom sensor for shortwave and thermal infrared. SGLI has 11 channels in VNIR and 6 channels in infrared at nadir position, 2 channels with 3 polarization angles for polarimetry. The total mass of the sensor is around 400 kg.

Natural variations in the global climate have occurred irregularly throughout history. Modern climatic models suggest that not only will this phenomenon continue in the future, but larger magnitudes and higher frequencies of variability are likely due to human influences. Furthermore, it has been postulated that the increasing concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases could result in regional changes of soil moisture, runoff, mean sea level, and the potential for severe climatic events (extreme hurricanes, floods, droughts, etc). The climate change / variability phenomenon, because of its potential to exert significant influence on water availability, the economy, and human society as a whole, has drawn considerable attention from the scientific community and government agencies worldwide. In response to growing concerns, we are attempting to expand our understanding of the relationship between land-use heterogeneities, water availability, and climate change / variability in the southeastern United States. Specifically, this paper describes the coupling and validation of a hydrologic / forest productivity model (PnET-II3SL) with a hydrologic / agricultural productivity model (SWAT) to better represent the hydrologic response characteristics of large spatial areas. The resulting model is capable of generating more scientifically sound predictions of the effects of climate change / variability, with regards to water availability, in the heterogeneous watersheds of the southeastern United States. Validation efforts are described, utilizing long-term historical records, for 15 experimental watersheds. Selected sites represent a diversity of climatic regimes, topographic conditions, soil types, area, and vegetal species. Furthermore, validation efforts focus on evaluations of model robustness to changes in management practices and factors such as biological adaptation.

The operation of a locomotive, for obvious reasons, is dependent upon the use of these forms of petroleum hydrocarbons, and leaks, spills and accidents are unavoidable in many cases. Nevertheless, these releases may be regulated by state environmental agencies. In Massachusetts, for example, the regulations governing the cleanup of releases of oil and hazardous materials-the so-called Massachusetts Contingency Plan, 310 CMR 40.000-do not exempt the railroad industry from remediating spills in excess of the 10-gallon Reportable Quantity'. Cleanup of spills along active rail lines, however, can be quitechallenging. Rail traffic presents significant dangers to remediation personnel. Moreover,although excavation of contaminated soils is often the most expedient method for remediatinga spill, this option is not always available at sites along active lines, particularly those with noalternative routes, as interruption of rail traffic is not economically acceptable for the railcompany or its clientele. At the 2001 International Conference on Contaminated Soils,Sediments and Water, the authors presented the preliminary results of a bioremediationprogram that was implemented at the Palmer Railroad Yard to address the release of 700gallons of diesel fuel along 1,000 linear feet of railroad tracks. The initial results of theproject were inconclusive; however, in the intervening period additional inoculation,fertilization and wetting of the affected soils has produced a reduction of soil petroleumhydrocarbon concentrations to levels that are less than the regulatory cleanup standards,thereby allowing site closure. In this paper we will present the details of the additionalremediation activities undertaken at the site since 2001 and report on the final analyticalresults to make the case for using this remediation approach successfully at other activerailroad sites. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","background conditions; cleanup timeframe; inoculation; rail traffic",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889966285

Some of the technology enhancements to gas-based direct reduction during the evolutionary period include larger capacity shaft furnaces, in-situ reforming, increased heat recovery, improved reformer catalysts, and hot briquetting. The most recent improvements include increased reduction temperature, energy efficiency and other process/equipment improvements that will be implemented in the current modules under construction and will have corresponding benefits. While there is still room for further optimization of gas-based DR technology and greater productivity through optimization of the current state-of-the-art features, new and significant advancements will be increasingly difficult to implement. Product (DRI) applications, however, are tremendous and substantially untapped sources of improvement. Issues such as DRI-to-liquid steel yield, chemistry, nitrogen reduction, carbon content and temperature can be improved much further as the links between DR plant and melter are optimized. The current focus of Hot DRI (HDRI) for continuous transport and charging will result in a significant step forward for mills wishing to boost throughput and reduce operating costs. Numerous projects are underway or planned to take advantage of continuously fed 700° C HDRI in adjacent EAF melt shops. Hot transport options by conveyor, container and gravity (HOTLINK®) will assure that nearly all configurations will find a solution, whether brownfield or greenfield. The next frontier for gas-based direct reduction, however, looks beyond conventional discontinuous liquid steelmaking. The most promising application of Hot DRI is to integrate it with a continuous steelmaking operation such that the best features of gas-based direct reduction technology and advanced rotary hearth technology are melded into a new process. By feeding the 2-3% carbon hot DRI from a MIDREX HOTLINK® module directly to an ITmk3®-type Rotary Hearth furnace as the ""finisher"", it should be possible to produce a continuous stream of high temperature steel nuggets made from virgin iron ore and natural gas. This patented process technology by Midrex is known as KWIKSTEEL®. The first generation of KWIKSTEEL® should be able to efficiently convert iron ore pellets/lump to produce a merchant steel nugget. Future generations of KWIKSTEEL® will have developed a continuous link of hot steel nuggets into a custom melter for continuous production of liquid steel without the need for oxygen or a strong power grid. Currently test work is being conducted at Midrex's Research and Development Center in Charlotte, with plans to introduce the KWIKSTEEL® technology commercially by the end of the decade.","Direct Reduction; EAF Dust; FASTEEL™; FASTMELT®; FASTMET®; FASTOx™; Gas-Based DRI; HOTLINK™; Iron Oxide; ITmk3®; KWIKSTEEL™; Rotary Hearth Furnace; Steel Mill Waste; Zinc Recovery","Energy efficiency; Furnaces; Optimization; Reduction; Waste heat utilization; EAF Dust; Rotary Hearth Furnace; Steel Mill Waste; Zinc Recovery; Steelmaking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644938071

These questions are not new. Roughly 70 years ago, Aldo Leopold set down his ideas on this matter in ""A Conservation Ethic"" (an early version of his more famous ""Land Ethic"" essay). Using the wildlife conservation movement as an example, Leopold suggested, ""At the inception of the movement fifty years ago, its underlying thesis was to save species from extermination. The means to this end were a series of restrictive enactments⋯ The whole structure was negative and prohibitory."" Leopold went on to argue that a new ""positive and affirma-tory ideology"" was developing in the 1930s, ""the thesis of which is to prevent the deterioration of the environment"" through ""ecological research"" and the ""same tools and skills already used in agriculture and forestry"" (1933, p. 641). But Leopold contended that knowledge and ability had to be accompanied by a willingness to use them: ""A rare bird or flower need remain no rarer than the people willing to venture their skill in building it a habitat"" (his emphasis). It is the question of how to create this willingness that Leopold explores in his subsequent essay, ""Land Ethic"" (1949). The essence of a land ethic was the belief that a ""thing is right if it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise"" (p. 262). This belief required changing ""the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such"" (p. 240). Roughly twenty years after Leopold's death, President Richard Nixon delivered a special message to Congress in which he declared that an ""environmental awakening"" had led to a ""new maturity of American public life. It is working a revolution in values, as commitment to responsible partnership with nature replaces cavalier assumptions that we can play God with our surroundings and survive"" (Nixon 1974, p. 174). The task ahead, Nixon continued, was to ""crystallize"" this awakening ""into permanent patterns of thought and action"" that created a ""new and higher environmental way of life."" As a step toward accomplishing this task, he called on Congress to enlarge and strengthen federal policy in regard to endangered species. Congress responded a year later with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). In the early 1970s, there was certainly reason to believe that the basic components of Leopold's land ethic were taking shape in the United States. Though still incomplete, the knowledge and skills needed for ecological management were far more developed than in the 1930s, and the apparent widespread political support for environmental protection efforts seemed to indicate that a willingness was also developing. Now, roughly thirty years later, the national political climate is more difficult to read. Opinion polls continue to show relatively strong public support for environmental protection efforts. In fact, some of these polls contain rather surprising results. For instance, in one recent national survey, 55 percent of the respondents disagreed with the statement ""Plants and animals exist primarily for human use,"" and 88 percent agreed with the statement, ""Humans have an ethical obligation to protect plant and animal species"" (Steele and Lovrich 1997, p. 10). In another survey, 59 percent of the respondents agreed with the statement ""Protecting the environment should be given priority, even at the risk of slowing down economic growth"" (p. 13). At the same time, opposition to environmental protection efforts has also grown, resulting in a natural resource policy arena that is mired in acrimony and gridlock. Particularly troublesome in this regard is the failure of Congress to reauthorize the ESA since 1992. There are a variety of factors that help explain the current controversy over the ESA. The one of primary importance to this project, however, was triggered by the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that extended the ESA to private property. It seems likely that the task of extending species protection to private property would be problematical at any time, but it is even more difficult in our current political climate. Opponents of environmental regulations challenge the extent to which governmental policy may violate constitutionally guaranteed protection of private property rights. On the face of it, the approach proposed in this project would seem to provide an appropriate response. The use of incentives recognizes the potential clash between species protection and private property rights. More important, offering compensation for endangered species protection may be an expedient in ensuring some measure of compliance with the law. In theory, it affords a way to create an economic value for endangered species and thereby alters the decisional calculus so that the benefits of compliance with the ESA outweigh the benefits of opposition to it. The argument we want to advance in this essay, however, is that the controversies over the ESA, and environmental protection in general, remind us that financial loss or gain is not the only measure of economic well-being. Consider, for example, environmental historian Samuel Hays's assessment of opposition to environmental protection efforts in the year after World War II (Hays 1985). Noting that this opposition was ""persistent, often uncompromising, and many times successful,"" Hays suggests, ""At the root of these controversies was not just 'interest' in the conventional sense of an economic stake but values. The economic interest of producers undergirded their opposition. But at a deeper level of human response was the degree to which producers' values were offended. They could not accept the notion that what environmentalists thought was useful and valuable was, in fact, so"" (pp. 529-530). Building on this assessment, we want to argue that much more is at stake in both species protection and land use than the financial value attached to each. We believe it is not merely financial well-being that many private property owners seek to protect but a way of life, for which no financial incentive or compensation may be adequate. In pursuing this argument, we will sketch out the reasons why we believe that environmental controversies are best understood in terms of ways of life. We then offer some tentative suggestions, drawing on the historical roots of concepts like economy, ecology, and property, on how it might be possible to add extra texture to the discourse of the incentive approach by making it more attentive to the cultural factors shaping the values that connect people to the land and each other. © 2005 by The University of Texas Press.

Various types of uncertainty plague climate change simulation, which is, in turn, a crucial element of Earth System modelling. Since the currently preferred strategy for simulating the climate system, or the Earth System at large, is the coupling of sub-system modules (representing, e.g. atmosphere, oceans, global vegetation), this paper explicitly addresses the errors and indeterminacies generated by the coupling procedure. The focus is on a comparison of forced dynamics as opposed to fully, i.e. intrinsically, coupled dynamics. The former represents a particular type of simulation, where the time behaviour of one complex systems component is prescribed by data or some other external information source. Such a simplifying technique is often employed in Earth System models in order to save computing resources, in particular when massive model inter-comparisons need to be carried out. Our contribution to the debate is based on the investigation of two representative model examples, namely (i) a low-dimensional coupled atmosphere-ocean simulator, and (ii) a replica-like simulator embracing corresponding components. Whereas in general the forced version (ii) is able to mimic its fully coupled counterpart (i), we show in this paper that for a considerable fraction of parameter- and state-space, the two approaches qualitatively differ. Here we take up a phenomenon concerning the predictability of coupled versus forced models that was reported earlier in this journal: the observation that the time series of the forced version display artificial predictive skill. We present an explanation in terms of nonlinear dynamical theory. In particular we observe an intermittent version of artificial predictive skill, which we call on-off synchronization, and trace it back to the appearance of unstable periodic orbits. We also find it to be governed by a scaling law that allows us to estimate the probability of artificial predictive skill. In addition to artificial predictability we observe artificial bistability for the forced version, which has not been reported so far. The results suggest that bistability and intermittent predictability, when found in a forced model set-up, should always be cross-validated with alternative coupling designs before being taken for granted. © 2005 Author(s).

When the interstitium is applied as a zoning device in communities, this dynamic extension of the solar envelope can support the ritual use of space for energy, comfort and choice.",,"Building sites; Dynamic extension; Interstitial space; Size and shape; Solar access; Zoning; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870539575

These issues are also important aspects of Swedish energy policy. In Sweden, the district heating (DH) sector has commonly been used to achieve Swedish energy policy goals. However, the ongoing integration and deregulation of the energy markets in Europe now means that the Swedish DH sector can also play an important role in achieving international targets. This thesis investigates the extent to which the Swedish DH sector can contribute to compliance with current energy policy targets, both international and Swedish. The study consisted of simulations of the Swedish DH sector response to various policy instruments in a model that takes the local features of virtually all Swedish DH systems into account. The findings show, for example, that there is great potential for combined heat and power (CHP) generation in the Swedish DH sector. By exporting this CHP electricity to other European countries with less effective and fossil dependent power generation plants, the CO 2 emissions from the European energy sector could be substantially reduced. This would also result in increased security of supply and competitiveness in the EU, since fuel use would be more effective. In Sweden, increased CHP generation would also be a way of maintaining an effective national security of supply of power.","Combined heat and power; District heating; System analysis; Tradable emission permits; Tradable green certificates","Combined heat and power; Tradable emission permits; Tradable green certificates; District heating; Energy management; Energy policy; Marketing; Mathematical models; Systems analysis; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29344471850

This location has a variety of advantages including cost savings, transportation savings, improved environmental emissions, and improved electric supply. Although coke is an absolutely essential part of the iron making process, currently there is a shortfall of 5.50 million tons of coke per year in the United States. This approach offers a partial resolution of this formidable problem through the use of local coal supplies in a mine mouth, environmentally friendly, high efficiency coking/coal gasification facility which could significantly reduce the inadequacy of the coke supply and production, while, at the same time, reducing the cost for the steel industry. Such a high efficiency coking facility would also produce electricity for sale to the wholesale electric market, thereby reducing costs and environmental emissions and, at the same time, enhancing electric system reliability, The coke production process would take place near a local coal mine and, hence, would afford a transportation savings because a large portion of coal used by the coking facility would not have to be transported over a long distance, The coke produced from Illinois Basin coal is smaller in size than conventional metallurgical coal, but it would be usable in various applications and thereby reduce the need for conventional metallurgical coal. At times transportation costs exceed the cost of the coal itself, Total transportation cost would be reduced, since coke is less dense than coal, This process would transport coke, which is less dense, over the longer distances and would result in a cost savings from the reduced weight per mile of material being transported.

Initially, explorations and production of oil and gas were land-based, but are now entirely in the marine environment, since the late sixties. In 1981, the first of a series of quantitative environmental assessment studies was carried out on the nearshore marine environment at the crude oil terminals at Bintulu, Lutong and Labuan, as well as offshore oilfield platforms - Temana A, Temana B, West Lutong a, B & C. It was not the company's intention right from the beginning to assess every living resource in area of its operations, but through carefully selected parameters that were relevant and effects that are measurable as indicator for environmental stress. The resource selected for quantitative study was the macrobenthic communities, which are important indicators of water quality. The individual is referred to as macrobenthos. These macrobenthos are relative long-lived and do not move far away once they have settled in a particular area. In the first environmental assessment study in 1981, an impact-reference sampling design was adapted because of the absence of historical baseline data for the macrobenthic community. Reference sites were chosen to be as similar as possible, in term of exposure and geomorphology, to impacted sites. In subsequent assessment studies, reference sites may not be necessary. Three environmental assessment studies are used to illustrate the use of macrobenthos as pollution indicators in Shell Malaysia EP operational areas. The first case is the use of oil-based mud at Erb West oil field at water depth of 60m. Predrill and post-drill environmental assessments were performed. The macrobenthic community was drastically reduced within the 100m from drilling center. This reduction correlated with the elevated level of hydrocarbons. The second case was the effects of effluent discharge from Labuan crude oil terminal, one of the first sites chosen by Shell Malaysia EP for environmental assessment in 1981. This site was again studied in 1993 and 2004. The changes observed in the structure of the macrobenthic community in these 3 studies showed a pattern similar to that of organisms responding to organic enrichment. The analysis of the macrobenthos data indicated the site studied there has improved from a polluted environment in 1981 and 1993, to one of a much cleaner environment in 2004. The third case was the recovery of intertidal macrobenthos from crude oil spilled from Bintulu crude oil terminal in 1996. The analysis of the macrobenthos data indicated the recovery of the macrobenthos within three months in exposed intertidal zone, but more than a year in enclosed bay. It is very important that raw data of any environmental studies be included in the reports, which are accessible for review.

Risk reduction for existing NPOESS instruments, including mitigation of daytime CO2 SWIR non-LTE effects, is also a high priority. We have proposed an NPOESS Instrument Of Opportunity (IOO) to address these priorities. It consists of two grating mapping spectrometers (GMSs). One that would acquire measurements with high spectral resolution Δv &lt; 0.13 cm-1 of CH4, CO and H2O absorption lines in reflected sunlight in the VSWIR region 4281 to 4301 cm-1, and another for measurements with Δv &lt; 0.30 cm-1 in the SWIR region 2355 to 2430 cm -1. The IOO will acquire spectra on a crosstrack swath from nadir to 55 degrees (about 1400 km on the ground) on footprints that are about 1.55 and 3.1 km on a side at nadir for the two GMS, respectively. The small footprint facilitates cloud screening, and identification of pollution hotspots. We use linear error analysis (LEA, based on the Rodgers [1] paper) to estimate the proposed IOO's performance. The LEA indicates that the IOO should be able to provide CH4 and CO column retrieval over sunlit land (and from ocean glitter when it is viewed) that satisfies or exceeds NPOESS P3I Environmental Data Records (EDRs) requirements in all aspects except refresh where the IOO would provide every two days vs the once per day requirement. Further, it shows the VSWIR IOO data when used in combination with the NPOESS Cross Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) [2] data should provide: (a) CO profile data with sensitivity to CO in near surface air that is enhanced compared to that in the current TERRA-MOPITT, ACQUA-AIRS and AURA-TES data sets because these are limited to thermal infrared measurements that lack sensitivity to CO in near surface air layer where there is little contrast between the air temperature and the ground surface temperature, (b) CH4 profile with sensitivity in the near surface air layer that is crucial for identifying CH4 sources/sinks (c) and significant improvement in the CrIS retrieved humidity in the near surface layer of air.

This methodology allows to facilitate the specification of different kinds of systems and to have a better readability. It also permits to separate the study of the different parts by using the most appropriate existing tools for each of them. Following this idea, we are particularly interested in the notion of running modes and in the Scade tool. Scade is a graphical development environment coupling data processing and state machines (modeled by the synchronous languages Lustre and Esterel). It can be used to specify, simulate, verify and generate C code. However, this tool does not follow any design methodology, which often makes difficult the understanding and the re-use of existing applications. We will show that it is also difficult to separate control and data flow parts using Scade. Regulation systems are better specified using mode-automata which allow adding an automaton structure to data flow specifications written in Lustre. When we observe the mode-structure of the mode-automaton, we clearly see where the modes differ and the conditions for changing modes. This makes it possible to better understand the behavior of the system. In this work, we try to combine the advantages of Scade and running modes, in order to develop a new design methodology which facilitates the study of several systems by respecting the separation between control and data flows. This schema is illustrated through the Climate case study suggested by Esterel Technologies1, in order to exhibit the benefits of our approch compared to the one advocated in Scade. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Approximation theory; Computer aided software engineering; Computer programming languages; Control systems; Data flow analysis; Data processing; Laws and legislation; Separation; Design methodology; Mode-automata; Scade; State machines; Synchronous reactive systems; Automata theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24344481358

Medical wastes are considered as a hazardous waste because they contain toxic materials, infectious, or non-infectious wastes and they are considered as a hazard to millions of patients, health care workers, and visitors. Treatment processes for medical wastes comprise autoclaving, microwaving, chemical disinfection, irradiation, plasma system, and incineration. Incineration is a thermal process, which destroys most of the waste including microorganisms. Combustion process must be under controlled conditions to convert wastes containing hazardous materials into mineral residues and gases. Hospital waste incinerators may emit a number of pollutants depending on the waste being incinerated. These pollutants include particulate matter, acid gases, toxic metals, and toxic organic compounds products of incomplete combustion, e.g., dioxins, furans, and carbon monoxide, as well as sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. So, there should be a reduction of emissions of most of these pollutants by air pollution control devices. This study was conducted in 51 medical establishments (ME) in Alexandria. To evaluate its incinerators. It was found that only 31.4% of total ME have their own incinerators to treat their medical waste.

The engine control seems to be a promising solution for this issue. Indeed, it is based on the optimisation of the engine operating conditions. Its development is made under engine transient operations, using experimental test-beds or numerical simulations. This last method requires however complex and sophisticated 1D system simulation software, due to the dynamic interactions between all the engine sub-systems. This paper presents the interest of using a 1D physical combustion model for gasoline transient engine applications instead of traditional empirical models. The proposed model, called CFM-1D, is based on the 3D gasoline combustion model ECFM [1]. In this model, the combustion chamber is divided into two zones: the burned and unburned gases. These 2 zones are separated by a premixed turbulent flame, which is modelled using a 1D adaptation of the 3D flame surface density approach [1]. This combustion model is validated comparing 1D and 3D results on an engine steady state operating condition. Then, using experimental results, a validation on a wide range of engine steady state conditions is performed. Finally, an application to a transient simulation of a turbo-charged gasoline direct injection engine is proposed to demonstrate the validity of this approach.

Its complexity in part ultimately results from the properties of the phase diagram of water, and in part from the appreciable latent heat involved in the change from one phase to the other. Transport of water is therefore closely linked with the transport of energy and the operation of the hydrologic cycle is closely related to the climate controls on the hydrologic cycle. The cycle evolves with strong feedbacks which regulate the climate in an important manner (Peixoto and Oort, 1992; Pierrehumbert, 2002). An example of a possible extreme climate, resulting from changes in the manner of coupling between the atmosphere and the water reservoirs, is the concept of a 'Snowball Earth', put forward by Hoffman et al. (1998). The discipline of hydrology, earlier directed principally for aiding in better water utilization and conservation, is now under great pressure from several academic directions (cf. Allen and Ingram, 2002) to resolve important questions: for example, how small changes in solar insolation (Lean et al., 1995, Pang and Yau, 2002) are possibly amplified by the hydrological cycle to produce the well-documented paleoclimates recorded by a great varieties of climate proxies. Tracers provide a convenient way of obtaining space-time integrals of motion of ""water"" molecules over both large and small ranges of space and time. It is now well recognized that several stable, as well as naturally and artificially produced radioactive isotopes can be used to study the hydrologic cycles, which is a subset of their wider applications in all dynamic reservoirs of the geosphere (Craig, 1961; Lal and Peters, 1967; Stuiver and Braziunas, 1989; IAEA, 1992; Phillips, 1994; 1995; Clark and Fritz, 1997; Lal, 1999). The great attraction of tracers of different halflives and chemical properties in geophysical/geochemical studies lies in the fact that they allow integration of complex fluid motion over very different space and time scales. To illustrate the power of tracers, one can cite the example of the great advance which occurred in our understanding of the atmospheric processes in the fifties, when artificial radionuclides were introduced in the atmosphere as a result of nuclear weapons tests. The 1954 spring Castle thermonuclear test introduced a large amount of artificial 3H (tritium: half-life = 12.3 years) in the atmosphere. Studies of its concentrations in rains clearly showed that it was removed from the atmosphere in periods as short as weeks, and provided insight into many hydrologic processes and their time scales (Begemann and Libby, 1957). In this paper, the main emphasis will be on the applications of cosmogenic nuclides, i.e. those produced on the Earth, with a brief review of their applications as tracers in the past and of recent advances. It must of course be realized that for a complete understanding of hydrologic processes, one has to use multiple tracers to characterize the state of the system as it evolves with climate; it is a well-nested problem involving the Sun, the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. Cosmogenic tracer studies must therefore be integrated with other tracers, and all supplementary information, to characterize the system's state in the past. © 2005 IEA.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44749084837

They damage woody plants due to chilling temperatures in the tropics, by freezing sensitive plants in regions with episodic frosts and temperatures down to -10 °C, and by freezing of even tolerant plants in regions with cold winters below - 10 and -40 °C. The wide range of frost resistances in plants from different climatic zones indicates that the ability to become hardened to freezing has evolved in a stepwise process. There are opinions how an evolutionary acquisition of freezing tolerance could have taken place in the following way: First there is a differentiation of better adapted ecotypes and in the long term a series of functional plant groups develop along climatic gradients. Frequent climatic stress and climatic changes stimulate the selection of new genotypes resistant to climatic extremes. Furthermore, plants exposed to multiple stress factors in their habitat acquire a general cross - tolerance to climatic constraints. The objective of this review is the understanding of low temperature resistance in woody plants, e.g. stabilization of biomembranes by lipid composition, deep supercooling, and ability to become freezing tolerant during winter dormancy. An over a hundred year long history of investigating frost stress and survival of different plant species has brought about an important understanding of basic processes. Recently antifreeze proteins which slow the freezing processes, and proteins, which protect the protoplasm against low temperature, frost and dehydration have been discovered. Findings that help to explain the mechanisms for coping with low temperature will be applicable to agriculture, horticulture, forestry and bioclimatology. © 2005, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Each manufacturing brand must not exceed an average 140 g CO2 emission per driven kilometre for the whole fleet of newly produced passenger cars. This figure should be valid from 2008 with an optional extension to 120 g/km from 2012. To meet these pre-conditions, the contribution from body engineering and manufacturing is spelled weight saving. The issue can be summarized in three main groups: • Reduction of the number of parts in the car body • Down-gauging sheet thickness in combination with the introduction of continuous joining methods • Substitution of traditional sheet steels with other lightweight materials One alternative which lately has received attention is to integrate various grades of high strength stainless steels into the body structure. This paper will briefly discuss the overall consequences of introducing such a material, regarding formability, corrosion and impact behaviour etc. From experience we know that outstanding car body properties can only be reached if the choice of materials, body concept and joining methods is done in an integrated process. One obvious challenge for mixed materials scenarios is of course the need to secure a high quality joining process for these material combinations. Therefore the paper will focus on the process feasibility of welding high strength stainless steels to zinc coated Dual Phase (DP) steels in various thickness combinations. Three commonly used assembly techniques for Body-in-White (BIW) manufacturing have been investigated; Resistance Spot Welding (RSW), Laser Beam Welding (LBW) and Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW). Alongside the manufacturing related activities, investigation of these joints at static and fatigue loading have also been tested and recorded. The paper will conclude the results and give recommendations about body components which could be suitable to manufacture in high strength stainless steels concerning a weight savings/cost efficiency ratio. It will also summarize how all the engineering and manufacturing data generated are easily accessed world-wide through the global Join-NET © database, which functions will be briefly described.","Body engineering; Database information; Dual phase steels; Gas metal arc welding; High strength stainless steels; Laser beam welding; Resistance spot welding","Assembly techniques; Automobile manufacturers; Body in whites; Body materials; Body structure; Car bodies; CO2 emissions; Database information; Dual-phase steel; Efficiency ratio; Engineering and manufacturing; Environmental-friendly; European community; Fatigue loadings; Gas metal arc welding (GMAW); High quality; High strength; Impact behaviour; Integrated process; Joining method; Joining process; Know-that; Lightweight materials; Main group; Material combination; Mixed materials; Resistance spot welding; Sheet steel; Sheet thickness; Weight saving; Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Enterprise resource planning; Gas metal arc welding; Joining; Laser beam welding; Loading; Materials; Railroad cars; Resistance welding; Stainless steel; High strength steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873599174

Many engine control systems in production today are based on look-up tables which are calibrated for different operating conditions. Improvements can be done by constructing better control systems to make the engine run in optimal operating conditions more often than conventional control systems are able to do today. One such improvement could be to replace some look-up tables with feedback control of wisely chosen properties of the combustion process. However, even if a promising property is found and quantified it must be measurable either directly or indirectly. Also, the property must be controllable using a suitable actuator. This thesis concentrates on estimating individual cylinder combustion phasing using a torque sensor mounted on a crankshaft. The combustion phasing is quantified using a measure called 50% torque ratio and it is controllable by modifying the spark advance for each cylinder. A control system has been implemented in an engine test bench to be able to test the ideas. Several test cases have been designed to demonstrate the capability of the system to control the combustion phasing individually for each cylinder and to compensate for simulated external disturbances in steady-state conditions. The control system is also equipped with self-optimising functionality by using an extremum seeking controller to detect for which value of the torque ratio that maximises generated work from each cylinder. The resulting implemented control system is capable of maintaining a desired set-point for the torque ratio in steady-state conditions. Transient conditions have not been evaluated. The extremum seeking controller is demonstrated to be able to find a torque ratio for each cylinder which maximises the generated work.","Combustion phasing control; Engine control; Extremum seeking control; Individual cylinder control; Spark-advance control","Combustion phasing control; Engine control; Extremum seeking control; Spark-advance control; Control systems; Engines; Feedback control; Torque; Combustion equipment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29344456742

The JCSDA will ensure that the maximum benefit from investment in space is realised from the advanced global observing system. It will also help accelerate the use of satellite data from both operational and experimental spacecraft for weather and climate related activities. To this end the advancement of data assimilation science by JCSDA has included the establishment of the JCSDA Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and continual upgrades including, the incorporation of AIRS and snow and ice emissivity models for improving the use of microwave sounding data over high latitudes, preparation for use of METOP IASI/AMSU/HSB, DMSP SSMIS and CHAMP GPS data, real-time delivery of EOS-Aqua AMSR-E to NWP centers, and improved physically based SST analyses.

It significantly improves the problems associated with the alternator and wiring harness because of the increase in the current level. The currently developing 42V PowerNet system employs a mild-hybrid concept using the ISG (Integrated Starter and Generator). It features the Idle Stop/Start functions and recovers the regenerative energy during braking to improve the fuel economy and to reduce the emission. In this paper, the control logic for the currently developing 42V system is proposed. Firstly, this work sets the system modeling suitable for the development of the control logic. Secondly, the operation mode (state) that can exist at the vehicle's operation profile and the transient condition among the states are defined. Thirdly, the energy management strategy applied to the developing vehicle is proposed. Finally, it estimates the fuel economy by simulation when the proposed control logic is applied. The developed control logic is implemented and verified for the experimental HEV system. © IEEE.",,"Electric loads; Electric power systems; Electric wiring; Energy management; Fuel economy; Particulate emissions; Power takeoffs; Control logic; Integrated Starter and Generator (ISG); Logic devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744980282

Carbon dioxide capture and storage are essential to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. For CO2 capturing, currently commercial technology using chemical absorption process exists and more improvements are expected in the future. But many options except EOR and EGR are still in R&amp;D stage for CO2 storage. Among different options mineral carbonation seems to be best to apply in Korea due to geological and regional limitations. Comparison of raw materials for magnesium carbonate synthesis was made. Possible candidates as a raw material in Korea are serpentine and talc. After thermal treatment of raw materials for better reactivity, distinct changes in composition, morphology, and structure were detected in raw materials by ICP, XRD, XPS, FT-IR, and TGA. Experimental results of magnesium carbonate synthesis indicate that supercritical carbon dioxide reaction depends mainly on temperature and, to a lesser degree, on pressure. Serpentine appears to be the most promising candidate for mineral carbonation raw material in Korea. © (2005) by the International Pittsburgh Coal Conference.",,"Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Chemical absorption; Commercial technology; In compositions; Magnesium carbonate; Magnesium silicates; Mineral carbonation; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Atmospheric composition; Carbon capture; Carbonates; Global warming; Serpentine; Supercritical fluid extraction; Synthesis (chemical); Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883120257

And membrane hydration is thought to have the largest time constant among all transient phenomena in PEMFCs. However the capillary motion of water in hydrophobic fibrous diffusion media is not well known; therefore, we suggest a pore-scale network model for understanding of GDL water transfer phenomena. A 3-dimensional lattice structure of fibers is generated as a replica of the GDL carbon fiber media. The rules for movement and redistribution of water are formulated in the pressure field within GDL for solving mass conservation equations. The pressure field governs the movement of water front and the flow rates of water and gas within GDL. The quasi-steady invasion percolation (IP) algorithm is proposed for low but non-zero capillary number region, which coincides with the practical operating ranges of PEMFCs. Non-wetting phase front dynamics, apparent saturation and relative permeability are computed for studying of the influence of various physical parameters, like current density, geometry parameters, hydrophobicity.

The variability of the H""2O maser in W31(2) was found to be cyclic, with a mean period of 1.9 yr. Two flares were most intense (superflares): in 1985-1986 and 1998-1999. In each activity cycle, we observed up to several short flares, subpeaks. The fluxes of many emission features during the flares were correlated. We also observed successive activation of individual emission features in order of increasing or decreasing radial velocity, suggesting an ordered structure and, hence, a radial-velocity gradient of the medium. There is a clear correlation of the emission peaks of the main components in the spectra at radial velocities of -1.7, -1.3, 0.5, and 1.3 km s(-1) with activity cycles and of the emission at V(LSR)< -8 km s(-1) with short flares.

The need for agricultural involvement in GHG mitigation has been widely recognized since the 1990s. The concept of C sinks, C credits, and emission trading has attracted special interests in herbaceous and woody species as energy crops and source of biofuel feedstock. Bioenergy crops are defined as any plant material used to produce bioenergy. These crops have the capacity to produce large volume of biomass, high energy potential, and can be grown in marginal soils. Planting bioenergy crops in degraded soils is one of the promising agricultural options with C sequestration rates ranging from 0.6 to 3.0 Mg C ha-1 yr -1. About 60 million hectares (Mha) of land is available in the United States and 757 Mha in the world to grow bioenergy crops. With an energy offset of 1 kg of C in biomass per 0.6 kg of C in fossil fuel, there exists a vast potential of offsetting fossil fuel emission. Bioenergy crops have the potential to sequester approximately 318 Tg C yr-1 in the United States and 1631 Tg C yr-1 worldwide. Bioenergy crops consist of herbaceous bunch-type grasses and short-rotation woody perennials. Important grasses include switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), elephant grass (Pennissetum purpureum Schum.), tall fescue (Fetusca arundinacea L.), etc. Important among short-rotation woody perennials are poplar (Populus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), etc. The emissions of CO2 from using switchgrass as energy crop is 1.9 kg C Gj-1 compared with 13.8, 22.3, and 24.6 kg C Gj-1 from using gas, petroleum, and coal, respectively. Mitigation of GHG emissions cannot be achieved by C sinks alone, a substantial reduction in fossil fuel combustion will be necessary. Carbon sequestration and fossil fuel offset by bioenergy crops is an important component of a possible total societal response to a GHG emission reduction initiative.","Biofuel; Biomass; C sequestration; Greenhouse effect; Poplar; Soil C dynamics; Switchgrass; Willow","elephant; Festuca; Panicum virgatum; Pennisetum glaucum; Pennisetum purpureum; Poaceae; Populus; Populus berolinensis; Prosopis; Salix; Schedonorus arundinaceus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14644386916

To understand the future of air emission regulations for animal feeding operations (AFOs), it is useful to understand the history and impact of the first air regulation on AFOs. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) adopted Rule 1127, Emission Reductions from Livestock Waste, in August 2004; it was the first rule that required dairies to reduce criteria air pollutant precursors. The rule requires dairies to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are precursors to ozone, and ammonia, which is a precursor to aerosol PM10 and PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter, respectively). Key technical and policy issues that arose during the development of Rule 1127 have particular relevance to the future of air emission regulations for AFOs. California Senate Bill (SB) 700, adopted in September 2003, requires California air districts to adopt specific permit and other air regulations for all agricultural operations and AFOs in particular. This paper describes the regulatory history and industry/agency working group process. The regulatory history, most of which predates SB 700, includes the development and evolution of the livestock waste control measure from SCAQMD's 1989 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) through final rule adoption. The industry/agency working group process began in March 2001 and addressed both technical and policy issues. Key issues that the working group addressed included emission inventory, control technology assessment, cost of controls, industry impacts, beneficial uses of manure, incentives, and the cross-media impacts of control strategies. These issues will affect all future air emission regulations of AFOs throughout the country. Lessons learned and the implications for future air regulations for AFOs are discussed.","Dairy controls; Dairy emissions; Livestock operations; Regulatory policy","Dairy controls; Dairy emissions; Livestock operations; Regulatory policy; Air quality; Coastal zones; Dairies; Farms; Particulate emissions; Regulatory compliance; Agriculture; Air Quality; Animals; Particulate Emissions; Regulations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847396893

The advective supply of methane leads to dense microbial communities with high metabolic rates. Anaerobic methane oxidation presumably coupled to sulphate reduction facilitates formation of carbonates and, in many places, generates extremely high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide in pore waters. Increased food supply, availability of hard substratum and high concentrations of methane and sulphide supplied to free-living and symbiotic bacteria provide the basis for the complex ecosystems found at these sites. This review examines the structures of animal communities in seep sediments and how they are shaped by hydrologic, geochemical and microbial processes. The full size range of biota is addressed but emphasis is on the mid-size sediment-dwelling infauna (foraminiferans, metazoan meiofauna and macrofauna), which have received less attention than megafauna or microbes. Megafaunal biomass at seeps, which far exceeds that of surrounding non-seep sediments, is dominated by bivalves (mytilids, vesicomyids, lucinids and thyasirids) and vestimentiferan tube worms, with pogonophorans, cladorhizid sponges, gastropods and shrimp sometimes abundant. In contrast, seep sediments at shelf and upper slope depths have infaunal densities that often differ very little from those in ambient sediments. At greater depths, seep infauna exhibit enhanced densities, modified composition and reduced diversity relative to background sediments. Dorvilleid, hesionid and ampharetid polychaetes, nematodes, and calcareous foraminiferans are dominant. There is extensive spatial heterogeneity of microbes and higher organisms at seeps. Specialized infaunal communities are associated with different seep habitats (microbial mats, clam beds, mussel beds and tube worms aggregations) and with different vertical zones in the sediment. Whereas fluid flow and associated porewater properties, in particular sulphide concentration, appear to regulate the distribution, physiological adaptations and sometimes behaviour of many seep biota, sometimes the reverse is true. Animal-microbe interactions at seeps are complex and involve symbioses, heterotrophic nutrition, geochemical feedbacks and habitat structure. Nutrition of seep fauna varies, with thiotrophic and methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria fueling most of the megafaunal forms but macrofauna and most meiofauna are mainly heterotrophic. Macrofaunal food sources are largely photosynthesis-based at shallower seeps but reflect carbon fixation by chemosynthesis and considerable incorporation of methane-derived C at deeper seeps. Export of seep carbon appears to be highly localized based on limited studies in the Gulf of Mexico. Seep ecosystems remain one of the ocean's true frontiers. Seep sediments represent some of the most extreme marine conditions and offer unbounded opportunities for discovery in the realms of animal-microbe-geochemical interactions, physiology, trophic ecology, biogeography, systematics and evolution. © R.

Several countries still use leaded gasoline and/or high sulfur fuels, which impair vehicle emission controls or prevent their use. The Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles (PCFV) was created at the United Nations to help developing countries eliminate lead in gasoline, phase down fuel sulfur and concurrently introduce cleaner vehicles as a way to reduce emissions. The PCFV was launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in September 2002 as a public-private collaborative effort designed to help developing countries achieve greater progress towards their air quality goals. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) hosts the partnership Clearinghouse, and its partners consist of governments, industry, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This paper will describe the PCFV approach to helping developing countries advance their policy objectives on cleaner fuels and vehicles. The paper will highlight the critical role and contributions of the auto and oil industries and their respective trade associations. The trade associations, in particular, will be shown to be instrumental to the functioning of such a partnership by facilitating and enabling their members' involvement.

By 2005, the EU had hoped that blended biofuels (conventional diesel and gasoline diluted with fuels sourced from organic materials) would account for 2% of the automotive fuels consumed in the EU. The EU wants biofuels (biodiesel and bioethanol) to account for 5.75% of automotive-fuels consumption by 2010 and by up to 20% by 2020. This policy has two objectives: reducing pollution and increasing security of energy supply by producing the fuel from locally grown crops. Germany has the highest absolute and per capita consumption of biodiesel in the EU because of its favorable tax regime; the country consumed 1.1 million ton in 2004. It is also the largest consumer of conventional diesel, at 30 million ton. The UK, at the bottom of the EU league, consumed just 300,000 ton of biodiesel in 2004.

A Euro 1 emission compliance SI car was tested using a real world urban driving cycle to represent typical city driving patterns and simulate ECE15 urban driving cycle. The test car was equipped with 27 thermocouples along the engine and exhaust pipes so as to measure metal and exhaust gas temperatures along the engine, exhaust and catalyst. The characteristics of thermal properties of engine, exhaust system and catalyst were studied as a function of warm up time and ambient temperature. The temperature and time of the light-off of catalyst were investigated so as to evaluate the effect of thermal properties of the catalyst on emissions. The results show that the coolant water reached the full warm up about 5 minutes in summer and 9 minutes in winter after a cold start. Lubricating oil reached the full warm up in 10 minutes in summer and 14 minutes in winter after a cold start. The light-off time of TWC was about 3 minutes in summer and 6 minutes in winter in terms of catalyst substrate temperatures. The determination of catalyst light off has been studied and discussed in terms of catalyst substrate temperatures and gas temperatures. The ambient temperature had little influence on engine out exhaust gas temperatures. The heat loss from the engine out to the catalyst was at highest level in the first 5∼6 minutes and after this point the heat available at the catalyst was relatively stable. The thermal properties of the engine and exhaust system had significant influence on emissions. The results indicate that in some urban driving conditions such as short journeys in cities especially under cold weather conditions, the function of catalysts for emission reductions is very limited.

Ionization effects at the anode as well as electron space-charge effects are described by Poisson's equation. The numerical calculations are carried out self-consistently to yield the steady states of the bipolar field-emission-limited flow of the FELD.

There is renewed interest in this problem from the rapidly growing field of molecule-based electronics, where the socalled ""contact problem"" is usually probed in transport measurements. Here, we probe interfacial electron transfer/transport using time-resolved two-photon photo-emission spectroscopy. Such an approach allows us to quantitatively measure the energetic alignment of occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals to the metal Fermi level, the electronic coupling strength (or spectral density) between the molecular orbital and the metal substrate, and electronic-nuclear coupling leading to dynamic localization. These three types of information are in fact key ingredients in quantitative theories for electron transfer and transport at molecule-metal surfaces. Recent examples from our laboratory are used to illustrate the point. They include femtosecond dynamics of image potential resonances on heptane-covered Au(111) and exciton relaxation dynamics in C60 epitaxial films on Au(111). On heptane/ Au(111), the lifetime of the n = 1 image potential resonance increases from 52 fs at one monolayer (ML) coverage to 700 fs at 2 ML and 2.8 ps at 3 ML. On C60/Au(111), the Frenkel exciton (involving the LUMO+1 level) couples over long distance to the metal substrate, with lifetime of 350 fs at 30 ML to 80 fs at 2 ML coverage. The film-thickness-dependent decay dynamics in both cases can be attributed to interfacial electron transfer. Fitting the distance-dependent electron transfer rates to a simple exponential function gives the characteristic distance parameter of β = 0.6 ± 0.1 and 0.023 ± 0.005 Å-1 for heptane- and C60-covered Au(111), respectively. The difference in the β parameters illustrates the essential role of the electronic structure of molecules in mediating interfacial electron transfer/transport.",,"fullerene derivative; heptane; silver; chemical reaction; chemical structure; conference paper; electron transport; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; photon correlation spectroscopy; quantitative analysis; reaction analysis; structure analysis; thickness",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21044460172

A thorough understanding on the effects of CO2 on surface properties is in a demand and proves to be a tough challenge. Even for pure polymer, the anomalous dynamic behavior of nanoscale surface from bulk phase was not widely recognized until about a decade ago. In this work, we first investigated the surface Tg behavior of Polystyrene(PS) by the AFM technique we developed. In brief, the gold nanoparticles with uniform size were deposited on polymer surface and then subject to thermal and/or CO2 treatment. By detecting the embedding depth of particles, the condition where the glass transition occurs could be revealed. In this way, we identified the surface Tg of pure PS, and its variation as external CO2 pressure. Meanwhile, we developed an entropy-based thermodynamic model that could satisfactorily describe the characteristics of surface Tg. We applied the Gibbs-Di Marzio glass transition criterion to the polymer surface region where exhibits a density gradient. By using the Sanchez-Lacombe EOS and the Helmholtz excess free energy equation derived in gradient theory, we successfully derived the entropy expression for the surface region. As a result, by searching the temperature where the surface entropy is equal to zero, we identified the surface Tg of monodisperse Polystyrene (MW=214,000) as 62 oC. The result shows excellent agreement with experimental observations and literature values. The gradient profile indicates the thickness of surface region that serves as the source of anomalous dynamics is about 1.5 nm, also reasonably in accordance with experimental findings.

Moreover, the model results show that high NH3 is in Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces, with average concentration of (30-35)×10 -9. The results of the sensitive experiment indicate that high concentration of NH3 has the efficiency of the production of secondary sulfate aerosol increase by more than 30%, especially at the juncture of Handan, Anyang and Changzhi that increased by 50%. In addition, NH 3 also produces secondary ammonia and nitrate aerosol, and the sum of them is approximately equal to sulfate aerosol. The height of planetary boundary layer (PBL) in Beijing is higher in daytime, with average height of 1500 m at noon. This makes SO2, NH3 and HNO3 transported into upper PBL of 850 hPa. The high secondary sulfate, and ammonia and nitrate aerosol happen in the upper and lower PBL, respectively. Because PM 2.5 lifetime is relatively long, it can be transported into the middle troposphere to form a thick aerosol layer, which is the arched roof of aerosol.

However, current commercial production practices that fermentatively produce PHA with pure microbial cultures grown on renewable, but refined, feedstocks (e.g. glucose) under sterile conditions, do not represent a sustainable replacement. Here we report on the commercial production of PHA with a mixed microbial consortium indigenous to an activated-sludge process on carbon present in industrial and municipal wastewaters in a unit-operation configuration completely congruent with wastewater treatment facilities. PHA production averaged 85, 10, and 53% (w/w) on pulp-and-paper mill foul condensate, biodiesel, and municipal wastewaters, respectively, with concurrent substantial reductions in soluble organic carbon and orthophosphate at specific percentages dependent on the type of wastewater. Given the proposed polymer production process arguably eliminates the energy and costs associated with feedstock production and bioreactor operation and further that wastewater treatment is mandated in most countries, results presented herein suggest environmentally benign production of biodegradable polymers is feasible.

Temperatures and CO2 concentrations [CO2] will increase. Also a decline in winter rainfall of up to 30% in 2070 is predicted for south-west Australia. Effects of climate change on cropping systems were simulated with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM-Nwheat) using transformed historic weather data. Fifty years of yield were simulated for three soil types at different locations on a north - south transect within the wheatbelt of south-west Australia. Simulation results showed that there were complex interactions between different aspects of climate change on crop systems. Effects of higher temperatures, elevated [CO2] and changed rainfall were in general not linear and differed significantly between soil types and location. Higher [CO2] increased yield especially at drier sites while higher temperatures especially had a positive effect in the cooler and wetter southern part of the region. The main difference between soil types was that heavier clay soils were most vulnerable to reduced rainfall while sandy soils were more vulnerable to higher temperatures. We tested which changes in crop traits would be a good adaptation to climate change for wheat systems. Earlier flowering varieties can increase production at lower rainfall and ambient temperatures. At increased temperatures a later maturing variety will promote wheat production. On clay soils early vigor did not improve yields for historic and future climate scenarios. Also increased rooting depth did not positively affect yields on clay soils. So the options for adapting cropping systems to climate change on clay seem to be limited. This in combination with the results that yields on clay soils are reduced the most by climate change makes these soils very vulnerable to the impacts of a drying climate. On loamy sand soils however there are plenty of opportunities to adapt cropping systems to climate change. In addition to longer season varieties and early vigor also increased rooting depth can significantly increase yields under future climate change.","APSIM; Climate change; Crop simulation model; Farming systems; Plant traits; Wheat","APSIM; Crop simulation model; Farming system; Plant traits; Wheat; Adaptation to climate changes; Agricultural production system; CO2 concentration; Cropping systems; Future climate scenarios; Impacts and adaptation; Increase productions; Increased temperature; Carbon dioxide; Clay; Computer simulation; Crops; Decision making; Rain; Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Clay; Crops; Decision making; Rain; Climate change; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053109649

The present installed capacity (gross) for electric power generation is 2,564 MWe with about 2,000 MWe net delivering power to the grid producing approximately 17,917 GWh per year for a 80.4% gross capacity factor. Geothermal electric power plants are located in California, Nevada, Utah and Hawaii. The two largest concentrations of plants are at The Geysers in northern California and the Imperial Valley in southern California. The latest development at The Geysers, starting in 1998, is injecting recycled wastewater from two communities into the reservoir, which presently has recovered about 100 MWe of power generation. The second pipeline from the Santa Rosa area has just come on line. The direct utilization of geothermal energy includes the heating of pools and spas, greenhouses and aquaculture facilities, space heating and district heating, snow melting, agricultural drying, industrial applications and ground-source heat pumps. The installed capacity is 7,817 MWt and the annual energy use is about 31,200 TJ or 8,680 GWh. The largest application is ground-source (geothermal) heat pumps (69% of the energy use), and the next largest direct-uses are in space heating and agricultural drying. Direct utilization (without heat pumps) is increasing at about 2.6% per year; whereas electric power plant development is almost static, with only about 70 MWe added since 2000 (there were errors in the WGC2000 tabulation). A new 185-MWe plant being proposed for the Imperial Valley and about 100 MWe for Glass Mountain in northern California could be online by 2007-2008. Several new plants are proposed for Nevada totaling about 100 MWe and projects have been proposed in Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon and Utah. The total planned in the next 10 years is 632 MWe.

The objectives of this study were to explore the alternatives of the existing greenhouse climate control policy under Chinese subtropical climate conditions, through simulation analysis. Based on the calibrated and validated the Greenhouse Process (KASPRO) model using experimental data from a Dutch Venlo-type glass greenhouse in Shanghai, China, scenario studies were carried out to investigate the possible responses of crop biomass production to affordable means of climate management. In this paper we limited the study to greenhouse ventilation capacity, and canopy size, in a greenhouse without injection of CO2. The results show that for a cucumber crop under the summer conditions typical of Shanghai, an average of 26 volume changes per hour is required, which, in view of the prevailing wind speed, is ensured by a ratio of roof window area to greenhouse floor area about 0.3 (it is about 0.1 in Holland, for instance). A LAI of 4 maximizes crop biomass production, when accounting for the balance of assimilation, respiration and also for the evaporative cooling. The results obtained in this study show that many local climate factors must be taken into account for an optimal management of greenhouse design, crop and climate, and that a greenhouse climate simulator is a good tool for this analysis.","Biomass production; Leaf area index; Number of air exchange; Roof opening area",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879931619

Over the same period, fuel economy, measured as miles per gallon, has not improved. These data suggest that technological innovation in vehicles is not lagging but is not being used to improve vehicle fuel economy. This paper quantifies vehicle efficiency improvements in U.S. light-duty vehicles since 1975 as they relate to fuel consumption. Energy efficiency improvements have been strongly positive and relatively constant since 1975. The rapid rise in fuel economy in the late 1970s was due to a mix of efficiency improvements and downgrading of utility in the form of reduced size, power, and elimination of accessories and amenities (such as air conditioning). In contrast, since the mid-1980s, fuel economy has remained constant while the benefits of technological innovation were used to satisfy private desires (more power, size, and amenities), instead of the public interest (reduced greenhouse gas emissions and oil imports). An important policy question is how and to what extent future efficiency innovations might be directed to the public interest.",,"Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Fuel consumption; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Public policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Light duty vehicles; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646400830

Such compounds are present in the effluent from the ballast treatment plant located at the terminal of the TransAlaska Pipeline. The plant processes 10 to 20 million gallons per day (mgd) of ballast water from arriving tankers. The principal organic components found in the treated effluent are benzene, toluene, and xylenes/ethylbenzene. Such volatile aromatic hydrocarbons comprise up to 50 percent of the total organic load in the effluent, and are discharged at a rate of 60 to 80 gallons per day. State regulations limit aromatic hydrocarbon content in waters outside the mixing zone to 10 micrograms per liter concentration. Distribution of the aromatic hydrocarbons in the receiving waters was studied by collecting and analyzing samples at the boundary of the mixing zone and throughout the fjord. Vertical and horizontal transects were designed for sample collection, and a sensitive analytical procedure capable of detecting 0.1 μg/1 of selected aromatic hydrocarbons was developed and used in this study. It was found that the treated effluent does not mix uniformly with the receiving waters of Port Valdez during the summer period of density stratification, at which time the volume of the mixing zone is grossly underutilized and no significant amount of hydrocarbons diffuses into the upper reaches of the water column. Discharged hydrocarbons are contained within a narrow trap zone of maximum concentration which spreads out horizontally 2 to 3 kilometers (km) from the mixing zone in a thin, pancake-like shape. The vertical position of the effluent plume is dependent on prevailing water density conditions: during the early summer it is located at a depth of approximately 50 meters (m), while in late summer it is found at a depth of 65 m, and is contained within 10 m off the bottom in the area of the mixing zone. The concentrations of total volatile aromatic hydrocarbons found on the boundary of the mixing zone were as high as 120 μg/1.

Because its energy density is very low compared to petroleum or coal, the cost of transporting biomass is a significant part of the total biomass cost. For this reason it is usually regarded as a local resource. However, appropriate logistic systems may allow collection of biomass over a large geographical area, thus making it possible to consider efficient, large scale energy conversion systems. For areas without significant water transportation, the basic choices are between truck-based, train-based and pipeline transportation. Previous work has shown that pipeline transport is not effective for biomass delivery due to uptake of carrier fluid (water or oil) by the biomass. Hence, the choice becomes one between train and truck transport. Western Canada has large resources of wood, forest harvest residues (limbs and tops of trees harvested for pulp or lumber), and agricultural residues such as wheat and barley straw. Effective use of these resources requires an economic plant size, determined by a previous study to be 250 MW for a straw-fired power plant or 130 MW for a forest residues plant. For typical Alberta biomass production densities, the collection radius for these bio-energy plants is 495 km for forest residues and 125 km for straw. This study uses a published life cycle analysis (LCA) results to investigate the environmental load for biomass transport to these optimum-sized plants. All biomass starts the journey from field to plant on a truck; this study evaluates the choice between truck-only or a combination of truck plus train transport for this sort of bulky, low value commodity. The study results favor train over truck, with reductions in emissions of 70% or more per tonne km. European economic studies suggest a transition distance at which truck and train transport is more economic than truck only. As an added feature, train transport alleviates a potential problem in truck congestion at biomass processing plants. While this study focuses on biomass-for-energy, a similar approach may be useful for other bulky comodities which requiere transportation from a distributed region to a central plant.

However, this type of regulation does not encourage process improvement and technological research to cut down emissions below compliance levels. On the other hand, market-based models stimulate continued improvement of cleaner manufacturing practices by creating economic incentives for sustained emission reduction. This paper aims at furnishing regulators and manufacturers with a tool to assess the impact of future regulatory scenarios. Two problems still not solved in a systematic fashion are how plant managers should optimally plan under different regulatory scenarios and how regulators should optimally design the regulations. In order to assess the impact of different regulations, this paper proposes a holistic model for commodity chemicals, pharmaceutical and specialties manufacturing operations including standard recycle and treatment options. This proposed work employs realistic chemical engineering models of pollution abatement operations in order to assess the feasibility of a treatment option, estimate its cost and expected emissions. Furthermore, this work introduces rigorous mathematical optimization techniques for designing regional emission reduction efforts at reasonable cost to manufacturers. This approach will offer plant managers a systematic tool to ascertain expected compliance cost of new environmental regulations and regulators a systematic methodology to design regulations considering manufacturers' budgets.",,"Hard emission thresholds; Mathematical optimization; Sustained emission reduction; Chemical engineering; Cost effectiveness; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Optimization; Drug products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645633657

Experiments compared the removal of carbon dioxide from synthetic biogas by an ""in-pond angled gutter"" to that by a simulated ""counter-current pit."" Results showed that the counter current pit has potential for use in biogas scrubbing, with synthetic biogas carbon dioxide composition consistently reduced from 40% to <5%. The in-pond angled gutter was less effective due to bubble coalescence which reduced the total bubble surface area available for gas transfer. Measurement of oxygen levels in the scrubbed biogas showed that despite supersaturation of oxygen in the HRP water, there was little transfer to the biogas, so that explosive methane/oxygen mixtures would not be formed. Theoretical calculations indicated that the amount of biogas likely to be formed during anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater could be scrubbed in the HRP of the same advanced pond system with little influence on HRP pH, algal growth and treatment performance.

Most SME's do not have sufficient resources or technical staff with detailed process safety knowledge. The technical staff in SME's usually wear several hats, with process safety, environmental, health, quality assurance, and perhaps even operational or maintenance responsibilities. How does the small business technical staff gain process safety information in today's fast changing regulatory climate? It is not from formal courses (as they take too much time away from the plant even if they were affordable). It is not from the out-reach programs of the regulatory agencies as their information is either too ""legalese"", too general or incomprehensible to the focused technician. Sometimes biased information is provided by equipment vendors or incomplete local news coverage. Delivering the appropriate process safety information to the worker or designer who most needs the information is the challenge of modern safety profession. Tell me, I may forget Show me, I may remember Involve me and I will understand. While we get caught up in the latest technologies to deliver information, the above adage must be remembered to be effective.

Genetic information obtained from DNA isolated from ANPT formation waters indicates a microbial community comprised of acetogenic bacteria acting in syntrophy with both acetate-fermenting and CO2-reducing methanogenic Archaebacteria.

The scanning of the sample surface was achieved by X-Y movements of the sample holder (the Z axis being coincident with the beam direction). These movements were accomplished by a motorised X-Y table, with a travel of 25mm × 25mm, connected to the sample holder. This system was used to study specimens of the mineral tourmaline. Two samples, of the ""watermelon"" zoned tourmaline variety, originating from the Alto Ligonha pegmatite district in northern Mozambique, were analysed by the simultaneous use of PIXE (Proton-Induced X-Ray Emission) and PIGE (Proton-Induced Gamma-Ray Emission) techniques, in order to quantify their composition and try to establish a correlation between the elements (major and trace elements) and colour zoning. In order to validate the ""milliprobe"" analysis and study in more detail the frontier between zones of different colours, a microprobe analysis of the samples was also done. In this work, the mineralogical classification of the samples was accomplished. A correlation was established between the presence of Fe and green colour. It was also concluded that the presence of Mn by itself is not enough to lead to pink colour, which gives support to previous studies that claim that only Mn3+ and not the more common form Mn 2+ is responsible for the pink colour. © Physica Scripta 2005.",,"Optical collimators; Optical correlation; Scanning; Milliprobes; PIGE analysis; Amines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349106048

The models studied in this work were: 1) Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential functions with different parameters, which have been proposed for methane and oxygen in the literature, 2) various types of Mie(n-m) potential with different values of n and m, for both methane and oxygen molecules, and 3) a potential function introduced by Dymond, Rigby, and Smith (DRS model). A Kihara-Mie(20-6) potential with the best value for the Kihara parameter, ""γ"" and optimized σ and ε is proposed for an oxygen molecule. Considering the predicting capability of the mentioned potential functions for pure methane and oxygen, two of them were selected for investigating methane-oxygen binary mixtures. The CH4-CH4 and O2-O2 center-of-mass radial distribution function, calculated with selected potentials, predicts the positions and peak height for g(r)CH4-CH4 and g(r)O2-O2 in good agreement with experimental data. The Deiters equation of state was used for PVT data production of pure methane and oxygen and their mixtures via imposing an intuitive mixing rule for the equation-of-state parameters. The results show good agreement between the LJ(12-6) and DRS potential models and the Deiters equation of state at densities of up to 0.25 gmL-1 at all temperatures, the deviations increasing by increasing the density. Furthermore, in the case of a methane-oxygen binary mixture, the Peng-Robinson equation of state was applied.

This new electronic criterion of aromaticity is based on the fact that aromaticity is related to the cyclic delocalized circulation of π electrons. It is defined not only considering the amount of electron sharing between contiguous atoms, which should be substantial in aromatic molecules, but also taking into account the similarity of electron sharing between adjacent atoms. For a series of rings in 15 planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we have found that, in general, FLU is strongly correlated with other widely used indicators of local aromaticity, such as the harmonic-oscillator model of aromaticity, the nucleus independent chemical shift, and the para-delocalization index (PDI). In contrast to PDI, the FLU index can be applied to study the aromaticity of rings with any number of members and it can be used to analyze both the local and global aromatic character of rings and molecules. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.",,"Aromatic fluctuation index (FLU); Aromaticity measurements; Electron sharing; Electronic charge; Correlation methods; Electronic structure; Electrons; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Electric charge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22944465467

Assessments are based on June to October monitoring of dissolved CH4 in the water column and ebullitive gas collected above the sediments. Reductions in overall CH 4 flux were first observed in ebullition, which decreased abruptly from 6 mmol m-2 d-1 before 1992 to 1 mmol m-2 d-1 thereafter. The contribution of ebullition to total CH 4 flux decreased from 35 to 9 % over the same period. Substantial reductions in dissolved CH4 flux were first observed approximately two years after the major reductions in ebullition. Sediment release of dissolved CH4 decreased 38 %, from an average rate of 11.7 mmol m-2 d-1 for the 1989 to 1991 interval, to 7.3 mmol m -2 d-1 for the 2002 to 2004 interval. The decrease in CH4 flux was driven by an abrupt decrease in the deposition of particulate organic carbon into the hypolimnion starting in 1987. The magnitude of the decrease in CH4 flux is consistent with previously documented decreases in primary production, organic carbon deposition, and the areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit. The time course of the decrease in CH4 flux reflects sediment diagenesis processes. Oxidation of large (3.3 - 8.2 × 106 mol) hypolimnetic accumulations of CH4 during the fall mixing period contributed significantly to oxygen depletion observed annually in the lake's upper waters. Decreases in CH4 flux from the sediments resulted in smaller hypolimnetic CH4 pools in late summer and contributed to improved dissolved oxygen resources in fall. © 2005 E.

Saline aquifers are predicted to contribute most of the national CO2 storage potential. Different approaches have been used for capacity estimates at various scales. In order to evaluate the aquifer storage option in relation to national climate protection goals, it is necessary to know the total national storage capacity. On the other hand reliable capacity estimates for individual structures are required by the industry considering storage actual sites. Values of national storage capacities required for the energy and environmental political decisions can be regarded as cross estimates only. More reasonable estimates can be obtained from regional mapping using the geographic information system (GIS). Knowledge of such estimates is important for state authorities and mining administrations that regulate and supervise the various activities making use of the deep underground space. Investment planning for CO2 capture and storage projects requires reliable predictions, including uncertainty ranges for storage capacity. Such predictions require an intensive site characterization, taking into account local variations of aquifer properties. Reservoir models are used to simulate the effects of different CO2 injection strategies and to predict sweep efficiencies.

The best of the recently developed and commercialized advanced 9-12Cr martensitic-ferritic steels may allow prolonged use at temperatures to about 620°C, but such steels are probably close to their inherent upper temperature limit. Further increase in the temperature capability of advanced steam turbines will certainly require the use of Ni-based superalloys and system redesign, as seen in the European programs that are pioneering advanced power plants capable of operating with 700°C steam. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has recently undertaken a concerted effort to qualify ultra-supercritical boiler tubing and piping alloys for 720/760°C steam for increased efficiency and reduced emissions. It is, therefore, necessary to develop the corresponding USC steam turbine, also capable of reliable operation at such conditions. This paper summarizes a preliminary assessment made by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) of materials needed for ultra-supercritical (USC) steam turbines, balancing both technical and business considerations. These efforts have addressed an expanded portfolio of alloys, that includes austenitic stainless steels and alloys, in addition to various Ni-based superalloys for critical turbine components. Preliminary input from utilities indicates that cost-effective improvements in performance and efficiency that do not sacrifice durability and reliability are prime considerations for any advanced steam turbine technology.",,"Ferrite; Martensite; Steam power plants; Steel; Thermal effects; Martensitic-ferritic steels; Ni-based superalloys; Piping alloys; Supercritical boiler tubing; Steam turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646183023

The Palermo's partners in this LIFE Program are the municipalities of Slovenska Bistrica (Slovenia) and Holargos (a municipality of Athens), along with the Climate Alliance Agency. The project officially started in November 2002 and it will end in October 2005. The subject of MedClima project is the climate protection measures for the Mediterranean cities. The emerging climatic changes are a global problem which is not only the concern of scientists across the world but of citizens as well. This project aims at actively involving the local communities in the efforts being made for the protection of climate. MedClima is focused on the Mediterranean Region, due to its proven vulnerability to climate alterations. The main environmental outcome of this project will be the long term reduction of CO2 emissions so it is to tune with Kyoto protocol. The main aim of reduction of CO2 emissions is carried out through achievement of several targets: 1. creation of network; 2. development of a rapid CO2 emission assessment method; 3. development and implementation of local action plan; 4. dissemination programme; 5. formulation of a framework for increasing public awareness; 6. project monitoring and evaluation; 7. proposal for institutional arrangements regarding local climate protection policies. One of the most important steps of this project has been the definition of the layout of a rapid CO2 emission assessment method that is a valid tool of Mediterranean local authorities monitoring the interventions of local action plan during the project and after the end of it. An important contribution was given toward the development of a CO2 emission assessment method, by the Palermo Municipality, particularly for the transport sector. In fact this sector provides the highest contribution of CO2 emissions in Palermo city. Another important goal of the project is the dissemination activity that has taken place throughout the whole project; it also allowed the publication of informative material devoted to the increasing of the public awareness about climate protection measures. Particularly, two different target groups were identified: citizens and school community . For each of them, different tools for the dissemination were used. The action plan is common for all three Municipalities in order to allow for comparisons and effective confrontation of problems that may rise. The expected results of this project are a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions, the implementation of several actions and interventions to lower the emissions, the elaboration of a Handbook of the climate protection measures for Mediterranean cities and the formulation of institutional proposals to the European Community.","Climate protection measures; CO2 emissions; Giudelines for Mediterranean cities; Life programme","Action plan; Assessment methods; Climate protection; Climatic changes; CO2 emissions; Community project; Environmental outcome; European community; Global problems; Institutional arrangement; KYOTO protocol; LIFE programme; Local authorities; Local climate; Local community; Mediterranean cities; Mediterranean region; Project monitoring; Public awareness; Slovenia; Target group; Transport sectors; Emission control; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873592320

Two coalchars, labelled as 1 and 2 with respective ash concentrations of 10.88wt% and 9.04wt%, and electrolytically pure iron were used in this study. Liquid iron droplets were exposed to chars at high temperatures for times ranging between 1 to 180 min and the assembly was then withdrawn into the colder section quenching the droplet. To examine the time dependant growth of new phases formed in the interfacial region, FESEM and EDS investigations were carried out on the underside of the droplet, which effectively represents the iron/char interface. The transfer of carbon and sulphur into the iron droplet was also determined using a LECO Analyser. Interfacial regions for both chars showed a high occurrence of ash deposits, which were found to increase with time. Al, Ca, S, O, Fe were also detected in EDS analysis of the interface. However very low levels of Si were found in the interfacial region despite high concentrations of silica in the chars initially suggesting chemical reactions involving silica. After three hours of contact, carbon pick-up by liquid iron reached only 0.12wt% and 0.28wt% for Char 1 and Char 2 respectively, both of which were much below the saturation level of 5.6 wt%. These results are discussed in terms of the formation of interfacial products, the consumption of solute carbon by reducible oxides and low intrinsic rates of carbon dissolution from non-graphitic Chars. © 2005 ISIJ.","Blast furnace; Carbon dissolution; Carbonaceous materials; Coal char; Liquid Iron","Argon; Blast furnaces; Carbon; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Carbon dissolution; Carbonaceous materials; Coal char; Liquid iron; Surface chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744514482

Current microturbines, rated at say 100 kW, operate with efficiencies approaching 30 percent. Advancing this to an upper level of about 35 percent is projected based on the ability to operate at turbine inlet temperatures greater than 1100C, and the utilization of a higher cost superalloy recuperator. This paper puts into perspective the challenge of trying to achieve 40 percent efficiency for small recuperated turbogenerator designs with radial flow components; the major constraints being associated with stress limitations in both the turbine and recuperator. Various publications (issued by both industry and the Government) often mention an efficiency goal of 40 percent for small gas turbines of this configuration, however, it needs to be recognized that the means to achieve this are beyond current high temperature metallic component capabilities. To achieve this ""goal"" necessitates increasing the operating temperature of the turbine and recuperator above 1100C and 800C respectively. Such advancements are projected to be technically and cost-effectively achievable by utilizing ceramic components, which with a dedicated development program, could perhaps become a reality in less than a decade to meet both future distributed power generation needs and defense applications, and be in concert with ever-demanding conservation goals and reduced emissions.

The concept of inter-pollutant trading has existed for several decades. However, its application to ozone precursors, i.e., NOx or VOC, presents challenges for implementation because of the nonlinearity of impacts between ozone and its precursors. Case studies of two approaches for inter-pollutant trading of ozone precursors are presented. The first focuses on trading between NOx and VOC emissions and demonstrates how inter-pollutant trading ratios can be developed and evaluated in an urban area using a photochemical grid model. The second case is a preliminary evaluation of emission trading between VOC with different Maximum Incremental Reactivities in Houston, TX. Preliminary analyses suggest that trading between highly reactive VOC and OVOC is not likely to lead to a significant degradation of air quality.

In the absence of penalties or restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions, coal use for electricity generation is expected to grow over the course of this century due to its relative abundance. This chapter examines the influence of four factors on future of coal consumption in the electric power sector: (1) the price of carbon emissions, (2) the price of natural gas, (3) costs of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies, and (4) the dispatch between coal and natural gas generation technologies. These variables are assessed for their effect on coal consumption using a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, the MIT Emissions Prediction, and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. The results illustrate how competing technologies, changing input prices, and general equilibrium effects influence the adoption of CCS technologies. The results for the United States and Europe suggest that carbon price and dispatch have the most significant effect on future coal consumption. Improvements in CCS technology costs make coal consumption less dependent on gas price, but do not mitigate the carbon price effects on consumption through 2050. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Six key themes have emerged that may have implication for reservoir development and facies architecture in similar depositional systems. These ""modern"" depositional themes are compared to some ancient mixed system examples. Although mixed systems are complex and spatially unique, similarities in the basic lithofacies deposition and their associated physical properties can aid in prediction of reservoir distribution and in refinement of geologic models in ancient mixed systems. The deposition-related themes recognized in this study of the Florida Neogene include (1) Concept of Template Control on Both Carbonate and Siliciclastic Deposition - precursor topography controls depositional geometry and location of subsequent depocenters for both carbonates and siliciclastics; (2) Distal Transport of Coarse Clastics and Influence of Currents on Grain-size Segregation - conditions can exist for the long-distance transport (fluvial?) of extremely coarse siliciclastics (flat-pebble quartz in this Neogene example) from the source area, and regional currents help segregate grain-size populations and partition grain types; (3) Demise of the Carbonate Platform/Ramp: Smothered by Siliciclastics? - in this Neogene example, we recognize a hiatus of several million years bounding the top of a carbonate ramp, which indicates that demise of the ramp and subsequent input of Siliciclastics are temporally distinct; (4) The Mixing Transition: Abrupt Vertical and Lateral Facies Changes - the lateral transition of carbonate to siliciclastic strata highlights the potential for abrupt facies changes both laterally and vertically. Interfingered carbonates and Siliciclastics may form stratigraphic traps based on lithologic differences and differential diagenesis and can result in alternating reservoir pay zones and nonreservoir intervals; (5) Cryptic Sequence Boundary in Shallow-marine Siliciclastics and Carbonates - in cases where no distinct change in lithology exists, it may be inherently difficult to recognize major disconformity based only on lithologie changes. In settings dominated by admixing, sequence-boundary confirmation may require the integration of biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic markers with any available textural indicators; and (6) Similarity in Acoustic Properties of Laterally Equivalent Siliciclastics and Carbonates - shallow burial and early diagenesis have produced an almost identical acoustic signature for the two admixed sediment types. This acoustic similarity may make it difficult to distinguish specific lithofacies on seismic profiles and sonic logs. In ancient mixed-system deposits where only seismic data exist, problems in specific lithofacies or geometric characterization may occur.",,"hydrocarbon reservoir; Florida [United States]; North America; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645530975

Actions need to be taken in the short term to reduce and control air pollution. An updated emission inventory for the MMA vehicle fleet using the Mobile6 model is presented. The vehicle fleet was classified by municipality and age of the vehicle for applying the model. Non registered vehicles estimated in another study were considered in the emission inventory. Emissions of CO, HC, NOx, SO2, and, for the first time, emissions of PM10 and NH3 are calculated. Old vehicles (&gt; 12 yr old) have the largest contribution of total emissions. New control technologies in vehicles contributed to reduce the emissions of new vehicles.

A methodology that combines the use of fast-response monitoring devices of air pollutants (e.g., CO2, NO, and NO2) mounted on a mobile platform and inverse modeling (chemical data assimilation) techniques is presented. The data obtained from the mobile laboratory serves two main purposes, i.e., validate source strength and speciation estimations obtained from emissions modeling tools, and provide input data to chemical data assimilation experiments using comprehensive chemistry-transport air quality models.

Although most studies demonstrate HIT or LWI in the case of a strong coupling field inducing coherence between two atomic levels, there is also an interest in the examination of these processes in the absence of an externally imposed coherent coupling field. In this work we investigate the generation of Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) without population inversion in the 4P3/2-4S1/2 transition of the Potassium atom under two-photon excitation of the atom from the 4S1/2 to the 6S 1/2 state. The experiments were carried out by utilizing a stainless-steel cell of potassium vapor and the excitation was done by an excimer pumped dye laser. The experimentally observed ASE radiation in the 4P3/2-4P3/2 transition is attributed to the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of the 4S1/2-4P 3/2 transition due to the internal generation of fields in the 5P3/2-4S1/2, 6S1/2-5P3/2 transitions, generated by a Four-Wave Mixing process and in the 6S 1/2-4P3/2 transition, generated mainly by Hyper Raman Scattering. To explain the experimental results, a theoretical model based on the density operator formalism is applied to describe the temporal evolution of a four-level system of Potassium atom states under the effect of four internally generated fields. The fields are externally imposed on the system with the experimentally recorded temporal evolution and radiation intensity. For the probe field in the transition 4P3/2-4S1/2 a minimum intensity is assumed due to spontaneous emission and its temporal evolution and amplification are calculated. The calculations show that the radiation observed in the 4P3/2-4S1/2 transition is generated without population inversion for a broad range of the parameters used. It seems that a V-type scheme due to the 5P3/2-4S1/2 emission and a cascade scheme due to the 6S1/2-4P3/2 emission are both important in the generation of the radiation in the 4P3/2-4S 1/2 transition. Both schemes are examined and compared with the experimental results in order to assess their impact in the generation of ASE without population inversion. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Amplification; Coherent light; Laser beams; Light emission; Photons; Raman scattering; Cascade scheme; Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT); Four-level systems; Electromagnetic fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847335154

A unique aspect of the Eco-house is the degree of student involvement; in accordance with UD's mission, interdisciplinary student teams from mechanical engineering, civil engineering and the humanities are leading the design effort. This paper discusses the conceptual design of a net-zero energy use campus residence, and the analysis completed thus far. Energy use of current student houses is analyzed to provide a baseline and to identify energy saving opportunities. The use of the whole-system inside-out approach to guide the overall design is described. Using the inside-out method as a guide, the energy impacts of occupant behavior, appliances and lights, building envelope, energy distribution systems and primary energy conversion equipment are discussed. The design of solar thermal and solar photovoltaic systems to meet the hot water and electricity requirements of the house is described. Ecohouse energy use is simulated and compared to the energy use of the existing houses. The analysis shows the total source energy requirements of the Eco-house could be reduced by about 340 mmBtu per year over older baseline houses, resulting in CO2 emission reductions of about 54,000 Ib per year and utility cost savings of about $3,000 per year.

Airplanes, like most combustion sources, emit small particles, yet current regulations for airplane emissions only regulate particles through their visible perturbation as measured by a Smoke Number determination. The SAE E-31 committee on Aircraft Exhaust Emissions Measurement has been asked by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the US Environmental Protection Agency, and the US Federal Aviation Administration to address more advanced methods of characterizing and quantifying the particle emissions from aircraft engines. The measurement of particles in an aircraft engine exhaust must address the hostile environment of the hot, high-speed exhaust, and accurate quantification of particle emission parameters faces many challenges and a number of complex technical issues.

At present, much of the smelter sulphur dioxide is converted into sulphuric acid for sale in the marketplace. However, sulphuric acid production is not viable when the smelters are located in remote areas as costly acid storage and distribution systems are needed. In these cases, a viable alternative is conversion of the sulphur dioxide into elemental sulphur by reduction with methane (natural gas). In contrast, solid elemental sulphur can be stored in exhausted mines sites or in dedicated storage facilities at relatively low cost. Also, when the market for sulphur is buoyant, it can be sold on the international market as it is easier to transport and distribute in comparison to sulphuric acid. The concept of sulphur production by reaction of SO2 with CH4 is not new. In the 1970's, several technologies were developed and patented, among them, the cyclic process developed by the Allied Chemical Corporation that was implemented at the Falconbridge nickel facility in Canada. However, these processes were abandoned due to the high consumption of methane, some difficulties in technical operation and a high demand for sulphuric acid in that time period. Recently, there has been resurgence in interest in direct reduction of SO2 to sulphur due to an increasing supply of sulphuric acid in regions where there is no market and the higher costs associated with sulphuric acid storage, handling and transportation. The economics of the direct reduction are, of course, appealing only when the natural gas is available at low cost. Although this condition is limited to relatively few places in the world, the overall economics and environmental concerns make conversion of SO2 to sulfur by CH4 an attractive proposition. Therefore, Siirtec Nigi has investigated the SO2/CH4 technology for treating smelter off gases in order to get a deeper insight of the process. This paper will present the key aspects of process relevant to commercial metals smelting operations.",,"Atmospheric corrosion; Cost reduction; International trade; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Sulfur determination; Sulfur dioxide; Sulfuric acid; Distribution systems; Elemental sulphur; Environmental concerns; International markets; Off-gas treatment; Storage facilities; Sulphuric acid production; Technical operations; Smelting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928787040

Box 13, H-4010 Debrecen, Hungary","Agricultural or ecological impact studies, related to future climate changes, require highly resolved meteorological input data both in space and time. Since present climate models can not fulfill this requirement, gaps between the necessary and available resolution, are filled by downscaling. A possible way to downscale GCM-output fields into regional climate scenarios can be to consider the changes in the frequency distribution of model-generated macro-circulation types and to combine them with conditional climatology of each macro-type. This approach can be successful, if a great part of local climate anomalies is connected to frequency anomalies of the macro-types. To test this assumption, a diagnostic method for separation of the local climate anomalies into circulation and non-circulation (physical) factors, allowing a mixed term, is developed, applying the subjective classification of pressure patterns by Péczely (1957). Results for monthly and seasonal anomalies of precipitation and temperature are presented for Debrecen, Hungary (47°N, 21°E). The investigated period is 30 years from 1966 to 1995. The main feature of the results is the secondary role of the macro-circulation factor. This conclusion is formulated from the comparison of contributions by these terms to moderate and extreme anomalies; to the standard deviation and to long-term variations; and also from the correlation between the three terms and their sum, i.e. the monthly anomaly. It is impossible, however, to considerthis circulation term as the maximum information contained by a series of macro-types, because the succession of macro-types and conditional relation of the local weather on different days of a given type is not taken into account by the given separation. On the other hand, the circulation term exhibits fair statistical relation to the physical term and also to the whole anomaly in many cases, which is promising considering further improvement of this approach to downscaling based on frequency of macro-synoptic types. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A small, fanatical minority of anti-nuclear activists is insisting that the looming problems of global warming and ocean acidification can be handled by deployment of renewable energy sources, additional ""clean"" carbon fuels, and by conservation. The technical community knows that this will be expensive and ineffective. Wind power is the nearest-term prospect, and is growing, but its electricity output is far below the expected levels. Its intermittency has meant that wind is unable to supply more than a few percent of a grid's electricity demand before the benefit of CO2 reduction disappears in emissions from stand-by generators [1]. Yet while the world's governments dither, nature and our energy use are setting the timescales. Like many others, our analyses of energy-use scenarios show that the World is going to become wanner over the next 30 years [2] and there is little that can now be done to change this. But, if world society starts immediately to take responsibility for our legacy to future generations, the rise thereafter can be sharply slowed. Action in the first half of this century is crucial and we have the technology to take action in the form of nuclear fission to bridge us to a sustainable energy future. Depending on the total amount of energy consumed world-wide, between an additional 4400 to 14 000 nuclear reactors of 1000 MW would need to be deployed by 2050. This is a large deployment but most is new generating capacity that will provide some equality in energy supplies to developing countries. Sensible, nuclear-rich scenarios differ from business-as-usual ones only in the form of this additional capacity, not by displacing existing fossil fuels Given the uncertainties in climate modelling, the Earth's climate could contain cusps beyond which positive feedback takes control of the planet's climate and places it entirely beyond human influence. At what point this will occur is irresolvable speculation. However, the increased concentration of CO2 in surface ocean water is one aspect of CO2 emissions that had been largely overlooked until recently and the ocean's response to CO2 emissions is much more certain. The changes to the oceans are predictable with complete certainty and the resulting shift of carbonate ions (CO32-) to bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) will reduce or eliminate supersaturation of the carbonate, disrupting or destroying the lifecycle of much of the ocean's phytoplankton [3]. Phytoplankton is the base of the oceans' entire food chain as well as an important mechanism for long-term sequestration of CO2 through their rain of detritus to the deep ocean bottoms. Action does not require technology that has yet to be developed or that is beyond our technical and financial capabilities. Yet, even with Kyoto's coming into force and the commitment of most world leaders to limiting greenhouse gas emissions [4], effective political action remains rare. What is needed to unlock the logjam? Nuclear power has determined opponents, who have shaped public opinion highly effectively. The anti-nuclear environmental movement activists (ANEMA) basically opposes nuclear energy because it is large-scale and requires seemingly abstruse technology. The ANEMAs' visceral position is not readily altered, but, because the public might judge it somewhat skeptically, ANEMA have raised a series of detailed objections designed to cause public alarm. The five most effective are nuclear energy's cost, reactor safety, waste disposal, insufficient fuel resource, and nuclear proliferation. The nuclear industry has evidently failed so far to provide the rebuttal to all of these that is likely a precondition of a massive fuel switch. Until these artificial barriers are removed by us, the insiders of the nuclear industry, our technical solution of an effective, non-polluting energy source cannot be applied on the scale needed to deflect global society from its current catastrophic course. The answers are not difficult: • The cost of nuclear energy should not be an issue. Our company, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, has a consistent record of building CANDU-6®1 reactors around the world on-time and within-budget. Our ACR®2 design and other Generation III+ reactor designs from other vendors further lower the capital cost of nuclear to a point where it is competitive with coal. • High standards for reactor safety have been established worldwide, through the activities of operators, designers and WANO (the World Association of Nuclear Operators). Still, the evidence has not yet removed the public's paranoia over traces of radioactivity. • Spent fuel storage is no longer a technical issue. Approaches to geological disposal have been independently developed and verified in a number of countries including Canada, Finland and the USA. What we have neglected to emphasise is the four to six orders of magnitude reduction in the amount of waste produced by nuclear power compared to the mountains of waste produced (and generally released) by carbon-based energy sources. • Proliferation and terrorism have never arisen from nuclear power reactors. That is almost certain to remain true: would anyone create a mining industry as a cover for misuse of conventional explosives? Still, this is the most difficult issue to address because these are grave problems and not susceptible to any single solution. Before the ANEMA reconfigure an old argument as: ""better red (from heat) than dead (from a nuclear explosion)"", we in the nuclear industry need to persuade public opinion that a world with adequate, sustainable supplies of energy is less likely to produce and shelter the fanatics who would resort to any sort of terrorism. Almost all technology can be misapplied. But we have not abandoned chemistry, simply because it led to explosives with the demonstrated capacity to kill and maim countless millions. We have not abandoned air, road and rail transport, despite their leading to the accidental deaths of thousands every year. Nor have we abandoned biology, though it has the capacity to devise new plague-creating organisms. Nuclear energy can be misused but it is the only safe foundation for the world's energy supplies for at least the next 50 years and our first task is to convince our public opinions of it.",,"1000 MW; Atomic energy of canada limiteds; Bicarbonate ions; Business-as-usual; Capital costs; Carbon fuels; Carbon-based; Carbonate ions; Climate modelling; Deep ocean; Earth's climate; Electricity demands; Electricity output; Energy source; Energy supplies; Energy use; Environmental movement; Finland; Food chain; Fuel resources; Future generations; Generating capacity; Geological disposals; Global society; High standards; Human influences; Intermittency; Nuclear power reactors; Nuclear proliferation; Orders of magnitude; Political actions; Public opinions; Rail transport; Reactor designs; Reactor safety; Renewable energy source; Surface ocean; Sustainable energy; Technical community; Technical solutions; Time-scales; World association of nuclear operators; World leaders; Algae control; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Climate control; Design; Developing countries; Earth (planet); Energy conversion; Explosives; Feedback; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Inert gases; Nuclear energy; Nuclear explosions; Nuclear industry; Nuclear propulsion; Nuclear reactors; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Spent fuels; Technology; Terrorism; Waste disposal; Wind power; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960568704

Coal has a long history of being used solely in power production and although significant progress has been made in environmental performance still more improvement is envisioned as part of the President's Clear Skies Initiative. Additionally, coal is increasingly being considered as a resource for the production of non-power related commodities such as fuels, chemicals, and in particular hydrogen, as technical advancements are made and economic and market conditions change. These revolutionary changes are altering how we perceive coal's role in our energy future and pose significant technical and economic challenges to the future implementation and market acceptance of these additional market areas for coal-derived commodities. The Bush Administration has also placed particular emphasis on developing hydrogen-related technologies to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign sources of energy while reducing air pollution and concerns about climate change. The Hydrogen Fuel and FreedomCAR initiatives are conducting RD&D activities on hydrogen production, delivery, storage, and utilization technologies. A key element of these initiatives is the production of hydrogen from domestic resources. Coal, as the nation's most abundant fossil energy resource, has an important role in these initiatives and as a future source of hydrogen. The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy (FE) has a significant number of activities devoted to research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) in coal and power systems. FE's Office of Sequestration, Hydrogen, and Clean Coal Fuels is investigating a number of innovative technologies to produce hydrogen from coal with near-zero emissions. This paper will provide a review of the Office's hydrogen and carbon sequestration RD&D goals, strategies, activities, and technologies. It will also review the FutureGen project, a DOE initiative to build the world's first hydrogen and power co-production plant integrated with carbon capture and storage.

SIDS have neither the resources nor the expertise to effectively evaluate the risks associated with climate change, nor the ability to adapt to potential changes. Compared to islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, SIDS in the Indian Ocean and eastern Atlantic Ocean off of the west coast of Africa are among the poorest and least studied of the SIDS. In this United Nations supported study, five Indian Ocean SIDS (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Maldives) and two Atlantic Ocean SIDS (Cape Verde, and the Republic of Sao Tome &amp; Principe) are evaluated for their vulnerability to climate change, with an emphasis on impacts on water resources and coastal zone resources. Due to significant differences between the SIDS studied in terms of size, topography, geology, precipitation, population density, storm patterns and intensities, relative sea level rise, indicators of wealth (such as GDP/capita), and other island characteristics, each SIDS faces its own unique challenges. This paper describes the major findings of the study. One important finding is that relative sea level rise at present appears most significant on one of the SIDS (Maldives), and a number of other SIDS appear to be emerging slightly at a rate high enough to presently offset the effects of global sea level rise. However, analysis shows that at sometime during the 21 st century, should sea level rise accelerate as climate models now suggest, that all the SIDS will become vulnerable to sea level change. Further, an existing stress on most of the SIDS is the human population density and tourism that have increased dramatically at most SIDS over the past several decades. Tourism provides both economic benefits to the islands, while at the same time tourists consume resources at rates typically far in excess of the native population. Therefore, stresses on water resources and the coastal zone due to human population are factored into the climate change stresses that are projected to increase over this century. Finally the paper describes capacity building efforts and strategies for adaptation that are intended to bring attention, resources, and expertise to the aid of the SIDS. One vehicle to do this is through the development of an Internet portal, eventually to be hosted and maintained by one of the SIDS.

The results were used to validate HEED (Home Energy Efficient Design), a whole-building energy simulation program. HEED automatically designed two 2000 sq.ft. houses, one to Meets the Energy Code, (California's Title24), and the other that was a More Energy Efficient scheme. The California Energy Code (Title 24) requires a slightly different buildings in each of California's 16 climate zones. On a state-wide basis these More Energy Efficient homes designed by HEED use about 35% less energy than the homes that Meet the Energy Code. One of the three cooling strategies was added to each of the two basecase homes in each climate In the Title 24 home the Whole-House fan is only half as good as either of the two Operable Shades. However in the More Energy Efficient home (that has more thermal mass) the Whole- House fan is significantly better than the Operable Shades, even to the point of eliminating the need to install an air conditioner in 10 of California's 16 climate zones.

This modifies the traditional belief that External Shades are always more efficient. This study demonstrates once again why design matters.

In regions of concentrated poultry production, the generation and subsequent management of litter have become an increasing challenge. Concerns over increased soil nutrient levels, impaired water quality, and community impacts have resulted in increased regulatory and legal burdens for the poultry industry. Accordingly, in major poultry producing regions, there is growing pressure to find reliable, affordable, and sustainable alternatives to land application for the management of litter. Using poultry litter as a biomass fuel to produce energy is a particularly attractive alternative for several reasons. Poultry-litter-fueled power plants can reliably process very large quantities of litter on a continuous, year-round basis, thereby, benefiting an entire poultry-growing region economically and environmentally. In addition, the ash resulting from the use of litter as a fuel is a valuable fertilizer product. The ash retains much of the nutrient value of the litter in a concentrated form, allowing for the storage and economical transport of this material away from the concentrated poultry production areas. Of added importance, poultry litter power is an environmentally sustainable (""carbon-neutral"") approach to energy generation, which displaces generation by fossil fuel power plants. While poultry litter to energy facilities have operated commercially with success in the United Kingdom for 13 years, only now is a large facility in the mature stages of development in the United States. This paper provides an overview of the Fibrominn Biomass Power Plant, which is a 50 MW poultry-litter fueled power plant under construction in Minnesota. The Fibrominn project, located in the west-central community of Benson, will serve a major turkey producing region, and is being developed by Fibrowatt LLC. The Fibrominn plant will be fueled with approximately 700,000 tons per year of biomass, primarily turkey litter, in conjunction with smaller quantities of other agricultural biomass fuel. The Fibrominn project is currently permitted, financed ($202 million), and is under construction, and is scheduled for commercial operation in mid-2007. After discussing the impetus for poultry litter power in the U.S., key aspects of the Fibrominn project are addressed, including: the need for an alternative to land application for management of poultry litter, the process by which support for the Fibrominn project was garnered, arrangements made with litter generators to supply fuel to the project, how the project coordinates litter management and transport with the region's producers, the technical characteristics of the turkey litter as a fuel, an overview of key design parameters for the power plant, Best Available Control Technology for the power plant emissions, the environmental greenhouse-gas advantage afforded by the plant, attributes of the ash residue as a valuable fertilizer product and the marketing plan for the ash, the economics of the project, and of particular importance, the factors that have made the Fibrominn project successful.","Ash; Biomass; CAFO; Chicken litter; Chicken litter power; Fibrowatt; Greenhouse gas; Nutrient management plan; Poultry litter; Poultry litter power; Renewable energy; Turkey litter; Turkey litter power","Fibrowatt; Nutrient management plan; Poultry litter; Poultry litter power; Turkey litter; Turkey litter power; Biomass; Greenhouse effect; Renewable energy resources; Agricultural wastes; Ash; Biomass; Greenhouse Effect; Nutrients; Poultry; Renewable Resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847402596

This emission, induced by an unstable beam of electrons, can occur owing to either nonlinear three-wave decay interactions involving Langmuir waves, ion sound waves, and transverse waves or STI. Here recently obtained conditions for decay dominating STI and expressions for the combined efficiencies of decay and STI processes are applied to several phenomena: (1) type II and III solar radio bursts, both in the corona and in the solar wind, and (2) emission associated with global merged interaction region (GMIR) shocks which propagate through the solar. system, and inner and outer heliosheath plasmas. The shock-associated electron distributions are computed using a shock drift acceleration model. It is found that decay should dominate STI for type II and III bursts and that the conditions for decay dominating STI reduce the emission predicted by decay processes by ≲ factor of 2. Similar results are found for GMIR related emission in the solar wind. In the portion of the VLISM where the electron distribution is primed with a superthermal tail the conditions are less severe; however, outside the primed region the conditions are important.

Among various single-oxide SEs examined, NiO-SE for the mixed-potential-type NOx sensor was found to exhibit rather high sensitivity to NO2 even in the high temperature range of 800-900°C. This sensor showed quicker response and recovery transients in the presence of water vapor, compared with that in the dry sample gas. The sensing mechanism of this type of sensor was discussed on the basis of the catalytic activities to the electrochemical and non-electrochemical reactions. It was also shown that the new-type complex-impedance-based (impedancemetric) NOx sensor attached with ZnCr2O4-SE exhibit good sensing characteristics to NOx at 700°C. Furthermore, the sensitivity to NO was almost equal to that to NO2 in the concentration range from 0 to ca. 200 ppm at 700°C. A linear dependence was observed between the sensitivity of the impedancemetric sensor and the concentration of NOx even in the presence of 8 vol. % H 2O and 15 vol.% CO2.

The equipment for Lemna semicontinuous culture consists of a growth chamber and a circulation control unit. Lemna gibba is kept in the growth chamber in a growth pot (with 1 mm diameter perforation at about 10 cm above the bottom), which retains the plant but allows an efficient exchange of the growth medium. Flow rate and composition of the medium is therefore varied independently of the L. gibba population density. The media are kept in circulation, and recharges or discharge of the media are controlled. The system took into consideration chemical processes such as O2 and CO2 exchange and maintained a degree of turbulence through continuous shaking of the growth chambers. It is also possible to investigate growth under different supply of O2 and CO2, and pH control with dissolved CO2 or reducing conditions with N2 gases. Theoretical analysis of growth in the steady state shows that integrated activation time of the dilution pump is proportional to the growth rate of L. gibba. Theoretical analysis was also used to determine the minimum flow-rate and nutrient concentration of the medium to cover the requirements of L. gibba. Experiments were carried out that demonstrated that the steady state growth could be attained and be controlled by the nutrient concentration, flow rate, and recharge intervals. The cultures could be kept at steady state over 21 days of the Lemna test period. © 2005, Penkala Bt.","Batch culture; Lemna gibba; Nutrient media; Semicontinuous culture; Steady state","Bacteria (microorganisms); Lemna; Lemna gibba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744543940

Strong population growth, increasing water demands, and the introduction of surface water into a treatment plant originally designed for groundwater required evaluations and upgrades to the water system. The City completed a Water Purification Plant (WPP) Master Plan in 1993. Several projects were completed based on the recommendations of the Master Plan: filter modifications, a new chemical feed facility, and the addition of filter to waste. After the completion of these projects, some operational issues still remained at the plant. In July of 2001, HDR updated the City's Master Plan. In the Master Plan Update several improvement projects were identified to improve reliability, enhance treatment, increase capacity, comply with regulations, or to improve safety, operation and maintenance conditions. In a workshop, HDR's Master Plan team and technical experts met with key City staff to evaluate these proposed improvements and prioritize project implementation. During that evaluation, it became apparent that the addition of clarification basins preceding the existing water purification processes was critical and would have a significant immediate benefit. The major issue related to the performance of the purification plant is the large variation in the raw water quality of the Big Sioux River. Significant, rapid changes in turbidity as well as periodic high algae concentration in the impoundment at the intake caused problems with the consistency of the solids contact basin effluent, which in turn impacted the turbidity and loading rate of the filters. Also, the backwash water was directed off site to the sanitary sewer, because the solids loading would upset the softening basins when recycled. Recovery of the backwash water would maximize use of the limited water resources. The City elected to go forward with HDR's recommendation and proceeded with the clarification basins addition project. The addition of clarification basins enhanced the treatment process and reduced the chemical usage by removing the majority of the particulates from the surface water source, prior to treatment in the lime softening and filtration processes. The purpose of the clarification basins is to provide consistent influent water to the softening basins that exhibit the following characteristics: • Turbidity less than 5 NTU • Total Organic Carbon (TOC) reduced by 25 percent or more • Maximized algae reduction Providing consistent water quality to the softening basins allows for a more stable operation. Benefits include a more stable solids blanket, which in turn allows for more consistent residuals withdrawal, and reduced powdered activated carbon (PAC) dosages for taste and odor control. More stable operation of the softening basins maximizes the hydraulic loading rate to the filters. © 2005 American Water Works Association.",,"Backwash water; Chemical feed; Filtration process; Hydraulic loading rates; Lime softening; Loading rate; Master plan; Off sites; Operation and maintenance; Operational issues; Population growth; Powdered activated carbon; Pre-Treatment; Project implementation; Raw water quality; Sioux falls; Solids loading; Stable operation; Surface water sources; Taste and odors; Technical experts; Total Organic Carbon; Treatment plants; Treatment process; Water demand; Water department; Water purification; Water purification plants; Water system; Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Algae; Chemical modification; Clarifiers; Effluents; Groundwater; Loading; Odor control; Population statistics; Surface waters; Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; Water treatment plants; Clarification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874312708

This important subject is being actively revisited by the GT community and safety organizations, namely under the impulse of the HSE of UK. Historically the catalytic detection technology that is of common use in stationary GT, has been applied to detect leakages of gaseous fuels - and more especially Natural Gas (NG) - since the catalytic detectors or ""pellistors"" are most sensitive to methane. Indeed, the response of catalytic detectors is specific to each individual hydrocarbon molecule and decrease with the size of the latter. After years this technology has been extended to the detection of rich NG (containing some amounts of C3-C4) then to hydrogen and liquefied petroleumliquids (LPG). The use of alternative gas turbine fuels such as LPG, syngas and volatile fuels is becoming increasingly popular in some world regions and requires to adapt the leak detection systems. Especially, volatile liquid fuels that comprise naphtha, ""natural gas liquids"", gas condensates (and alcohols) are critical in safety terms. Indeed these fuels exhibit both low initial boiling points (IBP as low as 30°C) and Flash Points (down to-20°C); in case of leak, they generate - as liquids - large masses of flammable substances. In addition, vapors of liquid fuels have a more complex response in catalytic detection than gases due to their complex composition with tens of HC molecules of various size and structure. In this context, the behavior of commercial detectors in presence of not only gas fuels but also of synthetic vapors of naphtha has been the matter of a comprehensive evaluation at the laboratory of INERIS, a French Institute devoted to safety and environment. This work that targets the detection of hydrocarbon (CnHm) fuels is the first phase of an overall, GE-INERIS joint evaluation program covering both hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon GT fuels, i.e. the complete Cn,Hm/ CO/ H2/ N 2(CO2) spectrum. The first part of this program phase addressed the lightest terms of the paraffin series (C1 to C4) and some mixtures of the same that are involved in the detection of NG and LPG vapors. The second part was dedicated to the higher paraffins terms (C5 to C8) including various mixtures of the same and 2 synthetic naphtha compositions. Particular emphasis has been placed on the capability to detect hydrocarbons at the levels (as low as 5%) that result from recent safety codes. After a record of principles, the paper summarizes the results of these tests that confirm the general capability of the catalytic technology for the detection of LPG and naphtha vapors.

This approach employs a backward facing method based on the quasi-steady approximation using the engine steady state characteristics. The driving cycle used in this study is extracted from the experimental data collected from the city buses in the real traffic conditions of the city of Tehran. The driving cycle is divided into several traffic conditions including congested, urban and extra-urban (highway). Several driving modes have also been considered including idle, cruise, deceleration and acceleration. The driving cycle simulation is then used to obtain the distribution of the engine operation for several driving cycles, traffic conditions and driving modes. Finally, the mapping from the driving cycle SAPM into the engine SLPM is employed to analyze the results.

The first part of this short overview focuses on potentiometric as well as on amperometric zirconia exhaust gas oxygen sensors. It is remarkable that in the past years a leap in manufacturing technology has occurred from classical ceramic technology to tape and thick-film technology. The advent of novel combustion concepts like leanburn operating gasoline direct injection required novel exhaust gas aftertreatment concepts. It pushed the development of the NO""x sensor, which is manufactured in the same technology. It is also shown how development of exhaust gas sensors has always to be considered in interaction with exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. This elucidates why novel sensors have gained in importance just recently when stricter emission regulations were announced, meaning that the time is ripe for novel exhaust gas aftertreatment concepts. Appropriate sensors - ammonia sensors, hydrocarbon sensors, and particulate matter sensors - are still in the R&D stage. Several possible sensor principles are discussed. The materials that are used for sensors in the automotive exhaust are electroceramics. Besides ion-conducting zirconia and zirconia cermets, electrically insulating alumina is used for substrate purposes. Novel functional materials in the R&D state are strontium-iron titanate for temperature-independent resistive oxygen sensing and zeolites for selective detection of spedfic gases like hydrocarbons or ammonia. © 2005 The American Ceramic Society.",,"Alumina; Cermets; Electric insulation; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Oxygen sensors; Potentiometric sensors; Thermal effects; Thick films; Titanium compounds; Zirconia; Automotive exhaust gas sensors; Electroceramics; Temperature-independent resistive oxygen sensing; Thick-film technology; Zirconia exhaust gas oxygen sensor; Ceramic materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844612014

The bench-scale microcosm study results showed that bioaugmentation and the addition of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate, yeast extract and vitamin 812) might be necessary to stimulate reductive dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons at Site 162. Microcosm results for Site 177/325 showed that perchlorate in the site groundwater will readily degrade with addition of a simple electron donor (no nutrients) and bioaugmentation/addition of nutrients may not be necessary (but would most likely increase me rate of reductive dechlorination) to treat chlorinated solvents present at the site. Results of the Site 162 and Site 177/325 tracer tests confirmed the localized ground-water flow direction, indicated that the wells in the pilot study areas are well-connected hydraulically, and showed that adequate distribution of an injected liquid can be achieved in the pilot study areas.

The TSAC is a solid-state compressor that has the capability to remove CO2 from a low-pressure source, and subsequently store, compress, and deliver it at a higher pressure as required by a processor. The TSAC described in this paper was designed to function as an interface device for the CO2 removal and reduction units of the International Space Station (ISS). The air revitalization system of the ISS operates in an open loop mode and relies on the resupply of oxygen and other consumables from Earth for the life support of astronauts. A compressor is required for recovering the CO2 from the carbon dioxide removal assembly (CDRA) and delivering to a CO2 reduction unit of an oxygen recovery system and thereby closing the air-loop. The TSAC achieves suction and compression of the CO 2 through heating and cooling of the adsorbent enclosed in a chamber. The TSAC was developed at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and its operation was successfully verified in integration tests with the flight-like CDRA at Marshall Space Flight Center prior to the long-duration tests. The purpose of the long-duration tests is to reveal any impacts of the repeated thermal cycling on the compressor components and the adsorbent material.

These pollutants are generally a mixture of hot gases and particulates. An optical fibre sensor is particularly well suited to this task. Due to it's small size and weight it is minimally invasive making it suitable for insertion into the vehicle's exhaust system. Optical fibres are immune from poisoning by the analyte gases, although they do require shielding from airborne particulates. As they do not transmit electricity they are also highly safe and furthermore they are immune from electromagnetic interference. To detect the presence of the gases it is proposed to use an optical absorption technique. The majority of gases of industrial and environmental importance have their fundamental absorption line in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with weaker overtones in the near infrared. Due to the greater availability of components, optimised for communications, most optical fibre gas sensing has taken place in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. In this paper mid-infrared optical fibre gas sensing techniques are investigated and the results of the investigation are presented. Due to the inhomogeneous state of the gas flow it is necessary to measure temperature especially just upstream of the after-treatment section where this can rise to as high as 650°C with large temporal gradients. Measurements of temperature of hot gases from a full size test engine using an optical fibre probe based on fluorescence decay time measurements are also presented.","Mid-Infrared Sensors; Optical Fibre Sensor; Vehicle Exhaust Emissions","Air pollution; Chemical sensors; Gas emissions; Infrared devices; Motor transportation; Particulate emissions; Signal interference; Vehicles; Land transport vehicles; Mid-infrared sensors; Optical fiber sensors; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Fiber optic sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27644469352

Through goods and services traded in a globally interdependent world, the consumption in each country is linked to greenhouse gas emissions in other countries. It has been argued that in order to achieve equitable reduction targets, international trade has to be taken into account when assessing nations' responsibility for abating climate change. Especially for open economies such as Denmark, greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on the national 'greenhouse gas responsibility'. By using input-output modelling we analyse the influence from international trade on national CO2 emissions. The aim is to show that trade is the key to define CO2 responsibility on a macroeconomic level and that imports should be founded in a multi-region model approach. Finally, the paper concludes on the need to consider the impact from foreign trade when negotiating reduction targets and base line scenarios.

The transient events previously identified as precursors to blowout are investigated in greater detail using simultaneous local OH chemiluminescence data and high speed visualization of the combustor. Two types of high speed visualization were employed, specifically chemiluminescence emission and planar light scattering from seeded oil droplets. The chemiluminescence imaging identifies active zones of reaction and the oil droplet scattering identifies cold, nonreacted fluid regions in the combustor. These two imaging approaches provide complementary information on the dynamics of the flow field. A theory of the blowout process is suggested based on the observations. The presence of cold reactants in the inner recirculation zone is believed to trigger the extinction process. The response of the swirling flow field to the change in the heat release distribution is a larger and stronger swirling region, which brings hot and reacting gases to the inlet zone and restores the combustion process. Several occurrences of these events in time gradually weaken the combustion process and eventually the feedback of the downstream gases to the upstream zone is no longer effective in restoring the flame; thus the combustor experiences a blowout. This improved understanding of combustor blowout should lead to an improved interpretation of lean blowout precursor signals in order to better estimate the proximity to blowout.",,"Chemiluminescence; Combustion; Gas turbines; Light scattering; Swirling flow; Visualization; Blowout precursors; Droplet scattering; Methane-air combustors; Reactants; Combustors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30744458847

Whereas conventional DI (Direct Injection) combustion burns primarily with a diffusion flame, HCCI combustion is a premixed combustion. This premixed reduction results in significantly lower NOx when compared to the DI counterpart. However, it is widely recognized that medium to high loads are not currently achievable with this combustion system. To circumvent this limitation, our implementation is a mixed-mode HCCI/DI combustion, which relies on the use of an essentially unmodified common-rail CIDI engine, coupled with a highly effective atomizer for external mixture formation. With this concept, the engine can operate in HCCI mode, HCCI/DI mixed mode, or DI mode depending on the load, and with seamless, progressive mode transition. The concept has demonstrated extremely low levels of nitrogen oxides (below 3ppm) and smoke (FSN &lt; 0.03) and pure HCCI operation up to an IMEP of 4.7bar. These levels are an order of magnitude lower than for conventional diesel combustion. In this paper, we present a supervisory control strategy for a hybrid electric vehicle which best exploits the NOx characteristics of such a mixed-combustion mode engine, while optimizing fuel economy and meeting driver's demand. This strategy is an extension of our Adaptive Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (A-ECMS) control strategy, suitably modified to explicitly minimize NOx emissions. The HEV configuration, coupled to this control strategy, allows to very effectively manipulate the operating points of the engine to be primarily constrained in the HCCI regime, with very low NOx emissions. This results in dramatically reduced NOx emissions during actual driving conditions, while retaining the high fuel economy of CIDI engines and hybrids and maintaining the performance envelop of the vehicle. In summary, the control strategy automatically exploits the relatively small region of HCCI operation to minimize NOx emissions. © 2005 AACC.",,"Combustion; Control systems; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Ignition systems; Nitrogen oxides; Optimization; Reduction; Direct injection (DI); Homogeneous charge combustion ignition (HCCI); Premixed combustion; Supervisory control; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23944482893

Many large-scale irrigation projects in the arid and semi-arid regions are now facing structural changes. Water management responsibilities are being transferred from governments to end-users; water distribution management of gravity irrigation networks, designed for mono-cropping system, is becoming more complicated by diversifying cropping patterns; and predicted climate change may further bring constraints on water resource availability and management options. Therefore an assessment of the existing irrigation systems' capacity is important if existing irrigation systems were to adapt to social and climatic changes. In 2002, the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (Japan) and the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey initiated a research project, 'Impact of Climate Changes on Agricultural Production System in the Arid Areas.' Seyhan Basin in southern Turkey was selected as a study area. One of the largest irrigation districts in Turkey extends on the delta plain of Lower Seyhan with a total irrigable area of 133,000 ha. With the water supply from the big reservoirs in the upper stream, gravity irrigation is conducted with water efficiency lower than 50%. However, climate change experiments predict a decrease of precipitation in the upper basin. The plain has potential drainage and salinity problems, which may deteriorate either with saltwater intrusion caused by sea level rise, or with a change of water use in the district. For analyzing the irrigation district's adaptation capacity, we are applying a quasi three-dimensional irrigation water balance model that can simulate the effect of cropping patterns and distribution management on water balance. The model is coupled with a GIS database of soil classes, irrigation networks, groundwater levels, salinity, and cropping patterns. The model is composed of 3 modules. The Water Distribution Module represents water distribution rule, canal capacity, and losses from the canals. The SWAP Module calculates in-field soil water balance. The Spatial Water Balance Module calculates inter-field groundwater balance and drainage flow out, which would feed back lower boundary conditions to the SWAP Module. In the EWRI 2005, we will show possible impacts on the district, predicted under climate changes in the future, with several scenarios of water availability, land use and adaptive management options.

To preserve global environment, international cooperation is required and international effort should be considered. In 1997, the 3rd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(COP3) was held in Japan and the Kyoto protocol was adopted to decide the target and the concrete measure against global warming. For the case of Japan, the protocol indicates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6%, as compared to 1990 levels, between 2008 and 2012. However, the emissions are increasing at present and achievement of the target becomes a critical subject in Japan. Tokyo Gas, a city gas supplier, has started a research and development of SOFC as a part of energy conversion research in 1989. After that, we have developed a planner-type SOFC generating electric power of 1 kW under internal reforming in 1998. Then, we have shifted to the development of a low-temperature operable SOFC which has a lot of advantages like a life time etc., and an anode-supported planar SOFC which can operate at 750 degrees Celsius was developed in 2004. The generative efficiency of a. single cell stack is 55% DC (HHV) and 10 cell stacks generate electric power of 140W. In this way, Tokyo Gas has established the base technology of SOFC cell stack with high performance for a commercialization. (Part of this study was performed as R&D program of New Energy Industrial Technology Department Organization (NEDO).) Approach For the sake of contribution to global environment, Tokyo Gas, Kyocera, Rinnai and Gastar ware jointly engaged in the development of SOFC based generator to accelerate the commercialization. The joint project group adopted a low-temperature operable segmented-in-series flat tube cell stack. The segmented-in-series multi-segment electrode structure is designed by Tokyo Gas and the flat tube production technology is provided by Kyocera. This cell stack has many advantages of operating in low temperatures by the cell technology and of generating high-voltage/low-current power by the cell design. When the power generation was evaluated in both companies, the performance reached what we had designed. Since the flat tube manufacturing technology is suitable for a mass-production, low cost production would be realized. In order to build a SOFC system with high generative efficiency, it is necessary to reduce the heat loss and to optimize the internal temperature distribution. Therefore, by using the heat exchange technology and the fluid control technology cultivated by Rinnai and Gaster through a gas appliance development, we are finding solutions of the heat related problem. The target specifications for the commercialization are as follows. Generation capacity 5kW Generation efficiency 45% AC (HHV)Operation temperature < 750 degrees Celsius Because high generative efficiency of SOFC is fit for customers who need much electricity, then main target is settled for business market. Results We have developing the cell stack, bundle and the generation unit simultaneously to aim at early commercialization. The present results are shown as follows. ?Cell stack and bundle Power generation of more than 300W using a stack bundle in a test furnace has been confirmed. The generative efficiency is 52% DC (HHV) for a stack, and 49% for a bundle. (Both are tested with H2 fuel and calculated assuming the same performance using methane.) The stable operation of a cell stack for 2,000 hours was achieved. (Operation temperature is 700 degrees Celsius.) ?Generation unit (thermally self-sustainable) Both generation of 3kW of electricity and generative efficiency of 46.2% DC (HHV) have been achieved simultaneously. (It is tested with H2 fuel and calculated assuming the same performance using methane.) In addition, generative efficiency of 44.5% DC (HHV) at 2.4kW was confirmed with CH4 fuel. Conclusion We have started development of a segmented-in-series SOFC generation system operating in low temperatures for commercialization. Developments of the cell stack, bundle and the generation unit are successfully in progress and they indicate results as expected. In the future, we are going to improve the durability and to realize the low cost production in particular. A preliminary generation system will be introduced in field tests in 2007.",,"Cell stack; Commercialization; Greenhouse gas emissions; Kyoto protocol; Electric power generation; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytic cells; Gas emissions; Global warming; Performance; Solid oxide fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646577128

The electrochemical reaction mechanism that delivers a large capacity was found to occur differently in two potential regions, region A (1.4 to 0.4 V) and B (0.4 to 0.0 V). During the reversible process in region A, a lithium alkoxide (C-OLi) is formed on the carbonyl edge planes as solvated lithium complex of the C-O -Li+(solv.)n (n = 1, 2, or 3). The formation of the lithium alkoxide traps solvents on the edge surfaces preventing further intrusion into stacked graphene sheets, that in turn suppresses a exfoliation and stabilized repeated redox cycles. In region A, a Li2CO 3 and a LiF are formed as an SEI film by the reduction of solvents and LiPF6 making a smooth surface. region B involves three parallel processes, viz., a lithium intercalation into graphene layers, a lithium metal cluster deposition at nanosized voids or pores, and a formation of LiF by disproportionation of the C-OLi formed at region A. Since the LiF is produced rapidly by a proposed repeated cycle, the electrode surface generates a rough anomalous topology. © 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

It has graduated from the status of obscure scientific debate to that of a global geopolitical issue. Climate itself is a sophisticated concept that is somewhat different to that used or discussed in everyday life. The basic nature of the globe's climate is regulated by the global energy balance, as are the principal climate mechanisms. These in turn are modulated via the complex nonlinear interactions between the components that comprise the global climate system. These non-linear interactions generate an intense variability in climate that makes detection of small, secular trends in climate very difficult. The increase of carbon dioxide and surface temperatures is now being established as a fact, but the attribution of the temperature increase to carbon dioxide increases is a complex challenge. Due to constraints imposed by the current level of climate modeling technology we cannot perform crucial experiments in climate science. Accordingly we have to rely on a combination of numerical experiments, often with a considerable degree of parameterization of key climate processes and consensus among experts to reach provisional explanations concerning the causes, magnitude and intensity of climate change. Although the scientific research procedure is incremental in nature, the process of data collection, experimentation and verification of modeling outcomes, results in the steady accumulation of knowledge. It is this knowledge on which we rely for drawing conclusions about the state of the globe's climate and that policy makers use in drawing up recommendations related to mitigation of and adaptation to climatic variability and change. © 2005 World Health Organization.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859775540

This work is based on the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute's (JAERI) High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) prototype in Japan. This study has two major objectives: calculate the risk to onsite and offsite individuals, and calculate the frequency of different types of damage to the complex. A simplified HAZOP study was performed to identify initiating events, based on existing studies. The initiating events presented here are methane pipe break, helium pipe break, and PPWC heat exchanger pipe break. Generic data was used for the fault tree analysis and the initiating event frequency. Saphire was used for the PSA analysis. The results show that the average frequency of an accident at this complex is 2.5×10 -6/year which is divided into the various end states. The dominant sequences result in the end state that causes graphite oxidation, which does not pose a health risk to the population. The dominant sequences that could affect the population are those that result in a methane explosion and occur with a frequency of 6.5×10-8/year, while the other sequences are much less frequent. The health risk presents itself if there are people in the vicinity who could be affected by the explosion. This analysis also demonstrates that an accident in one of the plants has little effect on the other. This is true given the design base distance between the plants, the fact that the reactor is underground, as well as other safety characteristics of the HTGR. Sensitivity studies are being performed in order to determine where additional and improved data is needed.",,"Hydrogen; Nuclear reactors; Probability; Risk assessment; Software prototyping; Trees (mathematics); Health risk; Heat exchanger pipe break; High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR); Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA); Industrial plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745832270

A synthesis of climatic development during the Holocene (ca. 11,500 cal. yr BP to the present) is based on pollen-based quantitative temperature reconstructions, tree-line variations, chironomids, tree-ring records, speleothem data, glacier variations, and marine records (stable isotopes, species abundance, lithological changes) from the Nordic Seas. The Holocene has been regarded as a period of relatively stable climate, but recent evidence suggests there have been several significant millennial-scale climate fluctuations (larger than the post mid-19th century warming trend) throughout the Holocene. A general climate warming in the first part of the Holocene was punctuated by a few, abrupt climate reversals, centred at 10,000, 9,700, and 8,200 cal. yr BP. The data suggest there was a period of relatively warm conditions in the first half of the Holocene, in many areas warmer than in the 20th century, after which temperatures generally declined. The temperature decline was punctuated by centennial-scale warmer and colder periods with the most recent cold episode (~AD 1550-1925), including the “Little Ice Age”, being one of the coldest of the entire Holocene. The kind of data presented here can be used for detecting mechanisms and forcing factors behind the reconstructed climate variations and to study leads and lags in the Earth's climate system. A comparison between the climate-forcing factors and the Holocene records presented here suggests that the early Holocene thermal maximum observed in most records from the Nordic Seas region was caused by increased summer solar insolation to the northern Hemisphere. The suborbital millennial to decennial climate variability observed in the Holocene climate reconstructions was most probably a combined effect of solar activity changes, periods of increased explosive volcanism, and internal feedback mechanisms in the Earth’s climate system. Internal modes of the climate system variability (for example, the North Atlantic Oscillation) were most likely responsible for some of the observed climate variability in winter. In addition to external climate-forcing factors, meltwater from the retreating northern hemisphere ice sheets and abrupt, catastrophic lake drainage from ice-marginal lakes during the termination of the last Ice Age had a significant, regional climate impact. In the near future, it will be possible to combine high-resolution palaeo-climatic reconstructions with fully coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models in order to test the complex interactions between the different forcing factors to help explain the primary forcing factors and the accompanying feedbacks behind the observed Holocene climate development in the North Atlantic region. © 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149363903

The northern implications of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are examined, including the status of climate change action by the northern territorial governments, the evolving role of indigenous people, and the responsibility for climate change impacts. The difficulties surrounding natural hazards research in remote locations, and the approaches of indigenous people to natural hazards are then presented.

This paper will use three case histories to discuss the specific operational and emission issues that caused failures, and to draw general conclusions about the efficacy of emissions treatments during the process versus post-process. In each case the emissions problems required correction after construction and commissioning, thereby increasing the overall capital and startup costs. Gas flowrate, velocity and pressure drop will be considered in determining if treatment during the process can be the most effective alternative in meeting emissions standards.

Biofilters have been demonstrated to be an effective technology in reducing odor and gas emissions from these facilities. Large biofilter media beds sometimes prevent application of this technology to building layouts. A vertical biofilter may be an effective alternative. The research objective was to determine optimum biofilter construction to achieve uniform airflow as the media settles. Media thickness was determined to be a factor in achieving uniform airflow. For a minimum thick biofilter media of 30 cm, a parallel wall construction produced the least airflow variation. As the media thickness increased to 61 cm, airflow variation across the biofilter was reduced by increasing the taper between the side walls which support the media to 9.6 degrees. Improved media moisture distribution was achieved when the water soaker hose was placed on top of the media versus being suspended vertically through the media. The net value of this research will achieve a more efficient vertical biofilter.","Biofilters; Emissions; Odor; Odor abatement; Swine","Odor abatement; Uniform airflow; Vertical biofilter; Gas emissions; Moisture; Odors; Biofilters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645038894

For the stable blast furnace operation, precise controlled drainage is one of the important factors. Therefore, in this work, the effect of coke diameter, void fraction, coke diameter distribution, coke free space, impermeable zone, slag viscosity in a blast furnace hearth on drainage rates, gas-slag and slag-iron interfaces shapes and maximum gas-slag interfaces height were examined with a three-dimensional mathematical model. The results indicate that the conditions of the peripheral region at the taphole level determine the residual slag volume. The packed bed in the region 2.0 m from the taphole has about 50% of contribution to the residual slag volume. The void fraction change has the largest effect on the gas-slag interfaces height. The coke diameter distribution has little effect on the total drainage rate as well as the coke diameter of the uniform packed bed, coke free space, and impermeable zone bellow the taphole level. The taphole conditions dominate the total drainage rate under the terms of the assumed blast furnace conditions. The conditions of the peripheral region in the hearth determine the drainage rate patterns of the iron and slag. The peripheral region's permeability can be predicted from the drainage rate patterns of iron and slag, if precise measurement of the drainage rate patterns can be achieved. A drainage pattern, whether iron drains prior to slag or slag drains prior to iron, is largely affected by a drainage interval. © 2005 ISIJ.","Blast furnace hearth; Coke diameter; Iron and slag flow; Ironmaking; Numerical simulation; Residual slag volume; Slag viscosity; VOF method; Void fraction","Coke; Computer simulation; Drainage; Iron metallography; Slags; Viscosity; Blast furnace hearth; Iron and slag flow; Ironmaking; Slag viscosity; VOF method; Void fraction; Blast furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144485523

With respect to this last issue, the most common actions adopted in many countries are the prohibition of the noisiest aircraft and the limitation of the number of night flights.

In this paper we applied two different commercially available dilution systems (an FPS from Dekati Ltd and an MD19-2E from Matter Engineering AG) to record the particle emissions of a Euro II and a Euro III diesel passenger car. The latter was also fitted with a diesel particle filter (DPF) to simulate future emission levels. At their present development stage, both dilution systems failed to totally comply with all requirements of the PMP protocol. The main problems appeared to be the lack of accurate determination of the dilution ratio and the inability to reach the desired dilution temperature. However, they were able to eliminate nucleation mode particles and the results demonstrated that particle number concentration measurement is equally repeatable to the gravimetric method for the Euro III vehicle and even more so for the DPF one. Over the type-approval cycle, the Euro III vehicle was found to consistently emit below 1014 km-1 particles without a DPF and 1011 km-1 particles with the DPF. The exact level could only be determined with external dilution ratio determination.

In comparison to wild-type plants, carbon dioxide assimilation rates and total plant dry matter were up to 11% and 19% enhanced in the transgenics, when assessed on a whole-plant basis. Accumulation of carbohydrates and redox-related compounds such as ascorbate was also markedly elevated in the transgenics. Also increased in the transgenic plants was the capacity to use L-galactono-lactone, the terminal precursor of ascorbate biosynthesis, as a respiratory substrate. Experiments in which ascorbate was fed to isolated leaf discs also resulted in increased rates of photosynthesis providing strong indication for an ascorbate-mediated link between the energy-generating processes of respiration and photosynthesis.

Autoclaved aerated concrete AAC, originally introduced in Sweden in the late 1920s, is a lightweight material with no coarse aggregate, produced by mixing cement, lime, sand or fly ash, aluminum powder and water. In the United States, the use of AAC has been somewhat limited due to marketing conditions, lack of applicable building codes, lack of familiarity with design methodologies, and limited understanding of the advantages of AAC by the design and construction industry.

However, the alkali (K and Na) behaviour in biomass fuels is of major concern for its use in power generation. Unlike coal, in biomass combustion most of the alkali matter evaporates from the fuel and forms alkali sulphates and chlorides based on availability of sulphur and chlorine. Alkali matter in the form of alkali sulphates and chlorides causes deposits in the heat transfer part of the boiler and forms sub-micron ash that can cause environmental problems. In the past, studies have been conducted to understand the release mechanism of alkalis from biomass fuels, gas phase transformations and deposition. It was found that alkali release and transformations depends on various factors like fuel composition, operating conditions and the combustion system chosen for conversion. This paper summarizes the work done to understand the alkali behaviour in biomass fuels during combustion. In addition, the paper discusses the attempts made to minimize the alkali effects in biomass combustion.",,"Agricultural by-products; Alternative to fossil fuels; Biomass combustion; Combustion systems; Environmental problems; Operating condition; Release mechanism; Urban green wastes; Boiler deposits; Byproducts; Chlorine compounds; Coal combustion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Wood fuels; Biomass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878978766

For a case study, this study considers a firm owing aged coal-fired thermal power plants in the United States. The firm has an option to invest in an Integrated coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) no capture plant, IGCC capture plant, or Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) for the substitution of the aged power plants. The optimal investment behavior subject to stochastic CO2 emission allowance price, natural gas price, and social cost is calculated numerically in the study by using the Bellman equation and lattice models with few variables. The results show that not only CO2 emission allowance price and natural gas price but also social costs and their uncertainty influence the firm's decision to invest in capture plant, especially at an early date. It is suggested that direct subsidies from government to the firm's capital cost are worthwhile, but social preference that forms the characteristic of the social costs could be a key issue in a firm's decision for the investment in an emission reduction technology. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Soil respiration (the sum of root and microbial respiration) increases soil CO2 concentrations by 10- to 100-fold or more than that in the above-ground atmosphere, and such elevated concentrations have a variety of significant effects on soil systems. Because increased soil respiration is expected to result from future global climates, due both to elevated atmospheric CO2 and temperature, we developed a multibox model without steady-state assumptions to investigate the factors that regulate soil CO2 concentrations. Results suggest that below-ground CO2 concentrations are predominantly controlled by tortuosity of pores, depth distributions of root and microbial activity, and total production of soil CO2. Considering the dependence of soil respiration rates on climate, our results are significant in suggesting that future climate change will increase soil CO2 concentrations in direct proportion to increases of below-ground respiration.","CO2; Diffusion; Modeling; Respiration; Soil","Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Mathematical models; Microbiology; Soils; Global climates; Microbial activity; Soil respiration; Soil systems; Earth atmosphere; carbon dioxide; article; atmosphere; carbon dioxide measurement; climate; diffusion; microbial activity; model; soil respiration; steady state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11444260522

We have to change our thinking way and economic system from those that depend on fossil resource to those that depend on solar resource called natural energy. In our research field everybody will imagine that an electric vehicle is the best one in order to diminish or reduce carbon dioxide exhaust. The battery is not adequate as an energy source for electric vehicles, because the battery will soon be dead due to its low energy density and low power density. The fuel cell is more favorable than the battery, but the mass of fuel cell is still big and the fuel cell can only be replaced the internal combustion engine, so that the power transmission devices are still necessary. The new concept electric off-road vehicle proposed here is entirely different from above ones. The vehicle has neither combustion engine nor battery, but it has only electric motors. The energy to drive the motors is transmitted in the air as microwave of 2.45 GHz.

Flocculation test by four kinds of coagulant showed that PSI-100 is better than the other agents and that its optimal amount of applied coagulant was 0.3 mL/L. The prototype treatment plant consisted of filtration by polyethylene fiber sheet, sand and activated carbon was tested in order to know the decrease in the TBT concentration through the filtering materials. The experiment showed that the outlet TBT concentration can be optimally controlled by designing the length of each material taking account for their cost. A quantitative evaluation that can reflect local conditions, for example, societal, geographical, and environmental characteristics, becomes indispensable for the systematic treatment when remediation of marine environment is planned. In order to satisfy these demands, the sensitivity analysis for a mathematical model was done.

President Carlos Mesa has been pushing for a compromise that would reduce the effect of the tax increases, but the government may have a difficult time convincing the opposition parties that control Congress, as well as many of Bolivia's people, that foreign investors deserve a break. The proposed Hydrocarbons Law will reverse some of the 1996 reforms. The biggest change is a new 32% tax on oil and gas production that will be added to the existing 18% royalty rate already paid by producers. The bill also enhances the status of YPFB, the state-owned oil company, which was largely reduced to the role of a regulator under the 1996 law. BG, the second-largest holder of reserves in the country, is in a better position to weather the Bolivian storm as the remainder of its portfolio is far more balanced. Nevertheless, the company has a significant stake in Bolivia's future given that it has reserves of 4 tcf of gas and 170 million bbl of liquids in the country. BG produces some 72.5 million cu ft/day of gas in Bolivia, which is shipped to customers in Brazil. Brazil has already begun to signal its unhappiness with the new bill.

The afternoon temperature and the morning global radiation were the variables that accounted for most of the meteorological variability in summer and spring, while other variables that can be related to vertical mixing and dilution of primary pollutants (afternoon global radiation, wind speed, stability or day of the week) were more significant in winter. In addition, the number of days after a frontal passage was important to account for ozone build-up in summer and ozone destruction in winter. The statistical model proved to be a robust tool for reducing the impact of the meteorological variability on the ozone concentrations. The explained variance of the model, averaged over all stations, ranged from 60.2% in winter to 71.9% in autumn. The year-to-year variability of the seasonal medians of daily ozone maxima was reduced by 85% in winter, 60% in summer, and 50% in autumn and spring after the meteorological adjustment. For most stations, no significantly negative trends (at the 95% confidence level) of the summer medians of daily O3 Or Ox (O3+NO2) maxima were found despite the significant reduction in the precursor emissions in Central Europe. However, significant downward trends in the summer 90th percentiles of daily Ox maxima were observed at 6 sites in the region around Zürich (on average -0.73 ppb yr-1 for those sites). The lower effect of the titration by NO as a consequence of the reduced emissions could partially explain the significantly positive O3 trends in the cold seasons (on average 0.69 ppb yr-1 in winter and 0.58 ppb yr-1 in autumn). The increase of Ox found for most stations in autumn (on average 0.23 ppb yr-1) and winter (on average 0.39 ppb yr-1) could be due to increasing European background ozone levels, in agreement with other studies. The statistical model was also able to explain the very high ozone concentrations in summer 2003, the warmest summer in Switzerland for at least ∼150 years. On average, the measured daily ozone maximum was 15 ppb (nearly 29%) higher than in the reference period summer 1992-2002, corresponding to an excess of 5 standard deviations of the summer means of daily ozone maxima in that period. © 2005 Author(s).

These improvements should not impair engine reliability. On the contrary, the operational life of the engine should increase. These demands are conflicting and a compromise has to be found. This compromise requires a thorough comprehension of the fundamentals of friction generation and oil consumption in an automotive engine and in particular of the piston ring - cylinder liner contact. The surface roughness of a cylinder liner influences these two parameters. Nowadays, surface roughness is imposed by the machining process. But the surface topography can be improved by laser texturing. The current paper describes a transient analysis of a textured starved contact under pure rolling conditions. It shows the influence of the surface texture on oil thickness and pressure profile. Even if a piston ring contact operates under pure sliding conditions, these results allow the understanding of the possible interest of a textured surface. Steady state results for a smooth surface under pure sliding starved conditions are also presented in order to show a particular effect of sliding on the lubricant layer. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The article argues that distributive and procedural justice in the society of states and in crosslevel linkages are the key areas of social justice in international environmental governance. The article identifies responsibility for climate change impacts and assistance to vulnerable developing countries as the key distributive justice issues in adaptation to climate change. Key procedural justice issues in adaptation include the weak capacity of developing countries to protect their interests in international negotiations and the inability of local groups to participate in decisions that affect them.

The increasing demand for reliable and high power quality sources addresses the industrial research to focus on electrical technologies, which are mainly characterised by high efficiency and reduced emissions. In the sector of electrical power systems, Fuel Cell (FC) technology is now emerging as a suitable solution for stationary and transient power generation. FC source is able to satisfy the requirements of homes, commercial premises and high-power industrial plants, in terms of reliability and operating security. Moreover, today FC sources find lot of consensus for the application in the transport sector, due to their reduced environmental harmful emissions. The main advantages of using FC source in power applications are related to: efficiency: the estimated electrical efficiency is about 50% (about double than that of an internal combustion engine); the source is able to feed also partial load with high value of efficiency. This has high incidence on source weight and dimension; cleanness: fuelling by pure hydrogen, FC has no emissions, only the production of pure water; quietness: FC source has not moving parts, although a FC system may have pumps and fans. It constitutes a well benefit for applications in quite locations; modularity: it is possible to suite the source size to the load power demand; duration: FC source durability is high. The degradation processes acting in the cell depend mainly on the operating conditions; the decrease of the cell performances is characterised by an analytical model of reduced degradation coefficient, compared to the average operating life (less of some tens of?V/h). Finally, it is possible to summarize that the system reliability mainly depends on the auxiliaries. At the present there is a potential big market for fuel cell sources, due to their power/weight ratio, invariant efficiency to load variations, unlimited energy production, when provided with hydrogen and oxygen fuel. The interest in FC power applications is increasing. So that, focusing on the technological potential, it can be noted how, starting from a power density of scarcely 0.30 kW/l (0.16 kW/kg) in 1997, already in 2001, the FC technology has already reached the value of about 1.75 kW/l (1.22 kW/kg) in 2001. Although at the present fuel cell sources are not cheap, as use spreads, their price will decrease and the specific power will increase, making them more and more attractive for power applications. The opportunity to use FC source in power applications is related to its performances feeding electrical load. So that, it is necessary investigate, in terms of power quality indexes, on the ability of the source to supply load. The power quality conformity can be evaluated comparing the source output voltage to the required. In this case, testing the source by means of repetitive transient step changes in stack current, it is possible to focus on transient and steady state conditions. In particular, during transient conditions, the FC response time is related to its intrinsic characteristics; occasional adjustments for new operating conditions (on input mass, pressures,...) evidence that transient phenomena depend also by auxiliary inertia dynamics. In steady state condition, the increase of input flows can require large amounts of power drawn by the auxiliary, thus increasing parasitic losses, which affects the system net power. In the paper, the opportunity supplying pulsing loads by means of a hybrid FC-ultracapacitor electrical source is discussed. In the paper the models, validated by means of experimental tests, are proposed in stationary and transient conditions. They describe the main behaviours of the electrical sources, allowing to evaluate the advantage of coupling them. The hybrid system is tested for pulsing load, with the aim of examining the intrinsic characteristics of the sources during dynamics applications and the interactions between the sources and the load. The exam of the theoretical and experimental results are discussed in order to analyse the power exchanges between FC, ultracapacitor sources and load. The results obtained show that the performances of ultracapacitors turn out to be very suitable for supplying the power peaks of pulsing loads efficiently and avoiding an over-sizing of the fuel cell stack. The paper is organized in two parts. In the first part of the paper, the analytical model of FC and ultracapacitor are analytically discussed and experimentally validated. In the final part of the paper the hybrid system, made up of FC and ultracapacitor sources, are experimentally discussed in terms of power exchanges.",,"Degradation coefficient; Fuel cell-ultracapacitor power sources; Stack current; Capacitors; Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Reliability; Structural loads; UHF devices; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646540066

These included the shoreline ecology program (SEP) of 1990 and 1991 which detected little measurable impact of the spill, except at certain heavily oiled sites. In 1998, these 1990 and 1991 studies were updated The 1998 study found that small remnants of the spill from originally heavily oiled sites represent a minute fraction of the total shoreline area of PWS. Any isolated deposits of remaining oil residues from the spill were generally found at the top of the tide zone and were highly weathered and therefore not in a form and location that is available and toxic to biota. Between 1991 and 1998, there was a dramatic decrease in the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons at the ""worst case"" sites studied. The concentrations of PAH measured at these sites in 1998 were at least 3 times lower than the effects range-low (ER-L) sediment toxicity threshold values of 4022 ng/g for total PAH. Mussels sampled at heavily oiled ""worse case"" sites in 1998 also had dramatically lower tissue polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations compared with samples taken in 1993, indicating low bioavailability of any hydrocarbons present and thus low risk to biota. Natural interannual variability in the structure of the biological infaunal communities is the largest and most consistent signal observed in this study, not any residual effects of the oil spill. The results of statistical analyses of the data (ANCOVA) showed no indication of continuing oiling effects in 1998. Consistent differences were observed between oiled and unoiled reference sites, but they were only significant in one analysis. These differences were not related to differences in the total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present among sites. Any observed differences are more likely related to the fact that these ""worst case"" oiled sites were not selected in an unbiased, random manner.",,"Oil spill zone; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Sediment toxicity; Shoreline ecology program (SEP); Crude petroleum; Ecology; Marine biology; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Statistical methods; Toxic materials; Oil spills",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646018595

To study this phenomenon we modify the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to disaggregate the household transportation sector. This improvement requires an extension of the GTAP data set that underlies the model. The revised and extended facility is then used to compare economic costs of cap-and-trade systems differentiated by sector, focusing on two regions: the USA where the fuel taxes are low, and Europe where the fuel taxes are high. We find that the interplay between carbon policies and pre-existing taxes leads to different results in these regions: in the USA exemption of transport from such a system would increase the welfare cost of achieving a national emissions target, while in Europe such exemptions will correct pre-existing distortions and reduce the cost. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855275884

CNT paste is typically formulated by mixing of CNT powders, inorganic binder and organic vehicle. In our previous report, we obtained enhanced film uniformity and emission properties of CNT paste through the changing of inorganic binder from glass frit to spin on glass (SOG). For realization of high resolution FEDs, the emission characteristics of CNT emitter should be stable over very long periods of time for device application. To obtain reasonable emission stability and lifetime of screen-printed CNT emitter, the electrical aging treatment is very important. In this study, we investigated effects of electrical aging on emission stability of screen-printed CNT (sp-CNT) emitter. Photosensitive CNT paste was formulated by using of SOG as an inorganic binder. For uniform thickness and patterning of CNT paste, backside exposure and development process were carried out after screen printing and drying process. CNT emitter films were fired at 450°C in a N2 ambient. After activation treatment using adhesive tap, we characterized emission properties of sp-CNT and evaluated long-term emission stabilities before and after the electrical aging. In this case, we have adopted direct current (dc) voltage and a super used stainless steel (SUS) plate was used as the anode. The emission area was 1×1 cm 2 and the distance between cathode and SUS anode was maintained at 200 μm. The I-V characteristics and the Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) plots of CNT emitter before and after the electrical aging were shown in Figure 1. Stable and uniform emission currents from CNT emitter were obtained during the multiple field emission cycling. Before the lifetime measurement, we carried out the electrical aging by applying a constant voltage of 410 V (2.05 V/μm) for 72 h to CNT emitter. We can observe the emission current fluctuation at the initial stage of electrical aging. This current fluctuation was gradually reduced and electron emission stabilized as time passes. The CNT emitter showed remarkable difference in the emission characteristics before and after the electrical aging as shown in Figure l(a). The turn-on electric field, Eto, was defined as the electric field to obtain a current density of 10 μA/cm. The Eto of CNT emitter increased from 1.67 to 2.27 V/μm and then the total emission current was substantially decreased. From the F-N plots in Figure 1(b), we observed two characteristics regions. The I-V curve fits well to the F-N relation at the low field region. The I-V curve deviated from the linear F-N plot is due to current saturation of CNT emitters at the high field region. Although several mechanisms such as gas adsorbates and space charging effect have been proposed to explain current saturation phenomena, it is not clear yet. According to the F-N model, the field-enhancement factor (β) and the emitting area (A) were calculated from the slope and the intercept of the F-N plot by assuming work function of the CNT emitters to be 5 eV, similar to graphite. The calculated β values of the CNT emitter before and after aging were 1727.5 and 1720, respectively. The corresponding A values were dramatically decreased from 1.77 × 10-8 to 1.23 × 10 -11 after the electrical aging. It is suggested that the decrease in emitting area is attributed to the removal of relatively weak CNTs caused by resistive heating during the electrical aging at a high voltage, resulting in the suppressed emission current The long-term emission stability of CNT emitter was measured at constant voltage of 550 V (2.75 V/μm) after multi cycling and electrical aging. The current variation was represented in Figure 2 as a function of time. The electrical aged CNT emitter showed stable emission properties without degradation and arcing during operational time. The emission current fluctuation was less than 5 %. The emission current density of CNT emitter was approximately 387 μA/cm2 after 19 h (not shown here). After the electrical aging treatment, emission properties of CNT emitter were suppressed but long-term emission stability was improved. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Current voltage characteristics; Field emission; Field emission displays; Printed circuits; Stainless steel; Emission stability; Field emitters; Inorganic binder; Mass production; Carbon nanotubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947286698

The PDRM explicitly exploits knowledge of the number and locations of major stationary sources, source and transport wind directions, stack gas emission parameters, and meteorological plume dispersion parameters during sample collections to constrain solutions for individual sources. Model outputs include average emission rates and time-resolved ambient concentrations for each of the measured species and time-resolved meteorological dispersion factors for each of the sources. The model was applied to ambient Federal Reference Method SO2 and 30-min elemental measurements during an 8.5-hour period when winds swept a 70° sector containing six large stationary sources. Agreement between predicted and observed ambient SO2 concentrations was extraordinarily good: The correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.97, their ratio was 1.00 ± 0.18, and predicted SO2 emission rates for each of four large utility sources lie within 8% of their average continuous emission monitor values. Mean fractional bias, normalized mean square error, and the fractions of the predictions within a factor of 2 of the observed values are -2.7, 0.9, and 94%, respectively. For elemental markers of coal-fired (As and Se) and oil-fired (Ni) power plant emissions the average ratio of predicted and observed concentrations was 1.02 ± 0.18 for As, 0.96 ± 0.17 for Se, and 0.99 ± 0.41 for Ni, indicating that the six sources located in the wind sector between approximately 200° and 260° well accounted for background-corrected concentrations measured at the sampling site. Model results were relatively insensitive to the choice of upper bound used to constrain solutions.

Dietary strategies can aid in the reduction of many airborne emissions, including dust and ammonia. Management techniques to quell, capture, or eliminate these air contaminants are numerous but vary in their cost, effectiveness, and practicality. Endotoxins, microorganisms, and nitrogenous compounds also can adhere to dust particles. Techniques for dust control include simple house cleaning, oil and water fogging, windbreaks, different filters, precipitation, certain housing systems and equipment, and vegetative shelterbelts. Many of the same strategies to reduce dust will also reduce ammonia losses as well. Simple procedures, including good manure management, reducing stress and maintaining bird health, reduce nitrogenous losses.

The main aim for this project was to convert used cooking oil into biodiesel and then use this biodiesel in urban buses, contributing to reducing in one hand waste cooking oil that can create problems in the drainage city system and water contamination and on the other hand reducing engine polluting emissions. Departamento de Máquinas y Motores Térmicos (DMMT) facilities at the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (Spain) were used to conduct detailed performance and emission measurements in a Diesel engine similar to those used by the urban transport operator in Valencia (Empresa Municipal de Transporte, EMT). The test engines were operated with conventional Diesel fuel (EN 590) and three different biodiesel blends: 30, 50 and 70%, using the pure biodiesel obtained from used cooking oil (EN 14214). Tests were conducted using a modified year 2000 model, four stroke, 300 kW, Renault VI Diesel engine equipped with computer controlled electronic fuel injection system. The engine was not operated according to a standard test routine. Instead, an specific transient cycle was defined representing standard Valencia city bus performance. Using this specific cycle, real emission differences between conventional Diesel fuel and biodiesel were evaluated. In a further step, the use of biodiesel will be evaluated on a field test, using 350 urban transit buses on real service in Valencia city.

Such EM techniques include land magneto-tellurics MT, audio MT, marine MT and now Controlled Source EM - CSEM. The first three have been successful commercial exploration tools for some time now and are very good for answering regional geological questions in areas where seismic fails or is ambiguous.areas such as sub-salt, sub-volcanics sub-carbonates.ie poor seismic regions. The EM methods help the explorationist by measuring the passive electrical energy flow in the earth which allows for identification of regional conductor and resistor rocks. However the new CSEM technique that is getting the recent strong attention is rather different. Although it uses similar receiver technology to the passive method it then couples it with an active dipole EM source. Thus CSEM offers an entirely new set of applications for EM by its ability to image much thinner resistors down to 10's of meters rather than the 100's of meters of passive EM. CSEM has been effectively proven over the last 3 years as an exceptional new geophysical tool that can and already is changing the way companies work in exploration, appraisal and development. Of CSEM the CEO of a major US Oil Corporation recently stated something like: “Research in non-seismic electro-magnetic hydrocarbon detection has led to new technology for remotely detecting and imaging hydrocarbons from the earth's surface. This new technology “CSEM” holds great promise for accurately assessing potential hydrocarbon resources and reducing exploration risk” ….and others have described the technology as the most significant new E & P development since the transition from analog to digital…cdp stacking, 3D….and more recently DHI's and AVO.

A series of reference measurements were performed on a fixed route in Belgium in real traffic circumstances, including motorway, rural and city traffic. Three vehicles were used for the reference measurements: a passenger car, a delivery van, and a delivery truck. An on-board device recorded vehicle speed and GPS position on second-basis. The resulting speed profiles were used as input in the vehicle emission simulation program VeTESS to estimate fuel consumption and emissions of certain vehicles driving according to these speed profiles. Goal of these calculations was to quantify the effect of preventing traffic jams. From the simulations it was concluded that a reduction in average speed, does not necessarily lead to higher fuel consumption. Actually when average speed is reduced from speeds above 100km/h down to 80 or 60km/h, fuel consumption can even be expected to decrease. Of course traffic jams are more about low average speeds. The simulations showed that when average speed drops below 30 or 40km/h, fuel consumption increases significantly. Emissions of NOx, CO and HC also increase in this case. So concerning fuel consumption and emissions it is indeed worth the effort to prevent traffic jams and slow traffic and to improve the traffic flow. The role of traffic jam detection is very important to take measures to improve the traffic flow and this way save fuel and reduce emissions.

To prepare for it, it is appropriate first of all to study the variations in the climate of the past using extensive, homogenised series of meteorological or phenological data. General circulation models constitute the basic tool in order to predict future changes in climate. They will be improved, and the regionalisation techniques used for downscaling climate predictions will also be made more efficient. Crop simulation models using input data from the general circulation models applied at the regional level ought to be the favoured tools to allow the extrapolation of the major trends on yield, consumption of water, fertilisers, pesticides, the environment and rural development. For this, they have to be validated according to the available agronomical data, particularly the available phenological series on cultivated crops. In addition, climate change would have impact on crop diseases and parasites, as well as on weeds. Very few studies have been carried out in this field. It is also necessary to quantify in a more accurate way the stocks and fluxes of carbon in large forest ecosystems, simulate their future, and assess the vulnerability of the various forest species to a change in climate. This is all the more important in that some propagate species choices must be made in the course of the next ten years in plantations which will experience changed climate. More broadly speaking, we shall have not only to try hard to research new agricultural and forestry practices which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions or promote the storage of carbon, but it will also be indispensable to prepare the adaptation of numerous rural communities for the climate change (with special reference to least developed countries in tropical areas, where malnutrition is a common threat). This can be accomplished with a series of new environmental management practices suited to the new climatic order. © 2005 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892340243

When completed in 2006, the project will deliver Qatar north field gas to the United Arab Emirates and later on to Oman. The Dolphin project will develop part of the North Field in Qatar with an objective to deliver 2,000 MMSCFD of sales gas, to the United Arab Emirates on a yearly average basis during 25 years with possible 5 years extension. The onshore production facilities are designed for peak production of 2,100 MMSCFD of export sales gas corresponding to an inlet wellhead fluid feed rate of 2,600 MMSCFD. The Dolphin Gas Treatment facilities at Ras Laffan will also produce Condensates, Ethane, LPG's and solid Sulphur. The Dolphin Project development is being undertaken under Agreements with the Qatari Government represented by Qatar Petroleum (QP). Project implementation is the responsibility of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin) the joint venture company established by the UAE Offsets Group (Mubadala). Mubadala is the majority shareholder in DEL, with 51% ownership. The other strategic partners in the Dolphin Joint Venture are Total and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy), each holding a 24.5% equity stake. Dolphin is operating in Qatar as the Contractor on behalf of the Contracting Companies which are the three partners. This contract location in the North field was agreed upon between Dolphin and QP on 3rd December 2002 after the conclusion of the appraisal drilling campaign. This set the time line of the project. The first delivery of commercial gas to the emirates is planned by the end of 2006. Geologic and reservoir studies performed after the conclusion of the appraisal drilling program, confirmed that the reservoir can maintain the project gas sales plateau rate of 2.0 BSCFD for 25+ years without the need for upstream compression. The initial drilling campaign will be 24 production wells. Dependent on well and reservoir performance it may be necessary to drill additional wells to maintain the required level of gas production over twenty-five yearsThe expected commingled gas composition has been assessed using the gas composition produced from the different layers of the two appraisal wells adjusted for offset data. Reservoir simulation runs predicted the contribution of each of the four Khuff layers to the commingled flow. The range of H2S content range is 0.5-1.1%. The reservoir fluids will be produced from two offshore centers located at approximately 74 km (DOL2) an 90 km (DOL1) from Ras Laffan. Each center will consist of a single wellhead platform and a flare platform. The design of the platforms is based on a concept of minimum topside facilities and not normally manned operation. The well fluids will be transported to shore by two multiphase sub-sea pipelines (""wet"" scheme, gas, Hydrocarbon condensate and free water are transported simultaneously). Owing to the risk of hydrate formation during the transportation, a Low Dosage Hydrates Inhibitor will be injected from the platform during the winter months. A Corrosion Inhibitor will also be injected from both platforms all year round. The platforms are located in water depth of approx. 44m and 56m LAT respectively for DOL2 and DOL1. The onshore production plant at Ras Laffan will include all processing units, utilities, off-sites and infrastructure necessary to process and export sales gas, ethane, propane, butane, stabilised/sweetened condensate and solid sulphur. Sales Gas will be exported through a 48 sub-sea pipeline of approximately 360 km long to receiving facilities, located at Taweelah in the United Arab Emirates. The gas export line has an operating capacity of 3,200 MMSCFD to accommodate future increase of requirements At Taweelah, gas will enter the Eastern Gas Distribution System (EGDS) currently operated by Gasco and by Dolphin when Gas will flow from Qatar. Dolphin has installed in 2003 a 24 line between Al Ain and Fujairah and since January 2004, has been buying Oman gas to transport it and sell it to UWEC desalination and power plant at Fujairah. This pipeline has been connected in may 2005 to the Emarat network to supply Ras AI Kaiman who signed a purchase agreement with Dolphin in 2004. Sales agreements were concluded in 2003 with UWEC and ADWEC in Abu Dhabi. Discussions have been finalized with DUSUP in April 2005. Other contract is negotiated with Ras al Khaima and the sultanate of Oman. These agreements cover the 2000 MMSCFD production and may cover more. Dolphin is currently discussing the purchase of an additional 1000 MMSCFD of gas with the Qatari government.",,"Butane; Corrosion inhibitors; Ethane; Hydrocarbons; Liquefied petroleum gas; Natural gas well production; Petroleum reservoirs; Pipelines; Project management; Propane; Sulfur; Water; Well drilling; Commercial gas; Dolphin Project development; Project gas sales; Reservoir simulation; Solid sulphur; Natural gas fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745262571

Historically, the dominant industries in this area were leather tanning and chemical manufacturing. It is known that the latter released large quantities of metals, including arsenic and chromium into the watershed in the early to mid-1900s. Likewise, the industrial activities of the former are believed to be responsible for, and still contributing to, the elevated N levels in the Aberjona Watershed. Consequently, high levels of nitrate (NO 3 -) have accumulated downstream in the eutrophic, ∼51 ha Upper Mystic Lake (UML). As with many N-polluted lakes, NO 3 - levels frequently exceed 100 μM and contribute to the eutrophication of UML. In addition, NO 3 - acts as a powerful oxidant in the anaerobic reduction of organic matter and other elements. It has been shown that NO 3 - controls the cycling of iron and arsenic in UML, and it is hypothesized that the high concentration of NO 3 - has other direct effects on the biogeochemistry of the water. We use a novel sampling system as part of a program to establish the metabolic gas profiles of UML; data that is intended to more fully elucidate the redox balance of the lake during anoxia. In particular, the changing pool sizes of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) indicates the flux of reducing power due to carbon cycling. Moreover, as carbon metabolism is likely linked to transformations of nitrogen, and seeing that both CO 2 and CH 4 are greenhouse gases, N pollution may thus have effects on atmospheric release of these gases.",,"Anoxia; Leather tanning; Sampling systems; Arsenic; Lakes; Leather; Metabolism; Watersheds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744447285

In this contribution, we first review recent phylogenetic and molecular clock studies that estimate dates for high-level metazoan diversifications, in particular the origin of the major lineages of the bilaterally-symmetrical animals (Bilateria) including cnidarians. We next review possible ""internal"" triggers for the Cambrian explosion, and argue that pattern formation, those processes that delay the specification of cells and thereby allow for growth, was one major innovation that allowed for the evolution of distinct macroscopic body plans by the end of the Precambrian. Of potential ""external"" triggers there is no lack of candidates, including snowball earth episodes and a general increase in the oxygenation state of the world's oceans; the former could affect animal evolution by a mass extinction followed by ecological recovery, whereas the latter could affect the evolution of benthic animals through the transfer of reduced carbon from the pelagos to the benthos via fecal pellets. We argue that the most likely cause of the Cambrian explosion was the evolution of macrophagy, which resulted in the evolution of larger body sizes and eventually skeletons in response to increased benthic predation pressures. Benthic predation pressures also resulted in the evolution of mesozooplankton, which irrevocably linked the pelagos with the benthos, effectively establishing the Phanerozoic ocean. Hence, we suggest that the Cambrian explosion was the inevitable outcome of the evolution of macrophagy near the end of the Marinoan glacial interval. © 2005 The Paleontological Society.

A reaction is deemed up or down regulated if it is constrained to assume flux significantly above or below its respective steady-state values. The extent of deviation of a flux from its steady state values is quantified by using the ""regulation strength parameter"". Steady state fluxes for some of the reactions in central metabolism of Escherichia coli are fixed at experimental values available in literature. The remaining fluxes are estimated computationally using a series of linear programming problems. The computational difficulties arising due to hundreds of binary variables and bilinear products of binary and continuous variables make this a challenging problem to solve. The developed framework is demonstrated by studying the overproduction of ethanol in Escherichia coli. Computational results reveal the existence of synergism between reaction deletions and modulations implying that the simultaneous application of both types of genetic manipulations yields the most promising results. For example, the downregulation of phosphoglucomutase in conjunction with the deletion of oxygen uptake and pyruvate formate lyase yields 99.8% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield. Conceptually, the proposed strategies redirect both the carbon flux as well as the cofactors to enhance ethanol production in the network. In many cases, the predictions made by the framework pinpoint the crucial role played by cofactor availability in biochemical overproduction. The OptReg framework is therefore a versatile tool for strain design which allows for a broad array of genetic manipulations.",,"Biochemical engineering; Carbon; Chemical reactions; Computational methods; Enzymes; Ethanol; Linear programming; Metabolism; Optimization; Strain; Cofactors; Phosphoglucomutase; Microbiology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645642441

This dual action suggests particular sensitivity of the parasite to climate change and any associated impacts on hosts and other members of the community. While little research has addressed the responses of parasitic plants to climate change in natural environments, impacts are predicted from controlled environment studies together with a knowledge of the key ecophysiological traits of hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, in particular of Striga species, which are important weeds in semi-arid tropical agro-ecosystems, and Rhinanthus species, which can be important components of (principally) grassland communities in the northern temperate zone. The main mode of action of both elevated CO2 and warming will be through changes in photosynthesis and stomatal functioning. Enhanced photosynthesis of the hemiparasite and host will increase parasite carbon gains but may also increase the demand for host mineral nutrients. Mineral nutrition may, therefore, mediate the impacts of climate change on host-parasite associations. The relative insensitivity of hemiparasite stomata to elevated CO2 suggests that high stomatal conductances may be maintained and thus solute uptake may become limited by soil drying driven by higher rates of evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. Climate change impacts on host-parasite interactions at the individual level will ultimately affect hemiparasite impacts at the community level. Community impacts will be greatest where climate change considerably favours hemiparasite populations or, conversely, causes them to disappear from communities where they were formerly abundant. Impacts will further be mediated by climate impacts on hosts, and the natural enemies of hosts and parasites alike. Further, the wide host range of many root hemiparasitic plants may facilitate migration of their populations through new communities under a changing climate.","Carbon dioxide; Drought; Global warming; Host-hemiparasite interactions; Precipitation; Transpiration","climate change; global warming; hemiparasite; host-parasite interaction; parasitic plant; photosynthesis; plant water relations; Arida; Orobanchaceae; Rhinanthus; Scrophulariaceae; Striga; Striga asiatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22444442861

The method uses high-resolution hyperspectral imagery to detect and map the effects of elevated CO2 soil concentrations on the roots of the local plants. The method also detects subtle or hidden faulting systems which localize the CO2 pathways to the surface. Elevated CO2 soil concentrations deprive the plant root systems of oxygen which is essential for a healthy plant. Excessive soil CO2 concentrations are observed to significantly affect local plant health, and hence plant species distributions. Hidden faults can be mapped using the spectral signatures of altered minerals and of plant species and health distributions. Mapping hidden faults is important because these highly localized pathways are the conduits for potentially significant CO2 leaks from deep underground formations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The vessel continued its transit up the Cape Cod Canal, unknowingly leaking oil for another 26 km. An estimated 350,000 L of No. 6 heating fuel were released into the bay, and in spite of significant clean up efforts and a rapid response to the spill, strong and shifting winds dispersed the oil throughout Buzzards Bay. Nyes Neck Beach in North Falmouth, MA, was heavily impacted with the viscous fuel, and many small cobbles on the beach were coated with a dark black residuum. To investigate the short-term fate of PAH, compositional changes of the oil on Nyes Neck Beach cobbles were studied over a 6-mo period. In an opaque, oil-film surface, direct photolysis was hindered by light attenuation and inefficient quantum yields. The PAH-rich films, exposed to sunlight and in contact with amply triplet-state oxygen, were subjected to substantial degradation via indirect photoreaction with singlet oxygen. The strong light attenuation of the oil reduced the effective reactive layer to the upper 10% of the film, and PAH re-supply to that layer was hindered by unusually slow compound diffusivities in the thickened oil. Nevertheless, the oxidative power of highly reactive singlet oxygen did act to mobilize aromatic hydrocarbons from the solid phase.

If there is truth to the wistful aphorism that ""we learn from our mistakes,"" then our society is in position to learn a great deal about our world and how it works, which perhaps provides some ground for hope for the years to come. Environmentalism embodies fundamentally rational and realistic principles of analyzing scientific fact, human needs and behavior, values and risks, and issues of policy and governance - so therefore, as in the past, against protracted retrogressive opposition, citizen environmentalism will undoubtedly continue to play an indispensable societal role. The title of this presentation and essay, when first hypothesized in the summer of 2004, seemed a useful and somewhat light-hearted approach to the subject and the occasion. Over the years, citizen environmentalism has been critically important in catalyzing and shaping the development of environmental protection law and policy, and citizen effort often has been necessary to force corporate and public officials to address the practical as well as legal deficiencies of their ongoing projects and programs. According to the original plan, a series of piquant, revealing vignettes of official astigmatism might usefully illustrate the critically important role that citizens continue to play in twenty-first century societal governance. But since then, as I suspect most observers have noticed, the near-term prospects for environmental protection policies here in the United States have become a good deal more problematic. There was a national election in November 2004, you may recall, and it did not turn out well for the environment. The current administration, embodying a cresting New Right movement, has implemented an unprecedented agenda for eroding fifty years of bipartisan development of environmental laws, presenting civil society with a very substantial challenge. Then in February of 2005 the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change officially came into force - a small, shaky, but crucial collective international first step toward planetary climate sanity - but the United States of America, which had initiated the global carbon trading plan in the first place, decided to back off into a corner, sulking, isolated. Also quite recently, a dramatic and petulant critique essay entitled The Death of Environmentalism has been lobbed into the midst of the national environmental policy debate and received a great deal of attention for its declarations that what U.S. environmentalists have been doing for the last few decades is all wrong. So it seems high time that citizen environmentalism in this country gives itself a gut check. This essay seizes an opportunity to pull together an analysis that goes a good deal beyond a simple two-pronged finger-pointing at ""dumb and dumber."" The more I thought about it, the more it seemed worthwhile to define and distinguish five different categories of dumb, not just two, and that is what this essay attempts to do, seeking to derive some useful observations from those five distinctions. The essay draws upon the short history of environmental law and some of the particular issues with which, working with many students and friends, I've been involved over the years. It lays out some facts and themes that may help in the conversation about how we can make the most of what we are, to get our society and planet to a better and more sustainable future. Like most environmental analyses, moreover, an examination of the interactive cyclic history of environmental knowledge and policy in the United States over the past forty years teaches broader and deeper lessons, beyond the reaim of purely ""environmental"" issues, with significant relevance for the success of modern democratic governance generally.",,"environmental policy; environmental politics; environmental protection; environmentalism; Kyoto Protocol",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745094159

The attention has been focused on the emissions of pollutant gases and on the unburned carbon in elutriated fines. Steady-state combustion experiments were carried out at different temperatures by feeding pre-dried sludge particles into an inert bed of ceramsite particles. The 9.4 cm i.d. combustor was operated at superficial gas velocities of 0.3-0.8 m s-1 and at different excesses of air. Very small amounts of unburned carbon in the fly ash separated by the cyclone (below 0.8 mass %) and generally very low levels of carbon monoxide in the exit flue gas (usually below 50 ppm) document very good combustion efficiency attained in a bubbling (dense) fluidized bed. Although conversions of the fuel nitrogen, measured under practical conditions, to NOx and N 2O amounted to only about 10% and 5%, respectively, the resulting harmful emissions must be of serious concern. The measured content of NO x varied between approximately 600 ppm and 1100 ppm, in the case of N2O it was 150-400 ppm. The emissions of CO and NOx are closely interdependent and connected: the lower concentration of CO is in flue gas, the higher level of NOx measured. Higher operating temperatures, higher partial pressures of oxygen, and longer residence times in the combustor improved the combustion efficiency, according to the amount of unburned CO, CxHy, and carbon. Unfortunately, such process conditions inherently lead to unwanted higher conversions of the fuel-bound nitrogen-to-nitrogen oxides.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646791863

The set-up of realistic emission scenarios requires accurate emission inventories including the whole methodology used to calculate the emissions. This means a good description of the source characteristics including a detailed composition of the emitted fluxes. Two main approaches are used. The so-called bottom-up approach that relies on the modification of the characteristics of the sources and the topdown approach whose goal is generally to reach standard pollutant concentration levels. This paper is aimed at providing a general methodology for the elaboration of such emission scenarios and giving examples of applications at local and regional scales for air quality management. The first example concerns the impact of the installation of the urban tramway in place of the road traffic in the old centre of Strasbourg. The second example deals with the use of oxygenated and reformulated car fuels on local (Strasbourg urban area) and regional (upper Rhine valley) scales. Finally, we analyze in detail the impacts of the incoming European emission regulation for 2015 on the air quality of the upper Rhine valley. © 2005 Author(s).

Greenhouse gases, harmful and hazardous inorganic and volatile organic compounds (VOC s), nauseous odors - these are just some of the problems to be solved to ensure a healthy and comfortable environment for future generations. The principal sources of modern air pollution are vehicles, industrial sites, and municipal facilities dealing with water treatment, collection and disposal of waste, etc. (Table 14.1). There are several approaches to the problem. The preferred solution is, of course, the development of new ""green"" technologies that impose less burden on the environment, and the use of new, cleaner energy sources, including non conventional ones. Nevertheless, efficient abatement technologies, i.e., endof-pipe solutions, will in the near future remain an essential tool for reducing air pollution. Whatever future advances we make in industrial production, one element of modern civilization will continue to aggravate air pollution. Mankind generates more and more waste, and its collection, disposal and recycling is a substantial factor in the sustainable development of our economies. All these activities generate various odors and smells that are detrimental to the environment and quality of life. These problems will persist indefinitely, and the only for eseeableremedy is the development of efficient and economical ways to treat these sources of air pollution. Biological methods of air purification are indispensable when large and diluted volumes of VOC s and|or odor-laden air are to be treated (Cox and Deshusses 1998; Devinny et al. 1999; Cox and Deshusses 2000; Share efdeenet al. 2003). Their main advantages over traditional methods (incineration, activated carbon adsorption, etc.) are well known and mainly reside in low operational costs. Moreover, they do not generate secondary waste streams and or pollutants, and are readily accepted by regulating authorities and thegeneral public. Bio filtration has been successfully used to neutralize odors ofdifferent origin (agricultural, municipal, industrial) containing sulfur and nitrogencompounds, and to remove an impressive number of various volatile chemicals. These include solvents and diluents (BTEX, aliphatic hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, chlorinated compounds, etc.), and components used in the industrial production of polymers, plastics and dyes (styrene, vinyl chloride, epichlorohydrine, formaldehyde, phthalates, cyclohexanone, etc.), including recalcitrant and poorly biodegradable ones (Devinny et al. 1999). The difference between VOC and odor abatement is tenuous. It depend son individual circumstances and national legislation, and can be considered purely semantic. However, it is worth outlining someof the differences between the two principal bio filtration applications (Table 14.2). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895268469

It was established that ""Chromic Luvisol-maize - Dry land"" combination was associated with the greatest coefficient of variability of yields (Cv = 43%) and drought frequency (in 22 years with yield losses more than 20%) over the analysed period. Average yield losses in dry vegetation seasons were 60% of maize productivity potential under sufficient soil moisture. Traditional and drainage controlling precise irrigation scheduling mitigated drought consequences by reducing year-to-year variability of yield to Cv = 5.6-11.6% on risky Chromic Luvisol. Long-term wheat yields were much more stable (Cv = 23-26%) than those of maize on Chromic Luvisol. In this case droughts covered 12 of the studied 30years in which yield losses were 25-30% on the average. Soils of high water holding capacity (as Vertisol) stored 50-150mm additional precipitation for crop evapotranspiration and thus reduced frequency of drought under both crops to 6-7 cases in 30years. Agriculture should be more sustainable on this soil since variability of yield dropped to Cv = 13% for wheat and respectively Cv = 21% for maize. As a result Vertisol mitigated yield losses during dry vegetation periods by 10-15% for wheat and 22% for maize if compared with productivity under sufficient soil water. Thirty-year frequency analyses of seasonal nitrogen (N)-leaching, proved that ten of wheat and only one of maize vegetation seasons were susceptible to significant (10-45kgN/ha/year) ground water pollution on Chromic Luvisol. Simulated precise irrigation scenario did not influence drainage in vegetation period. Another risky situations occurred under maize in the wettest fallow state after extremely dry vegetation (in one more of the studied years) when up to 18-33kgN/ha/year might be leached. Earlier wheat sowing (on the 1st instead on the 15th of October) and nitrogen fertiliser split application timed as close as possible to the period of maximum crop N-uptake reduced nitrogen available for leaching under both crops. Drainage-controlling irrigation scheduling decreased maize drainage in fallow state by 30-40% in half of the years and caused 10-12% yield losses in average and dry seasons on Chromic Luvisol. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Adjusted CERES wheat was validated over a range of soils, varieties, climate, and management conditions and proved acceptable reliability of model predictions in most of the tested situations. The highest degrees of association (R2 &gt; 0.85%) was established between observed and simulated series of potentially extractable soil water (PESW) on fertilised Vertisol and Chromic Luvisol when the error (RMSE) ranged from 8.9 to13.3 mm in moderately wet, moderate and dry wheat vegetation seasons.

The terrestrial ecosystem flux for atmospheric CO2 for the Amazon region of South America has been predicted between a biosphere source of -0.17 Pg C per year (in 1983) and a biosphere sink of +0.64 Pg C per year (in 1989). The areas of highest variability in net ecosystem production (NEP) fluxes across all of South America were detected in the south-central rain forest areas of the Amazon basin and in southeastern Brazil. Similar levels of variability were recorded across central forested portions of Africa and in the southern horn of East Africa, throughout Indonesia, and in eastern Australia. It is hypothesized that periodic droughts and wildfires associated with four major El Niño events during the 1980s and 1990s have held the net ecosystem carbon sink for atmospheric CO2 in an oscillating pattern of a 4-6-yr cycle, despite observations of increasing net plant carbon fixation over the entire 17-yr time period.","Carbon; Ecosystems; Remote sensing; Soil","Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Biospherics; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; NASA; Remote sensing; Soils; Carnegie-ames-stanford approach (CASA); Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Net ecosystem production; Oscillating pattern; Satellite observations; Southeastern Brazil; Southern Hemisphere; Terrestrial ecosystems; Ecosystems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77249099815

Every tenth of a percentage increase in the recovery efficiency results in significant reduction in the emission of harmful pollutants. Pollution levels and the effects they are having on nature have reached alarming proportions in some regions of the world, and many countries have taken, and continue to take steps to reduce the emission of these pollutants, and minimize the damage caused by them. Process control and emissions monitoring play a key role in the optimization of any Claus-based SRU process, as the increase in recovery efficiency leads to a direct reduction in emissions of toxic pollutants to the atmosphere.Analytical techniques and sample system methods have enhanced and improved overall operations and control of modified Claus-based sulfur recovery units and tail gas treating processes. Additional analyzers, including continuous emissions monitoring equipment, may provide reduced down-time and aid in troubleshooting potential bottlenecks in SRU plants. Continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) systems are required for reporting purposes, a CEM may also aid in the optimization of Claus SRUs. Furthermore, some CEM designs are capable of providing process operators with additional tools to enhance operations, such as calculating overall recovery efficiency, as well as reporting mass emission rates on a continuous basis.

They also provide a rational option for land use within the EU that could be economically viable, provided that an appropriate financial and policy environment is developed. If 80% of current set-aside land in the UK were used for production of biomass crops for electricity generation, about 3% of current UK electricity demand could be met from this source. Considering possibilities for increasing yields and land area devoted to such crops over the coming decades, this could possibly rise to 12%. These estimates exclude consideration of developments in electricity generation which should increase the efficiency of conversion. Also, the use of combined heat and power units at local level (e.g. on farms or in rural communities) gives additional energy saving. Dedicated biomass crops such as willow, poplar, miscanthus, switchgrass or reed canary grass are perennials: in comparison with annual arable crops they would be expected to deliver additional environmental benefits. The elimination of annual cultivation should give a more stable environment, beneficial for farmland biodiversity. Some increase in soil organic matter content is likely, leading to some sequestration of carbon in soil and long-term improvements in soil quality. The impact on water quality may be positive as nitrate losses are small and a similar trend is expected for phosphate and pesticides. However, these crops may well use more water than arable crops so their impact on water resources could be negative - an issue for further research. Agricultural land can also be used to produce liquid fuels for use in transport. At present biodiesel can be produced from oilseed rape and ethanol from either sucrose in sugar beet or cellulose from virtually any plant material. In the short-term, liquid biofuels are an easy option as they require little change to either agriculture or transport infrastructure. However, their benefits for CO2 emissions are much less than for biomass used for generating electricity. It is therefore necessary to debate the priorities for land use in this context. © 2005 Association of Applied Biologists.","Biofuels; Emissions; Miscanthus; Poplar; Reed canary grass; Switchgrass; Willow","biofuel; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16444368034

To address this issue, we examine the effect of volatiles on melting to determine if regions of low seismic velocities may also be interpreted as regions of melting without elevated temperatures. We find that for the very small amounts of H 2 O in the oceanic mantle, the effect on solidus temperatures is a reduction of at most ̃13°C, which can be neglected. In contrast, even the smallest amount of carbonate reduces solidus temperatures more than 300°C at pressures greater than 1.9 GPa. The close match between detailed seismic imaging of the upper boundary of the low-velocity zone on the East Pacific Rise and the sharp temperature decrease for the carbonated lherzolite solidus at ̃1.9 GPa supports earlier suggestions that the low-velocity zone (̃70-150 km depth) is caused by melting due to the presence of carbonate. For locally elevated concentrations of carbonate subducted into the mantle along with oceanic crust, melting of the resulting carbonated lherzolite and carbonated eclogite could also occur at greater depths, possibly into the lower mantle, without elevated temperatures. Thus seismic imaging of deep low-velocity regions may reveal the locations of old subducted crust rather than hot plumes. © 2005 Geological Society of America.","Carbon dioxide; Carbonatite; Low-velocity zone; Mantle melting; Plume","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Melting; Seismic waves; Seismology; Structural geology; Carbonatites; Core-mantle boundary; Elevated concentrations; Elevated temperature; Low velocity zones; Mantle melting; Plume; Temperature decrease; Velocity; carbon dioxide; carbonate; carbonatite; high temperature; mantle; melting; seismic velocity; temperature effect; volcanic eruption; East Pacific Rise; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874961533

The pursuance of risk management hinges on four fundamental considerations: a) a threshold for a particular system of interest; b) understanding of the response of that system to climate variability and/or change; c) understanding of the probabilities associated with different climate futures; d) one or more management options or strategies for reducing risk. Integrating these four components in the process of risk management is a non-trivial task, particularly for complex systems. Stochastic simulation such as Monte Carlo analysis is a useful tool for achieving such integration in a modelling environment. Monte Carlo techniques were applied in the analysis of impact assessment data from the United States to assess the uncertainty associated with the direction and magnitude of different impacts over a range of climate futures and estimates of sectoral responses. Bayesian techniques were used in the quantification of the probabilistic uncertainty associated with global and U.S. changes in climate and sea-level in 2025, 2050, and 2100 using different assumptions regarding future greenhouse gas emissions and climate sensitivity. In addition, the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation to constrain future uncertainty in climate parameters, and thereby reduce climate impacts, was assessed using the WRE 750/550/350 stabilisation scenarios as constraints on future emissions. Monte Carlo simulation was used to integrate posterior probability distributions for climate variables with probabilistic impact response functions for a number of key sectors including agriculture, energy, coastal protection, water resources, freshwater biodiversity, and human mortality. Impact distributions indicated there is significant uncertainty associated with future climate change impacts. This uncertainty becomes increasingly less constrained as one's time horizon extends further into the future. For a number of sectors, even the direction of impacts (e.g., damages vs. benefits) could not be determined with a high degree of confidence. Nevertheless, the results indicated that significant climate change impacts are likely in future decades including economic impacts of plus-or-minus several billion dollars, thousands of excess deaths, significant reductions in suitable habitat for wildlife, and reductions in runoff and subsequently, water availability. The impact distributions also revealed that where potential benefits are likely, there remains a lower, but not necessarily negligible, probability of significant adverse effects, and vice versa. Given a particular critical threshold, these impact distributions can be used to estimate the likelihood of threshold exceedences, and subsequently, provide guidance on the need for risk treatment actions. More stringent thresholds create greater perceptions of risk and thus greater demand for risk treatment, while less stringent thresholds have the opposite effect. Greenhouse gas mitigation generally reduced the risk of adverse climate change impacts. However, the benefits of mitigation were quite limited pre-2050, and even in later decades, stringent stabilisation levels were needed to significantly reduce risk. Mitigation largely benefited the avoidance of large-scale consequences, but did little toward avoiding nearterm and/or smaller scale consequences, which are likely those of most relevance to current decision-making activities. Probabilistic risk assessment offers a useful framework for managing decision-making events challenged by uncertainty. Yet there are important challenges to consider. Uncertainty regarding appropriate ranges and distributions for model parameters introduces subjectivity into Bayesian analysis. Uncertainties associated with impact estimates increase rapidly over time, and dynamical system properties can influence estimates of risk. The spatial scale of analysis must be tailored to ensure results are relevant to decision-making. Finally, in order for the development of methodologies for climate change risk analysis to ultimately benefit decision-making, considerable effort must be invested to ensure that risk assessment is combined with societal preferences for impact thresholds, risk aversion, discounting, and risk treatment within the larger context of risk management.","Climate change; Greenhouse gas; Impacts; Mitigation; Risk management","Adverse effect; Anthropogenic climate changes; Bayesian Analysis; Bayesian techniques; Climate change impact; Climate change risks; Climate impacts; Climate parameters; Climate sensitivity; Climate variability; Climate variables; Coastal protection; Critical threshold; Degree of confidence; Economic impacts; Freshwater biodiversity; Future climate; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Human mortality; Impact assessments; Impacts; International researches; Management options; Mitigation; Model parameters; Modelling environment; Monte carlo analysis; Monte Carlo Simulation; Monte Carlo techniques; Non-trivial tasks; Perceptions of risks; Potential benefits; Probabilistic impact; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Probabilistic uncertainty; Risk aversion; Risk treatment; Robust decisions; Societal preferences; Spatial scale; Stochastic simulations; Suitable habitat; System property; Time horizons; Water availability; Anthropogenic climate changes; Freshwater biodiversity; Greenhouse gas mitigation; International researches; Monte Carlo techniques; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Probabilistic uncertainty; Stochastic simulations; Associated gas; Biodiversity; Computer simulation; Dynamical systems; Estimation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Rating; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Shore protection; Stabilization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Water resources; Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Dynamical systems; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Sea level; Shore protection; Stabilization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Water resources; Climate change; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053120535

The economic feasibility and competitiveness of soil C sequestration depends on the opportunity cost per tonne of C stored. The key issue is whether the cost is competitive with alternative methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The high spatial variability in land productivity means that the soil characteristics are important when designing public policies to address this issue. Empirical evidence suggests that the opportunity cost per tonne of C stored can be as low as US$10 to US$25 t -1 (Can$12-30), but that for the majority of temperate agriculture it exceeds US$50 t-1 (Can$60). The final monetary value placed on a tonne reduction of C will emerge either from the establishment of a fully functioning market or from government payment schemes. Estimates of the value of stored C have ranged from US$100 t-1 (Can$120) to a low of less than US$5 t-1 (Can$6). Current evidence suggests a likely price in the lower region of this range.","Carbon farming; Carbon sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Soil sustainability","agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; organic carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144461071

Of these, the technique of Life Cycle Carbon Analysis (LCCA) is developed as an effective tool for the comparison of options for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, for the introduction of energy-efficient processes, and for the utilization of renewables in power generation or liquid fuel production. Comparisons may be made in terms of carbon payback time per ton of carbon invested, or in terms of the lifetime cost per ton of CO2 foregone or sequestered. Examples are given of coal-fired power generation with CO2 removal and sequestration, domestic energy-saving equipment and small-scale renewable energy installations. These enable some generic conclusions to be drawn about the current state of technologies for greenhouse gas reduction/sequestration, and also lead to target costings per ton of CO2 equivalent avoided. These costings indicate that, with current technology, investments in the containment of HFCs, in CH4 leakage reduction, and in straightforward measures for energy efficiency and energy conservation, are all far more cost-effective than CO2 capture technologies. In particular, cost-effective and carbon-effective reductions in emissions of non-C02 green house gases are far more readily achievable than CO2 reduction measures, both economically and in engineering terms. LCCA demonstrates that policies that address the impact of these releases show the most immediate and tangible benefits. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the above compounds have obviously suppressing effects on the total amount of PCDD/Fs formation from PCP below 280°C. The interaction of basic metal oxides with the acid precursor PCP and the destruction of products from the decomposition of nitrates on PCDD/Fs were speculated to reduce their formation.

It has the potential nearly to eliminate engine-out NOX emissions while producing diesel-like engine efficiencies, when a pre-mixture of gas-phase fuel and air is burned spontaneously and entirely by an autoignition process. However, when direct injection is used for diesel fuel mixture preparation in engines, the complex in-cylinder flow field and limited mixing times may result in inhomogeneity of the charge. Thus, in order to minimize non-uniformity of the charge, early injection of the fuel is desirable. However, when fuel is injected during the intake or early compression stroke, the use of high-pressure injection is limited by the relatively low in-cylinder gas pressure because of spray impingement on the cylinder walls. Thus, it is also of interest to consider low-pressure injectors as an alternative. In the present paper, the parametric behaviour of the combustion characteristics in an HCCI engine operated with a low-pressure fuel injector were investigated through numerical simulations and engine experiments. Parameters including the start-of-injection (SOI) timing and exhaust gas recirculation were considered, and diesel and n-heptane fuels were used. The results show good agreement of behaviour trends between the experiments and the numerical simulations. With its lower vaporization rates, significant effects of the SOI timing and intake gas temperature were seen for diesel fuel due to the formation of wall films. The modelling results also explained the origin of high-temperature NO x-producing regions due to the effect of the gas density on the spray. © IMechE 2005.","Combustion; Direct-injection diesel engine; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Low-pressure fuel injector","Combustion; Computer simulation; Diesel fuels; High pressure effects; Ignition; Mathematical models; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Pressure effects; Vaporization; Direct-injection diesel engine; High-pressure injection; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Low-pressure fuel injector; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22044448377

The primary objectives were to verify emissions inventories and demonstrate the feasibility of installing affordable emissions reduction technology on marine vessels as well as compliance with future regulatory emissions limits. The tests also provided an opportunity for Canada to share information on emissions program and technology developments with U.S. regulatory authorities. This may lead to developing joint emissions reduction initiatives for existing marine vessels. This paper describes the field-testing of a water injection system (WIS) to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from ocean-going vessels. Tests were conducted on a semi-dedicated basis during voyage and under steady-state conditions. The emissions measurements were taken in accordance with ISO 8178-4-E3 protocol and using both marine diesel oil and intermediate fuel oil, which enabled the evaluation of the impact of different fuel type and quality on emissions. An initial series of tests was carried out on the MV Cabot in March 2004, followed by a second series of tests on the same vessel in March 2005. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of a low-cost WIS for reducing NOx emissions in marine diesel engines. They also showed that water injection reduces NOx at the expense of an increase in both particulate matter and carbon monoxide when using intermediate fuel oil. NOx reductions varied between 10 and 35 percent, and were most effective at high water injection ratios above 50 percent engine load. The test results showed no negative impact of the WIS on fuel consumption or engine operation and performance. This paper compares the results obtained from the consecutive series of tests in terms of the effectiveness of NOx reduction, and analyses the results in the context of other full-scale test results obtained from emissions control system vendors and engine suppliers. It also investigates the theoretical process and technology of water injection through charge air fumigation, and both direct water and fuel/water emulsion injection. In addition, the effects of water injection on engine emissions, operation and maintenance, and the optimization of water injection from a knowledge-based perspective are discussed. Further testing and development of the WIS are required to realize optimal emissions reduction potential and to determine the impact of water injection on fuel consumption, and engine operational performance as well as the impact of fuel quality on emissions.

This study quantifies the benefits of several policies enhancing the flexibility of carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation, with emphasis placed on emissions trading, optimal timing paths and support for learning-bydoing (LBD) in the use of low-carbon technologies. We present illustrative results for a “Soft-landing” scenario, which imposes a CO2-emission stabilization target that is consistent with stabilizing CO2 concentration at 550 ppmv in the long run. This analysis has been conducted with the Global MARKAL Model (GMM), which is a multi-regional, “bottomup”, partial equilibrium energy-system model with endogenized technology learning (ETL). Incorporation of flexible CO2 mitigation policies leads to significant reductions in energy-system costs and marginal costs of CO2 abatement as well as increasing diffusion of advanced low-carbon technologies.

Energy from biomass provides about 13% (130 PJ) of all Austrian primary energy consumption today. Small BMDH plants have gained increasing importance in the past 20 years as providers of domestic heating in rural areas in Austria. The advantages of BMDH as compared to traditional heating systems are well known in Austria. BMDH would eliminate fuel handling at the individual level, allow the provision of continuous heat, and reduce emissions significantly. Despite these advantages, the introduction of BMDH in Austria was by no means an easy process. It was only successful because of a unique combination of top-down policies and local bottom-up initiatives. The case of BMDH in Austria shows the complexity of establishing a renewable energy system. It is of fundamental importance for successful renewable energy policies to address this complexity while avoiding a simplistic economic and technical focus. Resources need to be made available for a systemic management during the introduction of renewable energy technologies. Money invested in proper advice, monitoring of technical development, benchmarking, quality control, educational measures, and promotion based on a profound understanding of the social processes in communities is an indispensable prerequisite for success. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A catalytic converter needs to reach a certain temperature before the chemical reactions take place (light-off). Recently, the new regulations on emission standards have prompted a reconsideration of the design of automotive catalytic converters in order to reduce the light-off period of the catalyst. The catalytic converter light-off period is very Important since almost 80% of the emissions from vehicles occur within the first three minutes after cold start in the FTP-75 test. In order to meet these new regulations, current studies have suggested that the catalyst should be ""close-coupled""; that is fitted close to the engine exhaust manifold. In order to design ""close-coupled"" converters, the designer may have to resort to truncated inlet and outlet cones, or distorted inlet pipes due to space limitations. Hence, it is very difficult to achieve good mixing of the exhaust gas, and a good flow distribution at the inlet cross section of the monolith. Based on such a current status in the study of the catalytic converter, the present work focuses on the time-dependent flow patterns, both in the exhaust manifold and the catalytic converter using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A three-dimensional grid model of an engine exhaust manifold and a close-coupled catalytic converter was developed and analyzed. The flow simulations were performed using MVA-3 for non-reacting flow fields. These simulations were performed with transient boundary conditions applied at the inlet to the exhaust runners to simulate the opening and closing of exhaust valves. The CFD results were used to study flow uniformity under different operating conditions and to identify the best location for the oxygen sensor.

Moreover refiners also need to invest in order to comply with the clean fuels regulations and thus are on the look out for ways to stay competitive, while withstanding the recent high crude price environment. In such an endeavor, there is a strong focus placed on lowering the manufacturing cost of hydrogen, whether under the 'make' or 'buy' case, to enhance site-wide profitability. Moreover, some of the refinery upgrade ventures, especially in the developing countries, can get the necessary commercial boost by extending the capabilities of the hydrogen facility which can render additional value and thus improve the economics of the overall project. In responding to such needs, few proven options have been employed to improve capital efficiency of a hydrogen facility, both new and existing. The underlying aim is to create an 'added value' to reduce the net operating cost against cost-effective investment These include integration of potential Refinery-offgases for hydrogen generation, prospects for captive steam-power synergy and finding possible credit for CO 2 as a by-product; in order to lower the net specific costs. Furthermore, most of these options carry inherent extra merits of reduced environmental emissions and increased reliability through custom modifications and exploitation of state-of-the-art technological advancements.

An integrated approach to corrosion modeling and testing is employed by ExxonMobil to reliably extend the application of carbon steel. The integrated approach to predicting corrosion has five primary elements: 1. Rigorously establish the environmental conditions by conducting thermodynamic and compositional hydraulic analyses, and characterize how these conditions are expected to change over time. 2. Identify the local environmental conditions and the types of corrosion that are expected to occur (e.g., weight loss, pitting, environmental cracking), including sensitivity and upset cases. 3. Conduct realistic corrosion tests under the identified field conditions by simulating brine chemistry, dissolved acid gas concentrations, hydrocarbon effects, fluid shear stresses, and flow regime in appropriate laboratory equipment. Specialized laboratory test apparati, such as a large-diameter sour, multiphase flow loop and large-volume highpressure high temperature autoclave test cells, have been designed and constructed to ensure proper reproduction of field conditions. 4. Mathematically extrapolate the results of the laboratory tests to the field, enabling calculation of expected tubular life. 5. Conduct life cycle cost analysis.

Yet hydroelectric schemes are significant in another way. They provide an unusual example of a technology that has changed little over the last 100 years and thus offers a real opportunity to judge the impact of a changing regulatory climate. In Scotland, three distinct phases can be detected. Earlier controls focussed on the protection of private interests, especially fishing rights, with authorisations secured through Private Acts of Parliament. This was followed by a period where promotion of such schemes lay with public bodies; though under general statutory duties, ultimately the balancing of environmental and other interests lay with such bodies who acted with few external controls. Privatisation of electricity generation in 1989, coupled with the growing development of relevant European Community legislation, dramatically shifted the regulatory balances. Environmental Assessment requirements and now the obligations of the Water Framework Directive have substantially altered the concept and scope of environmental concerns in this field. © The Author [2005].

However, routine application of these procedures is yet to occur. The major roadblocks are the uncertainties in future trajectory of aircraft, the difficulty such uncertainties presents for air traffic controllers having to predict and control separations, and the consequent impact on airport capacity. This paper describes a research targeting to help the air traffic controller predict and manage separations between aircraft performing noise abatement procedures so that these procedures can be implemented at more airports to benefit the communities and operators as well as to ease the constraint on traffic growth. The research first developed a fast-time flight simulator, and modeled factors driving flight trajectory variations. Those driving factors include stochastic aircraft landing weight, pilot response delay, and wind variations between flights. Specifically, a unique wind variation model based on non-linear mode decomposition was developed. Aircraft meteorological reports were used as data source for modeling the wind. The flight simulator together with the models of trajectory variation driving factors formed a Monte Carlo simulation tool. A noise abatement approach procedure framework was proposed. The research then developed a separation analysis methodology to utilize the developed Monte Carlo simulation tool to predict desired initial separation at an intermediate metering point between aircraft performing noise abatement procedures. The initial separation was to be used by air traffic control to assure safe separation would not be violated in the execution of noise abatement procedures. The separation analysis methodology was designed such that the determined initial separation maximizes capacity without sacrificing safety and noise abatement benefits. The Monte Carlo simulation tool and the separation analysis methodology were then applied to a continuous decent flight demonstration test at Louisville International Airport using UPS Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 revenue flights. The flight demonstration test and the follow on analysis of radar data showed close match between simulation results and observed separation between aircraft and thus proved the effectiveness of the tool and analysis methodology.",,"Emissions reductions; Flight trajectory; Air traffic control; Airports; Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Flight dynamics; Flight simulators; Monte Carlo methods; Trajectories; Noise abatement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644552433

Given a reduced description of the chemical composition (e.g., in terms of some ""major"" species), species reconstruction is a procedure to estimate the full composition. In this paper, we develop and demonstrate a new species reconstruction methodology, which is based on a pre-image curve of the reaction mapping. By definition, in the composition space, if a reaction trajectory is followed from any point on the pre-image curve, then at some time the reduced composition on the trajectory intersects the given reduced composition. The reconstructed composition is taken to be the full composition on the reaction trajectory at this intersection. The method is tested for a case of methane autoignition in which the detailed mechanism has 27 degrees of freedom, and two reduced descriptions are considered with 4 and 6 degrees of freedom. It is shown that the normalized reconstruction errors are very small; they are two orders of magnitude smaller than those in RCCE; and with 6 degrees of freedom they are smaller than those in QSSA with 12 degrees of freedom. The reconstructed compositions (for all reduced compositions) form the reconstructed manifold. It is shown that, to an excellent approximation, this manifold is inertial (i.e., it is composed of reaction trajectories). In comparison to other dimension-reduction methodologies, this is the first approach which determines, locally, points on a low-dimensional inertial manifold. The combination of in situ adaptive tabulation and species reconstruction can be used to reduce substantially the computational cost of applying detailed chemistry to turbulent combustion calculations. © 2004 The Combustion Institute.

Until recently the focus of CHP system development has been primarily on medium-scale commercial applications in a limited number of market segments where clear value propositions lead to short term payback. Small-scale integrated CHP systems that show promise of achieving economic viability through significant improvements in fuel utilization have received increased attention lately. In this paper the economic potential is quantified for small-scale (micro-grid) integrated CHP systems suitable for groups of buildings with aggregate electric loads in the 15 kW - 120 kW range. Technologies are evaluated for community building groups (CBGs) consisting of aggregation of pure residential entities and combined residential and light commercial entities. Emphasis is on determination of the minimum load size (i.e. the smallest electric and thermal load for a given CBG that is supplied with electric, heating, cooling power from a CHP) for which a micro-grid CHP system is both technically and economically viable. In this paper, the operation of the CHP system is parallel with the public utility grid at all times, i.e. the grid is interconnected. Evaluations of CHP technology options using simulation studies in a ""three-dimensional"" space (CHP technology option, CBG load aggregation, and geographical location in the USA) were evaluated based on comparisons of net present value (NPV). The simulations indicated that as electric load increases, the viability of the CHP system (independent of the system's size) becomes more favorable. Exceeding a system runtime (utilization) of 70% was shown to pass the break-even line in the NPV analysis. Finally, geographic location was found to have a relatively weak effect on the reported trends. These results suggest that micro grid CHP systems have the potential to be economically viable with relative independence of geographic location if adequately sized to match the load requirements.

While mercury emissions from hazardous waste incinerators and fossil-fuel power plants have been and continue to be regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Clean Air Act (CAA), non-hazardous waste cement kilns are currently excluded from regularly controls. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to assess the need for possible mercury emission controls nationwide, under the CAA, and for specific facilities, through the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Program of the Clean Water Act. The EPA's major concern appears to be the potential impacts the bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and other aquatic organisms may have on humans and wildlife that consume them. This paper uses fate and transport modeling to evaluate whether mercury emissions from cement kilns could pose unacceptable risks to fish-consuming populations in the area of a source because of high levels of methyl mercury that could accumulate in fish. Emphasis is placed on assessing the effects that parameter variability and the lack of the parameter specificity for environmental conditions have on risk assessment results. The key parameters that are evaluated include emission rates, mercury speciation, methylation rates, and watershed and water body configurations. The results of this assessment indicate that mercury emissions from cement kilns pose much less of a risk to fish consumers than mercury emissions from other types of combustion sources; however, there is substantial uncertainty in the risk estimates. These uncertainties in the EPA model for mercury emissions indicate that this model is only refined enough currently to screen risks from combustion facilities (to identify facilities that pose no significant risk of mercury exposure), but is insufficient to characterize risks for populations at any specific site. Finally, prior to any attempt at regulating Portland cement kiln mercury emissions, the EPA should refine and validate its models based on mercury emission and fish concentration data for actual sites. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Clean Air Act (CAA); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Program; Environmental impact; Hazardous materials; Kilns; Mathematical models; Portland cement; Risk assessment; Mercury (metal)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746736959

As early as 1988, some Canadian municipalities embraced the challenge of climate change and through municipal programs recorded emissions reductions. Given the recent publication of the Government of Canada's climate change plan which clearly emphasizes a prominent role for municipalities in meeting greenhouse gas emission reductions, and equally, the federal government's declared intent to provide further financial support to cities and communities through its 'New Deal for Cities and Communities', it is important to consider the potential role that Canadian municipalities can take in responding to climate change, and most importantly, the barriers they face in responding. Based on these observations, this paper presents evidence from a survey of 392 Canadian municipalities (all municipalities with populations of more than 10,000 people) conducted between the summer of 1998 and spring of 1999. The survey provides information on a key issue, which despite the date of the survey remains centrally relevant today: barriers to Canadian municipal response. Building on both quantitative and qualitative results from the survey data and updated information on the number of municipalities participating in Federation of Canadian Municipality (FCM) climate change programs, the paper concludes with recommendations as to how municipal capacity to respond to climate change can be increased.

The TRANSIMS software was used to simulate traffic for the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. Network and trip table data from the Portland METRO regional model were converted to TRANSIMS and calibrated against traffic counts. The TRANSIMS microsimulator was then used to generate detailed speed and volume information for 30-m link segments at 15-min intervals throughout the day. Second-by-second vehicle speeds were summarized with six speed bins (0, 16.8, 33.5, 503, 67.1, and 83.8 mph). The detailed simulation results were aggregated in various ways to produce the input data required by the MOBILE6 emission inventory software. MOBILE6 was also applied with specific parameters to test the impacts of various assumptions with regard to analysis year, seasons, vehicle types, facility types, and inspection and maintenance programs. The total emissions from each aggregation method were compared with the emissions estimated with the use of MOBILE6 with METRO's EMME/2 volumes and speeds. The analysis indicates that the emission estimates generated with simulation data are significantly different from the emission estimates produced by traditional modeling techniques. If simulation data are aggregated to levels that are more consistent with traditional regional outputs, the magnitude of the difference is minimized. In general, using the more detailed information produced by TRANSIMS or other simulation models will result in higher emissions than are currently estimated by using aggregate methods.",,"Aggregates; Calibration; Computer simulation; Computer software; Environmental engineering; Traffic counts; TRANSIMS software; Trip table data; Vehicle emissions; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646412883

ConocoPhillips Venezuela and its partners discovered offshore oil resources in the Gulf of Paria, northeastern Venezuela in 1999, and have since been making progress on their development plans. At the time, little was known about biodiversity in this region; however, ConocoPhillips decided to address this emerging issue as part of the Company's sustainable development approach to hydrocarbon development. Further, baseline studies and consultation completed with the support of Ecology and Environment Inc. (E & E) - as well as preliminary results of an assessment of the West Central Atlantic (Caribbean) fisheries, which was being completed in 2002 by Conservation International - suggested that the Gulf of Paria could harbor important levels of aquatic biodiversity. In July 2002, ConocoPhillips requested a meeting to present its draft plan of development, to share results of preliminary baseline studies completed by E & E, and to seek input on actions to protect biodiversity. In turn, Conservation International shared the results of its assessment of the West Central Atlantic fisheries, which classified the Gulf of Paria as important to Caribbean aquatic biodiversity. Over time, a Memorandum of Agreement was established to complete a collaborative process of biodiversity characterization and establishing priorities. In late 2002, Conservation International led a rapid assessment program to characterize and document aquatic biodiversity in the southern Gulf of Paria. In 2003, ConocoPhillips organized workshops with a diverse group of leading conservation organizations, academic institutions, consultants, and other stakeholders to evaluate results of the rapid assessment; and achieve consensus on potential risks to biodiversity and opportunities for conservation. ConocoPhillips also integrated community input, particularly small-scale fishermen who are dependent on aquatic resources in the region for their sustenance. This effort culminated in an initial biodiversity action plan, which was published with Conservation International and formally launched at a Biodiversity Symposium, Contribution to the Knowledge on Biological Diversity and Socio-Cultural Aspects of the Gulf of Paria and the Orinoco Delta that ConocoPhillips organized on June 3, 2004 in Caracas, Venezuela. Later that year, the www.ConocoPhillipsParia.com website was established to provide a focal point and repository for information. Information is also available on Conservation International's Website at http://www.celb.org/xp/CELB/news-events/press_releases/06032004.xml. Collaboration between ConocoPhillips and Conservation International -and other organizations - has confirmed that Gulf of Paria harbors a unique variety and abundance of aquatic species, including nine (9) new to science. The initial biodiversity action plan is the first step in generating and disseminating knowledge, raising awareness, achieving consensus on priorities and encouraging conservation as well as sustainable development in the Gulf of Paria through cooperation, engagement and dialogue among stakeholders.",,"Biodiversity action; Pro-active cross sector partnership; Stakeholders; Biodiversity; Conservation; Hydrocarbons; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Marine engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947120216

It considers the microstructure of cracks and the magnitude of the different types of physical event that can occur at the crack tip during plastic deformation and stable crack growth. Expressions are given for the threshold plastic zone size 'Δl' at which local fracture instability occurs and the stress-wave displacement amplitude as a function of distance 'ui(r)' for the different wave types 'i' produced during crack extension. Dispersion of the stress-wave and its convolution into an electrical burst signal at the sensor is considered together with the choice of appropriate sensing frequency. A methodology is described for correcting the measured signal amplitude for attenuation in the structure and for determining the maximum sensor spacing for the detection and location of events of a specified magnitude 'Mae' similar to the Richter scale. Case studies are presented to illustrate the extensive database now available on acoustic emission from crack growth in metallic structures and the technical and commercial benefits to be gained from an acoustic emission based inspection strategy. The applications considered are: Fatigue crack growth in the node joints of offshore structures, Stress corrosion cracking in platform flow line.","Acoustic emission; Crack growth; Fatigue; Fracture mechanics; In-service monitoring; Offshore structures; Phonon fission; Stress corrosion","Acoustic emission testing; Crack tips; Fatigue crack propagation; Fracture mechanics; Microstructure; Offshore structures; Plastic deformation; Stress corrosion cracking; Flow line; Fracture instability; In-service monitoring; Phonon fission; Stress-wave displacement; Crack detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249691625

This policy included details for the assessment of the appropriate setback to new and infill development along the coast of Western Australia. The method stipulated for the technical assessment of setback distance is a modified form of an approach developed by Coastal and Port Engineers, Rogers & Associates in the 1990s. The State Coastal Planning Policy includes factors for acute storm erosion, chronic long term erosion or accretion trends, and possible impacts due to Climate Change. The Policy's provisions for the assessment of an appropriate setback distance have now been applied at numerous locations around Western Australia. The application of the Policy at Exmouth and Cervantes for new development is reviewed. At both locations the data, computer modelling and calculation of setback distance is presented. Certainly, one size does not fit all when it comes to coastal setback distances. The SBEACH storm erosion model is stipulated in the Policy and its validation at two different locations along the Western Australia coastline is also presented. The issue of infill development has its own complexities and is not addressed in this paper. These investigations have shown that there can be some inconsistencies with the application of the Policy and there is a case for revision and improvement. This approach of ongoing review and refinement is in keeping with modern quality management principles. The Policy provides a powerful planning tool to ensure safe and sustainable coastal development in Western Australia and will help ensure that all new development has a setback from the active coastal processes that provides a minimal risk of being threatened by coastal erosion in the coming century.",,"Coastal development; Coastal erosion; Coastal process; Computer modelling; Infill development; Management principles; Planning tools; Setback distances; State coastal planning policies; Storm erosion; Technical assessment; Western Australia; Climate change; Coastal zones; Ocean engineering; Ports and harbors; Quality management; Storms; Erosion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874163774

A series of quantitative field experiments has been initiated to simulate conditions following nearshore treatment of a floating oil slick or following the cleaning of a spill stranded on the shore. The basic experimental design is a series of treatments (Forties or Nigerian crude oil, BP 1100WD dispersant, or oil plus dispersant) applied to sets of experimental plots in a range of intertidal and subtidal communities. Biological recording includes frequency and density measurements of plants and animals, and hydrocarbon analysis is by capillary gas liquid chromatography and computerised gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, the effects of dispersant on the movement and fate of oil in different types of sediment is being investigated using a laboratory sediment column and controllable temperature sea-water system. The columns have been successfully used in the modeling of low-energy sedimentary environments. Particular attention has been paid to the nature of water table fluctuations within the sediment, to grain size and sorting, to permeability, and also to the number of simulated ""tides"" that the column experience after treatment. Hydrocarbon analysis is primarily by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, which has the advantage that the large number of samples generated by each experimental run can be quickly analysed. Gas liquid chromatography is used for checking selected samples. Preliminary results from the field and laboratory experiments indicate that some dispersant treatments increase penetration of oil, and that it may be retained below the sediment surface. Interacting factors include time of treatment in relation to tidal cycle and behaviour of the water table in the sediment.",,"Grain size and shape; Hydrocarbons; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Oil spills; Seawater; Sediments; Temperature control; Density measurements; Dispersants; Spilled oils; Ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Crude petroleum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646064129

The on-line measurements were made in two chambers with a one-year old shoot inside. Simultaneous measurements were performed for carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, transpiration (H 2O), exchange of trace gases (NOx, O3), photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air temperature and relative humidity (RH). The composition of the monoterpene emission did not change during the measurement period, with Δ3-carene and α-pinene being the dominant species. The total monoterpene emission rate (per needle area) was on average 0.5 ng m-2 s-1, varied from non detectable to 2.1 ng m-2 s-1, and showed a typical diurnal pattern with afternoon maximum and nighttime minimum. The emission rates determined with this on-line chamber method were in agreement with results from a simultaneously used established adsorbent sampling technique with offline GC-MS analysis. The monoterpene emissions from the chamber walls were correlated with the chamber temperature and this measurement artifact was dominating at night. Emission rates normalized to 30°C, using temperature regression coefficient of 0.09°C-1, ranged from 2.1 μg g(dw)-1 h-1 to 4.4 μg g(dw)-1 h-1. Measurements of emission dynamics of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) together with plant physiological activity are urgently needed for the development of mechanistic BVOC emission models in order to assess their regional and global influence.",,"Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744437981

Considerable practical and scientific progress in this direction has been achieved in the framework of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. A number of international binding instruments (Protocols to the Convention) on reduction of air pollution were developed and entered into force during the last 25 years. Scientific support for the evaluation of long-range air pollution, as well as development and implementation of the Protocols is provided by the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP). EMEP was established in 1977 under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. After the Convention entered into force in 1983 EMEP became an operational programme of the Convention. Routine activity of EMEP is based on joint efforts of the participating countries and 4 international centres of EMEP. One of these centres-the Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-East (MSC-E) is responsible for the development and application of atmospheric transport deposition models for the assessment of air pollution by heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. Heavy metals in line with acid compounds are included in the priority list of substances considered under the Convention. A Protocol on Heavy Metals was signed by 36 Parties to the Convention in 1998. The Protocol is aimed at control of heavy metal emissions into the atmosphere to reduce their transboundary transport and to prevent adverse effects on human health and the environment. In accordance with the Protocol EMEP is responsible for use of appropriate models and measurements for providing to European countries calculations of transboundary fluxes and depositions of lead, cadmium and mercury. This paper is focused on the assessment of the long-range transboundary transport of mercury. Mercury is widely recognized as a global pollutant. To evaluate mercury pollution of Europe mercury emissions all over the globe and intercontinental transport should be taken into account. To meet these requirements MSC-E is developing mathematical models for the evaluation of mercury atmospheric transport on regional (Europe) and hemispherical (Northern Hemisphere) scales.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887886221

Key challenges faced by the jointly staffed In Salah Gas project team were to insure the sustainability of 9 billion cubic meters for 13 years minimum in one of the most hostile environments, to put in place the infrastructures to transfer dry gas to the ""Centre National de Dispatching de Gaz"" (CNDG), 500 km north of the contractual perimeter and finally to meet the high environmental commitments that had been outlined by the Algerian Ministry of Mines &amp; Energy and the SONATRACH and BP management. The requirement is that the CO2 concentration in the gas stream should be less than 0.3%, significantly below the concentrations present in the In Salah Gas fields, which range between 1% and 9%. The most important aspect of the project is the commitment to non-atmospheric disposal of the 0.66 billion cubic meters per year of extracted CO2 stream that results from the fields production to meet the contracted sales gas volumes. This means that an alternative solution to simply venting would be required. Storage and sequestration of the extracted CO2 stream is planned within the aquifer region of the hydrocarbon bearing Carboniferous formation adjacent to the Krechba field, the most northerly of the gas fields currently in production since July 2004. Three CO2 injection wells have been drilled with results as prognosed from seismic, providing access into the east and north aquifer reservoir region for storage and sequestration of CO2. The project is now operating one of the largest sequestration and storage schemes in the world. Another important aspect of the project is the environmental certification ISO 14001, the first one in the world to get this distinction during the construction phase. Another challenge is to sustain this certification for the whole life of the project. This document provides a case study of one of the first major gas developments where an integrated mitigation plan was constructed in the initial stages of project design, ahead of project sanction. The paper will describe the project and outline the key elements of the development, and the complexity faced by the project team to resolve the environmental, geographical and logistic issues.

It runs through semiarid and arid regions of North America and is subject to extreme climatic and hydrologic processes that generally cause major physical, environmental, and social impacts and consequences. The Colorado River system has been subject to a number of adverse climatic episodes ranging from wet periods, such as those that formed the basis of the 1922 Colorado River Compact and also short periods of very high flow years such as those of 1982-83 and 1983-84, to periods of low flows and droughts such as the dust bowl years of the 1930s and the current 2000-2004 drought in the Western United States. While the present state of the art does not allow accurate long-range prediction of these climatic extremes, the stochastic approach to hydrologic data can offer river system managers a better understanding and appreciation of the types of streamflow extremes they may face in the future. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate and compare alternative stochastic modeling techniques to extend the monthly streamflow records of the Colorado River system. They include multivariate parametric and non-parametric techniques with and without noise. Naturalized flow records at 29 sites are available for the Upper and Lower Colorado River systems. For the first 21 sites (the Upper Colorado River) streamflow records are available for the period 1905-2000, however for sites 22-29 (Lower Colorado) the records are short. The modeling strategy consisted of the following elements: (a) record extension of the annual flows, (b) record extension of the monthly flows, and (c) temporal and spatial adjustments. The annual flows were extended first to assure a reasonable preservation of the annual statistics. For this purpose a multivariate model with and without noise was utilized. In the case of using the noise option, the variance-covariance matrix was estimated either parametrically or instead the noises were obtained by re-sampling techniques. For the monthly flows a periodic multivariate product model was established that consisted of a periodic Markov chain for the case of intermittent flow sites and a periodic multivariate model with and without noise. As for the annual model the periodic noises were either parameterized or re-sampled. Temporal adjustments were made to assure that the monthly flows add up to the previously extended annual flows and spatial adjustments were made to assure the streamflow network connectivity in the downstream direction. The basis of the various models will be explained along with the results and conclusions thereof.",,"River systems; Streamflow networks; Climatology; Hydrology; Water supply; Watersheds; Rivers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744480819

Human-induced climate change, and increasing climate variability, as well as other global environmental issues such as land degradation and loss of biological diversity, threaten our ability to meet these basic human needs. It is undisputed that the last two decades have been the warmest this century, and likely to be the warmest for the last 1000 years, sea level is rising, rain and snowfall patterns are changing. Arctic sea ice is thinning and the frequency and intensity of El-Niño events appear to be increasing. In addition, the frequency of extreme events is rising and many parts of the world have recently suffered major heat-waves, floods and droughts leading to significant loss of life and economic costs. This requires the global community to give urgent attention to addressing key issues. The range of adaptation options for agriculture and forestry is generally increasing because of technological advances, thus reducing the vulnerability of these systems to climate change. However, some regions of the world, particularly developing countries, have limited access to these technologies. Agriculture and forestry are currently not optimally managed with respect to today's natural climate variability. Decreasing the vulnerability of agriculture and forestry to increasing climatic variability will go a long way towards reducing the long-term vulnerability to climate change. This book represents a major step in assessing the science of climate variability and change, and their likely impacts on agriculture and forestry, with clear adaptation strategies required to reduce their vulnerability. © 2005 Springer.

There is evidence that global warming over the last millennium has already resulted in increased global average annual temperature and changes in rainfall, with the 1990s being likely the warmest decade in the Northern Hemisphere at least. During the past century, changes in temperature patterns have, for example, had a direct impact on the number of frost days and the length of growing seasons with significant implications for agriculture and forestry. Land cover changes, changes in global ocean circulation and sea surface temperature patterns, and changes in the composition of the global atmosphere are leading to changes in rainfall. These changes may be more pronounced in the tropics. For example, crop varieties grown in the Sahel may not be able to withstand the projected warming trends and will certainly be at risk due to projected lower amounts of rainfall as well. Seasonal to interannual climate forecasts will definitely improve in the future with a better understanding of dynamic relationships. However, the main issue at present is how to make better use of the existing information and dispersion of knowledge to the farm level. Direct participation by the farming communities in pilot projects on agrometeorological services will be essential to determine the actual value of forecasts and to better identify the specific user needs. Old (visits, extension radio) and new (internet) communication techniques, when adapted to local applications, may assist in the dissemination of useful information to the farmers and decision makers. Some farming systems with an inherent resilience may adapt more readily to climate pressures, making long-term adjustments to varying and changing conditions. Other systems will need interventions for adaptation that should be more strongly supported by agrometeorological services for agricultural producers. This applies, among others, to systems where pests and diseases play an important role. Scientists have to guide policy makers in fostering an environment in which adaptation strategies can be effected. There is a clear need for integrating preparedness for climate variability and climate change. In developed countries, a trend of higher yields, but with greater annual fluctuations and changes in cropping patterns and crop calendars can be expected with changing climate scenarios. Shifts in projected cropping patterns can be disruptive to rural societies in general. However, developed countries have the technology to adapt more readily to the projected climate changes. In many developing countries, the present conditions of agriculture and forestry are already marginal, due to degradation of natural resources, the use of inappropriate technologies and other stresses. For these reasons, the ability to adapt will be more difficult in the tropics and subtropics and in countries in transition. Food security will remain a problem in many developing countries. Nevertheless, there are many examples of traditional knowledge, indigenous technologies and local innovations that can be used effectively as a foundation for improved farming systems. Before developing adaptation strategies, it is essential to learn from the actual difficulties faced by farmers to cope with risk management at the farm level. Agrometeorologists must play an important role in assisting farmers with the development of feasible strategies to adapt to climate variability and climate change. Agrometeorologists should also advise national policy makers on the urgent need to cope with the vulnerabilities of agriculture and forestry to climate variability and climate change. The workshop recommendations were largely limited to adaptation. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change is of high priority for nearly all countries, but developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Effective measures to cope with vulnerability and adaptation need to be developed at all levels. Capacity building must be integrated into adaptation measures for sustainable agricultural development strategies. Consequently, nations must develop strategies that effectively focus on specific regional issues to promote sustainable development. © 2005 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892355367

Drought episodes may be described in terms of drought duration and intensity. Among the several methods proposed for describing drought, the run method appears to be the most suitable for providing an objective identification and characterisation of drought events. In the bio-climatology approach, a simple drought index obtained from a few input variables and able to describe the two dimensions of drought is meaningful. Such an index should recognise ""normal"" conditions, not only in terms of statistical average, but especially from an ecological point of view, in order to highlight anomalies in dryness conditions. Our interest is therefore to develop a climatic index, called a drought severity index (DSI), able to produce such information on a detailed geographic and time scale. The procedure for deriving DSI calculates for each day, classified as dry or wet according to the amount of rainfall measured, the length of the current dry spell, as well as rainfall, evapotranspiration and water deficit during the dry spell. Furthermore, for each day we associated the agro-climatological variables measured with the corresponding percentile value obtained using climatology. Finally, the length of each dry spell was expressed as a consecutive number of dry days (LHS), and daily mean water deficit during the dry spell (DFS) was computed as the maximum value between LH and LH6 percentiles and between DF and DF6, respectively. LHS describes drought duration, whereas DFS is an indicator of drought intensity. DSI was developed by calculating the geometric mean of the variables LHS and DFS. Duration, intensity and severity of drought were estimated on a day time scale for the test period 1988-2003 based on climatological figures. At the national level, the most arid spell along the test period was recorded during spring-summer 2003, with especially dry conditions occurring in northern and central Italy. The DS index correctly indicates a consistent increase in dryness from March to July 2003 at all the Italian meteorological stations. We further selected a sample station (Rome) in order to evaluate the behaviour of the drought index during the whole test period. At this station, the period May-August 2003 was characterized by an exceptionally long dry spell with extremely hot conditions. This spell was correctly classified as highly anomalous, with both LHS and DFS indexes rapidly increasing from the normal (40th percentile and 60th percentile for LHS and DFS, respectively) at the beginning of May to the 99th and 90th percentiles, respectively, at the end of August 2003, and the same pattern was measured for DSI.

Energy forecasts indicate that the growing demand for electricity will require the construction of more electric power plant that use different fuels. In Spain, the growing electricity demand has been met with natural gas fueled combined cycle electric power plant. While the air quality impact associated with the newer technologies is relatively lower when compared to older technologies, modern EU Air Quality legislation requires the control of air quality impact in real-time and forecasting mode. An operational real-time forecasting decision support system systemhas been developed and implemented in Spain on a 4-unit (400 MW per unit) combined cycle electric power plant, which is located in the surrounding area of Madrid Community (Spain). The system is based on the MM5-CMAQ-EMIMO modelssystem. The MM5 model is widely used all over the world and was developed by PSU/NCAR (USA). The CMAQ model is the so-called Community Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System developed by USEPA. EMIMO is an anthropogenic and biogenic air emissions model , which produces hourly emissions per pollutant per square kilometer. The system is implemented in an 8-node PIV-3, 4 GHz Dell computer cluster to minimize computation time. The system covers three model domains: 405 x 405 km with 9 km spatial resolution; 81 x 99 km with 3 km spatial resolution; and 24 x 24 km with 1 km spatial resolution. The three domains have 23 vertical layers up to 100 mb. The system runs on a daily basis and forecastes up to 72 hours. The system runs all the scenarios needed to obtain the air quality impact of each of the 4-units for every grid cell, hour and air pollutant simulated. The estimated electric power plant emissions are produced on a weekly basis and provided on-line to the modelling system. Changes to expected emissions for the electric power plant are introduced automatically in the modelling system on a daily basis. The system is accessed over the Internet by the environmental authorities and company managers on a daily basis. The system produces alerts every day according to the results of the model. Any decision related to possible shutdown for a limited period of time of the different power plant units , where the EU Directive limits may have been exceeded, is taken by environmental authorities in real-time. The system prototype was part of the EUREKA project TEAP (A tool to evaluate the air quality impact on industrial plant) (2001-2003). The same approach can be used for any other industrial plant and also for any emission source apportionment such as traffic over specific sections of the model domain or even specific pollutants over certain areas in the model domain.","Air quality modelling; Industrial impact; Real-time control","Air emissions; Air pollutants; Air quality impacts; Air quality modelling; Combined cycle; Community multi-scale air qualities; Computation time; Dell computers; Electric power; Electricity demands; Emission sources; Energy forecasts; Environmental Authority; EU directives; Grid cells; Growing demand; Industrial impact; MM5 models; Model domains; Per unit; Real-time forecasting; Spatial resolution; System prototype; Three models; Air quality impacts; Community multi-scale air qualities; Electricity demands; Energy forecasts; Environmental Authority; Modelling systems; Real-time forecasting; Spatial resolution; Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electricity; Forecasting; Image resolution; Industrial emissions; Industry; Laws and legislation; Plant shutdowns; Pollution; Quality control; Real time control; Small power plants; Air quality; Decision support systems; Electric lines; Electric power plants; Forecasting; Image resolution; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Natural gasoline plants; Plant shutdowns; Quality control; Electric power plants; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053108865

The overarching goal of CCX is to turn the theory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and trading into a reality-to prove that the concept can work in practice. The members of CCX undertook significant efforts to assemble internal records of energy and materials use. For members in the electric generation sector, GHG emission reports are based on the data from the continuous emission monitors (CEMs) installed on most electricity generating units. When CEM data are not available for most members in the industrial and manufacturing sectors, the GHG emissions are determined by applying emission factors to fuel inputs. CCX rules prescribe the use of World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) calculation tools and other methods to determine GHG emissions from fuel use. CCX and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) developed the auditing process after thoroughly researching into existing emissions trading programs and calculations developed by WRI and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CCX intends to extend the central exchange model not only to non-GHG air pollutants but also to other environmental commodities. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The satellite will be launched in 2007 and it will carry state-of-the-art of microwave radiometers and bolometers arranged in two instruments, respectively the Low Frequency Instrument and the High Frequency Instrument, both coupled with a 1.5 m telescope and working in nine frequency channels between 30 and 857 GHz. From the second Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, the instruments will produce a survey that will cover the whole sky with unprecedented combination of sensitivity, angular resolution, and frequency coverage, and they will likely lead us to extract all the cosmological information encoded in the CMB temperature anisotropies. The development strategy of PLANCK and the two instruments has been to set up a mission that inherently minimizes the systematic effects. The optics, composed by an optimised telescope-feed array assembly, introduce unwanted systematic effects in the measurements like the so called external straylight due to the sidelobe pick-up. A trade-off between angular resolution and external straylight has been carried out for LFI in order to reach the best optical performaces preventing the Galactic contamination. The main product of the study has been the definition of the internal geometry of the flight model of the LFI feed horns and the characterization of the overall optical response of the instrument. Thermal emission from all components of the spacecraft produces the so called internal straylight, that has been evaluated and controlled in the design phase.

Catalyst light-off plays a very important role in reducing these emissions. Model-based paradigm is used to develop a control-oriented, thermodynamics based simple catalyst model for coldstart purposes. It is a modified version of an available model consisting of thermal dynamics and static efficiency maps, the critical modification being in the thermal sub-model. Oxygen storage phenomenon does not play a significant role during the warm-up of the engine. The catalyst is modeled as a second-order system consisting of catalyst brick temperature and temperature of the feedgas flowing through the catalyst as its states. Energy balance of an unsteady flow through a control volume is used to model the feedgas temperature, whereas energy balance of a closed system is used to model the catalyst brick temperature. Wiebe profiles are adopted to empirically model the HC emissions conversion properties of the catalyst as a function of the catalyst temperature and the air-fuel ratio. The static efficiency maps are further extended to include the effects of spatial velocity of the feedgas. Experimental results indicate good agreement with the model estimates for the catalyst warm-up. It is shown that the model represents the system more accurately as compared to the previous model on which it is based and offers a broader scope for analysis.

The potential for emissions reduction with F-T diesel fuels in laboratory engine tests and on-road vehicle tests is well documented. While a number of chemical and physical characteristics of F-T fuels have been attributed to the observed reduction in emissions, the actual effects of both the fuel properties and in-cylinder combustion characteristics in modern diesel engines are still not well understood. In this study a 2002, six-cylinder, 5.9 liter, Cummins ISB 300 diesel engine, outfitted with an in-cylinder pressure transducer, was subjected to a subset of the Euro HI 13-mode test cycle under steady-state operating conditions. Emissions and in-cylinder pressure measurements were conducted for neat F-T diesel, low sulfur diesel (LSD), ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), and a blend of F-T/LSD. In addition, a detailed chemical analysis of the fuels was carried out. The differences in the measured combustion characteristics and fuel properties were compared to the emissions variations between the fuels studied, and an explanation for the observed emissions behavior of the fuels was developed.

However, such systems are prone to produce toxic gases causing acid rain and greenhouse effect leading to air pollution. It is the future policy of European Union to achieve efficient and environment-friendly energy generation by targeting low to zero emission in power plant technology and aircraft traffic. Stringent legislation concerning such emissions for vehicles are already underway and is expected to be released for turbine engines, especially for those located in or near urban areas. Catalytically stabilized combustion is an attractive technique because it offers the potential of ultra-low NOx emissions (&lt; 3 ppm), improved flame stability and fewer pulsations. Possible positions to situate the catalytic converters in air-craft engines are hot areas such as within combustion chamber and at hot-gas outlets behind the chamber, requiring high-temperature stability of materials. The catalytic system consists of ceramic layers with unique microstructures fulfilling the needs of being smart but low cost. For removal of CO, NOx and HCs, complex oxides are used such as nanocomposites of CexZr1-xO2-y with a higher effective surface which yield much better catalytic activity. Another group of materials which delivers preliminary promising results in terms of NO reduction is the Hexaluminates. Mn-substituted La-Hexaluminates with their magnetoplumbite crystal structure having large amount of interstitial oxidation sites and oxygen vacancies provide catalytic combustion by reducing NOx effectively during propulsion. In another approach, nano-sized noble metal particles embedded in ceramic matrices allow an effective fuel-rich catalytic combustion. This paper evaluates the catalytic materials and defines their use and advantages. Lean premixed combustion is considered for both stationary and mobile gas turbines and engines. It is very attractive in terms of increased engine efficiency but poses higher NOx-emission and some practical problems. Since such engines operate near the lean stability limit, under these conditions, incidents such as flame out, flame instability or pressure waves induced flashback may occur. Thus, it is crucial that combustion is controlled by sensors to monitor the process, operate the flame in a safe range and detect rapidly the occurrence of combustion instabilities. The sensor shall take a two-fold task and control the combustion and regenerate the catalyst. The principles for sensing techniques and requirements for sensor materials for each application area are specified.","Catalytic conversion and activity; Coatings; Gas-sensors; Magnetoplumbite; NOx-reduction","Air pollution; Catalyst activity; Chemical sensors; Combustion; Greenhouse effect; Power plants; Turbines; Catalytic combustion; Flame instability; Magnetoplumbite crystal structures; NOx emissions; Nitrogen oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35148849550

In particular, the study will be focused on the micro-cogeneration process with micro-combined heat and power system, or MCHP (electric power output ≤ 15 kW), which represents a valid and interesting application of this technology applicable, above all, to residential and light commercial users. This paper presents the Energy, Economic and Environmental (3-E) analysis of a natural gas-fired MCHP in combination with an electric heat pump (EHP). The 3-E analysis of the MCHP/EHP begins with the results of a detailed experimental activity developed in a test facility [1] for a wide range of conditions. Two operating conditions were simulated: a heating mode with co-production of electric and thermal energy, and a cooling mode with co-production of electric, thermal and cooling energy (tri-generation).

It is believed that urban atmospheres contain a mixture of in excess of 100 speciated aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOC). Recent studies in understanding the degradation mechanisms of aromatic species have resulted in a significant update of the chemical mechanisms for the atmospheric degradation of aromatic compounds. The elucidation of new detailed and more accurate chemical mechanisms has targeted specifically the aromatic group of volatile organic compounds (VOC). These updates have been incorporated in the MCM methodology and made available on the MCM website (MCMv3.1 October 2003). In this work a highly detailed airshed model appropriate to Western Australia has been further developed and updated to not only encompass the aromatic mechanism developments of the MCM, but also the most recent emission inventory data for the region. Initial studies using the updated model have been in the determination of differences in ozone formation from individual aromatic VOC, which will depend on the Perth geographic location, local meteorological conditions, and local emissions. Perth currently experiences relatively few high ozone days, however there are still ozone exceedances recorded every year with the ozone concentration reaching levels in excess of the NEPM standard and world recognized health standards (Figure 1). With the continuing economic growth and development in the region and the projected increase in use of road transport vehicles comes the potential for worsening air quality. Only through detailed airshed modeling is it possible to assess the impact of individual VOC and changes in their emissions scenarios. The meteorological conditions in Perth, Western Australia that give rise to high ozone episodes are generally a result of light morning easterly winds which pass over the populated urban area and pick up pollutants in the morning. The air mass then passes off shore where the photochemical processing develops. The air parcel is brought back over land early in the afternoon, where it receives further emissions from the afternoon rush hour peak. These conditions are very different to the multi-day high ozone development in Europe, hence reactivity indicators for aromatic compounds, appropriate to Perth are determined for the first time. (Graph Presented) The study is the first determination of the sensitivity of ozone levels to individual aromatic VOC emissions using the latest development in the aromatic degradation schemes of the MCM v3.1. The results are compared with data generated using the earlier Perth airshed model. The work is aimed towards gaining a detailed understanding of the sensitivities of photochemical ozone formation under widely varying conditions. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of changes to the emission inventories and potential future emission reduction strategies.","Air quality modelling; Aromatic VOC oxidation; Tropospheric ozone","Air mass; Air parcels; Air quality modelling; Aromatic group; Aromatic species; Atmospheric degradation; Chemical mechanism; Degradation mechanism; Economic growths; Emission inventories; Emission reduction strategy; Emissions scenarios; Geographic location; Health standards; Latest development; Local emissions; Mechanism development; Meteorological condition; Off-shore; Ozone concentration; Ozone episodes; Ozone formation; Ozone levels; Perth , Western Australia; Photochemical oxidants; Photochemical ozone; Photochemical processing; Reactivity indicators; Road transport sources; Road transports; Tropospheric ozone; Updated model; Urban air; Urban areas; Urban atmospheres; VOC emissions; Western Australia; Atmospheric degradation; Emission reduction strategy; Meteorological condition; Perth , Western Australia; Photochemical oxidants; Photochemical processing; Road transport sources; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Air quality; Aromatic compounds; Atmospheric chemistry; Chemical compounds; Computer simulation; Decision making; Degradation; Economics; Highway administration; Motor transportation; Ozone; Pollution; Roads and streets; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality; Aromatic compounds; Atmospheric chemistry; Decision making; Degradation; Economics; Emission control; Highway administration; Motor transportation; Ozone; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; Volatile organic compounds; Aromatization; Aromatization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053095208

Simulation results of an AGENDA 2000 reference scenario for the time frame 1990-2020 indicate that a decreasing demand for cropland leads to an increasing carbon sink in soil organic matter.","Carbon Sequestration; Environmental Modelling; Land use change","Carbon; Environmental engineering; Greenhouse gases; Information technology; Soils; Agricultural soils; Carbon sequestration; Environmental modelling; Greenhouse gas inventory; Land use change modeling; Land-use change; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil organic matters; Land use",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893259343

The crater is filled by a basal breccia and Late Devonian Chattanooga black shale. Conodonts in shallow water lag deposits that overlie the Ordovician succession in the region indicate lower Frasnian flooding of the area. The continuous stratigraphic record in the crater spans impact and post-impact deposits; the recovery of shallow water components and lower Frasnian conodonts in initial marine deposits above the crater fill breccia indicate that marine sedimentation commenced immediately after impact and that the impact occurred in shallow water. Most recent radiometric calibrations of Devonian conodont zones suggest that the impact occurred around 382 Ma. Stratigraphy and sedimentary features suggest the following sequence of events: (1) shallow water impact duringthe early Frasnian; (2) formation of basal breccia as a fallback deposit; (3) deposition of graded breccia as displaced water rushed back into the crater; (4) ejecta washed back into the crater by storm-induced waves and currents; (5) accumulation and preservation of black shale first in the crater, and also as sea level rose outside the crater. Because the target rocks were lithified carbonates, the Flynn Creek crater has the morphologic characteristics of a subaerial impact. The sediment fill, however, reflects the shallow marine setting of the impact site. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Management strategies provide a framework for management decisions, based on available information, which means that reliable, comparable and up-to-date information is crucial for decision making. The need for reliable information on various aspects of urban forest resources and their use has led to the development of different methods, tools and systems to help collect, compile and use available information. Information in urban forestry is needed to develop management concepts (see Chap. 13), make policy decisions (see Chap. 5), to determine the benefits of urban green space (see Chap. 4), to determine how green space should look (see Chap. 6), to decide which trees to plant where and how (see Chap. 9-12), and for many other reasons. However, depending on its purpose information is needed on different scales and in different levels of detail. Local, more detailed information about, for example: tree and plant species, the number of users, and management costs, is primarily useful for green-space and tree management. An overview of all green space in a city is more useful for city development plans and city green-space policies. Information on national or even international level can be used in urban development strategies, health strategies, etc. Besides the difference in scale, information is quite often available and used for certain topics only. For example, information on the biodiversity of a city's green spaces can be available and used in great detail, while information on environmental benefits such as reduction of air-pollution is virtually non-existent in the same city. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891974977

The first proposal integrates tCERs and lCERs (temporary credits) into the EU ETS by allowing for their direct use for compliance purposes. The second proposal builds on the idea of swapping temporary credits for EU allowances (EUAs) by Member States. The third proposal would not require a political decision at the EU level. Instead supportive Member States or private carbon fund operators would agree to swap temporary credits for the CERs or ERUs they hold in their accounts. All three solutions would be linked to a risk-mitigation strategy based on levying a fee or fixing an exchange rate, which would allow governments to hedge the risk of losing temporary credits. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; CDM; ETS; Linking directive; LULUCF; Reforestation; Temporary credits","afforestation; carbon sequestration; clean development mechanism; emissions trading; environmental policy; European Union; forestry policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27244442422

Over 60% of the waste materials that are brought to the facilities are recycled and composted. Remaining residuals from both the composting and materials recovery facilities have little value in terms of being further recycled and are currently being landfilled. The residuals do have a significant calorific value and have the potential to produce enough electricity to provide 100% of the power and heating for facilities at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre (EWMC), with remaining energy for adjacent developments. The City is considering advanced thermal treatment (not conventional incineration) of the residual waste (after recycling and composting) as a way to close the loop in waste management in terms of minimizing waste materials that are landfilled and reducing the net energy requirement for waste processing and disposal to nil. Other renewable biomass waste streams (e.g.: wood or agricultural waste) could complement operation of the facility and make it more economically viable (economies of scale). There are also other environmental benefits such as reductions in the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) and other harmful emissions by displacement of fossil fuel as an energy source.

In the United States there are approximately 450,000 agricultural operations that confine animals. Even though about 85% of these AFO have fewer than 250 animals, there has been an increase in concentrated feeding operations (CAFO), and CAFOs require an NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit. CAFOs are defined as housing 1000 animal units, which translates to 1000 slaughter steers or heifers or 700 dairy cows; 2500 hogs, over 25 kg or 55 Ibs. each; 30, 000 laying hens or broilers using a liquid manure system; and 100,000 hens/broilers using a continuous overflow watering system. The emission of malodorous compounds and the accumulation of solids are two of the major challenges confronting animal production facilities. The current report examines the effectiveness of a commercial chemical formulation/blend, Bio-Kat from NRP Group, Inc., in reducing gaseous emissions from hog barn wastewater pits and in reducing solids in anaerobic treatment lagoons. In other wastewater systems, Bio-Kat has been shown to stimulate indigenous microbes to more effectively remediate odors and wastes. When Bio-Kat was applied to the surface of barn pit wastewaters, gaseous ammonia emissions were substantially reduced. Application of Bio-Kat to the primary treatment lagoon reduced total and volatile solids, ammonia, sulfides, and chemical oxygen demand. Taken together, these results indicate that Bio-Kat was apparently effective in enhancing the remediation of swine wastewaters potentially providing savings for the farmer and reducing environmental impacts.","Bio-stimulant; Lagoons; Malodors; Swine; Wastewater","Animal feeding operations; Bio stimulant; Malodors; National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES); Agriculture; Manures; Sewage lagoons; Wastewater; Odor control; Agriculture; Lagoons; Manure; Odor Control; Swine; Waste Waters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847371992

The method is called the extended exergy accounting technique (EEA), and its proper application enables the analyst to perform more complete and meaningful assessments of a complex production system, including of course energy conversion processes. The novelty as well as the decisive advantage of EEA consists in its being entirely and uniformly resource-based: the so-called externalities (labor, capital and environmental remediation costs) are included in the system balance by means of their equivalent exergetic fluxes, which represent the gross amount of primary exergy required to locally generate the specified amount of capital, the specified number of work-hours, or to reduce the emissions below a certain specified level. EEA owes some of its structural formalism to Sraffa's ""network"" representation of the economic production of commodities by means of other commodities, which it extends by accounting for the unavoidable energy dissipation in every productive chain. The method has also borrowed several definitions, concepts and procedures from Georgescu-Roegen's classical work on the economic implications of irreversibility on production chains, from Daly's pioneering work in resource-oriented economics and from Szargut's ""cumulative exergy content"" method. The representation of a general energy conversion process by means of its extended exergy flow diagram is discussed in this article, and it is argued that some of the issues that are difficult to address with a purely monetary approach can be properly resolved by EEA. It is also shown how EEA, being intrinsically ""localized"" both in time and in space, can account for the non-uniformity of societal conditions without the need of patching the theory with artificial features external to its paradigm. In the conclusions, some indications are given as to the possibility of using the extended exergy accounting technique to supplement and substantially improve Thermo-Economies on one side and Life-Cycle Assessment or Environmental Footprint Analysis on the other side.

To meet these requirements engine manufacturers have had to make significant design changes and as a consequence new engine lubricant specifications from Industry bodies (ACEA, EMA, JAMA) and individual OEMs have had to be introduced to ensure adequate lubrication of these new engines. This has led to significant changes to heavy-duty diesel engine oil (HDDEO) oil formulation composition. Engine design modifications to increase fuel combustion efficiency such as increased peak cylinder pressure and increased fuel injection pressures have placed higher stress on piston rings and liners, bearings and valve train components [1], and improved oil consumption has meant longer oil residence time in the piston ring belt area. The practice of retarded fuel injection timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as measures to reduce NOx levels by reducing peak combustion temperature has had a considerable impact on lubricant performance. Retarded injection leads to higher soot levels which can cause valve train wear and piston ring liner wear and soot-induced thickening, whilst EGR leads to increased corrosive acids and wear in the combustion chamber. Currently in Europe, Euro 3 heavy-duty engines predominantly use retarded fuel injection as the primary NOx emission control strategy although there are cases where EGR is used. In the US, cooled EGR is used by most engine manufacturers to meet US 2002 emissions. HDDEO's contain a combination of performance additives such as overbased metal detergents, dispersants, antiwear agents and antioxidants designed to provide wear protection, engine cleanliness, and control of soot contaminants and oxidation. Other additive components include selected viscosity index (VI) improvers and pour point depressants to provide necessary viscosity characteristics and shear stability, and also anti-foam agents for oil aeration control. To meet the increased demands from low emission engines, the chemical composition of the performance additives has been modified and levels increased. Current HDDEOs optimized to meet US and European specifications contain typically between 1.3 and 1.9%wt sulphated ash, 0.1-0.14%wt phosphorus and 0.3-1.1.wt sulphur. To meet the next generation emission standards, engines will require the use of exhaust after-treatment devices. In Europe, Euro 4 emission reductions for NOx and PM, scheduled for introduction in 2005, will require the use of either selective catalytic reduction, or the use of EGR in combination with a diesel paniculate filter (DPF). To meet the US 2007 requirements, higher levels of EGR than currently used, in combination with DPFs, is envisaged by most engine builders. Exhaust after-treatment devices are already used extensively in some applications such as DPFs on city buses in Europe and the US. Further NOx restrictions are scheduled for Euro 5 in 2008 and USA in 2010. NOx absorber systems, although used in gasoline engines, are still under development for heavy-duty diesel engines and may be available for 2010. Some lubricant base oil and additive components from oil consumed in the combustion chamber are believed to adversely affect the performance of after-treatment devices. Ash material from metal detergents and zinc dithiophosphates (ZDTP) can build up in the channels within particulate filters causing blockage and potentially loss of engine power, leading to a need for frequent cleaning maintenance. The role of sulphur and phosphorus in additive components is less clear. Sulphur from fuel can either oxidize to sulphur dioxide and react through to sulphuric acid, which manifests itself as particulate, or can have a poisoning effect on the catalyst itself. However, the role of sulphur containing additives is yet to be established. Phosphorus from ZDTP antiwear components can lead to a phosphate layer being deposited on catalyst surfaces, which may impair efficiency. Concerns from OEMs regarding the possible effects of ash, sulphur and phosphorus has led to chemical limits being introduced in some new and upcoming engine oil specifications. The ACEA E6 sequence restricts sulphated ash to 1.0%wt max, phosphorus to 0.08%wt max and sulphur to 0.3%wt max, while the PC-10 category scheduled for 2007 will have maximum limits of 1.0%wt sulphated ash, 0.12%wt phosphorus and 0.4%wt sulphur. The resulting constraints on the use of conventional overbased metal detergent cleanliness additives and zinc dithiophosphate antiwear additives will necessitate alternative engine oil formulation technologies to be developed in order to maintain current performance levels. Indeed, performance requirements of engine oils are expected to become more demanding for the next generation engines where emissions are further restricted. If absorbers become a major route for NOx reduction, limits on sulphur and phosphorus are likely to be more restrictive. Oil formulations meeting ACEA E6 and PC-10 chemical limits have been assessed in several key critical lubricant specification tests, looking at valve train and piston ring/cylinder liner wear, corrosive wear in bearings, piston cleanliness and soot-induced viscosity control. It is demonstrated that it is possible to achieve MB 228.5 extended oil drain performance and API CI-4 wear, corrosion and piston cleanliness requirements for current US engines equipped with EGR [2], at a sulphated ash level of 1.0%wt, and phosphorus and sulphur levels, (0.05 and 0.17%wt, respectively), considerably lower than these chemical limits. This is achievable by the use of selected low sulphur detergents, optimized primary and secondary antioxidant systems and nonphosphorus containing, ashless supplementary antiwear additives blended in synthetic basestocks. Field trials in several city bus fleets have been conducted to assess engine oil performance and durability using one of these low sulphated ash, phosphorus and sulphur (SAPS) oil formulations and to examine lubricant effects on particulate filter performance. Engine oil durability testing was conducted in bus fleets in Germany and Switzerland. These trials, involving over 100 vehicles, cover a range of engine types, e.g., Daimler Chrysler and MAN Euro 1, 2 and 3 and different fuel types (low sulphur diesel, biodiesel, and compressed natural gas) in some MAN engines. The fleets are fitted with continuously regenerating particulate filters either from new or retrofitted. Oils were tested at standard and extended drain intervals (up to 60 000km). Used oil analysis for iron, copper, lead and aluminium with the low SAPS oil in these vehicles have shown low wear rates in all engine types and comparable with a higher 1.8% ash ACEA E4, E5 quality oil. Soot levels can vary considerably, but oil viscosity is maintained within viscosity grade, even at 8% soot loading. TBN depletion and TAN accumulation rates are low showing significant residual basicity reserve and control of acidic combustion and oxidation products. Buses in Stuttgart and Berlin have been used to investigate lubricant ash effects of engine oil on particulate filter durability. Exhaust back-pressure is routinely measured and DPF filters removed and cleaned when back pressure exceeds 100 mbar. Comparison of rate of back pressure build up as a function of vehicle distance shows reduced back pressure gradients for the low SAPS oil relative to the 1.8%wt ash oil in both engine types looked at. An average reduction in back pressure gradient of 40% was found in buses equipped with OM 906LA engines in Berlin and 25% with OM 457hLA engines at both locations. Examination of the ash content in DPFs has shown a 40% reduction in the quantity of ash with the low SAPS oil. This investigation shows that it is possible to meet current long oil drain requirements whilst meeting chemical limits for future lubricants and provide benefits in DPF durability.

This trend is clear in North American climate change action. Though the Canadian and American federal governments have adopted diverging positions on climate change policy, extensive sub-national climate change action across the Canadian-U.S. border is developing in northeast North America. In this region, Canadian provinces and U.S. states forge ahead with climate change action beyond requirements mandated by their federal governments. This collective effort includes the six New England states (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and five Eastern Canadian provinces (Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Quebec). This article draws insights from the literatures on regionalis m and networks to examine growing Canadian provincial and U.S. state level environmental cooperation with a case study of the regional NEG-ECP climate change action. The authors attended multiple regional meetings and workshops with public, private, and civil society participants, conducted a large series of semi-structured and open-ended interviews with stakeholders and experts, and reviewed a multitude of climate change documents and reports. We begin by discussing central aspects of regionalism and networks as tools for analyzing NEG-ECP policy-making and implementation.

More meaningful elements include: streamlined approval paths for LNG terminals; improved government standards to reduce GHG impacts of products and buildings; several billion dollars of federal aid to support deployment of clean-coal technology; new nuclear power generation; hybrids and other efficient vehicles; energy efficiency; and renewable energy, ranging from ethanol and other biofuels to wind and solar. These technology-push items will have little effect in the absence of regulated GHG limits. The Senate took a significant step forward on climate in preparing its version of the bill. A solid majority supported a resolution stating that Congress should enact a national mandatory, market-based program to slow, stop, and reverse growth of these emissions. A total of 21 states and the District of Columbia have adopted renewable energy mandates. Nine northeastern governors are designing a CO2 cap-and-trade program for power plants.

At current CO2 partial pressure [p(CO2)], rice is not photosynthetically saturated but immediately after exposure to 100 p(CO 2), photosynthetic rates are increased by 48 percent on an average. However, this increase is not sustained during prolonged exposure and is associated with reduced amounts of ribulose-1-5-bisphospate carboxylase/ oxygenase (Rubisco) content and its maximum potential activity (V cmax). Rubisco content and Vcmax were reduced by 33 and 22%, respectively, at elevated p(CO2) and this has an additive effect on leaf photosynthesis. Activation state of the Rubisco is also decreased by elevated p(CO2) but no deactivation of Rubisco occurs in rbcS antisense rice with 40% wild type Rubisco suggesting that deactivation is an optimize response. Large amounts of Rubisco (about 80-90%) is synthesized prior to full expansion of leaf when sugar accumulation is minimal. After the leaf has fully expanded, very little Rubisco (about 10-20%) is synthesized and a large amount of sugar accumulates during this period. Therefore, it is unlikely that downregulation of Rubisco at elevated p(CO2) is caused by decreasing the mRNA transcripts for Rubisco small subunit (rbcS) and Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) through soluble sugars. It is more likely that elevated p(CO2) mediated decline in Rubisco is due to rapid degradation of protein and lower nitrogen (N) allocation to Rubisco due to reduced N afflux. Leaf N content was reduced by 16% in plants grown at elevated p(CO2) though leaf N to Rubisco ratio remained consistently unchanged regardless of growth p(CO 2) suggesting that N assimilation, distribution and remobilization at the whole plant level is tightly controlled at elevated p(CO2). Further, changes in N and C metabolisms at elevated p(CO2) are likely to reduce the critical N concentration by 30% at elevated p(CO2). © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Currently Maryland does not meet the EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for annual PM 2.5, 8-hour ozone, and 1-hour ozone. Consequently, the monitoring focus will be on PM 2.5, ozone, and their respective precursors and constituent species. Column monitoring of meteorology and air quality will also take place via remote sensing by a wind profiling radar system and via in-situ measurements by aircraft and balloons. The new site, called ""Piney Run"", will provide a continuous time series of highly time resolved data. The location is unique for measuring regional background pollutant loads because it is a high elevation, western boundary location in rural Maryland. Piney Run will also focus on haze-related measurements as part of the Rural Aerosol Intensive Network (RAIN) deployed in Spring 2004 by state agencies in the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Visibility Union (MANE-VU) regional planning organization.

Simon formation has the potential for large amount of CO2 sequestration. However, the area of the formation inside the Canadian territory is small compared to that of the area inside the states of Michigan and Ohio. A coordinated effort between Canada and USA can make sequestration in this formation a success. With the exception of the concerns described in the safety aspects, the caprock integrity seems to be acceptable. Even though, the caprock should be tested by core analysis to determine its properties and overall integrity. The presence of shale formation in the Silurian and Devonian strata of the study area will provide a succession of barriers to vertical migration of CO2 and might contain any leak of CO2 if it occurs from the main caprock. Distance between the source and a sink is a major factor for the viability of a sequestration project. The biggest advantage for the Nanticoke power generation is that it is located on the edge of the southern zone. Distant location from the point source and cross-country piping network through populated areas makes the northern zone less attractive for sequestration of Nanticoke CO2.

Predictions by the National Petroleum Council (NPC) on ""Balancing natural gas policy - Fueling the demands of a growing economy"" in September 2003 forecast that the traditional North American producing area will provide only 75% of the long term U.S. gas needs. At present 2% of the total U.S. natural gas demand is met by imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). Over the next 20 years, supply from the imported LNG is expected to make up over 15% of the total U.S. gas demand. This will require construction of new LNG import terminals. One of the main components of the LNG import terminal facility is the LNG vaporizer, which vaporizes the LNG from liquid to gaseous form. The natural gas is then transported to the users in a pipeline. Various LNG vaporizer technologies have been utilized in the world today. Each technology has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the terminal locations, economic benefits and environmental impact. Most of the existing land based LNG terminals in the U.S. use Submerged Combustion Vaporizer (SCV) technology as a primary means for vaporizing LNG due to its high thermal efficiency and ease of start up and operation. Also the SCV technology has an excellent safety record. Although SCV technology has high thermal efficiency, excellent operability and good safety record, the conventional SCV generates air emissions due to natural gas combustion producing nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) among others. Many areas of the U.S, where the LNG import terminals are being considered, require air emission controls to mitigate the environmental impacts.

Pollution resources combined with moisture provide undesirable conductive paths on insulations that result in faults and economic losses. Types and degree specification of pollution seems to be vital for efficient operation and proper choice of insulation. Various climates, pollution resources like Oromieh Lake, cement and plaster factories, as well as industrial towns respect to localization necessity of international standards motivated authors to perform field and periodic pollution measurements in Azarabayjan province as a test place. The periodic measurements of ESDD-NSDD and DDG lead to the establishment of a pollution map of North-west of Iran. The different climatic parameters of Oromieh and Khoy are compared with pollution variation procedure of the test stations to assess climate influence on pollution accumulation. According to authors' researches, we feel, proves that the ESDD measurement alone is not sufficient to establish the pollution severity level of a given site. Likewise, analysis of the site pollution severity and the weather data indicated a strong correlation of SPS with some of the climatic parameters. Thus, new approaches to study environmental pollution effects on insulation of West-Azarbayjan province are presented in this paper. © 2006 IEEE.","DDG; ESDD; Insulation; NSDD; Pollution map","Climate change; Electric conductivity; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Insulation; Standards; DDG; ESDD; NSDD; Pollution map; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847100997

One of the emerging techniques for NOx reduction is that of NOx Storage and Reduction (NSR), and the device in which NSR is carried out is commonly referred to as the lean NOx trap (LNT). The LNT is a periodically-operated adsorptive reactor and comprises a bifunctional catalyst with deliberate periodic operation in which the air fuel ratio is altered between lean (oxygen excess) and rich (fuel excess) mixtures. During the storage phase, NOx is incorporated into the alkali earth storage component as a mixture of nitrites and nitrates through a complex set of steps that involve NO oxidation to NO2 on the precious metal (Platinum), followed by nitration of the alkali earth carbonate, among other pathways. Just before breakthrough of NOx in the reactor effluent, a net-reducing mixture is fed to the trap either by temporary rich operation of the lean burn engine or by direct injection of reductant (fuel) into the exhaust system. During this regeneration or purge phase the injected hydrocarbon serves the dual role of consuming the excess oxygen and of reducing the nitrites/nitrates. The NOx reduction chemistry primarily occurs on the precious metal through a selective catalytic reduction process forming a mixture of nitrogen and N2O as the N containing products. Upon regeneration of the storage component, the feed is switched back to the net oxidizing feed and the cycle is repeated. In this study, we simulate the effect of various parameters on the working of the NOx trap by using a generic two-phase, 1-D model describing detailed chemistry of adsorption, desorption and reaction of different species. This detailed kinetic model includes the storage of oxygen (on ceria) and NOx in the washcoat during the lean phase, followed by combustion of hydrocarbon and reduction of NOx during the rich phase. We compare the steady state operation with the cyclic operation and predict that there is a feed temperature window where cyclic operation gives high NOx conversions. Several design and operating parameters are varied to study how the NOx conversion efficiency of the LNT varies and to find out the optimal operating strategy for achieving the best fuel economy. The parameters studied include the feed reactant fraction, cycle timing and temperature. The results from this study are compared with the experimental results and found to follow the same trends.",,"Adsorption; Diesel engines; Exhaust gases; Hydrocarbons; Precious metals; Reduction; Adsorptive reactor; NOx Storage and Reduction (NSR); Reduction chemistry; Nitrogen oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645644066

Many important phenomena leading to limitations of properties of composites may take place at the interface, depending on its structure and local stress field. Present study was carried out in order to obtain better understanding of the role of controllability of the properties of composites via fiber surface treatment and interface modification. Two surface modification methods have been developed and evaluated. These consisted of a chemical vapour deposition technique, used to build up a uniform carbonaceous layer of around 80 nm of pyrolytic carbon on the fiber surface and controlled growth of multiwall carbon nanotubes on fiber surface. The fiber surface modifications were achieved by exposing the fibers to suitable hydrocarbon environment at elevated temperatures. The surface modified fibers were used to fabricate composite specimens with either coal tar pitch or epoxy matrix. The surface modifications are expected to alter damage and microfracture mechanisms occurring at the interface in response to local stress field during loading. Shear properties being amongst the most sensitive to interface behaviour, short beam shear test and flexural tests were conducted on the composite samples made out of carbon fibers with and without surface treatments. A significant increase in the value of these parameters was observed in both the cases of surface modification. Composite specimens made out of PyC coated fibers showed an increase of 300% in flexural strength and 360% in shear strength while the composite specimens made out of CNT grown carbon fibers showed 74% increase in flexural strength and 18% increase in shear strength. Metallographic and fractographic examination showed that pyrolytic carbon layer reduced interface debonding between carbon matrix and carbon fibers. Presence of nanotubes on fiber surface appeared to effectively anchor the carbon fibers into the matrix and reduce fiber pullout during crack propagation and rupture.","Carbon finer reinforced composites; Carbon nano-filaments; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical vapour deposition; Composites; Interface treatment; Nanotechnology; Surface engineering","Carbon fibers; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical vapor deposition; Composite materials; Fiber reinforced materials; Nanotechnology; Carbon finer reinforced composites; Carbon nano-filaments; Interface treatment; Surface engineering; Surface treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644952428

We conclude this behavior results from emission from initial states in a dielectric (oxide) surface coating, and that the energies of these states change relative to the emitter Fermi level due to changing oxide state density and charge density. When emission occurs below the bulk Fermi level, energy is deposited into the emitter. In some cases this energy can be coupled to chemical bonds, creating states in the oxide and improving electron transport. If the power density deposited this way becomes excessive, oxide breakdown and arc initiation can result. Thus preventing excessive emission current at potentials more than 1-2 V positive relative to the bulk Fermi level may prevent arc initiation. We propose that might be done by building a second (filter) aperture above each gate aperture in an array, and placing the aperture at a low positive voltage relative to the emitter contact. That structure creates a potential barrier for emitted electrons, which will cause those electrons emitted at excessively positive potentials to be returned to the gate electrode. A circuit element in series with the gate electrode will reduce the gate voltage, thereby limiting the current emitted at low energy. To limit or regulate the total emission current, a small resistor or other circuit element can be placed in series with the emitter, forcing the emission energy to be reduced in response to a given current. © 2005 American Vacuum Society.",,"Field emission; Surface coatings; Coatings; Electric arcs; Electric breakdown; Electric potential; Electrons; Fermi level; Silicon; Arrays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22944431621

Because urban access is considered crucial to the economic success of a downtown area, certain constituencies, such as business and retail, have historically been opposed to such policies. To address these concerns and design appropriate policies, it is important to understand how visitors to a city center are likely to respond to new policies. This paper presents a model for estimating the likely response to two potential auto restraint policies in the center of Tel Aviv, the largest metropolitan area in Israel: an increase in parking cost and the use of congestion pricing in the form of a cordon around the city center. The models are based on the responses of center visitors to a stated preference survey. The results show that for both workers and nonworkers, most drivers who respond to the policy will do so by changing their mode of travel, and, in the case of congestion pricing, by also changing the time of their trip. The minority will respond by changing their destination or canceling their trip. This is an encouraging result from a policy point of view because changing time or mode is considered a positive shift, whereas changing destination or canceling the trip is considered negative. The results indicate that auto restraint policies can be effective in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in city centers without hampering their economic vitality.",,"Air pollution; Costs; Highway traffic control; Motor transportation; Parking; Urban planning; Auto restraint policies; Traffic congestion; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645071927

Based on carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction target defined by Kyoto Protocol, CO2 emission quota in each commitment period were set in the study. Using this model, the global energy system subject to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target in the 2nd commitment period from 2000 to 2017 was optimized. Through application of this model to Kyoto Mechanism, optimal technical measures to achieve emission reduction commitment are proposed. Simulations by the model showed that CO2 emissions of Annex B countries in each scenario exceed the total CO2 emission quota for Annex B. Excess is filled up by the gain of emission rights by the utilization of Kyoto Mechanism and banking of CO2 emission rights.

Therefore, a systematic framework for episodic urban air quality management (e-UAQM"") is needed to control pollution levels during adverse dispersion conditions. Mathematical modelling techniques are mostly used in predicting the air pollution dispersion phenomena. However, there exist considerable difficulties in describing pollutant dilution mechanism in urban environment due to its complexity and nonlinearity. Majority of the existing conventional models fail in accurately predicting the air pollutant concentration due to inherent limitations in form of various assumptions. In this paper, the application of conventional deterministic, stochastic, hybrid of deterministic and statistical, and artificial neural network (ANN) based line source models in the management of local air quality of Delhi city is explained. The limitations encountered in modelling of urban air pollution are also presented.

In the present paper, an analysis is made of the bursts of the CV triplet emission (2271-2278 Å) observed over all of the viewing chords in high-current discharges and also of a decrease in the spectral line emission below its initial (predisruption) level both in the plasma core and at the plasma edge in low-current discharges. The data from measurements of the spatial and temporal parameters of the CV line emission from the central and peripheral plasma regions in the rapid phase of disruption in the DAMAVAND tokamak are compared to the results from model calculations of the kinetics of the charge-state distribution of carbon impurity ions (during the disruption, their kinetics is governed by the increase in the effective recombination rate). A key result of the kinetic model is an increase in the effective rate of charge exchange of impurity ions by two orders of magnitude. Numerical simulations show that the dispersion of the charge-state distribution increases substantially; this is attributed to the rapid phase of disruption being dominated by the recombination of impurity ions through charge exchange with neutrals rather than by the anomalous transport. In this case, carbon impurities in the plasma are transported to the region of increased radiative losses on a time scale of 50 μs. © 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21844478750

Once the proposed EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) becomes operational, however, the CO2 performance of these policies, i.e. their effectiveness and efficiency in reducing CO2 emissions, will differ depending on whether they affect fossil fuel use by the participating or non-participating sectors of this scheme. This article discusses in particular the CO2 performance of national energy policies affecting the participating sectors of the EU ETS. A major conclusion is that once the EU ETS becomes operational, the effectiveness of all other policies to reduce CO2 emissions of the participating sectors becomes zero. Moreover, in a perfect economy with no market failures, these policies will lead to a lower CO2 efficiency and less optimal market operations of the EU ETS. Hence, in such a situation, this coexistence of policy instruments cannot be justified from a CO2 efficiency point of view. It will be argued, however, that there are three reasons why the joint use of the EU ETS and policies affecting the fossil fuel use of the participating sectors may be justified: (1) improving the design of the EU ETS, (2) correcting for market failures, and (3) meeting other policy objectives besides CO2 efficiency. The ideas expressed in this article are illustrated by a detailed numerical example on the interaction between emissions trading and national energy policies. The article concludes with a summary of its major findings and policy implications. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Emissions trading; Energy policy; Policy interaction","emissions trading; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22244475439

These infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are characterized by their high masses, high column densities, and low temperatures, which makes them interesting candidates for clouds in the earliest stages of star formation. Little is known, however, about their origin and distribution in the Galaxy. We use mid-IR data acquired by the MSX satellite mission to identify and catalog IR dark cloud and core candidates in the first and fourth Galactic quadrants using a median filtering technique applied to the images. The catalog contains ∼ 12000 objects. Their distribution is concentrated around the Galactic mid-plane and traces prominent bright star forming regions. Selected high contrast IR dark clouds in the first Galactic quadrant are correlated with 13CO emission from the BU-FCRAO Galactic Ring Survey (GRS), a high resolution survey of 13CO emission in the inner Milky Way. With the GRS it is possible to spectroscopically determine distances to the IR dark clouds and to derive physical parameters, such as sizes and masses, of the dark cores and their parental molecular clouds. Based on morphological correlation of mid-IR extinction and GRS 13CO emission in velocity channel maps, we assign radial velocities to the IR dark clouds throughout the first Galactic quadrant. Assuming a flat rotation curve with (R ⊙, v 0)=(8.5 kpc, 220 km s -1) and that the clouds are at the near kinematic distance, we break the distance ambiguity and determine their location in the Galaxy. We selected a total of 375 dark clouds in the GRS coverage of the first Galactic quadrant with contrasts higher than 20% and sizes larger than 1′. Of these, 318 have clean morphological matches with GRS molecular line emission in distinct velocity channels. The remaining dark clouds are either low contrast clouds, have only weak GRS emission counterparts or molecular line emission in more than one velocity channel, or no GRS emission at any velocity. The latter are often found close to bright H II regions and are probably holes in the MSX emission. The majority of IR dark clouds is found towards the 5 kpc Galactic Ring. High contrast IR dark clouds almost always have bright, extended 13CO emission. Thus, in many cases, they are condensations inside larger Giant Molecular Clouds. Core masses are typically a few 100 to a few 1000 M ⊙. We therefore suggest that the condensations in the most massive IR dark clouds represent high mass proto-clusters, or OB-associations in the making.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24144473926

While the advantages of compression ignition engines are superior to other internal combustion engines in torque generation and fuel efficiency, some diesel exhaust emissions pose health and environmental problems. Emission reduction techniques generally diminish one type of tailpipe gas yet often sacrifice engine performance and may even raise other emission levels. For instance, exhaust gas recirculation can reduce NOx emissions. However, the dilution of the combustion charge with hot inert exhaust gas hinders the engine's power characteristics. To solve this problem, an EGR cooler allows the exhaust gases to be cooled prior to mixing with intake air allowing a denser cylinder charge for combustion. The effective application of cooled EGR requires a smart thermal management system. In this paper, a real time empirical and analytical model will be introduced to estimate the diesel engine's overall performance. The simplified model considers the engine's combustion chemistry, as well as the thermal, emissions, and rotational dynamics. Representative numerical and experimental test results are presented and discussed to validate the model. Eventually, an on-board computer controller will use this model to regulate the EGR valve's functionality and the smart thermal system.

Since then, dispersant formulations have evolved significantly, leading many in the oil spill response community to revisit the question of whether or not dispersing oil can help achieve an overall net ecological benefit. Spill response must necessarily involve weighing the costs and benefits of both dispersant use and nonuse to resources potentially at risk. The majority of comparative data on the toxicity of dispersed and undispersed oil in the literature to date is based on fresh oil. In most circumstances, however, mounting of dispersant operations requires hours to days, making the use of data based on fresh oil problematic. Laboratory-weathered oil has been used in the evaluation of dispersant effectiveness, but its use in toxicological investigations has been limited. Using standardized methods, the authors have compared the acute aquatic effects of untreated and chemically dispersed oil in both its fresh state, and artificially weathered to simulate approximately 1 day at sea. Oil weathering was done under controlled conditions using accepted, repeatable methods. Findings show that weathering significantly reduces the amount of low molecular weight hydrocarbons, and generally elicits reduced toxicity from both untreated and dispersed oil, compared to fresh oil. Based on actual hydrocarbon exposures, however, in several instances aqueous solutions from dispersed and undispersed oil (both fresh and weathered) were essentially equitoxic.",,"Ecological damage; Marine organisms; Oil spill response; Dispersions; Ecology; Marine pollution; Oil spills; Risk assessment; Weathering; Crude petroleum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646055778

Based on the Ford U152 Explorer platform, implementation of the hybrid powertrain has resulted in an efficient, high performance vehicle with a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 7.5 seconds. A dual drive system allows for four-wheel drive capability while optimizing regenerative braking and minimizing electric motor cogging losses. Design of the system focused on reducing petroleum use, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing criteria tailpipe emissions. Additionally, this vehicle has been designed as a partial zero emissions vehicle (PZEV), allowing the driver to travel up to 50 miles in a zero emission all-electric mode. High-energy traction battery packs can be charged from the grid, yielding higher efficiencies and lower critical emissions, or maintained through the internal combustion engine (ICE) as with a traditional hybrid vehicle. The ICE is primarily used to provide average power and maintain state of charge (SOC). The ability to use the electric energy from the grid allows the most inexpensive way of driving the vehicle and reduces the dependence on petroleum. Electric power created at a large-scale power plant is produced more efficiently than by an ICE. However, to allow a long range and the option (rather than requirement) for using the plug, one has the capability to utilize liquid fuel through the ICE as well. Fuel consumption is reduced by more than 80% over the stock vehicle, resulting in average city usage of roughly 29 mpg (gasoline equivalent). Full functionality of the stock vehicle has been maintained, including four wheel drive, tow, and acceleration capabilities, as well as driver comfort, with no loss in cabin space and a small increase in vehicle weight. Analysis shows a final cost lower than comparable performance competitors. This paper details the design and implementation of this powertrain, and compares the hybrid vehicle response to that of the stock vehicle.

A catalyzed particulate filter (CPF) is used to capture PM in the exhaust stream, but as PM accumulates in the CPF, exhaust flow is restricted resulting in reduced horsepower and increased fuel consumption. PM must therefore be burned off, referred to as CPF regeneration. Unfortunately, nominal exhaust temperatures are not always high enough to cause stable self-regeneration when needed. One promising method for active CPF regeneration is to inject fuel into the exhaust stream upstream of an oxidation catalytic converter (OCC). The chemical energy released during the oxidation of the fuel in the OCC raises the exhaust temperature and allows regeneration. This approach facilitates active control of the regeneration process so that the CPF can be operated in a sufficiently clean state to maintain engine performance and fuel economy. Development of active regeneration control strategies is challenging since a balance must be struck between fuel consumption for the regeneration process, keeping backpressure low by burning off PM, and maintaining regeneration stability. This paper describes the development of a lumped parameter heavy-duty vehicle engine aftertreatment system simulation (VEASS) suitable for designing and evaluating the performance of CPF active regeneration control strategies. A candidate control strategy is also proposed and evaluated using this model calibrated to load cycle data for an International 9700 heavy-duty truck with a Cummins ISM 2002 diesel engine. The PM collected in the CPF is estimated from the pressure drop across the CPF. It was found that fuel injection for active regeneration should not be allowed to respond to high frequency components in the CPF pressure drop and the CPF exhaust inlet temperature. A filter-based approach is described for avoiding the negative effects of responding to the high frequency measurements. For the sample case study considered, the fuel penalty associated with CPF usage was reduced with higher PM loadings of the CPF, higher target temperatures at the inlet to the CPF and higher time constant of the low pass filter to the OCC inlet temperature. Also, different sized exhaust systems can be evaluated for active regeneration strategies using the VEASS model and a different sized CPF is simulated for illustration.

These elevated nitrogen levels are attributed to increased point and nonpoint sources, and to alterations in the landscape and river channel that promote delivery instead of uptake and sequestration. In this paper, we examine estimates of nitrogen loads in the Mississipi River Basin, look at some simplistic load reduction scenarios, and discuss the difficulties in balancing different controls to address hypoxia. Load estimates are taken from the National Water Pollution Control Assessment Model (NWPCAM), a policy support tool being developed for EPA by Research Triangle Institute. NWPCAM combines point source discharge information from the Permit Compliance System database with nonpoint source loading models for urban and rural areas to provide end-of-pipe and edge-of-field source estimates for conventional pollutant loadings. Load estimates for current conditions and for hypothetical control scenarios (e.g. point source nitrogen limits, feedlot regulation) will be compared in order to suggest potential benefits. Although point source and agricultural controls both have tangible benefits in load reductions, there is considerable debate as to whether one approach is more effective and efficient than the other.

Anthracyclines used to treat cancer are reduced by CR at the C13 carbonyl and the resulting metabolites are implicated in the cardiotoxicity associated with anthracycline therapy. CR also is believed to have a role in detoxifying quinones, raising the question whether CR catalyzes reduction of anthracycline quinones. Steady-state kinetic studies were done with several anthraquinone-containing compounds, including 13-deoxydoxorubicin and daunorubicinol, which lack the C13 carbonyl, thus unmasking the anthraquinone for study. kcat and k cat/Km values for 13-deoxydoxorubicin and daunorubicinol were nearly identical, indicating that that the efficiency of quinone reduction was unaffected by the differences at the C13 position. kcat and kcat/Km values were much smaller for the analogs than for the parent compounds, suggesting that the C13 carbonyl is preferred as a substrate over the quinone. CR also reduced structurally related quinone molecules with less favorable catalytic efficiency. Modeling studies with doxorubicin and carbonyl reductase revealed that methionine 234 sterically hinder the rings adjacent to the quinone, thus accounting for the lower catalytic efficiency. Reduction of the anthraquinones may further define the role of CR in anthracycline metabolism and may influence anthracycline cytotoxic and cardiotoxic mechanisms. © Copyright 2005 by Humana Press Inc.

A 2,800 m deep borehole was drilled to explore potential CO2 storage reservoirs at an electric power plant along the Ohio River Valley. The goal of the drilling was to install a test well that could be used both for hydrogeologic testing and for injecting CO2 from the power plant into deep saline reservoirs if such a decision is made. The arrangement of rock formations encountered in the test boring was similar to the regional framework estimates made in the pre-drilling characterization. The formations identified as potential reservoirs were mainly in the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks within the depth range of 2,100 m to 2,765 m. These include the sandy part of Rose Run Sandstone and a zone of high permeability within the Copper Ridge Dolomite. The basal sand overlying the Precambrian rocks (a probable equivalent of the Mt. Simon Sandstone present in much of the midwestern USA), was dominated by highly cemented sandstone. Low permeability shale, dolomite, and limestone layers dominate the remaining geologic column. Deeper formations were present in relatively thick, continuous layers typical of the Appalachian Basin. Rocks dip toward the southeast at approximately 20 m per km. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Australia is considerably impacted by these fluctuations and although is served by several operational prediction schemes, the associated degree of skill is, at best, only moderate. There now exist quite a number of dynamically-based seasonal prediction models which are global in extent and there is considerable interest in developing methods for maximizing and quantifying their skill and utility to potential end-users. It is also possible to assess their performance by accessing hindcast (retrospective prediction) data. One of these models was developed by CSIRO and is based on the CSIRO Mk3 global coupled climate model. Results from seven other models which comprise the DEMETER (""Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble system for seasonal to inTERannual prediction"") project were also assessed. This paper focuses on an assessment of the skill of the models at predicting rainfall for a catchment region of south-east Australia. In each case, rainfall hindcasts are compared with observed rainfall totals and also compared with observed inflows into one of the major reservoirs, the Burrinjuck dam. The major findings are: • It is not possible to distinguish between the performance of the different models due to different sample sizes and periods for which hindcasts are available. • Overall, the models exhibit an ability to capture, to some extent, variations in seasonal rainfall associated with ENSO events and this is evident in the fact that they exhibit skill in the extreme categories but not in the average category. • The average success rate, while greater than that expected by chance or the strategy which assumes climatology, is not high and is expressed in the slight shifts in the probabilities for below average and above average tercile categories. As a rough guide, the model-based predictions provide an advantage over climatology 1 year in every 10. • Taking into account the fact that rainfall and inflow predictions can be somewhat redundant when dealing with water storages, this may overestimate the potential utility to end -users. • Finally, it has to be recognised that the economic value of predictions, no matter how skilful, can be diminished according to the costs/benefits associated with decisions made by the end-user. Assessing value is a more task which needs to be done on a case-by-case basis.","Burrinjuck Dam; El Nino/La Nina; Inflows; Rainfall; Seasonal predictions; Skill","Australia; Coupled climate model; Demeter; Economic values; EL Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation events; End users; ENSO events; Global scale; Hindcasts; Inflows; Inter-annual predictions; Interannual climate variability; Mean sea level pressures; Model-based prediction; Multi-model ensemble; Operational predictions; Potential utility; Quasi-periodic; Research efforts; Sample sizes; Sea surface temperatures; Seasonal climate prediction; Seasonal prediction; Seasonal rainfall; Skill; Water storage; El Nino-Southern Oscillation events; Inter-annual predictions; Interannual climate variability; Mean sea level pressures; Model-based prediction; Operational predictions; Sea surface temperature (SST); Seasonal climate prediction; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Catchments; Climatology; Computer simulation; Decision making; Forecasting; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Sea level; Atmospheric pressure; Catchments; Climate models; Climatology; Decision making; Forecasting; Ocean currents; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Sea level; Surface waters; Climate models; Predictive analytics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053101511

Previous risk estimates, such as those for indoor air pollution, had been done independently from one another, leading to incompatible criteria for accepting evidence of exposure-response relationships and approaches for establishing exposure. In addition, the separate assessments used different base years, different estimates of background disease rates, different population estimates, and different groupings of populations/countries/regions. Among the nearly 30 major risk factors examined were hypertension, cholesterol, tobacco, alcohol, unsafe sex, several kinds of occupational risks, lead exposure, climate change, and outdoor air pollution. At 1.6 million premature deaths annually, mainly in women and young children, indoor air pollution was found to be one of the 10 most important causes of ill-health in the world today and was ranked fourth after poor nutrition, unsafe sex, and dirty water in poor countries as a cause of ill-health. Substantial uncertainty is associated with these estimates, however, and there is urgent need to improve the quality and extent of exposure and epidemiological risk assessments to reduce the uncertainty associated with the main disease outcomes: pneumonia in children, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in adults, and to establish whether other diseases, for which is limited but intriguing evidence today, can be causally linked: TB, asthma, heart disease, cataracts, and low birth weight. New studies, such as the first randomized intervention trial in air pollution history, are promising to throw more light on this question. This trial, in highland Guatemala, is examining pneumonia and asthma related endpoints as well as adult heart-rate variability and pulmonary health. New technology is also greatly improving the capacity to estimate indoor air pollution exposures over large populations for small particles, the best single measure of risk. The WHO Comparative Risk Assessment also estimated the rate at which fuel-based household pollution would decline worldwide without intervention, which is a function of population and economic trends. The decline was estimated to be only 6-10% per decade, barely sufficient to make up for population increases. Thus there is need to find cost-effective interventions that can be effectively applied. The Chinese improved stove program, which has introduced nearly 200 million stoves, may provide useful lessons for other countries.",,"atmospheric pollution; disease incidence; health impact; indoor air; mortality risk; pollution exposure; risk assessment; World Health Organization; Central America; Guatemala [Central America]; Nicotiana tabacum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845603643

These kinds of treatments usually evolve off-gas. Air emission regulations have become increasingly stringent in recent years. Mixed waste thermal treatment in the United States is now generally regulated under the Hazardous Waste Combustor (HWC) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards. These standards impose unprecedented requirements for operation, monitoring and control, and emissions control. Off-gas control technologies and system designs that were satisfactorily proven in mixed waste operation prior to the implementation of new regulatory standards are in some cases no longer suitable in new mixed waste treatment system designs. Some mixed waste treatment facilities have been shut down rather than have excessively restrictive feed rate limits or facility upgrades to comply with the new standards. New mixed waste treatment facilities in the U. S. are being designed to operate in compliance with the HWC MACT standards. Activities have been underway for the past 10 years at the INL and elsewhere to identify, develop, demonstrate, and design technologies for enabling HWC MACT compliance for mixed waste treatment facilities.

Other major policy features of the CAA include introduction of market-based approaches, a ban on incineration, and the conversion of the Environmental Management Bureau from a staff to a line bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. With such key policy shifts, there has been an expectation that the CAA would improve air quality, particularly in urban centres where health-related costs of air pollution have been estimated to be around US$430 million per annum. However, the CAA has suffered implementation difficulties. This article analyses the institutional, regulatory and policy approaches adopted by the CAA and identifies the various issues besetting its implementation, from unfunded mandates to lack of institutional capacity. The paper concludes that the lack of political and financial support has resulted in a series of telling implementation gaps.

The resulting surface carbide was further hydrogenated in a stepwise mechanism leading to formation of methylidyne, methylene, methyl, and eventually to gaseous methane. Among various local minima, i.e., CO adsorption on top (1F), in a bridge (2F), and at a four-fold (4F) hollow sites, the highest diffusion barrier of CO molecule corresponded to diffusion out of 4F site with a barrier of ∼ 13 kcal/mole. The barrier for dissociation of CO bound at the 4F site had a value of 24.5 kcal/mole. The resulting C and O atoms adsorbed at 4F sites with binding energies of 186 and 145 kcal/mole, respectively. In both the two cases, the adsorption at 4F site was the most stable with binding energies of 161.3 and 99.5 kcal/mole for CH and CH3 species, respectively. In contradistinction, methyl adsorption was the most stable at 2F site. In the case of methane adsorption, a very week interaction with Fe surface independent of the surface site and molecular orientation relative to the surface was found. In this case, the calculated adsorption energies were very small with values of ∼ 0.9 kcal/mole indicating a weakly physisorbed state.

Biomass gasification is one such technology which is environmentally benign and holds large promise for the future. These technologies are currently being utilized for power generation applications at a number of industrial sites in India and abroad. This paper summarizes the work conducted using biomass derived producer gas in reciprocating internal combustion engines. The producer gas for the experimental work is derived from the well-established open top, re-burn, down draft gasification system, which is proven to generate consistent quality, ultra-clean producer gas. This paper discusses the actual emission measurements in terms of NOx and CO on (a) dual-fuel engine (compression ignition engine) - using high speed diesel and producer gas fuel, (b) gas engine (spark ignited engine) - using 100% ultra clean producer gas. In the case of dual-fuel operation it is found that the NOx levels are lower compared to operations with pure diesel fuel on account of lower peak flame temperature, whereas the CO levels were higher due to combustion inefficiencies. In the case of gas alone operation it is found to be environmentally benign in terms of emissions; NOx and CO levels are found to be much lower than most of the existing emissions norms of various countries including the United States and European Union.

Nine state-of-the-art DPF systems were retrofitted to heavy-duty and light-duty vehicles and were subjected to extensive long-term in-mine evaluation. Periodic efficiency tests were conducted at various stages of the study (in 2001, 2002 and 2004) to establish in-use efficiencies and durabilities of the tested DPF systems. During efficiency tests, the vehicles/engines were operated over several steady-state operating conditions. Various instruments were used to measure particulate and gaseous emissions upstream and downstream of the filter systems. The results were used to assess the effects of the filter systems on the concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM), nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide in the vehicle exhaust. Experience with the operational issues related to deployment of the filter systems on underground mining vehicles, coupled with the assessment of the filtration efficiencies, were the primary objectives of the study.

Studies of the degradation of diurnal leaf starch have revealed a number of surprises, such as the importance of starch phosphorylation in initiating degradation, and shown that starch degradation in leaves differs significantly from that in cereal grains. We have previously shown that plants contain three distinct α-amylase families. T-DNA knockouts of each α-amylase family member in Arabidopsis had no effect on diurnal leaf starch degradation, raising questions about the function of α-amylases in leaves.

Especially the complex modern combustion have a wide variety of parameters like injection, ignition, variable valve timing, variable port geometry, EGR etc. This variability allows unprecedented performance, fuel consumption, emission levels and driveability, but requires a tremendous effort for calibration of the ECU. Modern test bed technology, DOE, design of experiments, and powerful calibration software are required to handle the increased number of test runs which are necessary to for calibration of such a complex, modern combustion engine system. However, high dynamic engine test beds, drive train test beds, or the simulation of climatic conditions increase testing costs, and after all, even the most sophisticated technologies can't reproduce the complexity of a complete vehicle and real driving conditions. Therefore, taking measurements in the vehicle in addition to best bed measurements, provides a potentially cost and time saving alternative, with the advantage of absolutely realistic measurement conditions, but at the expense of reproducibility of measurement runs. It has proven to improve the quality and reliability of the engine application, control systems and components in the vehicle, and according to a major car manufacturer, was for example crucial for bringing SULEV vehicles into production. Using combustion diagnosis systems in combination with an ECU application system to measure data in correlation to the combustion cycles has opened new insight into the processes and the interrelations between ECU, injection system, combustion system, exhaust system, engine mechanics, on-board electronics and other parts of the vehicle. The detailed information about every single combustion and its parameters enables application and development engineers to optimize the vehicle performance under all conditions. It helps to identify and consequently correct ECU function errors, to optimize the strategies for emission reduction, and to improve the responsiveness and driveability of the vehicle. Additionally, these aspects of vehicle quality can be verified and tested under all climatic conditions or sea levels. This paper will take a look at the measurement system that can be used for such measurements, and the type of data which can be acquired. It will discuss some examples of improvements in engine calibration, emissions, performance and engine hardware. It will show how the in-vehicle measurement approach ideally supplements testbed testing to reach emission limits, and to improve and fine tune engine performance and driveability while keeping costs under control.

Piper, an American engineer. His concept was to include combining an internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric motor to provide extra acceleration. In the early 1900s, a typical automobile would require around 30 seconds to accelerate to 25 miles per hour. With Mr. Piperis invention, this could be accomplished in 10 seconds. However, within a very few years, gasoline ICEs had improved and were able to accelerate within an acceptable amount of time, without the extra electric motor. [1] The early 1900 engines improved and became more powerful resulting in a decreased interest in hybrid vehicles. There were still a few hybrids built around this time, but between 1910 and 1920, production of hybrid vehicles steadily declined to a dormant state for the next 50 years. The next resurgence of hybrids came in the mid-1970s. In the 1970s, gasoline prices increased drastically due to an oil crisis, causing people to renew their interest in the hybrid vehicles. In 1966, the U.S. government began introducing new bills that recommended the use of electric and hybrid cars. However, it was not until ten years later, in 1976, that any action was taken. The traditional automotive electrical system has been part of a modern luxury vehicle ever since Henry Ford's wife watched her friend start the car with the push of a button. The 12-volt system is being strained by safety features, luxury add-ins and with the requirement for greater efficiencies and dramatic reductions in emissions. The hybrid vehicle and the drive towards fuel cell vehicles will enable a series of other exciting options to the automotive digital design engineer.

The chapter presents a summary of the findings from this study. Regulatory issues are discussed in the context of relevant timeframes. Most industry standards and codes relate principally to an operational period for engineering projects of up to several decades, perhaps as much as one hundred years. In contrast, CO2 stored in geological reservoirs should remain there for at least several hundred, and possibly thousands of years. Thus, the focus of this chapter has been on the long-term framework for CO2 storage. Two independent timeframes are identifiable, according to the specific responsibilities of a regulatory system. The first relates to reservoir storage performance, or permanence and the second timeframe relates to local environmental impacts. Issues were discussed in terms of these two timeframes under six main topic areas: liability, economics, record keeping, wellbore integrity, reservoir leakage, and monitoring. Such issues are interrelated and there is considerable overlap among/between the individual topics. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947427355

To address these issues, a group of scientists and engineers at NASA Langley Research Center proposed the use of an IR camera to inspect the RCC. Any crack in an RCC panel changes the thermal resistance of the material in the direction perpendicular to the crack. The change in thermal resistance can be made visible by introducing a heat flow across the crack and using an IR camera to image the resulting surface temperature distribution. The temperature difference across the crack depends on the change in the thermal resistance, the length of the crack, the local thermal gradient, and the rate of radiation exchange with the environment. The current paper describes how the authors derived the minimum thermal gradient detectability limits for a through crack in an RCC panel. This paper will also show, through the use of a transient, 3-dimensional, finite element model, that these minimum gradients naturally exist on-orbit. The results from the finite element model showed that there exists sufficient thermal gradient to detect a crack on 96% of the RCC leading edge.","Infrared (IR) imaging; Non-destructive Testing (NDT); Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC); Thermal Protection System Inspection; Thermography","IR camera; On-orbit inspection; Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC); Thermal protection system inspection; Carbon carbon composites; Finite element method; Heat radiation; Heat resistance; Inspection; Nondestructive examination; Space shuttles; Wings; Thermography (imaging)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26444533466

Together, these fields stored 2.4 billion t of CO2, equivalent to more than 1 year of USA power plant emissions. Because CO2 in these fields has been commercially extracted for industrial uses, the fields offer data on natural CO2 reservoirs, cap rocks, and production operations. McElmo Dome, the largest and most important field, originally stored 1.6 billion t of supercritical CO2 within a carboniferous carbonate reservoir at a depth of 2300 m. Carbon isotope data indicate the CO2 originated from a nearby igneous intrusion dated to 70 Ma. Its cap rock is a 400-m thick sequence of salt (halite), which is finely layered and unperturbed by faults which cut the underlying reservoir; there is no evidence of CO2 leaking into the overlying strata. McElmo Dome has two decades of safe operational history. It currently produces 15 million t/year (800 MMcfd) of 99%-pure CO2, which is transported 900 km via pipeline to depleted oil fields for re-injection and enhanced recovery. However, these three fields represent a small sampling of geologic situations, insufficient for defining universal criteria for cap rock integrity. Building scientific and public acceptance for geologic CO2 storage may be facilitated if proposed projects each had a local or regional natural analog. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

New generation lean-burn combustion engines which are more effective and require less fuel consumption will raise the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) even more. Thus, especially in urban areas, more stringed environmental regulations are to release which can only be met by development of new catalytic materials and concepts. Rare earth oxide catalysts are reported to offer highly effective conversion of NOx by methane (CHU) in the terms of selective catalytic reduction (HC-SCR). Especially La 2O3 is reported to have a high NO reduction by CK 4 to N2, although its technical realization as catalyst material has not yet reported and can be challenging due to the hydroscopic property of La2O3. Complex oxide compounds containing La2O3 however can be suitable alternatives and promising candidates for technical application as catalysts. In this study, LaMnAl 11O19 is characterized in terms of HC-SCR with methane. Phase and morphological characterization of the powder synthesized by sol-gel route and coatings by electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) deposition was presented. LaMnAl11O19 crystallizes to the magnetoplumbite phase at about 1000°C and is then thermally stabile up to 1400°C. FTIR spectra of pressed sol-gel powder showed that NO is adsorbed superficially and oxidized by the surface. The addition of oxygen led to changes of the spectrum in the nitritenitrate region and the formation of NO + and N2U4 species.

Iron is required for the synthesis of chlorophyll and of several photosynthetic electron transport proteins and for the reduction of CO2, SO4 2-, and NO3- during the photosynthetic production of organic compounds. Iron concentrations in vast areas of the ocean are very low (&lt; 1 nM) due to the low solubility of iron in oxic seawater. Low iron concentrations have been shown to limit primary production rates, biomass accumulation, and ecosystem structure in a variety of open-ocean environments, including the equatorial Pacific, the subarctic Pacific and the Southern Ocean and even in some coastal areas. Oceanic primary production, the transfer of carbon dioxide into organic carbon by photosynthetic plankton (phytoplankton), is one process by which atmospheric CO2 can be transferred to the deep ocean and sequestered for long periods of time. Accordingly, iron limitation of primary producers likely plays a major role in the global carbon cycle. It has been suggested that variations in oceanic primary productivity, spurred by changes in the deposition of iron in atmospheric dust, control atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and hence global climate, over glacial-interglacial timescales. A contemporary application of this ""iron hypothesis"" promotes the large-scale iron fertilization of ocean regions as a means of enhancing the ability of the ocean to store anthropogenic CO 2 and mitigate 21st century climate change. Recent in situ iron enrichment experiments in the HNLC regions, however, cast doubt on the efficacy and advisability of iron fertilization schemes. The experiments have confirmed the role of iron in regulating primary productivity, but resulted in only small carbon export fluxes to the depths necessary for long-term sequestration. Above all, these experiments and other studies of iron biogeochemistry over the last two decades have begun to illustrate the great complexity of the ocean system. Attempts to engineer this system are likely to provoke a similarly complex, unpredictable response.",,"carbon; iron; biology; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phytoplankton; review; sea; Carbon; Ecosystem; Iron; Marine Biology; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644796172

These systems are particularly expected to increase the comfort of living by providing increased functionality (e.g., autonomously controlling jalousies and lighting depending on insulation, or temperature control) and more ease-of-use by intelligent devices and device interoperation. Further, lower installation costs, increased flexibility and portability by using wireless communication technologies, ecological aspects (e.g., pollution reduction by intelligent climate control in office buildings), and security (e.g., fire alarm, escape route signalling, access control) play an important role. Most of these aspects have been discussed in preceding chapters of this book. Ubiquitous computing has also been suggested for other domains of our everyday life: In production environments, many devices need to co-operate and react spontaneously to the condition of other units in th plant. To this end, e.g., self-configuring conveyor belts and autonomously co-operating machinery have been proposed. In telemedicine, tracking of vital functions, localization and automatic alarming has been suggested. Many localization and remote metering applications can be found in the logistics sector. Computer and entertainment electronics offer a wide field of application for device interactions and remote control. Overall, the progress in ubiquitous computing will leverage new technologies to satisfy the demands and future needs of our society on the global scale, conserve energy resources and save cost. The predominant goal of ubiquitous computing is to create a networked environment which allows us to access even complex systems in a simple and intuitive way, relieving us of the details of the underlying technology [19, 34, 39]. A ubiquitous system does not only cover the classical application fields of data processing, but interweaves information technology with our real physical environment. Therey, it offers access not only to information anywhere and at any time, but also an unobtrusive and transparent access to technical appliances in our direct or remote environment. In order to realize this vision, three fundamental components are essential: 1. Intelligent Sensors and Actuators Sensors and actuators are the technical components which interface with the real world. They are needed to control and monitor our physical environment. Control networks in a ubiquitous computing environment must be able to organize themselves dynamically and autonomously, which is in contrast to state-of-the-art sensors and actuators. These are usually connected in a static, inflexible, manually-configured network. Selfconfiguration is especially important for control networks with a large number of nodes, since a manual configuration is too complicated for inexperienced users which are the primary target group of ubiquitous computing environments. To this end, the sensor and actuator nodes must exhibit the intelligence to set up the network connection, advertise and provide their functionalities to the other nodes of the network and access remote functionalities without user interaction. In many cases, ubiquitous computing systems need to provide a certain level of fault tolerance. At least a basic set of functionality must be preserved even if some nodes fail. Therefore, this functionality must be implemented in the sensor and actuator nodes themselves, whereas more advanced functionality may be centralized and remotely accessed from specific nodes in the network. 2. Middleware Platform The objective of the middleware platform of a ubiquitous computing system is to link the network components on a logical level. The middleware platform provides mechanisms which allow the nodes to discover each other, to offer their functionality to other nodes in a formalized way as so-called services and to access remote services offered by other nodes. Further, the middleware platforms support the so-called life-cycle management of servic s, which means monitoring, starting and stopping the services provided by the individual network nodes. 3. Semantic Data Processing In the future, the components of a ubiquitous computing environment will spontaneously establish networks and interact autonomously. Thereby, they create new services which consist of the joint access of several remote services on several remote components. To this end, more than a simple remote control operation is required. The underlying component-oriented services must be understood, interpreted and accumulated to higher-value services by the ubiquitous computing system. New services arise from the combination of several sub-services. For example, the desire of a user for ""more light"" will automatically be translated into appropriate commands to the installed lights and to the jalousies, dependent on the time, external weather conditions, the direction of the insolation, or the user preferences. This approach requires the semantic analysis of the condition of the environment and of the users' demands, and the translation into appropriate actions. Recently, several middleware platforms have been proposed which provide a basis for semantic data processing by defining mechanisms for network establishment, and discovery, description and access of services distributed in the network. However, due to excessive demands on data processing, these systems address components which exhibit high computing power and large memory. Thus, small sensors and actuators are typically excluded from the integration into these networks for cost and power reasons. Concurrently, research on autonomous sensor networks has propelled mainly in academia and has brought forth a number of approaches which are dedicated to the specific features of small sensors and actuators. Many of these approaches are related to static networks which must be configured manually. Few other approaches, e.g., the ones discussed previously in this book, aim at dynamic sensor networks which allow for spontaneous ad-hoc network est blishment. However, these approaches more or less ignore the need for semantic data processing and do not provide a service-oriented, transparent middleware which offers mechanisms for service discovery, description and remote access as needed in autonomous device control scenarios introduced above. In this article, we will focus on the requirements for embedding small sensors and actuators into a middleware-based, ""IT-centric"" ubiquitous computing environment. At the end, we will present an example on how autonomous interaction of small, low-cost and low-power appliances can be realized utilizing one of the best promoted middleware standards for semantic device interoperation, namely Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Therefore, the subject considered in this article is complementary to both the standardization pursued in middleware design as well as to the research conducted on autonomous sensor networks. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895206750

Rational nitrogen fertilization is of particular importance in rice crops in order to guarantee high production levels while minimising the impact on the environment. In fact, the typical flooded condition of rice fields can be a significant source of greenhouse gasses. Information on plant nitrogen concentration can be used, coupled with information about the phenological stage, to plan strategies for a rational and spatially differentiated fertilization schedule. A field experiment was carried out in a rice field Northern Italy, in order to evaluate the potential of field radiometric measurements for the prediction of rice nitrogen concentration. The results indicate that rice reflectance is influenced by nitrogen supply at certain wavelengths although N concentration cannot be accurately predicted based on the reflectance measured at a given wavelength. Regression analysis highlighted that the visible region of the spectrum is most sensitive to plant nitrogen concentration when reflectance measures are combined into a spectral index. An automated procedure allowed the analysis of all the possible combinations into a Normalized Difference Index (NDI) of the narrow spectral bands derived by spectral resampling of field measurements. The derived index appeared to be least influenced by plant biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI) providing a useful approach to detect rice nutritional status. The validation of the regressive model showed that the model is able to predict rice N concentration (R2=0.55 [p&lt;0.01]; RRMSE=29.4; modelling efficiency close to the optimum value).","Hyperspectral data; Nitrogen concentration; Normalized vegetation index; Oryza sativa","Concentration (process); Monitoring; Nitrogen; Radiometry; Hyperspectral data; Nitrogen concentration; Normalized vegetation index; Oryza sativa; Crops; Concentration; Farm Crops; Monitoring; Nitrogen; Radiometry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33244470336

At the global, national, and sub-national levels, many policies have been created or are in the process of development to deal with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), are being extensively studied because global climate change has been demonstrated to be one of the major environmental problems of the 21 s t century. CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or storage in saline aquifers are options available to governments and industries to meet emission reduction levels. Carbon emission trading can create a value for CO2 and can modify the cost competitiveness of EOR or other forms of geological storage. The main contributor to CO2 emissions is fossil fuel combustion. CO2 emissions can be reduced by switching to fuel with a lower carbon content, improving operating efficiency, and CO2 capture and storage. The International Energy Agency (IEA) Weyburn Monitoring and Storage Project was established to study the CO2-enhanced oil recovery project at Weyburn in 1999 to determine the fate of CO2 in the oil reservoir. Information from the IEA Weyburn Monitoring and Storage Project is used to provide baseline information for the storage of CO2.

In an effort to reduce the future atmospheric CO2, some technological mitigation strategies have been proposed. On the basis of detailed investigations to, it has been recognized that the CO2 sequestration in the ocean is one of the promising option from the points of view of its capacity, economy, and effectiveness. Benthic chamber experiment is conducted to investigate the impact of CO2 injection on deep-sea microbial ecosystem. In the experiment, the impact of CO2 and CO2-induced pH change on deep-sea floor microbial communities are investigated to determine the ecological effects by CO2 ocean sequestration. Microbial communities are characterized by using cultivation-independent molecular techniques-PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DOGE). A shift in community composition caused by CO2 enrichment is observed in sea-floor surface. To determine relationships among the community fingerprints, similarities are calculated and unweighted pair group clustering method with arithmetic averages is used to create a dendrogram describing pattern similarities. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is necessary to detect the VOCs precisely in order to control the air pollution during the plant operation. In general, to examine the concentration of VOCs, gas chromatography (GC) is used. However, most plant operators are using the easy operating handy VOCs detector, which is imported, because GC is difficult to treat and the installation price is high although it is very useful equipment. Therefore, the development of the VOCs detector becomes one of the urgent issues. In this study, sensing characteristics of selected VOCs for the development of VOCs detector was investigated. Semiconductor sensor and several VOCs such as aliphatic, aromatic, and non-homogeneous hydrocarbons were used for the experiment. Through the various experiments, sensor used in the experiment has shown high linearity and sensitivity for most VOCs in the range of 1 - 500 ppm concentration.

Three school buses equipped with an International T444E, an International DT466E, and a Cummins 5.9L ISB engine were instrumented and tested at the Aberdeen Test Center at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. Exhaust gas emission measurements were made using a Semtech-D mobile emissions analyzer to measure CO, CO2, NO2, NO, O2, and unburned hydrocarbons, along with a Sensors PM-300 to measure particulate matter (PM). In addition to the exhaust emissions measurements, operating parameters such as instantaneous vehicle speed, engine speed, percent load and fuel flow rate were acquired from the engine electronic control module (ECM) during testing. To ensure repeatability of testing under conditions that accurately reproduce actual school bus operating conditions, a new composite mobile school bus cycle was developed. The cycle was developed by acquiring Global Positioning System (GPS) data from actual school bus routes from 5 different municipalities within the state of New Jersey.

For human populations, climate change impacts can be devastating, giving rise to economic disruption and mass migration as agricultural systems fail, either through drought or floods. Such events impact significantly, not only where they happen, but also in the neighbouring areas. Vulnerability to the impacts of climate change needs to be assessed, so that adaptation strategies can be developed and populations can be protected. In this paper, we address the issue of vulnerability assessment through the use of an indicator approach, the climate vulnerability index (CVI). We show how this can overcome some of the difficulties of incommensurability associated with the combination of different types of data, and how the approach can be applied at a variety of scales. Through the development of nested index values, more reliable and robust coverage of large areas can be achieved, and we provide an indication of how this could be done. While further work is required to improve the methodology through wider application and component refinement, it seems likely that this approach will have useful application in the assessment of climate vulnerability. Through its application at sub-national and community scales, the CVI can help to identify those human populations most at risk from climate change impacts, and as a result, resources can be targeted towards those most in need. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Climate change; Indices; Vulnerability; Water resources","Agriculture; Drought; Economic and social effects; Floods; Risks; Adaptation strategies; Climate change impacts; Climate vulnerability index (CVI); Human populations; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact; flooding; hydrological response; vulnerability; agriculture; article; climate; climate change; controlled study; drought; economic aspect; environmental impact; flooding; methodology; population; risk assessment; society; Agriculture; Climates; Drought; Floods; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19044366278

This natural CO2 analogue was investigated as a first order proxy for a purposeful CO2 injection in order to determine potential effects such as depressed pH and hypercapnia on existing marine ecosystems. Trapping rates at Loihi were much higher than anticipated with a minimum of 1,100 amphipods recovered after a 24 hour deployment despite the loss of many animals through the funnel opening. On all dives the amphipods remained continuously active during the ascent to the surface until ambient temperatures of between 10 and 11°C were reached at a depth of about 300 m. From that point activity decreased rapidly until all appeared to be dead soon after the temperature exceeded 13°C at depths of about 250 m. These data indicate that the state of torpor which the majority of amphipods experienced following a 10-minute exposure to the vent fluids was due to the high CO2 content and not the elevated temperature. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, a prototype air filter was utilized to enhance the performance of a CVS by reducing non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) from dilution air at ambient temperature. Also incorporated into this study was the assessment of a Bag Mini-Dilute (BMD), a relatively new sampling system developed for measuring low-level vehicle emissions.

Three field examples from Jabung Block show pop-up features caused by Plio-Pleistocene tectonics inverting the pre-existing structures. This phenomenon creates the major hydrocarbon traps in the Jabung (Tungkal) sub-basin providing strong targets for further exploration work. Incorporating existing 3D seismic and wireline log data, a tectono-sedimentary model unique for the each field was generated. All three field geological models are in close proximity to each other within the Betara Complex. Generally, there are three distinct identifiable sub-basin evolution periods. First, a period of horst-graben development controlled by major localized extensional faults that initiated the basin architecture. This episode was followed by rapid to moderate sedimentation controlled by normal faults resulting in deposition of Oligocene Talang Akar alluvial, fluvial and deltaic deposits. Secondly, a period of decreased fault activity along with regional subsidence coinciding with the deposition of post-rifting fine marine Miocene sediments which provided a regional seal for the underlying reservoirs. The third period is marked by regional uplift resulting in wide spread basin inversion over the entire region providing a period of hydrocarbon trapping. Basin evolution provided complex stratigraphic and structural features and constitutes compartmentalized reservoirs. Complex-multiple gas and oil contacts and variation in CO2 distribution has verified the complexity of the basins geological framework. Drainage patterns identified from localized paleogeographic configurations can be used to locate sedimentary styles and trends. When combined with attribute extractions and structural analysis, these patterns can help explorationists develop excellent opportunities for further exploration and development of the area.

Several Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) systems were proposed to reduce such emissions. But the reliability and the durability of the current DPF systems remain an issue, due to the lack of the filter regeneration control during the ""stop & go"" duty cycles. To fit particularly these duty cycle requirements, a new active Diesel particulate filter system, called ExoClean™, was recently developed with a new regeneration strategy in order to achieve the durability and reliability issues. The ExoClean™ filter system is currendy offered by Renault Trucks as original equipment for the Premium DCI 11 320 Diesel engine (refuse trucks market) for EURO 3 and EUR04 applications. The ExoClean™ filter system was also evaluated by the French EPA (ADEME) through refuse trucks and urban busses applications over more than a 12 months program, using a standard European Diesel fuel (350ppm of sulfur). The filter system demonstrated high efficiency and durability. The ExoClean™ filter system received the VERT Verification and was added to the VERT Filter List. In parallel, in order to extend the field of applications, further improvements have been developed, and will be presented, such as: > Association with a fuel-borne catalyst (FBC) to control the filters regeneration and limit the maintenance: performance and long term durability; > Downsizing of the filter system: new SiC-based filters materials and design. > Association with NOx reduction devices: compatible strategies with NOx-SCR devices.

It has attracted the attention of researchers interested in automatically deriving the behavior of the components of a system from their interactions. UML lacks a formal semantics and does not propose semantic links between the diagrams of dynamics. In particular, Interaction diagrams do not have an operational semantics describing formally how to carry out such diagrams. Therefore, it is not possible to apply formal techniques for deriving Statecharts from Sequence diagrams. To reach this goal, this paper proposes a new semantics for UML Sequence diagrams based on a relation of causality between the actions of emission and reception of messages.

Tests were carried out with various payloads on roads. As the results, advantages of the tested hybrid truck were shown from the actual data regarding the fuel economy and NOx emissions, considering regeneration energy by the hybrid system. Improvement of the fuel economy and NOx emissions was clearly observed in the running condition such as urban and suburban roads. From the analysis of regeneration energy during vehicle deceleration, it turned out that a longer slowdown time and a higher speed at which deceleration begins result in larger amount of energy regeneration, which means the improvement of fuel economy. For the improvement of roadside pollutions, the reduction of NOx emissions in running using the second gear position is desired.

One example is shown by explicitly proving that one can indeed generate an unconditionally secure key from Alice's two-photon emission part in ""SARG04 protocol"" proposed by V. Scarani et al., in Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 057901 (2004). This protocol differs from BB84 only in the classical communication. It is, thus, interesting to see how only the classical communication of QKD protocol might qualitatively change its security. We also show that one can generate an unconditionally secure key from the single to the four-photon part in a generalized SARG04 that uses six states. Finally, we also compare the bit error rate threshold of these protocols with the one in BB84 and the original six-state protocol assuming a depolarizing channel.",,"Channel depolarization; Quantum key distribution; Secure key distillation; Single-photon polarization; Bit error rate; Communication channels (information theory); Light emission; Light polarization; Network protocols; Photons; Security of data; Quantum cryptography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749452576

Effects of light and temperature on isoprene emission rate (E) of Edgeworthia chrysantha was investigated. A leaf cuvette was modified to collect volatiles emitted by the plant leaf and its photosynthetic rate (A) and E were determined for the same periods. The experimental results showed that E value increased with increases in photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) and leaf temperature up to 40°C. A change in A value against PPF was similar to the change in E, but, for leaf temperature, the A value had a maximum between 25 and 30°C. As a result, carbon ratio of isoprene emission to photosynthetic uptake increased greatly with an increase in leaf temperature and had the highest value of 1-5% at 40°C. A model (G93) was employed to explain the plant isoprene emission responses to PPF and leaf temperature. The model could explain the isoprene emission within the RMS error of 3 nmol m-2s-1, while emission factor e calculated for standard conditions of 1000μmol m-2s-1 PPF and 30°C leaf temperature was largely different between measurements. This suggests that determining representative e value for a whole plant and stands is essential to estimate a regional scale isoprene emission. © 2005, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

'Cabernet Sauvignon' under three treatments of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI): 1) standard RDI (weekly applied water at 70% of estimated wellwatered vine evapotranspiration [ETw]); 2) early deficit (weekly water applications at 35% of ETw between fruit set and veraison, then a return to the standard treatment); and 3) late deficit (standard treatment until veraison, then weekly water applications at 35% of ETw until harvest). All vines were well-watered from harvest to leaf fall. Whole-vine chambers were deployed for 7-day measurement runs during physiologically important stages: fruit set, pre- and post-veraison, and pre- and postharvest. Large differences in net carbon exchange and transpiration were observed between vines under standard RDI and those receiving less applied water. Prior to veraison, early-deficit vines fixed 40% less carbon and transpired up to 46% less each day than did vines in the standard treatment, when integrated over 24 h. After veraison, transpiration was 38% less for the late deficit treatment compared to the standard treatment. Even though the early deficit vines had been irrigated at the standard RDI rate, at this time they did not appear to have completely recovered in terms of daily carbon fixed and water transpired. In late-deficit vines, after two to three irrigation cycles under the deficit, reductions in carbon assimilation and transpiration were proportionately similar to those that had been observed in the early-deficit vines before veraison. Only small differences in photosynthesis and transpiration were detected among treatments before and after harvest, when daytime temperatures were lower and day-length was shorter than at veraison. A longer deficit applied between fruit set and veraison reduced seasonal irrigation by 38% with no apparent negative impact on fruit quality, suggesting that reduction in irrigation below current levels of RDI can be accomplished in this region without negative impact on fruit.","Net carbon exchange; Regulated deficit irrigation; Transpiration; Vitis vinifera",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449105196

Box 10362, Wellington, New Zealand","An IPCC-based Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) was developed to monitor soil organic C stocks and flows to assist New Zealand to achieve its CO2 emissions reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol. Geo-referenced soil C data from 1158 sites (0.3 m depth) were used to assign steady-state soil C stocks to various combinations of soil class, climate, and land use. Overall, CMS soil C stock estimates are consistent with detailed, stratified soil C measurements at specific sites and over larger regions. Soil C changes accompanying land-use changes were quantified using a national set of land-use effects (LUEs). These were derived using a General Linear Model to include the effects of numeric predictors (e.g., slope angle). Major uncertainties arise from estimates of changes in the areas involved, the assumption that soil C is at steady state for all land-cover types, and lack of soil C data for some LUEs. Total national soil organic C stocks estimated using the LUEs for 0-0.1, 0.1-0.3, and 0.3-1 m depths were 1300 ± 20, 1590 ± 30, and 1750 ± 70 Tg, respectively. Most soil C is stored in grazing lands (1480 ± 60 Tg to 0.3 m depth), which appear to be at or near steady state; their conversion to exotic forests and shrubland contributed most to the predicted national soil C loss of 0.6 ± 0.2 Tg C yr-1 during 1990-2000. Predicted and measured soil C changes for the grazing-forestry conversion agreed closely. Other uncertainties in our current soil CMS include: spatially integrated annual changes in soil C for the major land-use changes, lack of soil C change estimates below 0.3 m, C losses from erosion, the contribution of agricultural management of organic soils, and a possible interaction between land use and our soil-climate classification. Our approach could be adapted for use by other countries with land-use-change issues that differ from those in the IPCC default methodology.","Flows; IPCC; Land-use change; Measurement; Modelling; Soil organic carbon; Stocks","land use change; organic carbon; soil survey; Australasia; New Zealand",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144453653

While in Europe the overall diesel share exceeds 40%, the current diesel share in the U.S. is 1%. Despite the current situation and the very stringent Tier 2 emission standards, efforts are being made to introduce the diesel engine back into the U.S. market. In order to succeed, these vehicles have to comply with emissions standards over a 120,000 miles distance while maintaining their excellent fuel economy. The availability of technologies such as high-pressure common-rail fuel systems, low sulfur diesel fuel, NOx adsorber catalysts (NAC), and diesel particle filters (DPFs) allow the development of powertrain systems that have the potential to comply with the light-duty Tier 2 emission requirements. In support of this, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has engaged in several test projects under the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels - Diesel Emission Controls (APBF-DEC) activity [1; 2; 5; 6]. The primary technology being addressed by these projects are the sulfur tolerance and durability of the NAC/DPF system. The project investigated the performance of the emission control system and system desulfurization effects on regulated and unregulated emissions. Emissions measurements were conducted over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP), Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP), and the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET). Testing was conducted after the accumulation of 150 hours of engine operation calculated to be the equivalent of approximately 8,200 miles. For these evaluations three out of six of the FTP test cycles were within the 50,000-mile Tier 2 bin 5 emission standards (0.05 g/mi NOx and 0.01 g/mi PM). Emissions over the SC03 portion of the SFTP were within the 4,000-mile SFTP standards. The emission of NOx+NMHC exceeded the 4,000-mile standard over the US06 portion of the SFTP. Testing was also conducted after the accumulation of 1,000 hours of engine operation calculated to be the equivalent of approximately 50,000 miles. Recalibrated drivability maps resulted in more repeatable NOx emissions from cycle to cycle. The NOx level was below the Tier 2 emission limits for 50,000 and 120,000 miles. NMHC emissions were found at a level outside the limit for 120,000 miles.

Many telescopic and spacecraft-based observations of atmospheric water vapour on Venus have been made, but are inconclusive about its role as a component of the current climate system on the planet. The data suggest that H 2 O may be well mixed in the lower atmosphere, but highly variable in and near the cloud layers, and probably also at the thermospheric levels where dissociation and loss occur. The details of the middle atmosphere variability, how significant it is, and the processes responsible, remain controversial. In particular, the Pioneer Venus Infrared Radiometer found a large 'wet patch', a localized region where the water vapour mixing ratio is generally enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude over the global mean, occurring at low latitudes in the mid-afternoon, that has not been confirmed by other observations. If it is real, the presently unknown mechanism that produces it may be an important part of the water cycle in the Venusian atmosphere.

A similar reduction of mercury emissions was reported by Florida DEP for south Florida where the Everglades Park is located: Point sources of emissions decreased from a high of 3.4 short tons (3,100 kg) of mercury in 1991 to 0.22 tons (204 kg) in 2000. The Florida DEP study of the Everglades also showed that the mercury concentrations in largemouth bass and in great egret nestlings decreased by a factor of six between 1991 and 2000. On the other hand, our analysis of 330 sets of weekly mercury deposition data, obtained by the Everglades station of the national Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) showed that the annual average deposition in the Everglades did not change significantly from December 1995 to January 2004. Two other interesting findings were that 73% of the total mercury deposition during those eight years occurred in the high precipitation season, between May and October; and that 40% of the weekly samples taken during this eight-year period represented only 3.8 % of the recorded total deposition of mercury. This paper examines the reasons why the substantial decrease of local and regional point sources of mercury emission has not affected substantially the local deposition rates. A likely answer is that climatic conditions in Florida, associated mainly with the warmer months and higher rates of precipitation and evaporation, have a large effect on a) re-emission of previously deposited mercury and b) coprecipitation of global mercury from the atmosphere. This may also explain why Florida, where the present annual rate of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants (in kilograms per square kilometer) is one fifth that of Pennsylvania, has mercury deposition rates that are twice those reported by MDN for Pennsylvania.

A framework for analyzing the impact of highway incidents on the local air quality was proposed. Various proven deterministic as well as statistical models were used to model the capacity reduction due to an incident and to estimate vehicle speed immediately after an incident. The impact of highway incident on the local air quality depended on the traffic demand during the time of incident and the degree of capacity reduction due to the incident. Incidents during the peak hour had much more adverse effect on air quality compared to that of incidents during off-peak hours. Incidents causing larger capacity reduction had more adverse effect on air quality compared to that of incidents causing lesser capacity reduction. Emissions increased significantly at speeds lower than 30 mph. CO and NOx emissions were minimum at speeds around 30 mph. However, VOC emission decreased with increasing speed. An incident during peak hour would result in significant increase in CO and VOC emissions. The severity of congestion due to an incident depended on the ratio of the traffic demand to the available capacity. Severity of congestion determined the emission factor and corresponding emissions.

Plasma waves responsible for such interactions are substantially enhanced during storms, causing rapid pitch-angle scattering (and ultimate loss to the atmosphere) and energy transfer from low to high energies (leading to a hardening of the high-energy tail population). Several wave modes, including electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves and whistler-mode waves, contribute to pitchangle scattering loss on timescales comparable to a day. Local electron acceleration to relativistic energies is prevalent during the storm recovery, due to interactions with intense whistler-mode chorus emissions outside the plasmapause. Codes have recently been developed to evaluate rates of diffusion in pitch-angle and energy. However, these diffusion rates have yet to be integrated into multi-dimensional diffusion codes, to quantify the role of each wave mode in radiation belt variability during storms. A major obstacle to developing accurate models for radiation belt dynamics is the limited observational data on the power spectral density of each important wave. © 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68749108695

Unfortunately, once released into the atmosphere, mercury is subjected to a variety of complex physical-chemical processes before its deposition. Thus performing detailed mercury-cycle simulations on the large spatial scale required implies the use of parallel computing.

The STW consists of a facultative pond. Since this pond functions under close to anaerobic conditions, unpleasant odors are emitted. In this respect, two possible ways to deodorize the pond were evaluated. Firstly, the recirculation of effluent using 1/6 of the flow stream followed by aeration of the pond with a reduced power aerator. In order to study the efficiencies of the deodorization methodologies chemical analyses of the gases NH3 and H2S, olfactometric analyses and evaluation of the environmental perception of the population in relation to the odors originating from the STW, were carried out for each experimental situation. The results showed a significant reduction in odors when aeration with reduced power equipment was utilized in combination with recirculation of effluent in the pond. Reductions in emissions of H2S from 0.1345 mg/m3 to 0.0083 mg/m3 and of NH3 from 0.021 mg/m3 to 0.0073 mg/m3 were obtained.

Their benefits and uses range from intangible psychological and aesthetic benefits to amelioration of urban climate and mitigation of air pollution. Historically the main benefits of urban trees and forests relate to health, aesthetic and recreational benefits in industrialized cities. Moreover, green areas have provided people with subsistence by providing food, fodder, fuel, wood and timber for construction (see Chap. 2). Today, woodland, woods and trees are important to people especially through symbolizing personal, local, community and cultural meanings. They provide aesthetic enjoyment and create a pleasant environment for different outdoor activities. Woodland can provide an experience of nature in the middle of urban life. In particular, old woodland with big trees may provide urban people with the opportunity to recover from daily stress, revive memories and regain confidence. There is also an important educational value of urban forests. Contact with trees, in particular for children, can help people learn about nature and natural processes in an otherwise artificial environment. Urban trees and woodland also contribute to an attractive green townscape and thus communicate the image of a positive, nature-oriented city. Indirectly, urban trees and forests can promote tourism and enhance economic development. At the local level trees contribute to the quality of housing and working environments and their benefits are reflected in property values. The same urban woodland areas and trees may have multiple benefits that reinforce each other. Recreational woodland, for example, also reduces wind speed and traffic noise as well as improves the landscape in a nearby residential area. To a certain extent the distinction between different categories of benefits is artificial.

Schemes 6,15,17, and 19). The thermal reaction between dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (ADM) and 1 leads, kinetically controlled, via a sterically less-congested transition state (Fig. 4) to the formation of the (M*)-configured 1,4-dihydro-1,4-epoxybenzo[a]heptalenes, which undergo a cyclic double-bond shift to the energetically more-relaxed benzo[d]heptalenes 4 (Schemes 6 and 7). Most of the latter ones exhibit under thermal conditions epimerization at the axis of chirality, so that the (M*)- and (P*)-stereoisomers are found in reaction mixtures. The (P*)-configured forms of 4 are favored in thermal equilibration experiments, in agreement with AMI calculations (Table 1). The relative (P*,1S*,4R*)- and (M*,1S*,4R*)-configuration of the crystalline main stereoisomers of the benzo[d]heptalene-2,3- dicarboxylates 4a and 4f, respectively, was unequivocally established by an X-ray crystal-structure determination (Figs. 1 and 2). Acid-induced rearrangement of 4 led to the formation of the corresponding 4-hydroxybenzo[a]heptalene-2,3-dicarboxylates 5 in moderate-to-good yields (Schemes 8, 13, and 14). When the aromatization reaction is performed in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), trifluoroacetates of type 6 and 13 (Schemes 8, 12, and 13) are also formed via deprotonation of the intermediate tropylium ions of type 7 (Scheme 11). Thermal reaction of 1 with dimethyl maleate gave the 2,3-exo- and 2,3-endo-configured dicarboxylates 14 as mixtures of their (P*)- and (M*)-epimers (Scheme 15). Treatment of these forms with lithium di(isopropyl)amide (LDA) at -70° gave the expected benzo[a]heptalene-2,3-dicarboxylates 15 in good yields (Scheme 16). Fumaronitrile reacted thermally also with 1 to the corresponding 2-exo,3-endo- and 2-endo,3-exo-configured adducts 17, again as mixtures of their (P*)- and (M*)-epimers (Scheme 17), which smoothly rearranged on heating in dimethoxyethane (DME) in the presence of Cs2CO3 to the benzo[a]heptalene-2,3-dicarbonitriles 18 (Scheme 18). Some cursory experiments demonstrated that hex-3-yne-2,5-dione and (E)/(Z)-hexa-3-ene-2,5-dione undergo also the Diels-Alder-type cycloaddition reaction with 1 (Scheme 19). The mixtures of the stereoisomers of the 2,3-diacetyl-1,4-epoxytetrahydrobenzo[d] heptalenes 22 gave, on treatment with Cs2CO3 in DME at 80°, only mixtures of the regioisomeric inner aldol products 24 and 25 of the intermediately formed benzo[a]heptalenes 23 (Scheme 20). © 2005 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG.",,"Addition reactions; Carboxylation; Dehydrogenation; Isomers; Magnesia; Methanol; Oxidation; Reduction; Cycloadditions; Dicarboxylates; Dienophiles; Vicinal dimethanols; Aromatic hydrocarbons; benzo[a]heptalene; benzo[a]heptalene 2,3 dicarbonitrile; dicarboxylic acid derivative; furan derivative; heptaleno[1,2 c]furan; unclassified drug; article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical reaction; chemical structure; crystal structure; cycloaddition; Diels Alder reaction; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrogenation; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; stereoisomerism; ultraviolet spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144492533

And, carried out concrete measures were introduced in order to aim at the low reducing agent rate operation. The following results were obtained. 1) Since it has reached the already high reaction efficiency in present state blast furnace, it is not easy to attempt further reduction of the reducing agent rate. 2) The blast furnace use of high reactivity coke or reduced iron is equal level or over it in comparison with the reduction effect by the assumed blast operation in this paper. 3) The promotion of coke reaction load with the gasification is worried, when it aims at the low reducing agent rate operation by the high reactivity coke use. 4) It is estimated that the threshold also exists for the reducibility of competing ore, when it aims at the low reducing agent rate operation using the high reactivity coke. 5) The use of the low SiO2 sinter is effective for the improvement on the permeability in the blast furnace, when it aims at the low fuel rate operation.

As a result of these policies and measures, global industrial energy demand in the Alternative Policy Scenario is almost 9% lower, or close to 300 million tons of oil equivalent (300 Mtoe, or about 12 quadrillion Btus) less than in the WEO Reference Scenario in the year 2030. Reduced electricity consumption contributes the most to the total efficiency savings, 30% or 90 Mtoe, followed by oil with 76 Mtoe savings (26%), coal with 65 Mtoe (22%) and natural gas at 47 Mtoe (16%) savings. More than half of the global savings are in Developing Countries while OECD countries account for only a third and transition economies the rest. With typical efficiency investments averaging a payback period of 3-5 years, efficiency gains average 7% in OECD countries, 10% in developing regions and 11% in transition economies. Global CO 2 emissions from the global manufacturing sectors are down 10% in 2030 as a result of the policies assessed in the Alternative Policy Scenario.

To make engines satisfactorily meet such regulations in the short term, innovations in engine development technology are essential. In this paper, an innovative technique for the optimization of the transient performance of engines, 'STATE', was developed. Recently, the Design of Experiments (DoE) has gradually been used to optimize the static performance of engines, however it takes a long time to create a response surface model including all operating conditions of an engine. The newly developed technique 'STATE' shown in this paper was able to create the response surface model in a very short time by means of multivariate analysis of the transient performance data of time series. A new transient engine test cycle, named 'universal mode', was developed for the efficient creation of response surface models. The experimental data of the 'universal mode' was analyzed by the newly developed technique 'STATE', and a response surface model was created. The model could be used for the prediction of NOx, smoke and so on under each regulation test cycle, for example, JE05*1, FTP*2 and ETC*3. Moreover it could be also used for the optimization of the engine control system, hence the engine performance and emissions are improved. It was found that the NOx and smoke predicted by this model showed good agreement with the measured data. The better control value for the engine control system was derived by optimal value analysis using the response surface model. The newly developed technique 'STATE' improved the efficiency of the development of the response surface model by more than 90% in terms of time, in comparison with that of the DoE technique. An example of the optimization of the transient engine performance under the JE05 engine cycle, Japanese regulation mode, by means of the newly developed technique is demonstrated.

In order to possibly diminish the health impacts of exposure to airborne particulates, the Dutch Ministry of the Environment is going to subsidize particulate traps on new diesel cars between 1 January 2005 and the time the Euro-5 emissions standards come into force. The Ministry asked the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency to assess the possible short-term health risk reduction of this subsidy programme for 2010. The total number of premature deaths due to short-term exposure to PM10 in the Netherlands is approximately 2800. However, there is still much uncertainty about what part of the total PM10 causes this observed acute mortality. For this reason the health risk reduction of the particulate trap subsidy programme was estimated using three different assumptions on which part of PM10 is actually causing acute premature mortality. From the assessment we can presume the subsidy programme to result in around 40 fewer premature deaths (∼1% of 2800) in 2010 due to short-term exposure to PM 10 in the case only primary anthropogenic PM10 causes the observed acute health impact. In the hypothetical case that only the carbonaceous part of primary anthropogenic primary PM10 or Black Smoke cause the observed health impact, the health benefit is estimated at around 5% of 2800. One should bear in mind that the share of all diesel cars in total PM10 emissions in the Netherlands in 2010 is only 6% and the share of diesel cars in the average PM10 concentration is even smaller, around 1%. Despite the uncertainty about what fraction of PM10 causes the observed short-term health impacts, subsidizing particulate traps could still be justified from a precautionary perspective and besides, long-term exposure to diesel PM is harmful to humans. © 2005 WIT Press.","Diesel particulate trap; Health impact assessment; PM10; Traffic","Airborne particulate; Diesel particulate; Environmental assessment; Health impact assessment; Long term exposure; PM10; Premature mortality; Short-term exposure; Airborne particulate; Diesel particulate; Emission standard; Environmental assessment; Health impact assessment; Long term exposure; Premature mortality; Short-term exposure; Health; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Telecommunication traffic; Urban transportation; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890515430

They link climate, human activities and ecologic processes through groundwater and surface water interactions. For simulating these linkages an integrated regional hydrologic model has been coupled to an ecologic evaluation model. The simulated ecologic effects of climate change on mesotrophic riverine grasslands are clearly positive. Simulation results also indicate a high sensitivity of the peak discharges to the precipitation. For modelling the long-term development of land use and water management an integrated 'bio-economic' model has been constructed. It includes a model for the development of agriculture. Results for the autonomous development in reaction to climate change indicate a strong increase of field drainage by agriculture. This development would substantially reduce the predicted positive effects of climate change on riverine grasslands. The challenge is to guide regional developments in such a manner that opportunities for improving nature are not lost, but that at the same time the peak discharges are kept under control. Flow retardation in the 'fine arteries' of the upstream areas appear to be a viable option for the latter. The bio-economic model can provide help in anticipating on climate change through spatial planning. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Bio-economic model; Climate change; Desiccation; Peak discharges; Spatial planning","Agriculture; Computer simulation; Ecology; Hydrology; Land use; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Surface waters; Flow retardation; Riverine grasslands; Spatial planning; Surface water interactions; Climate change; ground water; soil water; surface water; climate change; hydrological response; peak discharge; spatial planning; water management; adaptation; adaptive environmental management; agriculture; article; climate change; controlled study; ecology; economic evaluation; environmental planning; evaporation; finite element analysis; grassland; hydrodynamics; irrigation (agriculture); land use; mathematical model; Netherlands; precipitation; prediction; river basin; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; simulation; vegetation dynamics; water flow; water management; water supply; Agriculture; Climates; Ecology; Grass Lands; Hydrology; Land Use; Mathematical Models; Surface Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19044400079

Current strategies for reducing PM2.5 mass concentrations target reducing SO2 to reduce sulfate, but in such a case more ammonium nitrate may form when nitric acid is present. Large-scale chemical transport models suffer from uncertainties associated with emission inventories. To examine how the inorganic PM2.5 concentration responds to changes in emissions, we introduce an observation-based box model, the thermodynamic model with removal (TMR), to estimate responses of PM 2.5 to precursor concentrations. TMR assumes that particles are in equilibrium with the gas phase, but the removal rate of total (PM2.5 + gas) nitric acid from the system depends on the gas/aerosol partitioning of this species. The model is used to investigate sulfate, total ammonia, and total nitric acid control strategies for western Pennsylvania during the winter using measurements obtained in the Pittsburgh Air Quality Study. Predictions from TMR are compared with observations and predictions of a chemical equilibrium model (GFEMN), where the perturbation of sulfate or total ammonia does not affect the total nitric acid availability. Results show that TMR predicts more aerosol nitrate to form than GFEMN in scenarios where the total ammonia to sulfate ratio is increased, but model results are similar under ammonia-limited conditions. When sulfate is reduced by 50% during the winter, GFEMN predicts that inorganic PM2.5 mass concentrations will be reduced by 23%, while TMR predicts that there will only be an 8% reduction. For a 50% reduction in ammonia availability, inorganic PM2.5 was reduced by 29%, while for a 50% reduction in total nitric acid a 17% reduction in inorganic PM2.5 was predicted. The analysis suggests the importance of the phase state of the aerosol for the effectiveness of the emission control strategies.

These studies reveal new fundamental physical and chemical aspects of matter. Clusters are called the fifth state of matter: liquid, solid, cluster, gas and plasma. In this work, a carbon cluster was generated by a spark cluster source and detected by single focusing mass spectrometer in situ. We examined the effects of cluster source parameters on the generation of carbon cluster and report our initial results. This method should be useful for studying the mechanism of fullerene formation. In the case when carbon clusters generated in plasma arc are carried by the Ar or H 2 gas flow downstream through a vacuum chamber to the ion source of mass spectrometer, we obtained a small binary carbon cluster C 28H4 (hydrogenated fullerene). The empty fullerene is tetravalent and strongly binds four hydrogen atoms, which significantly weakens two different sets of bonds and leads to an open-shell electronic structure. Conclusion is that endohedral C28H4 are hypervalent. We have demonstrated how in situ mass spectrometry has led to the rapid development of an important branch of synthetic fullerene chemistry that has yielded many new small fullerenes and related derivatives with novel structures and properties.

Land-use values in savanna landscapes are changing as a result of changing economic markets, greater recognition of native title, and growing social demands and expectations for tourism, recreation and conservation. In addition, there is increasing interest in developing markets and policy arrangements for greenhouse gas abatement, carbon sequestration and carbon trade in savannas. We argue that for carbon management to lead to national greenhouse outcomes, attention must be paid to social, economic and institutional issues in environmental planning and policy arrangements. From an economic perspective, the financial impact of carbon management on savanna enterprises will depend on appropriate and available policy mechanisms, unit price for carbon, landscape condition, existing management strategies and abatement measurements used. Local social and cultural features of communities and regions may enhance or constrain the implementation of carbon abatement strategies, depending on how they are perceived. In terms of institutional arrangements, policies and plans must support and enable carbon management. We identify three areas that require priority investigation and adjustment: regional planning arrangements, property rights, and rules for accounting at enterprise and regional scales. We conclude that the best potential for managing for carbon will be achieved while managing for range of other natural resource management outcomes, especially where managing for carbon delivers collateral benefits to enterprises. © CSIRO 2005.",,"carbon; land use; resource management; savanna",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28644444773

Higher car ownership, more and longer trips and less public transport are the direct outcomes of traditional transport planning.

The recent transport plans in metropolitan cities in Australia have been developed within the integrated transport and land use framework and are a crucial part of the strategic plans for improving the quality of life and liveability in the cities. Key sets of goals aimed at enhancing sustainability include (a) increased share of public transport modes, cycling and walking and (b) improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To ensure the achievement of these objectives, massive investments and expansion of public transport systems are being pursued. In this paper, it is aimed to examine the action plans for achieving the key objective of sustainability. The discussion focuses on targets, plans and measures for achieving the desired outcomes as well as the alignment of transport plans with related environmental management strategies for the cities.

In 1986, the Federal government established the Vehicle Air Pollution Control Program (PROCONVE), which created tighter emissions standards for all new vehicles and mandated improved fuel quality. As a result, considerable progress has been made with regard to certain pollution problems, particularly with carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2). Two pollutants continue to threaten public health in São Paulo: particulate matter (PM) and ozone. For particles, standards are set and a monitoring program is in place for PM10 (particles of 10 μm or smaller, also known as inhalable PM). PM10 concentrations in São Paulo continue to exceed air quality standards on a regular basis. Because fine PM or PM2.5 (a subset of PM10 which includes particles of less than 2.5 μm) are able to lodge more deeply in the lungs, these particles are more dangerous to human health. Standards have not yet been set for these particles in Brazil and high readings of fine particles PM 2.5 have recently been recorded in São Paulo. Levels of ozone also remain very high and consistent (over 200 μg/m3 at the peak hour). Solving the ozone problem will require very significant reductions in volatile organic compounds and NOx. This report will explore the current air pollution problem in the São Paulo, lay out strategies to reduce mobile source emissions in order to meet air quality standards, and explore the technology options needed to reduce emissions. Clean air in São Paulo requires control of direct particulate matter emissions and precursors for ozone and secondary PM. We argue that, in order to meet air quality standards in São Paulo, diesel vehicles need to be much cleaner and that reducing the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel, which will enable clean new vehicle standards, is one of the critical first steps, followed closely by wide scale retrofit programs for in-use vehicles. Our analysis shows that clean air goals will require a nationwide shift to diesel fuel with sulfur content below 15 ppm, allowing Brazil to take advantage of the best pollution control technologies available today. High sulfur in fuel makes it virtually impossible to use the advanced technologies (filters and traps) to control particulate matter (PM) and ozone precursors - the pollutants that most threaten the health of Brazilians. When ultralow sulfur fuels are used in combination with advanced control technologies, the emissions reductions from diesel vehicles are dramatic. For example, catalyzed filters can reduce particle emissions from diesel vehicles by up to 95%. This technology could reduce levels of these life-threatening pollutants in São Paulo and save thousands of lives throughout the country each year. With low sulfur fuel, filters can also be placed on many existing vehicles and can reduce emissions by 80-95%, making it one of the most cost effective ways to clean up the air in the near term.

In raising this question, this volume has targeted three shortcomings of mainstream research into the effects of globalization. These shortcomings were identified as follows: first, that the definitions of both globalization and its assumed consequences are often either rather vague or limited to economics only; second, that in most cases the nation-state remains the basic unit of analysis despite the claim of fundamental change- something we call methodological nationalism-and third, that the actual process of policy-formulation, in other words, the very basis of what politics is about, has in our view largely been ignored. The design of our study was specifically oriented toward avoiding these pitfalls. In respect of the first mentioned shortfall, we have built on the notion of societal denationalization rather than globalization as a working definition. This notion is based on the fact that areas of dense social transaction are no longer confined by national borders. In our view, societal denationalization exists to the extent that the traditional dominance of intranational over transnational transactions is challenged. The affected transactions are not confined to economics only. Thus, based on this definition and on empirical considerations, we singled out communication (viz, the Internet), migration and climate change as areas particularly worthy of investigation. Though each of these areas demonstrate marked levels of transnational interaction, amongst them there is still a degree of variance in their extent of denationalization. In addition, (in respect of the second above mentioned shortcoming) we deliberately moved below the level of the nation-state. We looked at nationally constituted political groups closely tied to politics within the nation-state as we know it. At the same time, we selected these groups from countries at the core of the OECD world. While looking at issue areas evidencing a high level of denationalization, therefore, we otherwise followed a double-hard case design. That is to say, our focus was on groups with a national focus in countries widely regarded as examples of the successful modern state. Our reasoning behind this was that if political processes concerning these issue areas remains indistinct from politics as usual, there is very little reason to expect that the politics of denationalization brings anything new. We thus intentionally did not include new transnational entities1 or countries well removed from the notion of the model modern state in our inquiry.2 The logic behind this design was to ensure sufficient sensitivity to change but without being oversensitive or reacting too easily to marginal variation. The core of our investigation therefore lies in the reactions of nationally constituted political groups faced with governance challenges in areas showing a high degree of denationalization. Our focus is on the political process, that is, the negotiation between an array of different policy possibilities, rather than on political outcomes (our response to the third shortcoming identified above). In this way, we circumvent the structural shortcuts of macrocorrelative attempts to link globalization directly to policies. We are not concerned with the immediate policy outcomes of denationalization, but rather with the political processes which it triggers. The fundamental question is: is there such a thing as a politics of denationalization? And if so, what does it look like? Chapters 3 to 5 have already established there are various aspects of politics in the respective fields that constitute interesting results in their own right. On the one hand, some responses of nationally constituted interest groups' responses were outside the realm of politics as usual. In the Internet cases, the groups from the New Left join the issue-specific groups on the Right in demanding only very soft and weak forms of intervention, thus making up for strange bedfellows following a strategy of deregulation. The Climate cases support the notion that policy debates on international fora directly lead to politics beyond the nation-state. Many groups were active on the international level and almost all groups asked for some form of international policies. National policy-making fora thus proved to be subordinated to international policy-cycles. And in the labor migration case, unions-seen by many as most heavily bound to the national constellation-could be portrayed as the most internationalized actor. All that points to politics of denationalization as something specific, quite different from politics as usual. On the other hand, however, in both migration cases, it is traditional domestic interests that drive the responses to denationalized issues. The problems of cryptography produced similar patterns. Those who do not like the status quo, merely employ international arguments to get rid of disliked national regulations. And while business sometimes accepts the need for international regulation as in the climate issue, they always try to get the cheapest deal. In these respects, our cases pretty much look like politics as usual. The purpose of this concluding chapter is to integrate these findings by systematically comparing the cases with the aim of generating some generalized statements about the politics of denationalization. In order to do so, we compare group reactions with a somewhat stylized picture of politics as usual in advanced capitalist democracies. While it will become apparent there are interesting general trends, there is also considerable variation in the findings. In order to account for these results, we analyse these differences along the dimensions of case, group type, and country. This chapter proceeds as follows: first, drawing on consensual elements of research in comparative politics, we present our conceptualization of what we call politics as usual, outlining the main characteristics of politics in advanced capitalist societies in the twentieth century. We then systematically compare this model with the results from our case studies, making use of a standardized coding procedure. Having established that there are indeed significant differences between our results and politics as usual, we then attempt to summarize and condense our results in such a way as to represent what could be called a model of the politics of denationalization. We then delve deeper into the politics of denationalization and evaluate some hypotheses about its outcomes; in particular, we look at the role of new political divisions, the significance of state intervention, and the relevance of new steering mechanisms. As mentioned in the introduction, this study followed an abductionist logic. Although it has an hypotheses-generating thrust, the observations are structured by theoretical expectations. On the one hand, we use the politics as usual blueprint in order to highlight the changes that are taking place in descriptive terms. On the other hand, the generation of hypotheses explaining the variation in societal responses to denationalization challenges is guided by a preselected number of independent variables, which were presented and discussed in the introduction and especially in chapter 2. Accordingly, group responses can vary along three dimensions: cases, countries, and groups. For each of these three dimensions, we identify one or two independent variables. The five ensuing independent variables form a pool on which we draw in order to interpret the data. In the concluding section we summarize the findings. We hope to have demonstrated by then that the politics of denationalization looks quite different from politics as usual. It is characterized by a remarkable role for transnational policy-demands and even activities of nationally constituted interest groups beyond the nation-state. Obviously, external constraints play an important role and often set national and international policy cycles into motion. These external constraints do however not structurally predetermine the response patterns, moreover, the external constraints can be changed by coordinated political responses. In addition, there is a still latent triangular cleavage structure that may become typical of the politics of denationalization. Moreover, we show that the Old Right with its preference for deregulation is put into a privileged position in the politics of denationalization. On the other side, the Left has to overcome both the deregulatory default option and disadvantages in organizing itself transnationally. Yet the Right cannot permanently escape its counterforces by moving to the level beyond the nation-state. In fact, the New Left in many respects turns out to be the spearhead of political denationalization. This suggests that political regulation beyond the nation-state can be as market-correcting and as traditional in the employed steering mechanisms as we know it from the national constellation. With the final reflections, we return to the larger picture of the postnational constellation as sketched in the introduction and ask for further avenues of research. © 2005 State University of New York.

BIPV has influence on microclimate in urban environments and the performance of BIPV is also affected by urban climate. The effect of BIPV on urban microclimate can be summarized under the following four aspects. The change of absorptivity and emissivity from original building surface to PV will change urban radiation balance. After installation of PV, building cooling load will be reduced because of PV shading effect, so urban anthropogenic heat also decreases to some extent. Because PV can reduce carbon dioxide emissions which is one of the reasons for urban heat island, BIPV is useful to mitigate this phenomena. The anthropogenic heat will alter after using BIPV, because partial replacement of fossil fuel means to change sensible heat from fossil fuel to solar energy. Different urban microclimate may have various effects on BIPV performance that can be analyzed from two perspectives. Firstly, BIPV performance may decline with the increase of air temperature in densely built areas because many factors in urban areas cause higher temperature than that of the surrounding countryside. Secondly, the change of solar irradiance at the ground level under urban air pollution will lead to the variation of BIPV performance because total solar irradiance usually is reduced and each solar cell has a different spectral response characteristic. The thermal model and performance model of ventilated BIPV according to actual meteorologic data in Tianjin(China) are combined to predict PV temperature and power output in the city of Tianjin. Then, using dynamic building energy model, cooling load is calculated after BIPV installation. The calculation made based in Tianjin shows that it is necessary to pay attention to and further analyze interaction between them to decrease urban pollution, improve BIPV Performance and reduce colling load.

Such an evaluation program progresses sequentially from lower initial cost for basic data acquisition to higher cost production testing that normally focuses on the construction of a reservoir simulation-based field development model. However, Applications of this approach minimize any consequence of reservoir heterogeneities, which ultimately dominate later large-scale project performance. Due to these heterogeneities, potentially commercial coalbed methane production areas may be bypassed or prematurely condemned. To reduce the likelihood of missing or overlooking otherwise attractive CBM plays, an alternative evaluation model was developed to focus specifically on reservoir heterogeneity. This alternative evaluation program utilizes production distributions derived from proven productive basin area reservoir/operational analogs. The resulting production variability is then weighed against prospective new play areas in order to define more effective exploration program requirements. This results in a more realistic approach to the exploration process and increases the probability of large-scale technical and financial success.

However, a body of recent work provides a new basis for supporting allelopathic mechanisms for some striking phenomena - the noteworthy examples include the obvious, devastating success of some invasive species (described above), as well as the equally impressive resistance to invasion by a natural community seen in the Florida scrub. Furthermore, the success of scrub vegetation in deterring invasion raises questions about the hypothesis that allelopathy will be most likely to occur as a mechanism that enables exotic invasions. The argument that allelopathy is likely to be of limited significance in natural communities is based on the assertion that over time, plants will likely have evolved tolerance to chemical defenses of their neighbors [19, 40]. However, the evolution of tolerance to chemical defenses should be no more significant among neighboring plants in terrestrial plant communities than it is for herbivores or pathogens of these plants. There are many examples of evolution of tolerance to toxins by specialist herbivores and pathogens, but for unadapted organisms in natural communities these defenses usually remain effective. Bioassays with Centaurea diffusa imply an important role for allelopathy in natural community structure, a point which has been overlooked [33]. While activated carbon increased the growth of North American grasses at the expense of C. diffusa (supporting the hypothesis of allelopathic effects by C. diffusa in this exotic environment), the growth of Eurasian grasses from its native habitat was reduced by activated carbon, and C. diffusa biomass increased. These results are consistent with allelopathic inhibition of C. diffusa by grasses in its native habitat, and contrary to the hypothesis that allelopathic interactions will be most important for exotic species invading new habitats. Considered together with work on the Florida scrub and on non-exotic invaders such as crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum), these results require the admission that while allelopathy may be of importance to the success of certain exotic invaders, it may be an important factor, along with competition, herbivory, and abiotic factors, in structuring natural plant communities. © 2005 Birkhäuser Verlag.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547486197

In this protocol, no additional testing is done for those passing the OAE screening, but infants failing the OAE are also screened with automated auditory brainstem response (A-ABR). This study evaluated how many infants who failed the OAE and passed the A-ABR had permanent hearing loss (PHL) at 8-12 months of age. Method: A total of 86,634 infants were screened at 7 birthing centers using a 2-stage OAE/A-ABR hearing screening protocol. Of infants who failed the OAE but passed the A-ABR, 1,524 were enrolled in the study. Diagnostic audiologic evaluations were performed on 64% of the enrolled infants (1,432 ears from 973 infants) when they were 8-12 months old. Results: Twenty-one infants (30 ears) who passed the newborn A-ABR hearing screening were identified with PHL when they were 8-12 months old. Most (71%) had mild hearing loss. Conclusions: If all infants were screened for hearing loss using a typical 2-stage OAE/A-ABR protocol, approximately 23% of those with PHL at 8-12 months of age would have passed the A-ABR. © American Speech-Language- Hearing Association.","Automated auditory brainstem response; Congenital hearing loss; False-negatives; Newborn hearing screening; Otoacoustic emissions","auditory screening; controlled study; demography; diagnostic accuracy; evoked brain stem auditory response; female; hearing loss; human; infant; major clinical study; male; methodology; newborn screening; otoacoustic emission; review; Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hearing Loss; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Neonatal Screening; Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746659271

Regional upwarps are recorded as plate-wide unconformities with variable amounts and distributions of erosion. Subsequent thermal-tectonic subsidence created accommodation space, allowing onlap onto unconformities and preservation of eustatically-driven sequences. The Jurassic and Triassic section consists of 14 second-order sequence sets, each with 2 to 6 third-order sequences typified by transgressive-to-highstand shoaling-upward systems tracts (Figure 1). Third-order sequence boundaries show little erosion or onlap. The Lower and Middle Triassic are characterized plate-wide by carbonates (Figure 2). The Upper Triassic is shallow-marine and non-marine (Minjur) clastics on the southern Arabian Plate (SAP) and more continuous carbonate-evaporite deposits on the northern Arabian Plate (NAP). An unconformity below the Minjur cuts into the carbonates across the NAP and the Qatar arch. Another unconformity erodes the Minjur, and together these two unconformities cut through the Triassic on the southern margin of the SAP. These unconformities are related to uplift when India started to rift away from Arabia. Liassic deposition started in the NAP and progressively lapped onto Triassic rocks from the north, covering the Qatar Arch last during the Toarcian (Figure 3). The Gotnia Basin, a starved basin with thin deep-water sediments, formed in the NAP in the Middle Jurassic. The Gotnia Basin was rimmed by oolitic carbonates, as was a zone which extended to the SW along the present-day Arabian Gulf. These shoals formed a barrier SW of which were platform-interior carbonates, in some cases organic-rich. The paleogeography changed in the Kimmeridgian, when evaporites filled the Gotnia Basin and intercalated carbonates and evaporites of the Arab and Hith Formations covered the SAP. An unconformity occurred in the Tithonian, with deep erosion regionally in southeastern Arabia and on isolated salt structures across the SAP.

Some species will persist only if they can colonize new areas, although in some cases their dispersal abilities may be very limited. To address this problem we devised a quantitative method for identifying multiple corridors of connectivity through shifting habitat suitabilities that seeks to minimize dispersal demands first and then the area of land required. We applied the method to Proteaceae mapped on a 1-minute grid for the western part of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, to supplement the existing protected areas, using Worldmap software. Our goal was to represent each species in at least 35 grid cells (approximately 100 km2) at all times between 2000 and 2050 despite climate change. Although it was possible to achieve the goal at reasonable cost, caution will be needed in applying our method to reserves or other conservation investments until there is further information to support or refine the climate-change models and the species' habitat-suitability and dispersal models. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.","Area-selection algorithms; Bioclimatic modeling; Biodiversity conservation; Connectivity; Habitat suitability; Species persistence","bioclimatology; biodiversity; Cape Floristic Region; climate change; connectivity; conservation planning; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; Proteaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444255784

The reduction of scavenge losses is one of the key requirements for the development of two-stroke engines. Besides it is important to maintain the excellent torque and power behavior of the two stroke units. This publication gives a summary of previous and present development results of test bench and chassis dynamometer measurements and of 3D CFD simulations. All these results are targeted on a reduction of the scavenge losses and therewith HC-emissions. Therefore the focus is put on different injection strategies, such as semi-direct and air-assisted injection. Additionally, the potential of the high pressure gasoline direct injection is presented, even if this technology is still too expensive for the small capacity engine market, e.g. the European 50 cc scooter class. As a promising alternative to the aforementioned strategies new ideas to reduce the scavenge losses are introduced. These concepts have to be realized by using cost-efficient standard injection components from state of the art intake manifold injection systems. The goal of this type of injection is to achieve Euro3 emission standards with up to 30% lower system costs compared to state of the art air-assisted injection systems. These new ideas can be described in terms of stratified scavenging. Due to the accurate positioning of the injectors, a stratified mixture preparation or homogeneous mixture preparation can be obtained, before entering the combustion camber. For different load and engine speed variations, the benefits of the different mixture preparations will be pointed out. A potential estimation of this scavenge strategy will be shown by results of 3D-CFD simulations, comparing homogeneous (air and fuel) scavenging, air-assisted injection, high pressure direct injection, and stratified scavenging.

The initial phase of N2O production, lasting 2-21 days, was followed by a gradual decrease indicating reducing of N2O. The total amount of N2O reached 13-44% of the initial nitrate-N (NO3-N) content and was highest in the silty soils and lowest in the sandy soils. It was negatively correlated with the &gt;0.05 mm fraction and positively with the 0.05-0.002 mm fraction. Average daily N2O production was negatively correlated with the &gt;0.05 mm fraction and positively with finer fractions ie with the 0.05-0.002 mm and with the &lt;0.002 mm fraction. The rate of N2O disappearance averaged 0.56, 4.08 and 11.7 mg N2O-N kg-1 day-1 in sandy, loamy and silty soils, respectively.

The changes of the pressure involve changes of the laser gas density, and changes of the refractive index, as a consequence. It leads to a frequency tuning of the laser optical resonator. In the case of the CO2 laser a rotational line hopping phenomenon is observed as a result.

However, traffic-related emissions like particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide are still a problem in urban areas. Reduced vehicle emission due to the implementation of vehicle emission catalysts is compensated by increasing traffic. The growing evidence for an association between air pollution exposure and impaired human health has led to an increasing need for action to control and to reduce air pollution. To support air pollution control management strategies the spatial variations of air pollution in urban areas are of considerable interest. In addition, weather conditions have a strong impact on the temporal variation of pollution levels. Thus anti-cyclonic weather conditions characterised by stable air layers may lead to an accumulation of local emissions in the ambient air. In contrast, lower pollution levels may be caused by increased air movement during cyclonic weather conditions. Because of the lack of data regarding both the small-spatial variability and the influence of weather conditions, especially for the Berlin area, the present study examines patterns and sources of coarse and fine particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Berlin and the impact of weather conditions.

Architectural surface coating showed relatively little change while graphic arts and traffic markings showed increase in emissions. Industrial surface coating showed a decrease in emission with the updated VOC emissions from the use of solvent studies. The MOBILE 6.2C model output resulted in higher emissions for five built-in VOC toxic species (e.g., 1,3-butadiene) when compared to previous MOBILE5C/MOBTOX combination as applied to the 2001 and previous year emission inventories. Emissions of other VOC species showed similar pattern. The use of NONROAD model provided a better estimation of the non-road engines/equipment; the model considered various emission regulations imposed to these engines/equipment.

However, a transition in camshaft timing which often accompanies engine speed / load changes, can have a significant dynamic impact on volumetric efficiency. The change in volumetric efficiency can be highly unpredictable, and can last for several engine cycles following the endpoint of cam movement. Since precise control of catalyst feedgas equivalence ratio is crucial to meeting increasingly stringent automotive emission requirements, the steady state benefits of cam phasing can be overshadowed by the loss of A/F control during transient operation if the engine control algorithms are not properly designed and calibrated. This paper investigates the impact of exhaust variable cam phaser transients on equivalence ratio control, and the mechanism by which volumetric efficiency is affected.

The virus can survive and replicate in humans and other vertebrae hosts, and is transmitted by a variety of mosquito vectors (Russell and Dwyer 2000). The disease in humans is nonfatal and infections can be either asymptomatic or symptomatic, with symptoms including polyarthritis, rash, fever, myalgia, and lethargy (Harley et al. 2001). There has been much recent research into the spatial and temporal nature of Ross River virus in Queensland (Gatton et al. 2004; Kelly-Hope et al. 2004; Tong and Hu 2002). A recent paper by Gatton et al. (2004) focussed on the spatial and temporal nature of outbreak periods, where outbreak periods are defined by comparison against long term incidence rates specific to that area. The spatial and temporal nature of outbreak periods is of public health importance as increased understanding will lead to more targeted public health interventions (Tong 2004). In this paper, we use a Bayesian mixture model to analyse weekly cases of Ross River virus in Queensland from 1984 to 2001. RRv notification data was obtained from the Communicable Diseases Section of Queensland Health. An exploratory analysis revealed an association between climate variables and cases of RRv, so we aggregated the data to fifteen homogenous climate zones representing Queensland. We explore a mixture model to separate the RRv data over time into a number of states or components, and use model choice criteria to choose which number of components is preferable. This is an extension of previous work on RRv which has focussed on two components or states, an outbreak state and non-outbreak state. The method also allows the data to indicate the component (state) in which it belongs, and thereby avoid possibly subjective decision rules. Extensions to more than two components is expected to offer flexibility in cases where, for example, hyperoutbreak periods can be identified. The choice between competing models of a different number of components invariably involves a selection criteria that will take into account both measures of fit and complexity. In this paper we use methodology developed in Celeux et al. (2003) and choose between competing models based on Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) estimates. The parameters for the different models were estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using the software package WinBUGS (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002). We focussed the analysis on two different climate zones which appeared to display different temporal behaviour, and found much variability in the results, with a lower number of components preferred for data from the zone which appeared to show a more distinctive pattern.","Bayesian; Disease modelling; Ross River virus; Spatial; Temporal","Australia; Bayesian; Bayesian mixture model; Climate variables; Communicable disease; Competing models; Decision rules; Exploratory analysis; Incidence rate; Information criterion; Markov chain monte carlo; Mixture model; Mosquito vectors; Number of components; Number of state; Public health; Queensland; Selection criteria; Spatial; Temporal; Temporal behaviour; Two-component; Use-model; Vector-borne disease; Bayesian mixture model; Communicable disease; Deviance information criterions (DIC); Exploratory analysis; Health interventions; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Number of components; Vector-borne disease; Decision making; Health; Markov processes; Rivers; Tools; Markov chains; Mixtures; Public health; Rivers; Tools; Viruses; Viruses; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053117313

Prior to the 1990s, Government assistance to drought-affected farmers and pastoralists was based on the assumption that drought was an unpredictable natural disaster. A paradigm shift towards the present policy of self reliance occurred in the early 1990s. Under this policy, farmers were expected to be able to manage through most droughts, with Government assistance only available in the event of droughts of unusual length or severity - so-called exceptional circumstances. Details of the policy, and its application in, and following, drought situations, are briefly outlined. Illustrated by the experience of 2002-03, one of Australia's worst-ever droughts, we show that the development of drought policy in Australia is an ongoing process, in which attempts to apply aspects of the policy in practice generally reveal deficiencies, leading to subsequent modification of the policy. Areview of National Drought Policy conducted by the Australian Government after the 2002-03 drought generated a number of recommendations. Among these were: the nearly universal endorsement by stakeholders that proactive drought preparedness measures should be encouraged by Governments; and that improvements were needed to the reliability of seasonal predictions, with calls for better-coordinated research into climate variability, and better presentation of prediction information. The Chapter also describes changes in water management policy in Australia, which also underwent a fundamental change during the early 1990s. Case studies are provided of certain aspects of the policy, including the application of water entitlements in rural areas, and water restrictions in urban areas. The Chapter discusses some likely future developments, including discussion of the possible implications for drought policy posed by future climate change. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892255076

Alternative energy source should be provided without producing more CO2, such as solar energy. One of the best routes to remedy CO 2 is to transform it to hydrocarbons using photo reduction. In our study, CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol using a Hg lamp with wavelength 365 nm in a steady-state optical-fiber photo reactor. The optical-fiber photo reactor, comprised of near 120 Cu/TiO2-coated fibers, was designed and assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly inside reactor. TiO2 film was coated on optical fiber using dip-coating method. Titania and Cu-loaded solutions were prepared by a thermal hydrolysis method. The thickness of Cu/TiO2 film was 53 nm and consisted of very fine spherical particle with diameter of near 14 nm. The XRD spectra indicated the anatase phase of all TiO2 and Cu/TiO 2 films. The wavelength of absorption edge was on 367 nm, equivalent to near 3.3 eV. Most active Cu species on TiO2 surface were Cu 2O clusters, and played an important role for the formation of methanol. The methanol yield increased with UV irradiative intensity. Photo activity increased with increasing Cu loadings. Maximum methanol rate was 0.45 μmole/g-cat•hr using 1.2 wt%-Cu/TiO2 catalyst under 16 W/cm2 irradiation, 1.3 bar pressure of CO2, and 5000 seconds mean residence time. Higher than 1.2 wt% Cu loading gave less rate of methanol yield because of the masking effect of Cu2O clusters on the surface of TiO2.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25444524653

Today a number of precursors of ultra compact HII regions (PUCHs) have been found. Embedded in dense gas and dust, these PUCHs have a high bolometric luminosity but little or no 6 cm radio continuum emission (Molinari, et al. 2000; Beuther, et al. 2002). Evidence for Collapse was found in ultra compact (UC) HII regions and 12 water maser sources (Zhang, et al. 1998; Wu & Evans II 2003). This paper presents the identification of massive cores with no detectable infrared and radio sources. These kinds of cores usually have strong sub-mm emission. A special case is the SCUBA core JCMT 18354-0649S which has both infall and outflow motions as indicated by the profiles of high excitation molecular lines. This core is at a stage earlier than PUCHs. Blue profiles are also found in UC HII region, which indicates that material is still infalling in this phase. Our observations suggest that infall exists in different evolutionary stages for high mass star formation, similar to the low mass cases. © 2005 International Astronomical Union.","Ism: cloud; Ism: kinematics and dynamics; stars: formation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63549093467

Aim of this campaign was to characterize the solar radiation conditions in an Antarctic environment. These are different from other areas of the Earth due to extremely high reflection of the ground (albedo). Relatively low cloud optical depths and ozone depletion further contribute to rather different radiation conditions compared to mid-latitudes. The investigation of these conditions will improve the understanding of the impact of climate change and ozone depletion in polar regions. Spectral irradiance and radiance as well as luminance and spectral albedo have been measured in a wavelength range from 280 to 1050 nm. With this set of radiation parameters it is assured that directional information of incident radiation parameters as well as the impact of surface albedo can be investigated. Monitoring of radiation parameters is carried out by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany. Spectral irradiance from 290 to 400 nm has been measured since January 2001. UVB monitoring started in 1997. Broadband radiation parameters have been detected since 1981. Furthermore, the station participates in international networks initiated by the Word Climate Research Programme such as the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW). It is also a complementary site of the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC).","Antarctica; BSRN; NDSC; Spectral UV; Spectroradiometric measurements; Stratospheric change; UV effects","Climatology; Clouds; Earth (planet); Ozone; Radiometry; Spectrometers; Upper atmosphere; Antarctica; BSRN; NDSC; Spectral UV; Spectroradiometric measurements; Stratospheric change; UV effects; Solar radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29344442605

Until now this kind of hazelnut has only grown in the wild. Compared with the European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) the nut weight of Corylus heterophylla Fisch. is smaller (about 1.0 g less), and the yield is poor (about 300 kg/ha), but it has very good winter hardiness. A breeding program of interspecific hybridization between Corylus heterophylla Fisch. and Corylus avellana L. was initiated in 1979 at the Economic Forestry Research Institute of Liaoning Province (EFRI). The aim of this program included good climatic adaptability, high and constant productivity, bigger nut size, good kernel quality, high winter hardiness. During the period 1980-1986 more than 2,300 hybrid seedlings were obtained, while nearly 40 fine selections were selected during the period 1988-1996. From 1991 to 1999 hazelnut variety and advanced selection trials were carried out in different climatic zones in Liaoning province and other province, with the same aims as the aforementioned program. 5 new varieties were released in 1999, these being: 'Pingdinghuang' (80-43), height of 8-year old tree = 1.89 m, diameter = 1.78 m, nut weight = 2.4 g, percent kernel = 41%, yield per tree = 1,597 g; 'Bokehong' (82-4), measurements for the same parameters were 2.66 m, 2.28 m, 2.1 g, 46%, and 1,749 g respectively; 'Dawei' (84-254), measurements for the same parameters were 2.30 m, 1.58 m, 2.5 g, 41%, and 1,283 g respectively; 'Jinling' (84-263), measurements for the same parameters were 2.13 m, 1.67 m, 2.2 g, 40% and 1,098 g; 'Yuzhui' (84-310), 2.51 m, 1.66 m, 2.0 g, 43%, and 1,005 g respectively. The new varieties showed a good growth rate and a high yield in the temperate zone (between 32 and 42°N, average annual temperature 7.5-14°C) in China.2001 and 2003 the back-crosses were carried out in both Italy (Università di Torino) and China.

The amount of the localized beam loss on the one collimator is estimated about 1.2kW, and that loss generates a large quantity of the secondary radiations. So the beam collimator must be designed that it is covered with enough shielding. We calculated the radiation dose of the collimator and decided necessary shielding thickness. This result indicated that the residual dose rate at the outside surface of the shielding was mostly under 1mSv/h. We developed the remote cramp system and rad-hard components in order to reduce the radiation exposure during maintenance of the collimator. And also we coated The Titanium Nitride (TiN) film on the inside surface of the vacuum chamber in order to reduce the secondary electron emission from the collimator and the chamber surface.

Differential Density Circulated Fluidized Bed (DDCFB) incinerator was first developed by Zhejiang University to overcome such difficulties. The research of organic pollutants, especially dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission and control from MSW incinerators has been carried out in ITPE since 1998. The aim of this paper is to provide the scheme of a new co-firing CFB incineration technology, and useful data for environmental evaluation of trace organic pollutants emission from incinerators. The art of co-firing CFB is presented briefly in the first part of this paper. The dioxin content in original Chinese MSW is estimated to be 10 pg I-TEQ/g based on the data from Abad et al. Several test runs are conducted in a real-scale (150ton/day) incinerator co-firing MSW and coal to investigate dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission to ambient air. Test results show that dioxins input into the incinerator is estimated around 300-600 mg I-TEQ/y, dioxins output is estimated 3-100 mg I-TEQ/y, and dioxins emitted to ambient air is around 0.1-15mg I-TEQ/y. It seemed that most of dioxins in original waste are decomposed by incineration process. For seventeen priority PAHs, its emission to ambient air is around 200-4160g/y for co-firing runs, which is much more than 80g/y for coal combustion only. This suggests that PAHs emission to ambient air needed to be more concerned than dioxins. That is to say, PAHs emission regulatory should be proposed as soon as possible to restrict all incinerators. Several new incinerators (200 tons/day per unit and 300 tons/day per unit) were built by using new Co-firing CFB technology in past few years. From the environmental evaluation report, dioxins emission in stack gas is in range of 0.0025-0.06 ng I-TEQ/Nm3, which seemed far below the European limit. The annual dioxin emission to air for 200ton/day or 300 t/d units is around 3-6 mg I-TEQ. It shows that co-firing CFB incinerator is capable of reducing dioxin emission effectively. Based on industrial demonstration experience of new co-firing CFB incineration technology, it has been proven environmental friendly method for thermal treatment of MSW in developing countries. Some reasons for low dioxin emission of co-firing processes are discussed in this paper.

A modified anaerobic digestion process with partial ozonation of digested sludge to improve biological degradability and the conventional anaerobic digestion process were compared with respect to the energy demand in each process schemes. Options for beneficial use of biogas included (1) application of biogas for power production and (2) recovery as an alternative to natural gas utilization. The analysis indicated that the partial ozonation process with power production led to minimal greenhouse gas emission because the extra energy production from this scheme was expected to cover all of the energy demand for the plant operation. Moreover, the final amount of dewatered sludge cake was only 40% of that expected from the conventional process, this significantly minimizes the potential for greenhouse gas emission in the subsequent sludge incineration processes. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Anaerobic digestion; Greenhouse gas emission; Incineration; Kyoto protocol; LCA; Ozonation","Air pollution control; Biodegradation; Biogas; Combustion; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouses; Life cycle; Ozonization; Sludge digestion; Waste utilization; Biogas utilization; Energy demand; Greenhouse gas emission; Kyoto protocol; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Municipal sludge treatment; Anaerobic digestion; biogas; natural gas; anaerobic process; biofuel; greenhouse gas; municipal waste; Ozonation; Waste management; anaerobic digestion; article; biodegradability; controlled study; energy yield; experimental design; greenhouse gas; incineration; municipal solid waste; ozonation; pilot study; power supply; process optimization; recycling; sludge dewatering; sludge digestion; sludge treatment; waste minimization; waste water management; water analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25144484750

This model is used to predict the particle trapping in the porous wall and the growth of the soot layer in the inlet channels. With the accumulation of the particulates, the pressure drop across the filter and the reduction of the particulate matter are also predicted. Soot regeneration is ignored in this study and will be pursued with a three-dimensional model to complete the whole DPF process. A symmetric model of the filter is used to represent the flow condition of the filter. It consists of the inlet channels, the porous wall, and the outlet channels. The porous wall and the inlet channels are modeled as a porous media with a given initial porosity for the porous wall and 1 for the inlet channels for a clean filter. The soot loading is represented by the local porosity in the porous wall and in the inlet channels. For a clean filter, the particle trapping first occurs in the porous wall. The thickness of the soot layer is not fixed. The growth of the soot layer is resolved by the computational grid in the model. The soot will first accumulate in the first layer of the grid, and it will propagate into the next grid layer when the porosity of the first layer becomes lower than a certain value, and so on. Three particle trapping mechanisms, diffusion, inertia, and direct interception, are employed to compute the capture coefficient in the computational domain. The distribution of the porosity in the porous wall and in the inlet channels (soot layer) is computed from the local capture coefficient and the local flow condition (e.g., gas velocity, local porosity, and the particle concentration). The Darcy coefficient is therefore computed from the porosity and is used to compute the pressure drop. Because of the filtration the concentration of the particulate matter reduces along the flow path line. This is simulated with a bi-species mixture flow, in which one species represent the soot particles.",,"Computational domains; Computational grids; Diesel particulate filters; Local flow conditions; Particle concentrations; Particulate Matter; Three-dimensional CFD model; Three-dimensional model; Computational fluid dynamics; Dust; Inlet flow; Porosity; Pressure drop; Soot; Three dimensional; Porous materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886066916

The leakage coefficients for estimation are derived based on storage curve calculated by each characteristic. These are location and depth of injection. The methodology can provide the first order estimate of leakage of classified ocean storage of CO2 that would be a basis for developing accounting methodology. In particular, this is intended to contribute to accounting rules for CO2 capture storage proposed by the research project discussed in the chapter. Moreover, project planners and policy makers would utilize the methodology to examine the feasibility of some CO2 ocean storage projects. Difficulty of defining the leakage in ocean storage is due to the reservoir's open structure against atmosphere and continuous interaction between ocean and atmosphere. Under the current inventory system, ""emission"" is supposed to be counted. When this concept of emission is applied to the leakage in ocean storage straightforwardly, emission or leakage, which means that injected CO2 into ocean reservoir is released to the atmosphere, would not be observed because the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than that of ocean constantly when viewed as a whole ocean and not local area, so that ocean consistently keeps absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A few carbonyls, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone, are ubiquitous in both indoor and outdoor air as well as in organic solvents. In previous practices, solid sorbents were coated with the derivatization agent by applying solutions followed by drying, which inevitably introduces carbonyl impurity in the solvent to the sampling sorbent. We here describe a vapor coating technique that eliminates the use of solvents during the coating step; thereby greatly reduce background carbonyl contaminants. This newly developed method has been applied to measure ambient carbonyls in an urban location in Guangzhou, China. A total of 22 carbonyls were positively identified and quantified. An additional 14 carbonyls were tentatively identified on the basis of their mass spectra and relative retention times to known carbonyl compounds. Ranking of the measured carbonyls with respect to removal of the hydroxyl radical showed formaldehyde to be the most important followed by nonanal and glyoxal.

As society grows more mature, effectiveness of city planning itself seems to be increasingly unsuccessful. Correspondingly, some criticize EIS city planning approaches, because they draw upon physical city planning. Especially in the recent business climate, EIS planning seems not doing well. In this paper, we try to understand the reasons why both physical and EIS city planning seem to some to be unsuccessful. It is not attributable to the nature of city planning, but rather to the requirements for city or EIS planning, which have changed as the maturity of the society or the firms' information systems. We then introduce post-modern city planning. This concept was born of the paradigm change between industrial and post-industrial society. From here, we discuss how postmodern concepts can be realized in the field of EIS. Finally, to illustrate applicability of these new concepts we examine the case of KDDI's rust-free system.","Architecture; City planning approach; Enterprise information system; Maturity model","Business climate; Enterprise information system; Maturity model; Architecture; Electrochemical corrosion; Industry; Planning; Urban planning; Information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053517162

Among them, the development of low-temperature diesel combustion systems has received considerable attention. Low NOx emissions are achieved through minimization of peak temperatures occurring during the combustion process. Concurrently, soot formation is inhibited due to a combination of low combustion temperatures and extensive fuel-air pre-mixing. In this study, the effect of late-cycle mixing enhancement by post injection strategies on combustion and engine-out emissions in the low-temperature combustion regime was investigated experimentally and numerically. The baseline operating condition considered for low-temperature combustion was 1500 rev/min, 3bar IMEP with 50% EGR rate, and extension to high loads was considered by means of post injection. Post injection strategies gave very favorable emission results in the low temperature combustion regime at all loads. With small second fuel injected amounts, better soot emissions were found. However, the determination of the dwell between the injections was found to be very important for the emissions. Since post injection leads to late-cycle mixing improvement, further reductions in soot emissions were achieved without deteriorating the NOx emissions. To explain these results, numerical analysis was also done using the KIVA-CHEMKIN code. The simulations show that optimal combustion requires that the post injection fuel avoid fuel rich regions formed from the main injection.

Thus the adjustment of structure results in the rice has become the most important grain instead of wheat, and the planting structure has been changed from wheat and corn dominate to the corn and rice dominate in the past 20 years, especially in 1990s. All these changes had related to the increasing of accumulative temperature in response to the global warming. © 2005 IEEE.","Global warming; Grain crops Planting Structure; Heilongjiang Province; K-Means Cluster","Agriculture; Global warming; Land use; Remote sensing; Statistical methods; Grain crops Planting Structure; Heilongjiang Province; K-Means Cluster; Crops; Agriculture; Farm Crops",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745712812

In order to address these pollutants, a series of cobalt-based oxidation catalysts supported on zirconia and titania were synthesized and found to be effective for oxidation of NO and CO. NO oxidation has been examined as part of a two-stage lean NOx reduction system. NO2 is a more easily reduced species than NO, and additionally has been proposed as a reaction intermediate in the selective catalytic reduction of NO. It was thus proposed to develop a highly active NO oxidation catalyst. The synthesized cobalt-based catalysts were found to be active at low temperatures and showed high hydrothermal stability. Equilibrium conversions of NO to NO2 were reached at temperatures below 300°C. Additionally, tests of the oxidation catalyst as part of a mixed-bed that also contained a NO2 reduction catalyst have shown very promising results as a hydrocarbon-based NOx reduction system. The Co-based catalysts were additionally shown to be highly active for CO oxidation at relatively low temperatures. Complete oxidation of CO was observed at 135°C, and was steady over more than 180 hours on-stream. Steady-state kinetic experiments were conducted to determine catalyst activity, and were done under both model and simulated lean exhaust conditions. Additionally, deactivation and regeneration steps were examined. Synthesis parameters including composition, synthesis technique, metal doping, and calcination temperature were explored.

Shape and color of ash were observed visually. The results of the present study have revealed that all the average values of gases in the six incinerators were within the limits stated in Egyptian environmental law, where as carbonaceous particulate (smoke) averages of the six incinerators have exceeded the maximum allowable limit in the law. On the other hand, lead concentration in emissions were far below the maximum allowable limit in the law. Incinerator No 6 emissions have been significantly higher in CO, NO2, SO2 and smoke concentration than the other five incinerators P<0.001, P<0.0006, P<0.0001, and P<0.002 respectively. There was no significant variation in bacterial count of ash samples at 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C between the six studied incinerators. Volatile substance percentage of ash samples in the six incinerators were much higher than the recommended percentage. There was a highly significant variation between the six incinerators (p<0.005). Lead and cadmium concentrations in ash samples were much higher than those in developed countries, meanwhile, more or less as those in developing countries.

In Russia, there is an abundant supply of geological formations, which theoretically could be used for CO2 sequestration. Over 40 % of the world's discovered natural gas resources, near 12 % of the oil resources and about 16 % of proved coal resources are located in the territory of the Russian Federation. Because depleted oil and natural gas fields and unminable coal beds are considered as possible sites for CO2 storage, there is potentially a vast storage capacity in geological reservoirs for anthropogenic CO2 sequestration. The majority of national deposits of fuel resources are concentrated in West Siberia where bleak climate, rough terrain, and huge distance for transportation hinder exploitation of natural resources. These will also pose formidable obstacles for deployment of CCS technologies. The bulk of the CO2 emissions are from fuel combustion with more than 30 % originating in the power industry. The chapter discusses some characteristic features of Russian fuel and energy complex, distribution of energy resources and generating capacities from the point of view of possible utilization of CCS technologies. Effective and successful implementation of CCS technologies will be possible only with taking into account economical, geographical, and regional details of the considered region. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the project is to support the policy makers in the elaboration and assessment of air pollution policies at international, national and local level, by means of the more recent understandings of atmospheric processes. The MINNI Project consists of two main components (Figure 1). A multi pollutant eulerian Atmospheric Modeling System (AMS) simulating air pollution dynamics and multiphase chemical transformations, providing hourly concentrations and annual depositions of SO2, NOx, NH3, PM10 , PM2.5 and O3, with a spatial resolution ranging between 400 and 4 km 2. AMS provides RAINS Italy with the Atmospheric Transfer Matrices (ATM) or ""area to grid"" transfer matrices. The RAINS-Italy Integrated Assessment Model, developed within a joint research project ENEAIIASA, inheriting all the features of the RAINSEurope model, but comprising the atmospheric transport and chemical transformations, as calculated by AMS, in the ATM. Rains-Italy provides emission scenarios for the mentioned pollutants (plus VOC), as well as estimations of costs associated with the implementation of the abatement technologies and impact assessment. The two components complement each other, offering a powerful tool which allows to provide the policy makers with detailed analyses, where requested, tailored on the specific national or local needs. AMS may feed RAINS-Italy with fine resolution ATMs and/or different meteorological year based ATMs. RAINS-Italy may feed AMS with a projected emission vector, regarding future scenarios, to develop expected detailed deposition/concentration maps.

The first product of the project is a prototype for application in arid climate: a closed system for solar thermal energy capture, water recycling, water desalination and advanced horticultural use. It consists of a closed greenhouse connected with a vertical solar air collector which functions as a solar chimney. An air-water heat exchanger contained in a cooling duct inside the tower provides climate regulation of the greenhouse, powered by the buoyancy induced by the solar tower. The efficiency of the heat exchange processes is enhanced by the utilization of latent heat due to constant humidification/de-humidification of air in the process. The condensation associated with the cooling of the nearly saturated air also provides distillation of water. The thermal energy released in the process is stored outside the greenhouse for being used as heating or further water distillation during the night. Plants are an essential part of the whole process, being a means of grey water processing and a source of humidification of the air, and together with water and heat, biomass production is the main output of the system. A detailed explanation of the system and its components is presented, describing the heat accumulators, the heat exchanger in the cooling duct, and the secondary collector which further heats and humidifies the air from the greenhouse on its way to the cooling tower.

Lag cross-correlations of monthly mean aerosol optical depth, precipitation, vegetation, and wind speed are examined from 1979-1993. The response to monthly climate anomalies can differ greatly from the response to seasonal mean climate. The signs, magnitudes, and lags of highly significant (p < 0.01) correlations show that 14 important mineral dust source areas characterized by Prospero et al. (2002) fall into four response categories. Each category represents distinct mechanisms by which climate anomalies influence subsequent atmospheric dust loading on seasonal to interannual timescales. In most regions, precipitation and vegetation together strongly constrain dust anomalies on multiple timescales. In these regions, dry anomalies increase, and wet anomalies reduce, dust emission. Interestingly, in many other regions the contrary is true: Dust and precipitation anomalies correlate positively, consistent with sediment-supply factors. The response timescales are consistent with loss of surface crusts (less than 1 month) and with alluvial transport and dessication (interannual lags). Supply-limited dust emission appears more prevalent than previously thought and is not accounted for in models. Reproducing these wind erodibility responses in models may help remediate underprediction of observed seasonal to interannual dust variability.

CO2 migrating upwards is a process generally controlled by formation pressure gradient and CO2 gravity, affected by the changes of CO2 properties such as density, viscosity, enthalpy and phase state along the paths, and companied with heat transfer between escaping CO2 and the leakage paths and heat conduction in formation. Considering absorbing or releasing latent heat in phase changes, this paper developed models for CO2 flow and heat transfer during the leakage process. Then a procedure was developed to couple these models. Our studies have shown that CO2 leakage tends to approach a steady state within several years, thus it is reasonable to deal with this problem using the steady state model generated in this study for the CO2 migrating upwards in a thousand-year long process. Sensitivity analyses of the factors affecting CO2 leakage rate, the pressure and temperature profiles along the paths were studied. These factors are the permeability and cross-section area of the leakage path, the pressure and temperature in the storage reservoir, and the surface temperature. In terms of the temperature profile, CO2 cooling effect caused by forming the super heated gas is dominant. It is also discovered that, during the CO2 migrating upwards process, CO2 cooling effect along the paths is essentially described by the saturation line in the CO2 P-T phase diagram. A vertical fracture pattern with a radius of 1m and a permeability of 100mD was assumed in case studies. Within reasonable ranges of formation pressure and temperature gradients the altered temperature profile for the interval of 300m ~ 700m, where CO2 phase is close to the saturation line in P-T phase diagram, provided a clue to detect CO2 leakage. A simple linear relationship between the CO2 leakage rate and the maximum temperature difference between the original and the altered temperature profiles was obtained through regression analysis, so that the CO2 leakage rate could be estimated with the temperature profile logged along the wellbore in the field practice. © 2005 SPE All rights reserved.",,"Boreholes; Gasoline; Heat conduction; Oil field equipment; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Phase diagrams; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature control; Flow and heat transfer; Geological sequestration; Maximum temperature differences; Pressure and temperature; Pressure and temperature profiles; Simple linear relationship; Steady-state modeling; Surface temperatures; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085852089

We collected 21 gas samples from the different gas pay beds of the Sebei 1 gas field and the Sebei 2 gas field, measured their chemical compositions and carbon isotopes, and emphatically discuss their methanogenic pathway and significance. The CH4 and CO2 of the biogenic gases were enriched in 13C with increasing depth, which indicates that the gases are CO2 reduction-derived gases. The δ 13C1, δ13CCO2, and δD values of the biogenic gases approximate the range of the corresponding values of CO2 reduction gases. The values fall in the CO2 reduction field on genetic diagrams based on δ13C1, δ13CCO2 and δD values of natural gases. The fractionation coefficients (αc) of the carbon isotope of the CH4 and CO2 of the biogenic gases are more than 1.005, characteristic of a CO2 reduction pathway. During the Quaternary due to the dry climate, low temperature, high sedimentation rate and a high content of sulfate in the east of the Qaidam basin, methane bacteria could not propagate until sediments were buried at deeper depth. These conditions benefit a CO2 reduction pathway of the gases. These results are of importance in discussing the biogenic gas origin and formation conditions, determining the methods and conditions for biogenic gas simulation, accessing biogenic gas reserves, establishing a pool-forming model and selecting targets for natural gas exploration.

Thus it is a topic of great practical importance, as well as scientific interest. In this study, four types of source solutions (distilled H2O, 10 mg/L TCE, 300 mg/L CaCO3, and 10 mg/L TCE + 300 mg/L CaCO3) were supplied to four columns containing a commercial granular iron material. In all four columns, gases accumulated to ∼ 10% of the initial porosity and resulted in declines in permeability of ∼ 50% to 80%. In the columns receiving CaCO3, carbonate precipitates accumulated to ∼ 7% of the initial porosity, with no apparent decline in permeability. The data indicate that precipitates formed initially at the influent ends of the columns, reducing the reactivity of the iron in this region. As a consequence of the reduced reactivity, calcium and bicarbonate migrated further into the column, to precipitate in a region where the reactivity remained high.

Mixed waste of paper mill sludge and process residue from a paper company and bituminous coal were used in the experiments. The temperature distribution in the combustor was measured. The bottom ash and fly ash were sampled and analyzed. Six gas components were analyzed with a gas analyzer. The effects of some parameters, such as waste variety, fluidization velocity, secondary air rate, excess air, on the combustion characteristics and the emission of SO2 and NOX were clarified. The experimental results indicate that the incinerator temperature decreases with increase in secondary air rate and waste/coal mass ratio for the waste/coal mass ratios tested. When the excess air ratio increases, the dense bed temperature increases, but the temperature in the dilute phase region first increases, and then it decreases with further increase in the excess air ratio. The combustion efficiency increases with increase in the secondary air rate and decrease in the waste/coal mass ratio. With increase in the excess air ratio, the combustion efficiency first increases, then it reaches a peak and finally decreases. For the waste/coal mass ratio of 1.0, the highest combustion efficiency corresponds to the excess air ratio of 1.25. Higher desulfurization efficiency can be obtained with higher excess air, proper incinerator temperature and lower secondary air rate. The NO emission increases with increase in excess air ratio and decrease in the secondary air rate. Higher temperature, stronger staged air injection and lower excess air ratio are beneficial to suppressing N 2O emission from incineration. The emission can be reduced by decreasing excess air ratio, increasing incinerator temperature and secondary air rate.

The results showed that Σ10 PAHs was 13-36 μg/m3, among which, BaP, a strong carcinogenic kind ranged from 0.034 μg/m3 to 0.12 μg/m3. PAHs pollutions in four seasons were winter &gt; autumn &gt; spring-summer. The annual averages of ΣPAHs concentration were 25 μg/m3 for 1999, 28 μg/m3 for 2000, and 29 μg/m3 for 2001, respectively. Leaded gasoline was banned in December 1998 in Hangzhou, thus comparative measurements with PAHs in leaded and lead-free gasoline powered motor exhausts made it certain that the use of lead-free gasoline leaded to a heavier PAHs pollution in roadside air from December, 1998, in China, and ΣPAHs in air samples after the lead-banning were more than twice of that in samples before the action. For the large contribution of vehicle discharge to air pollution in roadside, further research was performed to suggest the factors influencing PAHs distribution in vehicle exhaust in order to control air pollution effectively. Compared to gasoline engines, emissions from diesel engines were less toxic, although they might produce more PAHs. Of the same vehicular and oil type, automobiles of longer mileages produced more toxic PAHs. PAHs distributions in the vehicular exhausts were related to the oil type. Large difference was found in the abundance of 3-, 5- and 6-ring PAHs between exhausts from gasoline and diesel oil engines. Diesel oil engines produced relative lighter PAHs such as NAPH, ACEN, FLUOR, while gasoline engines emitted heavier kinds such as BkF, IN and BP. The automobile produced more PAHs with the increase of mileage especially FLUR, PY, BaP, BP. Some significant ratios for traffic source in Hangzhou such as PHEN/AN, FLUR/PY, IN/BP were 0.50-4.3, 0.58-7.4, 0.51-1.5, respectively. A source fingerprint for vehicle exhausts of a mixture of vehicle and oil types in the city district for light-duty vehicle was the abundance of BaA, followed by NAPH, BP, IN. 4-ring PAHs such as FLUR, PY, BaA and CHRY were the most predominant kinds followed by 6-ring PAHs (BP, IN). © 2005 Science Press.

C-Lock, developed by Dr. Zimmerman and his colleagues at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, aggregates carbon emission reduction offsets from individual land parcels and prepares certified units for sale in the marketplace. The C-Lock process allows agricultural producers to quantify the impact of specific land-use management practices for specific agricultural land parcels on the sequestration of carbon in soil and vegetation. It also aggregates carbon emission reduction offsets for individual land parcels into units that can be efficiently marketed. This comprehensive tool has been designed to serve as an interface to link agricultural producers, carbon sequestration science and policy, and those who wish to purchase carbon emission reduction offsets. The C-Lock process incorporates three levels of data validation. Level I validation compares producer input data with lookup data for regional land use. Level II verification consists of a random audit to compare satellite data for a land parcel with reported data. Level III verification consists of submitting all data to a third party to operate the model and confirm the results. The C-Lock system must account for the variability in carbon accounting that results from a wide range of sources. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

On such a market, the traditional national energy policies are loosing their meaning and will be replaced by global (European) policies. The reduction of greenhouse emissions according to the Kyoto protocol is one of the main issues for future energy policies, hopefully without to reduce the economical welfare and to be done at the highest possible cost-benefit. Solar energy can play an important role for achieving an appreciable net reduction of CO2. However, it is important to coordinate the implementation of solar energy with the conditions for other energy systems, especially district heating and cogeneration, in order to make best use of available resources. We will also see that one effective way to decrease CO2 is the replacement of coal condensing power plants whenever possible. Energy from solar thermal heating can contribute well to this goal, when it is use at the right place.

Lincoln St., Tucson, AZ 85714, United States","There have been some questions in the astronomical community concerning the quality of silver coatings deposited on substrates that have been cleaned with carbon dioxide snow. These questions center around the possible existence of carbonate ions left behind on the substrate by CO 2. 1 Such carbonate ions could react with deposited silver to produce insoluble silver carbonate, thereby reducing film adhesion and reflectivity. Carbonate ions could be produced from CO 2 via the following mechanism. First, during CO 2 snow cleaning, a small amount of moisture can condense on a surface. This is especially true if the jet of CO 2 is allowed to dwell on one spot. CO 2 gas can dissolve in this moisture, producing carbonic acid, which can undergo two acid dissociations to form carbonate ions. In reality, it is highly unlikely that charged carbonate ions will remain stable on a substrate for very long. As condensed water evaporates, Le Chatelier's principle will shift the equilibrium of the chain of reactions that produced carbonate back to CO 2 gas. Furthermore, the hydration of CO 2 (reaction of CO 2 with H 2O) is an extremely slow process, and the total dehydrogenation of carbonic acid is not favored. Living tissues that must carry out the equilibration of carbonic acid and CO 2 use the enzyme carbonic anhydrase to speed up the reaction by a factor of one million. But no such enzymatic action is present on a clean mirror substrate. In short, the worst case analysis presented below shows that the ratio of silver atoms to carbonate radicals must be at least 500 million to one. The results of chemical tests presented here support this view. Furthermore, film lift-off tests, also presented in this report, show that silver film adhesion to fused silica substrates is actually enhanced by CO 2 snow cleaning.","Adhesion; Co 2 snow cleaning; Silver films","CO2 snow cleaning; Silver films; Adhesion; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Deposition; Moisture; Silica; Silver; Cleaning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144447670

The duration of such emersion leads to different exposures of the plants to light and aerial CO2, which then affect the physiology of them to different extents. The ecophysiological responses to light and CO2 were investigated during emersion in two red algae Gloiopeltis furcata and Gigartina intermedia, and two brown algae Petalonia fascia and Sargassum hemiphyllum, growing along the Shantou coast of China. The light-saturated net photosynthesis in G. furcata and P. fascia showed an increase followed by slightly desiccation, whereas that in G. intermedia and S. hemiphyllum exhibited a continuous decrease with water loss. In addition, the upper-zonated G. furcata and P. fascia, exhibited higher photosynthetic tolerance to desiccation and required higher light level to saturate their photosynthesis than the lower-zonated G. intermedia and S. hemiphyllum. Desiccation had less effect on dark respiration in these four algae compared with photosynthesis. The light-saturated net photosynthesis increased with increased CO2 concentrations, being saturated at CO2 concentrations higher than the present atmospheric level in G. furcata, G. intermedia and S. hemiphyllum during emersion. It was evident that the relative enhancement of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 in those three algae increased, though the absolute values of photosynthetic enhancement owing to CO2 increase were reduced when the desiccation statuses became more severe. However, in the case of desiccated P. fascia (water loss being greater than 20%), light saturated net photosynthesis was saturated with current ambient atmospheric CO2 level. It is proposed that increasing atmospheric CO2 will enhance the daily photosynthetic production in intertidal macroalgae by varied extents that were related to the species and zonation.","CO2; Ecophysiology; Marine macroalgae; Photosynthesis; Zonation","ecophysiology; intertidal community; macroalga; photosynthesis; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; World; algae; Gigartina intermedia; Gleiopeltis furcata; Petalonia fascia; Phaeophyceae; Rhodophyta; Sargassum; Sargassum hemiphyllum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23044477063

Yaxcopoil-1 impactites were initially permeated with calcite and halite at ambient temperature. This was followed by thermal metamorphism (diopside after igneous augite) and widespread Na-K metasomatism (feldspar after igneous plagioclase), which were overprinted by abundant lower-temperature clay and calcite. Silicate fraction isotopic values have δ 18O SMOW values between 10 and 23% indicating important isotopic exchange between impact melt (∼8%) and Cretaceous limestone (∼26%). Heavier δ 18 O values occur over depth intervals with intense feldspar alteration (813-833 m and 864-872 m). The δD SMOW values (-34 to -54%) are chiefl y infl uenced by smectite abundance and roughly mirror δ 18 O values. Carbonate fraction δ 18 O SMOW values (22-30%) are controlled by calcite contents, and several exceed the limestone signature. Most δ0.13C PDB (-1 to +2%) values also cluster around that of local limestone, but a number are signifi cantly lighter (down to -7%). Isotopic and fluid inclusion results indicate hydrothermal fluid temperatures between 270 and 100 °C, high salinities (∼20%), and minor kerogen contents. These data are compatible with mineralogical constraints, which further support an increase in oxidation state with decreasing temperature. Isotopic data point to a saline CO 2 -bearing fluid mixed with small amounts of reduced carbon, and decarbonation and infi ltration processes. Combined results are most consistent with a basinal oilfi eld saline brine that was driven by impact-induced heat. © 2005 Geological Society of America.","Chicxulub impact crater; Fluid sources; Hydrothermal paragenesis; Mineral compositions; Saline oil-field brine; Stable isotopes; Yaxcopoil-1 impactite sequence","Binary alloys; Boreholes; Calcite; Carbon; Feldspar; Groundwater; Isotopes; Lime; Limestone; Mineralogy; Oil fields; Potassium alloys; Silicates; Sodium alloys; Sodium chloride; Structural geology; Temperature; Chicxulub impact; Fluid sources; Hydrothermal paragenesis; Mineral composition; Oil field brines; Stable isotopes; Yaxcopoil-1 impactite sequence; Meteor impacts; borehole; calcite; carbonate; Cretaceous; feldspar; fluid inclusion; halite; hydrogen isotope; hydrothermal fluid; impact structure; impactite; kerogen; limestone; metamorphism; oxidation; plagioclase; silicate; smectite; stable isotope; Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448978092

The existence of this gap, or shortfall, is widely known and some countries already adjust test fuel economy values by a correction factor to account for it. In recent years, there has been speculation that the gap is growing as a percentage of the certified, tested value. This has raised concerns that national fuel consumption reduction goals based on test values will not be met in reality and that consumers will lose faith in reported fuel economy figures. This report analyses available data on the gap and examines technologies available to reduce it along with policies to promote their adoption. This information can be used to select technologies and measures for reducing oil use and CO2emissions that deliver fuel economy improvements on the road in spite of any deficiencies in the test cycles used to measure it. An extensive review of the literature reveals that there have been few recent assessments of shortfall in OECD countries. New empirical studies are needed and would be very valuable. These could be conducted, for example, by having a sample of drivers keep logs of vehicle travel and actual fuel consumption, in different areas and for different types of vehicles, and then comparing this data to test-rated fuel economy figures. An engineering analysis of available technologies has identified several that have little or no impact on fuel economy test results but are potentially useful for improving actual on-road fuel economy. Some (though not all) of these are estimated to be cost-effective for reducing fuel consumption from the consumer's viewpoint, based on a payback period2of three years. More of the technologies, in more situations, are estimated to provide net benefits to society - i.e. their costs are more than offset by the private plus the social benefits derived (associated with fuel savings and reduced oil dependency) - and they provide relatively low cost CO2emissions reductions. The most cost-effective technologies are related to reducing the fuel economy shortfall for gasoline vehicles in cold ambient temperature and dense traffic conditions. These technologies are electric water pumps, energy efficient alternators, heat batteries (for pre-warming engine oil on start up) and 5W-20 oil. Under cold ambient, dense traffic conditions, the combination of all these technologies could increase fuel economy by around 10% on average and up to 20% during the winter. These benefits are available to urban drivers in areas such as Northern Europe, Canada, the Northern U.S. and Northern Japan. This is a promising area for policy intervention. These and other technologies are sometimes cost effective in other situations (such as warmer climates or highway driving conditions) depending on fuel prices and average annual distances driven. A number of technologies were found not to be cost-effective in any of the conditions considered. In addition to technologies, one non-technology measure was also considered: driver training programmes. With careful programme design, driver training can provide significant fuel savings and appears cost-effective in all driving conditions. A key assumption is that drivers continue to follow the recommended driving styles after the period of training. Several technologies are available to encourage fuel-efficient driving (such as shift indicator lights and fuel-use indicators) and are already provided in many cars. When incorporated in new vehicle designs they can be added to cars at very low cost (less than 10 or Dollars/10 Euros). © OECD/IEA, 2005.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957765662

Vancouver has supported these directions in its transportation and land use plans, which strive to build compact and complete communities that support transit, walking and cycling and other alternatives to driving alone. Recent data has shown successes in implementing these plans - while significant population growth has occurred, auto driver mode shares have decreasing slightly, and transit, walking and cycling modes have shown substantial increases. In 2003, the City approved another measure that will further support these initiatives, with a new development cost levy that includes transportation alternative projects. During 2004, the City developed a Community Climate Change Action Plan, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions generated by Vancouver residents and businesses, in order to comply with the Kyoto Protocol. This Plan responds to the call by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) for municipalities to support the federal government's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. In Vancouver, buildings and vehicles were found to contribute to the majority of the community's greenhouse gas emissions (industry accounted for only about 7% of the total emissions). Vancouver passenger vehicles (i.e. cars, vans, pick-up trucks and SUVs) account for over one-quarter of the community's greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicle emissions were estimated using regional fuel sales, and allocating Vancouver's share based on the actual miles driven by Vancouver registered vehicles. This involved considerable effort, in matching odometer readings from a very large (8 million record) database that was provided from the region's Common Air Contaminant monitoring program. Analysis showed that although average distances travelled per vehicle went down between 1990 and 2000, total emissions increased due to the consumer preferences towards heavier vehicles. Public workshop for feedback on draft plan The Climate Change Action Plan recognizes that the best opportunities to reduce the City's greenhouse gas emissions are related to passenger vehicles. Accordingly, over 60% of the Plan's emission reduction target for 2012 is to come from passenger vehicle initiatives. The Plan provides a new framework that builds on existing sustainable urban transportation initiatives, and outlines new actions to achieve a substantial reduction in vehicle use and gasoline consumption. Fundamental to the Plan are new and expanded City roles in Transportation Demand Management, working with regional, provincial and federal partners, and new initiatives to promote efficient vehicles and fuels. Plan strategies and actions for providing facilities and services that encourage increased use of transportation alternatives (walking, cycling, transit, etc.), and promoting more efficient vehicles and fuels are summarised below:.",,"Climate change; Economics; Emission control; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Motor transportation; Population statistics; Trucks; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Consumer preferences; Emission reduction targets; Federal governments; Passenger vehicles; Registered vehicles; Substantial reduction; Transportation demand management; Transportation system; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898480638
