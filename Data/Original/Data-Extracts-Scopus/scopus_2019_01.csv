It is based on the use of a room-temperature phosphorescent probe consisting of alginate-capped and manganese(II)-doped ZnS quantum dots. The carboxy groups at the surface of the probe strongly coordinate Cu(II) to form a complex. As a result, the 4T1-6A1 transition of the Mn(II) ions in the probe is quenched, and the long decay time (~2.1 ms in the unquenched state) is accordingly reduced. At excitation/emission wavelengths of 316/590 nm and a delay time of 0.1 ms, the probe shows a linear response in the 0.01 to 12 μM Cu(II) concentration range. The detection limit is 6.0 nM and the RSD is 3.2% (for n = 5).

This technological solution can eliminate the emissions of auxiliary engines at berth, resulting in a global reduction of emissions if the grid powering the ships is an environmentally friendly energy source. This paper conducts a literature review of recent academic work in the field and presents the status of this technology worldwide and the current barriers for its further implementation. The use of cold ironing is mandatory in Californian ports for ship operators and as a result terminal and ship operators were required to invest in this technology. In Europe, all ports will be required to have cold ironing provision by the end of 2025. Other regulations that target local emissions such as Emission Control Areas can have a significant impact on whether cold ironing is used in the future as a potential compliance solution. This paper constructs a quantitative framework for the examination of the technology considering all stakeholders. The role of regulation is shown to be critical for the further adoption of this technology. Illustrative case studies are presented that consider the perspective of ship operators of various ship types, and terminal operators that opt to invest in shorepower facilities. The results of the case studies show that for medium and high fuel price scenarios there is economic motivation for ship operators to use cold ironing. For the port, the cost per abated ton of pollutants is much lower than current estimates of the external costs of pollutants. Therefore, shorepower may be a viable emissions reduction option for the maritime sector, provided that regulatory bodies assist the further adoption of the technology from ship operators and ports. The methodology can be useful to port and ship operators in examining the benefits of using cold ironing as an emissions reduction action. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Compliance control; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Current estimates; Emissions reduction; Literature reviews; Quantitative frameworks; Reduction of emissions; Regulatory bodies; Technological solution; Terminal operators; Ships; emission control; pollution tax; port operation; quantitative analysis; regulatory framework; shipping; transportation policy; transportation technology; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056622952

Beginning with the June 2016 vote in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and continuing through today, there are global signs of increasing emphasis on protecting national sovereignty and less on world efforts to address major environmental and energy issues. Admittedly, the United Nations-based effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions continues to move forward. However, more than a few nations are hinting that they may not live up to their commitments agreed in the form of the Paris Climate Agreement. There is no clearer example than the United States, where since January 2017 President Donald Trump has taken steps to deconstruct the US federal government’s role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This article current as of 1 December takes account of what is happening around the world in terms of major political changes that will affect the world’s ability to address environmental challenges. Special attention is devoted to what is happening in the US under the Trump administration.

A set of samples with different positions of Si doping with respect to the multi quantum well (MQW) active region was prepared and studied by PL, SIMS and AFM and structure band alignments were simulated. Based on our experiments and band structure simulations, we show that the dominant influence of Si doping is in modification of the tilt of the band structure. However, the minor influence of lower dislocation density or unintentional doping of a few lowest QWs in the case of a Si doped buffer layer cannot be excluded. A probable origin of the defect band luminescence and its high sensitivity to the band structure tilting is explained. Based on gained understanding, proper Si doping position for particular applications is suggested. In the case of LED structures, the n-type buffer layer and p-type capping layer help improve the emission efficiency. In the case of an InGaN/GaN MQW structure designed for scintillators, the n-type doping immediately under the MQW region is not required, since it strongly increases the QW defect band luminescence which becomes dominant in the spectrum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","A1.

The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is an economic and industrial center in China with an extremely large population. The potentially high emissions and excess cancer risk from human exposure in this region cannot be neglected. This study applied a multimedia model to estimate the concentrations of 16 US EPA priority PAHs in the environment in the YRD with a well-developed PAH-emission inventory for 2014. The model predicted that the average concentrations of ΣPAHs were 274 ng/m 3 in the air, 255 ng/g in the soil, 15 ng/g in vegetation, 147 ng/L in freshwater and 144 ng/g in sediment, as well as 99 ng/L and 80 ng/g in seawater and sediment, respectively. Soil is the PAH sink in this region, and the net flux of the total PAHs is always from air to soil for each isomer. A deterministic assessment observed that the ELCR (excess lifetime cancer risk) ranged from 2.5 × 10 −6 to 3.0 × 10 −5 for exposure by air inhalation and from 3.5 × 10 −7 to 7.9 × 10 −6 for exposure by soil ingestion. The probabilistic results did not find any probability of ELCR &gt;10 −4 by exposure via soil ingestion in the YRD. The probabilistic ELCR induced by inhalation exposure varied from 8.1 × 10 −7 to 3.1 × 10 −4 in the YRD. This study provided a comprehensive overview of PAHs occurrence in natural environments and of the relevant human health risks. The information presented in this study could help authorities to enact a strategy regarding emission reduction and pollution control relevant to PAHs.

We assessed in this study the association between exposure to PM 2.5 in ambient air during pregnancy and preterm birth in metropolitan areas of the state of Georgia, where the rate of preterm birth has been among the highest in the nation over the years. Birth data were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics natality dataset. The study population consisted of 53,094 singleton live births between January 1 and December 31, 2004 in nine metropolitan counties of Georgia. Preterm birth was defined as birth, which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation. County-level daily air quality index (AQI) data obtained from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was used to estimate individual exposure levels of PM 2.5 for each study participant based on the county of residence for the duration of the pregnancy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association, adjusting for potential confounders. Of the infants whose mothers resided in the nine metropolitan counties of Georgia, 4543 (8.6%) were born preterm. A higher rate of preterm birth (9.8%) was observed in infants whose mothers were exposed to ambient PM 2.5 with AQI values &gt; 50 than the ones with AQI ≤ 50 (EPA standard for good air quality conditions). Mothers with exposure to PM 2.5 at average AQI values greater than 50 during the entire pregnancy were at increased risk of preterm birth (odds ratio 1.15; 95% CI 1.07, 1.25), after adjusting for sex of infant, mother’s age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, prenatal care, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and season of conception.

Zhejiang Province has witnessed unprecedented LUCC concomitant with rapid urbanization from 1970 to 2010. In this study, remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method were combined to quantify changes in both vegetation carbon storage and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage resulting from LUCC during 1970–1990 and 1990–2010. For both 1970–1990 and 1990–2010, the results showed successive decrease in farmlands (2.8 × 10 5 ha or −9.15% and 5.9 × 10 5 ha or −20.49%, respectively) and grasslands (3.4 × 10 4 ha or −10.73% and 1.5 × 10 5 ha or −54.1%, respectively), and continuous increase in forests (2.0 × 10 4 ha or 0.33% and 1.7 × 10 5 ha or 2.81%, respectively) and built-up lands (2.07 × 10 5 ha or 78.41% and 6.49 × 10 5 ha or 137.8%, respectively). From 1970 to 1990, approximately 8.3 Tg of the total carbon sink declined, including a 0.4 Tg reduction in vegetation carbon and a 7.9 Tg reduction in SOC. While from 1990 to 2010, approximately 17.5 Tg of carbon storage declined, comprising a 2.8 Tg of carbon accumulated by vegetation, and a 20.3 Tg reduction in SOC.

The quantitative consequences of increased drought for ecosystems are not easy to predict. Process-based models must be informed by experiments to determine the resilience of plants and ecosystems from different climates. Here, we demonstrate what and how experimentally derived quantitative information can improve the representation of stomatal and non-stomatal photosynthetic responses to drought in large-scale vegetation models. In particular, we review literature on the answers to four key questions: (1) Which photosynthetic processes are affected under short-term drought? (2) How do the stomatal and non-stomatal responses to short-term drought vary among species originating from different hydro-climates? (3) Do plants acclimate to prolonged water stress, and do mesic and xeric species differ in their degree of acclimation? (4) Does inclusion of experimentally based plant functional type specific stomatal and non-stomatal response functions to drought help Land Surface Models to reproduce key features of ecosystem responses to drought? We highlighted the need for evaluating model representations of the fundamental eco-physiological processes under drought. Taking differential drought sensitivity of different vegetation into account is necessary for Land Surface Models to accurately model drought responses, or the drought impacts on vegetation in drier environments may be over-estimated. © 2019 Zhou, Prentice and Medlyn.","Drought acclimation; Flux measurement; J max; Land surface model; Mesophyll conductance; Photosynthesis; Stomatal and non-stomatal limitation; V cmax",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062811940

Since PM 2.5 affects meteorology via aerosol-meteorology interactions, a question arises how these interactions may impact the response of PM 2.5 to emission reductions and thus the effectiveness of emission control measures. Here we use the coupled meteorology-chemistry model WRF-Chem to investigate this issue with focus on aerosol-radiation interactions (ARI) for the APEC week and three more polluted episodes over North China. We find a quadratic relationship between PM 2.5 concentration changes due to emission reductions and PM 2.5 levels, instead of an approximately linear response in the absence of ARI. The ARI effects could only change the effectiveness of emission control by 6.7% during APEC in Beijing, but reach 21.9% under more polluted conditions. Our results reveal that ARI can strongly affect the attribution of PM 2.5 variability to emission changes and meteorology, and is thus important for assessing the effectiveness of emission control measures. © 2019 The Author(s).

Monthly measures of forest aboveground productivity from natural forests (primary and secondary forests) and plantations (mixed and single-species forests) were developed to explore the sensitivity of subtropical mountain productivity to the fluctuating characteristics of climate change in South China, spanning the 35-year period from 1981 to 2015. Statistical analysis showed that climate regulation differed across different forest types. The monthly average maximum temperature, precipitation, and streamflow were positively correlated with primary and mixed-forest aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and its components: Wood productivity (WP) and canopy productivity (CP). However, the monthly average maximum temperature, precipitation, and streamflow were negatively correlated with secondary and single-species forest ANPP and its components. The number of dry days and minimum temperature were positively associated with secondary and single-species forest productivity, but inversely associated with primary and mixed forest productivity. The multivariate ENSO (EI Niño-Southern Oscillation) index (MEI), computed based on sea level pressure, surface temperature, surface air temperature, and cloudiness over the tropical Pacific Ocean, was significantly correlated with local monthly maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), precipitation (PRE), streamflow (FLO), and the number of dry days (DD), as well as the monthly means of primary and mixed forest aboveground productivity. In particular, the mean maximum temperature increased by 2.5, 0.9, 6.5, and 0.9 °C, and the total forest aboveground productivity decreased by an average of 5.7%, 3.0%, 2.4%, and 7.8% in response to the increased extreme high temperatures and drought events during the 1986/1988, 1997/1998, 2006/2007, and 2009/2010 EI Niño periods, respectively. Subsequently, the total aboveground productivity values increased by an average of 1.1%, 3.0%, 0.3%, and 8.6% because of lagged effects after the wet La Niña periods. The main conclusions of this study demonstrated that the influence of local and regional climatic fluctuations on subtropical forest productivity significantly differed across different forests, and community position and plant diversity differences among different forest types may prevent the uniform response of subtropical mountain aboveground productivity to regional climate anomalies. Therefore, these findings may be useful for forecasting climate-induced variation in forest aboveground productivity as well as for selecting tree species for planting in reforestation practices. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change and disturbances; Forest aboveground productivity; Forests; MEI; Mixed forests; Streamflow","Atmospheric pressure; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Sea level; Stream flow; Tropics; Aboveground net primary productivity; Anthropogenic activity; Forests; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Mixed forests; Regional climate changes; Surface air temperatures; Tropical Pacific ocean; Climate change; aboveground production; climate change; environmental disturbance; human activity; mixed forest; reforestation; regional climate; streamflow; subtropical region; tropical forest; Barometric Pressure; Ecosystems; Forests; Reforestation; Stream Flow; Tropics; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060283001

One important finding is that the volume of SO X emissions embodied in global trade increased dramatically from 1995 to 2011, and the global SO X emissions stemming from anthropogenic energy consumption are mostly from China and the USA. Another important finding is that, referring to specific sectors, whether seen from the total SEET or from the sources of SEET or from the total SO X emissions occurring from economic consumption and production, energy sectors, like electricity, gas, and water supply and coke, refined petroleum, and nuclear fuel, are the main contributors to the increase in the global SO X emissions. Notably, however, our results show that the sector of agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing should be allocated more SO X emission reduction responsibilities under a consumption-based emissions’ accounting inventory. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Ecological environment; Energy consumption; Input–output analysis; Sulfur oxides","emission control; emission inventory; energy use; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; international trade; pollution policy; sulfur compound; sulfur emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051794441

Sequestering the CO2 into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs with associated enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the most achievable approach under current economic constraints since it increases recovery of existing oil reserves, and bridges the gap between regional-scale CO2 capture and geologic sequestration. However, one of the challenges is the paucity of modern subsurface data required for adequate reservoir characterization and storage estimates. The Upper Devonian fluvial sandstone reservoirs in the Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field in West Virginia, which have produced over 22 million barrels of oil since 1895, are ideal candidates for CO2 sequestration coupled with EOR. Reservoir storage capacity and oil recovery factors are keys for the evaluation of coupled CO2 storage and CO2-EOR process. Regression relationships between wireline logs and core measured data for porosity, permeability are constructed by artificial neural network and support vector machine in core-scale; then extended from core-scale to well-scale, where wells do not have porosity and permeability wireline logs; finally a 3D static geological model is generated based on the Random Gaussian Function simulation method and well-established variogram models generated by detailed data analysis. A static 3D reservoir model, which integrates detailed geological knowledge and existing legacy geological data from Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field, is constructed to estimate theoretical CO2 storage capacity. Depending on the proposed 3D geological model, the best regions for coupled CCUS-EOR are located in southern portions of the field, and the estimated CO2 theoretical storage capacity for Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field varies from 24 to 383 million metric tons. The estimated results of CO2 sequestration indicate that the Jacksonburg-Stringtown oilfield has significant potential for CO2 storage and value-added EOR. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D geological model; Artificial neural network & Support vector machine; CO2 storage capacity estimation; Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field; Reservoir characterization","Carbon dioxide; Computer system recovery; Digital storage; Geologic models; Global warming; Neural networks; Oil fields; Oil well logging; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Porosity; Proven reserves; Support vector machines; 3-d geological models; CO2 storage; Enhanced oil recovery; Geologic sequestrations; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Regression relationship; Reservoir characterization; Reservoir storage capacity; Enhanced recovery; artificial neural network; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; enhanced oil recovery; estimation method; geostatistics; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil field; reservoir characterization; support vector machine; three-dimensional modeling; United States; West Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057581507

The increase of consumer willingness to pay and the premium level that consumers would pay for green products hold the key to address this challenge. For that reason, this paper first constructs a behavioral game model to explore how environmental beliefs would affect consumer willingness to pay for the greenness premium. Then, the paper proceeds with empirical analyses on factors influencing consumer willingness to pay for the greenness premium by using micro-survey data of Chinese consumers when facing the choices of low-carbon rice in the cities of central China. The empirical research suggests that, although the average greenness premium that Chinese consumers are willing to pay for low-carbon agricultural products is low, the greenness premium will be stronger when consumers have higher environmental beliefs. We also find the impacts of environmental beliefs on the willingness to pay as well as the greenness premium levels that consumers are willing to pay for low-carbon agricultural products increase with education attainment and family income, but do not change with age. Findings in this study carry several important policy implications. To encourage green consumption that facilitates green production, the government should devote attempts to promote consumers' environmental beliefs and also apply differentiated public policy that targeting at different types of consumers. © 2019 by the authors.","Environmental beliefs; Low-carbon products; Premium level; Willingness to pay","agricultural production; carbon footprint; consumption behavior; environmental planning; market development; rice; survey method; theoretical study; willingness to pay; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060475246

Here we use density functional theory to investigate the effect of alloying Cu and Sn on the activity and selectivity towards formate. A theoretical thermodynamic analysis of the reaction energetics suggests that the incorporation of copper into tin could suppress hydrogen evolution and CO production, thus favouring formate generation.

Therefore, on the basis of this index system, this paper adopted the weight determination method based on the order relation method and Gini coefficient method to synthesize subjective and objective information. Then the comprehensive benefit evaluation of such projects was carried out by matter-element extension model with grey relational projection value. Therefore, the problem with the Euclid approach degree leading to a low discrimination of many samples to be evaluated was effectively solved.

The benefits of the policy on pollutant emissions could be indicated through the inter-annual trends in SO2 and NOX emissions for 2000-2014. From a bottom-up perspective, the policy improved the energy efficiency and elevated the use of emission control devices for power and other big industrial plants, and the emission factors were reduced for most cases. Satellite-derived vertical column densities (VCDs) are used to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of emissions across the country. Discrepancy existed in the inter-annual trends between SO2 VCDs and emissions. Such comparison is improved with an optimistic emission case in which the emission standards for selected industrial sectors issued after 2010 had been fully implemented. Suggested by VCDs and the optimistic emission case, SO2 control during the 12th 5-year plan (12th FYP, 2011-2015) period was more effective than that during the 11th FYP period (2006-2010). In contrast to fast growth before 2011 driven by increased coal consumption and limited controls, NOX emissions declined from 2011 to 2014 due to application of selective catalytic/non-catalytic reduction systems in the power sector. Reduced NO2 VCDs were detected, particularly in highly polluted Eastern China and Pearl River Delta regions. Given the strict controls in developed areas, air pollution has been expanding to less-developed neighboring regions. Transportation is playing an increasingly important role in air pollution, suggested by the increased ratio of NO2 to SO2 VCDs. A faster decrease of alkaline base cations than that of SO2 may raise the acidification risks to ecosystems, implying the need of further control of acid precursors. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085436261

The methane adsorption characteristics and influencing factors of the medium-to-high rank coal samples of the Shanxi Formation in this coalfield were analyzed. The results indicate that the Langmuir volume (V L ) of coals in the shallow western part of the Anhe coalfield is generally higher than that in the deep eastern part. The coal rank and the coal macerals are the dominant factors that influence the methane adsorption capacity of coals in this anti-Hilt law area. The methane adsorption capacity, represented by V L , first increases and then decreases with the coal rank, and the highest V L value corresponds to the maximum vitrinite reflectance of ∼2.1%. The adsorption capacity has a positive correlation with the vitrinite and the moisture content, a negative relationship with the inertinite content. In general, the adsorption capacity of coal samples shows a “V-shaped” change with the ash yield, and the lowest V L value corresponds to the ash yield of ∼9%.

We aim to test whether two currently interacting taxa, valley oak (Quercus lobata) and lace lichen (Ramalina menziesii), have had a long-lasting historical association and are likely to continue to associate in the future. Location: Central western California, western United States of America. Methods: Using population genetic analyses and MaxEnt software for ecological niche modelling, we estimate species’ distributions during the Last Interglacial, the Last Glacial Maximum, present, and future periods. Mantel and vertex (genetic connection) tests were used to examine the spatial congruence among taxa. To compare the modelled response to climate change, we estimated migration speed between respective time periods using vector analysis. Results: We found significant genetic congruence between valley oak and the lichen's green algal photobiont, independent of geographic isolation and habitat isolation, which is consistent with long-term association. Ecological niche models under past and future climate scenarios indicate that overlap of climatic niche sharing between valley oak and lace lichen might decrease in the future. Our models indicate that the speed of shifts in climate niches between these two taxa differed significantly in past periods from that of the present period. Main conclusions: Our findings reveal that historical interactions between valley oak and lace lichen correlate with long-term sharing of past climate niches. However, the future association of lace lichen with valley oak may be disrupted in parts of its current distribution due to differential discordance of climate niche shifts, species’ movements and generation times. This study illustrates the processes and patterns that allow long-term association during historic climate change and how they are likely to change during rapid climate change. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; co-occurrence; ecological niche modelling; migration; Quercus lobata; Ramalina menziesii","climate change; coexistence; dicotyledon; ecological modeling; future prospect; historical record; Last Glacial Maximum; Last Interglacial; lichen; migration; niche; niche partitioning; California; United States; algae; Quercus lobata; Ramalina menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057462728

With economic development, travel demands and logistics demands will continue to rise in China. To solve the associated problems, policies related to electric vehicle (EV) promotion and fuel economy regulations are being adopted by the state government. Six scenarios, based on different policies, are analyzed to calculate vehicle fleet GHG emissions in this research by developing a bottom-up modeling framework from a life-cycle perspective. When only fuel economy regulations are considered, GHG emissions from the road transport sector will reach their peak in 2047. However, combined with EV deployment, the peak will arrive earlier, in 2026. In the short term, more stringent fuel economy regulations exhibit better results. Without EVs, fuel economy regulations will be tougher for corporations to meet than with the introduction of EVs. However, in the long term, with a higher proportion of EVs, GHG emissions will further decrease. In addition, the introduction of EVs will weaken the effects of fuel economy regulations, especially for passenger vehicles, due to credit policies. The lack of EVs in the commercial vehicle fleet will impart more significance to the fuel economy regulations. Commercial vehicles, particularly trucks, will account for the majority of GHG emissions by the whole vehicle fleet. In brief, the government should persistently focus on the fuel economy regulations to achieve an early and relatively low-level peak in vehicle fleet GHG emissions. Meanwhile, the promotion of EVs will have the long-term effect of de-carbonization. In addition, more effective measures should be taken to reduce the truck GHG emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Corporate average fuel consumption; Electric vehicle; Greenhouse gas","Carbonization; Commercial vehicles; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Roads and streets; Trucks; China; Economic development; Effective measures; Environmental issues; Life cycle perspectives; Passenger vehicles; Road transport sectors; Vehicle electrifications; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055996271

The mosaic approach, rather than the dominant approach, was employed to describe the land surface characteristics and their corresponding changes, for which the changes in the land surface physical parameters were closer to the actual values. Changes in rainfall displayed marked subregional characteristics, which could be interpreted by changes in local upward and large-scale moisture fluxes. Meanwhile, changes in the total rainfall (RCN) in various categories displayed remarkably different characteristics. Among these characteristics, storm and heavy storm rain expressed larger changes (relative values) and displayed stronger sensitivities over semi-arid subregions. Storm and heavy storm rainfall increased up to 10.5% in the eastern part of northwestern China (NWE) and 13.6% over northeastern China and decreased up to 6.5% over the Tibetan Plateau and 11.9% over NWE. According to changes in the convective (RC) and non-convective (RN) rainfall, the RCN for both storm and heavy storm rain were influenced by changes not only in the RC, RN, and RCN intensities, but also in the rain areas and number of rain days. The impacts of land use change on the summed RC, RN, and RCN for various categories might be less, whereas changes in the RC, RN, and RCN for individual various categories could be much larger. The rainfall impacts in various categories were higher over the subregions of China compared to China overall or the East Asian land areas, and those impacts demonstrated smaller influences at the regional scale (country-wide, China) compared to the local scale (subregions of China). Therefore, the impacts of land use change on rainfall in various categories are important for climatic change studies. © 2018 The Authors.

Denitrification accounts for significant reduction of inorganic N to nitrous oxide (N2O) or dinitrogen gas (N2), and thereby curtails harmful effects of N pollution in coastal and marine ecosystems. However, the molecular drivers and limiting steps of denitrification in coastal wetlands are not well understood. Here, we quantified the abundances of functional genes involved in N cycling and determined denitrification rates using 15N paring technique in the coastal wetland sediments of Bohai Economic Rim in eastern China. Denitrification accounting for 80.7 ± 12.6% of N removal was the dominant pathway for N removal in the coastal wetlands. In comparison, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) removed up to 36.9 ± 7.3% of inorganic N. Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the effects of ammonium on denitrification potential were mainly mediated by the relative abundances of nosZ/nirS, nirS/(narG + napA) and amoA/nirK. Denitrification was limited by the relative strength of two steps, namely N2O reduction to N2 and nitrite (NO2 −) reduction to nitric oxide (NO). Our results suggest that the relative abundances of functional genes which are more stable than sediment chemical compounds in the context of environmental changes are indictive of denitrification potential in coastal wetlands. Denitrification was driven by functional microbial gene abundance in coastal wetlands. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal wetland; Denitrification; Eastern China; Functional gene; Nitrogen cycle","Denitrification; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Genes; Marine pollution; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Coastal wetlands; Denitrification potential; Eastern China; Functional genes; Microbial communities; Nitrogen cycles; Structural equation modeling; Wetlands; ammonia; amoA protein; bacterial protein; chemical compound; napA protein; narG protein; nirK protein; nirS protein; nitric oxide; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrogen 15; nitrous oxide; nosZ protein; unclassified drug; ammonium derivative; nitrogen derivative; coastal wetland; denitrification; functional response; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; relative abundance; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; anaerobic metabolism; Article; China; coastal waters; controlled study; denitrification; environmental change; gene function; marine environment; microbial community; microbial gene; nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; population abundance; sediment; structural equation modeling; waste component removal; wetland; bacterial gene; chemical model; chemistry; environmental microbiology; genetics; microbiology; microflora; nitrogen cycle; pollutant; Bohai Rim; China; Ammonium Compounds; China; Denitrification; Environmental Microbiology; Environmental Pollutants; Genes, Bacterial; Geologic Sediments; Microbiota; Models, Chemical; Nitric Oxide; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Compounds; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrous Oxide; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054578424

However, the mechanisms that guide this phenomenon, especially along latitude gradients, remain unclear. Using key leaf functional trait data of 1185 species within 120 sites in Eastern and Western China, we quantified the relationships between plant traits, namely leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus content, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf delta 13C (d 13C) content, and local climate along the latitude in Eastern and Western China. Our results revealed that: (1) Plant traits showed a wide variation across the study locations in China. The variation in plant traits was strongly correlated with latitude. (2) In Eastern China, latitude alone explained 54% and 53% of the variation in N:P and leaf phosphorus content (Pmass (g/kg)), respectively. In Western China, latitude alone explained 75% of the variation in leaf area. In Eastern China, most plant traits are significantly correlated with each other. However, this phenomenon is not obvious in Western China. (3) Immediate climate factors (mean climate in the month when the leaf traits were sampled) contributes most to explaining functional traits related to leaf nutrients, such as leaf nitrogen content (Nmass (g/kg), Narea (g/cm2)), leaf phosphorus content (Pmass (g/kg), Parea (g/cm2)), and annual mean climate contributes more to explaining functional traits related to leaf survival strategies. (4) In Eastern China, immediate climate and annual mean climate variables can explain the variance of 39.2% and 41.3% of plant traits variation, respectively. In Western China, the effect size of corresponding factors are 23.4% and 25.2%, respectively. © 2019","Climate variables; Forest ecosystems; Latitude gradient; Leaf nutrients; Plant traits",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060295292

Overall, the proposed modeling demonstrates that the integration of the heat and electricity system (when compared with the decoupled approach) can bring significant benefits by increasing the investment in the heating infrastructure in order to enhance the system flexibility that in turn can deliver larger cost savings in the electricity system, thus meeting the carbon target at a lower whole-system cost. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","combined heat and power (CHP); heat network; heat pump (HP); Integrated energy system; power system economics; renewable energy sources","Carbon; Cost effectiveness; District heating; Economic and social effects; Renewable energy resources; Combined heat and power; Heat pumps; Integrated energy systems; Power system economics; Renewable energy source; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054239650

To comprehensively reveal this problem, a new consumption-based sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission inventory in 2010 for 30 provincial regions of China was compiled by introducing source-receptor relationship (SRR) model to integrate the spillover impacts of physical transport from the emitter (producer) region to the receptor region and virtual transfer from the driver (consumer) region to the emitter region. Compared the emissions induced by final regional demand with the emissions received in seven regions of China, Southern (0.59 Mt), Northern (0.25 Mt), Northwestern (0.18 Mt), and Eastern (0.14 Mt) areas outsourced SO2 pollution in the mass, whereas Central (−0.66 Mt), Northeastern (−0.42 Mt), and Southwestern (−0.08 Mt) areas took excessive environmental burdens in 2010. The four municipalities, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin as well as the most affluent province Guangdong showed significant pollution transfer after an overall assessment of their roles in drivers, emitters and receptors. Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Henan, and Shandong showed the largest co-benefits of SO2 emissions control for climate change mitigation. Japan was found to receive more portions of transboundary SO2 deposition than its market shares in China's export instead of other major trade partners of China. As a mega-city, Beijing induced significant SO2 emissions for power requirement, food consumption, miscellaneous services, and her vibrant research activities through the sectors of the power industry, coal mining, chemical manufacturing, food-related industries, petroleum processing and coking, but 86% of those emissions were outsourced by Beijing. In total, the spillover of SO2 emissions induced by Beijing was estimated at 0.20 Mt, 76 times more than its own share as a receptor across the supply chains. This study is competent for an analytic framework of strategic planning for joint prevention and control of air pollution in China and other countries. The results can help reduce pollution transfer, properly tax on drivers, effectively control the emitters, and reasonably compensate the receptors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption-based accounting; Footprint; Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis; Pollution transfer; Shared responsibility; Source-receptor relationship (SRR)","Air pollution; Atmospheric movements; Climate change; Coal industry; Coking; Commerce; Competition; Food supply; Industrial research; Petroleum industry; Sulfur dioxide; Supply chains; Air pollution in chinas; Climate change mitigation; Footprint; Input-output; Long-distance transport; Prevention and controls; Shared responsibility; Source-receptor relationships; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056173123

The evaluation indicators of second-law efficiency and CO2 emissions are adopted to rank different pressure swing-top vapor recompressed (PSDVRC) configurations. Compared to the conventional PSD process, the economically optimum flowsheet is the thermal integrated PSDVRC process with overhead vapor splitting since it can reduce 67.05% in energy consumption, 72.66% in CO2 emissions and 34.14% in total annual cost (TAC) as well as enhance 159.06% in thermodynamic efficiency. Besides, PSDVRC processes with overhead vapor splitting (PSDVRC-VS) are also superior to other PSDVRC configurations where economic-efficient process is PSD process (PSDSVRC) with single vapor recompression. Dynamic controllability for the highly integrated and interacting economic-efficient process is also investigated. An effective control structure is developed that only handles small (5%) disturbances in throughput and feed composition. The modified process is further developed to achieve robust control performance in terms of peak dynamic transients, settling time, oscillation and steady-state offsets. Meanwhile, control performance comparisons for PSDVRC-VS and PSDSVRC processes are also studied and showed that there is conflict between the steady-state economics and dynamic controllability. © 2018","Dynamic controllability; Pressure-swing distillation; Thermal integration; Vapor recompression","Carbon dioxide; Controllability; Distillation; Energy utilization; Robust control; Dynamic controllability; Evaluation indicators; Performance enhancements; Pressure swing distillation; Second law efficiencies; Thermal integration; Thermodynamic efficiency; Vapor recompression; Integration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054756220

The present study proposes a hierarchical modeling framework for predicting and analyzing the impacts of climate change and hydropower on fish habitats. The approach couples multi-scale climate, hydrological, water temperature, hydrodynamic and habitat suitability models and was applied to a reach of the Jinsha River. Flow discharge and water temperature were predicted in the study area for a baseline scenario and three climate change scenarios, and each considered the presence and absence of impacts caused by hydropower operation. The impacts of flow discharge and water temperature variations on spawning and juvenile Coreius guichenoti, an imperiled warm-water fish in the Jinsha River Basin (JRB), were evaluated using a fuzzy logic-based habitat model. The results showed that habitat suitability and available usable area for the fish increased due to climate change, and water temperature rising was the main influencing factor. Water temperature decrease induced by hydropower operation in the spawning periods resulted in the reduction of available habitat area. However, climate change reduced the negative effects generated by hydropower operation, and the available habitat area for the fish would still be expected to increase under the combined impacts of climate change and hydropower operation in the future. It is predicted that water warming, as a result of climate change, is likely to eliminate the spawning postponement effect generated by hydropower operation on Coreius guichenoti as well as other warm-water fish species in the JRB. In contrast, water warming induced by climate change is likely to exacerbate the negative effects of hydropower operation on the spawning activity of cold-water fish species in the JRB. The present study provides a scheme to predict the impacts of climate change and hydropower on other organisms in river ecosystems. The results are beneficial for the development of long-term and adaptive conservation and restoration measures for aquatic ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Fish spawning; Habitat suitability; Hydropower operation; Scenario prediction; Warm-water fish","Aquatic ecosystems; Climate models; Fish; Flowmeters; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Hierarchical systems; Hydrodynamics; Hydroelectric power; Rivers; Temperature; Climate change scenarios; Habitat suitability; Habitat suitability model; Hydropower operation; Predicting and analyzing; Restoration measures; Scenario predictions; Warm water fishes; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; cyprinid; habitat conservation; hierarchical system; prediction; scenario analysis; spawning ground; warm water; Article; China; climate change; controlled study; Coreius guichenoti; Cyprinidae; ecosystem restoration; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; fuzzy logic; hydrodynamics; hydropower; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; spawning; species habitat; water temperature; animal; ecosystem; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; fish; physiology; river; China; Jinsha River; Coreius guichenoti; Animals; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Power Plants; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051133369

To address these problems, construction of Z-scheme 2D/2D BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts with carbon dots as solid-state electron mediators has been investigated. The resultant BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 hybrids exhibits remarkable interfacial charge transfer abilities and a broadened solar light absorption range owing to the short charge transport distance and the up-converted photoluminescence character of CDs. Simultaneously, the enhanced specific surface area and nanosheet structure impart more active sites to BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 composites. As a result, BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 composites reveal significant enhancement in the activity of photodegradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TC) under visible and near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Moreover, the photodegradation efficiency of BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 hybrids was significantly enhanced over that of pristine BiOBr nanosheets and g-C3N4 ultrathin nanosheets. The photocatalytic mechanism is expounded according to free radical capture experiments and electron spin resonance spin-trapping tests and the photodegradation intermediates of CIP were detected by liquid chromatography–mass/mass spectrometry.

This study aimed to reveal the amplitude attenuation laws of acoustic emission waves in plate structures. Thus, in this study, the traditional model of amplitude attenuation, which is in the form of an exponential function, was improved in reference to cylindrical waves, and an amplitude attenuation model in the form of a power function suitable for plate structures was proposed. Moreover, an experimental system for the attenuation of acoustic emission waves in aluminum alloy plates was established to experimentally verify the proposed model. Finally, the amplitude attenuation laws of acoustic emission waves within the full field, near field, and far field of plate structures were discussed. Results show that the amplitude attenuation laws of acoustic emission waves within the full field, near field, and far field of plate structures all conform to the power function model and gradually reduce as propagation distance increases. In addition, the improved amplitude attenuation model better corresponds with the actual amplitude attenuation trend within the near-field range of the acoustic emission source than other forms of amplitude attenuation models. Specifically, the traditional model of amplitude attenuation model agrees with the actual attenuation laws of acoustic emission waves only within the far-field range of the acoustic emission source. The results of this study provide valuable references for the profound analysis of the propagation characteristics of acoustic emission waves in plate structures and can be employed in the research of new methods for source localization of burst-type acoustic emission waves based on acoustic amplitude attenuation. © 2019 Publicaciones Dyna Sl.

In this study, the source-oriented University of California at Davis/California Institute of Technology model with externally mixed aerosol representation is expanded to track the age distribution of elemental carbon (EC) in Southeast Texas. EC with the age of 0-3 h (i.e., emitted less than 3 h ago) accounted for ∼70-90% of the total in urban Houston and 20-40% in rural areas of southeast Texas in August 2000. Significant diurnal variations in the mean age of EC are predicted, with higher contributions from fresh particles during the morning and early evening due to increased traffic emission and reduced atmospheric mixing. Spatially, the mean age of EC decreases with proximity to major sources. Ground-level EC with the age >6 h is less than 20% of the first age group over land, and background EC accounts for the majority over the Gulf of Mexico. Differences in EC spatial distribution indicate that age distribution could have regional impact on aerosol optical and hygroscopic properties, and thus potentially affect cloud formation and radiation balance. Appropriately accounting for the differential properties due to age distribution is needed to better evaluate aerosol direct and indirect effects. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Carbon; Atmospheric mixing; Differential properties; Diurnal variation; Elemental carbon; Hygroscopic properties; Radiation balance; Traffic emissions; University of California; Aerosols; carbon; carbon; aerosol; aging; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon; elemental carbon; hygroscopicity; soot; source apportionment; spatial distribution; traffic emission; aerosol; age distribution; air quality; airborne particle; Article; circadian rhythm; climate change; controlled study; global climate; Gulf of Mexico; particle size; remote sensing; rural area; secondary organic aerosol; suburban area; Texas; water content; wettability; age distribution; air pollutant; California; environmental monitoring; particle size; Atlantic Ocean; California; Davis; Gulf of Mexico; Houston County [Texas]; Texas; United States; Aerosols; Age Distribution; Air Pollutants; California; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Gulf of Mexico; Particle Size; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059653925

As a result, the newly passed General Provisions of Civil Law adopted a ""Green Principle"" requiring private actors to contribute to resources conservation and environmental protection in civil activities. Through normative and comparative analysis, this article explores the establishment of the ""Green Principle"", the rationales for civil law's response to environmental problems in China, the progress already made, and the further efforts that are needed. It argues that the major challenge for the greening of China's civil law at present is the modification of the subsequent sections of the forthcoming civil code. Despite the progress that has already been made, further efforts are needed regarding the following aspects: environmental and resources protection should be taken into account in contract rules concerning the validity, performance, and interpretation of contracts, and rules on emission trading contracts should be added; the property section should stipulate the unified exercise of state ownership over natural resources; and the ""personality rights"" section should stipulate environmental rights so as to clarify the right that is violated in environmental public interest litigation. © 2019 by the authors.","China; Civil law codification; Ecological civilization; Green principle; Greening of civil law","civilization; emissions trading; environmental legislation; environmental protection; natural resource; ownership; resource management; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059689058

These changes, in turn, lead to changes in global climate zones with pace and amplitude varying from one region to another. Algeria, a country characterized by climate conditions ranging from relatively wet to very dry (desert-like), has also experienced changes in its climate regions, notably in the country’s wet region, which represents about 7% of its total surface area, but is home to 75% of its population. In this study, the pace of climate zone changes as it is defined by Koppen–Geiger was analyzed for the period from 1951 to 2098 using climate data from observation and regional climate simulations over Algeria. The ability of the CORDEX-Africa regional climate models simulations to reproduce the current observed climate zones and their shifts was first assessed. Future changes over the whole of the twenty-first century were then estimated based on two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios. Analysis of the shift rate of climate zones from 1951 to 2005 found a gradual but significant expansion of the surface area of the desert zone at an approximate rate of 650 ± 160 km 2 /year along with the abrupt shrinking, by approximately 30%, at a rate of 1086 ± 270 km 2 /year, of the warm temperate climate zone surface area. According to projections for the RCP8.5 scenario, the rate of expansion of desert climate will increase in the future (twenty-first century), particularly during the period from 2045 to 2098. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Algeria; Climate zone shift; CORDEX-Africa simulations; Koppen–Geiger","climate change; climate classification; climate conditions; climate modeling; computer simulation; global climate; regional climate; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042076014

Too little plant-based and too much livestock-based food is consumed. Livestock production requires substantial resources and causes considerable greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), especially methane from enteric fermentation in ruminant animals. The livestock sector produces 18% of GHGE worldwide and uses 52% of the crops supplied in dry matter within the EU. Most livestock species are relatively poor feed converters. They require multiple units of feed to produce a unit of meat, milk, or eggs. The EU-average for this food conversion ratio ranges from 1.1 for milk to 34.2 for lamb meat on a dry-matter basis (Wilkinson, 2011). In addition to the impacts on the ecosystem, excess consumption of meat is also associated with substantial health risks. Large parts of the agricultural production capacity are used for a product that leads to high GHGE and even health risks, when consumed at current levels. This work therefore attempts to quantify the technical potential to repurpose feed crops for biofuel production, if healthy, low-meat diets were adopted. The reduction of agricultural GHGE and additional GHG mitigation from using the biofuels are examined as well. The analysis is performed with a modified version of the EUFASOM model. Trade volumes between EU and non-EU regions are fixed at observed levels to assess intra-EU potentials. Consumer preferences are considered in the examined diets. Average supply and demand quantities from 2007 to 2011 serve as the reference. If healthy diets were adopted and meat intake halved from about 200 to 100 g per day and capita, biofuel production could be increased 7.7 fold. With this, 16.1% of all the EU's fossil transport fuels could be displaced. Agricultural GHGE could be reduced by 24% and 14% of GHGE in the EU's transport sector could be additionally mitigated through the increased biofuel production. The adoption of healthy diets with reduced meat consumption can hence lead to large potentials for GHG mitigation in the EU. This holds however only if lower consumption of livestock products is mirrored by lower production as well. Mitigating GHGE by reducing livestock and displacing fossil fuels, is the “double dividend” of lower meat consumption. Furthermore, no innovations or high investments are needed, and substantial health costs can be saved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; GHG mitigation; Healthy diets; Land use; Livestock emissions","agricultural production; biofuel; dietary intake; environmental impact assessment; European Union; food consumption; greenhouse gas; land use; livestock farming; meat; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055660667

Using landscape analysis, field research, and research-through-designing in a case study on climate resilience in Boston (USA), we argue for better understanding of the spatial and design consequences of pathways in general. Our results indicate that pathways can be spatially translated, demanding landscape-informed choices when sequencing different policy actions. We found that spatial designing makes the landscape consequences of pathways transparent and enables policy-makers to replace the input of policy actions with spatial interventions, select pathways according to different underlying design strategies, use the mapped pathways to initiate an iterative research-through-designing process to test and inform different designs, and spatially visualize the pathways and possible sequences of actions. We conclude that policy-makers should be cognizant about the spatial implications of pathways and offer directions to enrich applications of pathways thinking for achieving adaptive and sustainable landscapes. © 2019 by the author.","Adaptiveness; Climate adaptation; Decision pathways; Flood risk management; Landscape architecture; Spatial design; Uncertainty; Visualization","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; design; flood; landscape; policy making; risk; spatial analysis; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; visualization; Boston; Massachusetts; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060377315

Data were collected through distribution of a structured questionnaire to 476 randomly selected households at the municipality of Inhambane. The questionnaire assessed all capital assets, covering 14 indicators and 43 sub-indicators of vulnerability, derived from published literature. Findings: Results indicate that overall community vulnerability is largely derived from the vulnerability of physical, financial and social capitals, illustrated by declared food shortage, low nutrition levels, weak social networks, high level of biomass utilization and lack of financial resources due to unemployment. These aspects largely influence the noticed reduced adaptive capacity of surveyed households. Practical implications: The study identified the need to improve the overall process of natural resources appropriation and utilization and the improvement of the governance capacity at the local targeting infrastructure, community structure and networks and capacity building that might enhance community livelihoods in changing scenarios.

We modelled current and future distribution of all 13 dangerous snakes occurring in Mozambique using ecological niche models to assess the likely impacts of climate change estimated as the difference between lost and gained climatic suitable area per species. In addition, we developed a normalized index of snakebite risk based on species diversity and species-specific traits for each time slice. We then superimposed our index to data on human population density to identify areas most prone to this burden. Our findings suggest considerable future reduction in climatically suitable area for nine out of 13 species, with species experiencing a north-south range shift and high rates of species turnover in northern Mozambique. We also found that GCC might alter the spatial patterns of snakebite risk in the country, with considerable increase in the future, affecting most areas in central and southern regions. This finding suggests that GCC will be harmful to venomous snakes in Mozambique with potentially adverse effects on public health. As GCC might induce the approximation of snake climatic suitable areas to highly populated areas, efforts are needed to increase human knowledge of snakebite prevention measures and increase awareness of the relative safety and attacking behaviour associated with some of the snakes studied here ensuring reduction in snakebites and improving species conservation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate models; Conservation; Health risks; Population statistics; Public health; Climate change impact; Ecological niche models; Global climate changes; Prevention measures; Public health policies; Spatial patterns; Species conservations; Species-specific traits; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; geographical distribution; global climate; health policy; niche; population density; public health; risk; snake; species conservation; species diversity; Mozambique; Serpentes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057176005

However, it is still challenging for current dynamical models to fully capture the variability as well as its impacts on future climate. In this study, instead of simulating the internal multi-scale oscillations in dynamical models, we discussed the effects of internal variability in terms of climate memory. By decomposing climate state x(t) at a certain time point t into memory part M(t) and non-memory part ε(t) , climate memory effects from the past 30 years on climate prediction are quantified. For variables with strong climate memory, high variance (over 20 %) in x(t) is explained by the memory part M(t), and the effects of climate memory are non-negligible for most climate variables, but the precipitation. Regarding of multi-steps climate prediction, a power law decay of the explained variance was found, indicating long-lasting climate memory effects. The explained variances by climate memory can remain to be higher than 10% for more than 10 time steps. Accordingly, past climate conditions can affect both short (monthly) and long-term (interannual, decadal, or even multidecadal) climate predictions. With the memory part M(t) precisely calculated from Fractional Integral Statistical Model, one only needs to focus on the non-memory part ε(t) , which is an important quantity that determines climate predictive skills. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate predictability; Climate prediction; Fractional integral statistical model; Long-term climate memory","climate conditions; climate prediction; numerical model; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044073885

A comprehensive understanding of the processes and driving forces of the long-term land use dynamics of the TRHR is needed to guide sustainable land resource management and regional ecological conservation strategies. This study examined long-term land change patterns in the TRHR and investigated the driving forces of the change. First, Landsat TM/ETM+ images covering TRHR of four time points from 1987 to 2016 were used to derive land use patterns, and statistical metrics were applied to quantify the spatial and temporal changes. Second, Principal Component Analysis and correlation analysis were employed to analyze environmental and social-economic data to identify the driving forces of land use change. Third, potential influences of the religion of Tibetan Buddhism on land use change were explored using GIS analysis, questionnaire survey and field observation. Results showed that areas of barren land, agricultural land, and built-up land largely increased, while areas of grassland and forest greatly decreased, with the highest change rate occurring in the most recent decade of analysis (from 2007 to 2016). Among the three headwater regions, the Yellow River Headwater Region showed an overall higher changing speed than the other two headwater regions.

China's economy stepped into a status so called ‘New Normal’ in which major change is taking place in terms of growth rate &amp; force, development model, and economic structure. Firstly, an extended Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model was established to study the impact of technological innovation on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions based on Chinese provincial panel data from 1997 to 2015. Secondly, the sample was classified into two groups, namely high-speed growth group and low-speed growth group, and the extended STIRPAT model was used to investigate the impact of technological innovation on CO2 emissions in these two groups. Thirdly, scenario simulations were herein introduced to predict CO2 emissions in 2016–2030 as economy stepped into the ‘New Normal’. Finally, logistic equation was applied to predict CO2 emissions during the period of 2016–2030. It was deduced that in comparison with the high-speed growth group, independent innovation makes a greater contribution on promoting CO2 emissions as the economy keeps a slowly growth rate. Besides, the contribution of introducing innovation on CO2 emissions was proven to be essentially marginal as for the low-speed growth group although it has significant impact effect on reducing CO2 emissions from the high-speed growth group. The prediction indicates new progress on CO2 emissions reduction in the future China will be achieved as appropriate policy on technological innovation is issued by government in the ‘New Normal’ period. © 2019","CO2 emissions; Logistic equation; Prediction; Scenario analysis; Technological innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050213179

In this study, a flexible-possibilistic stochastic programming (FPSP) method is developed for planning municipal-scale energy system (MES) with cost minimization and emission mitigation. FPSP cannot only deal with multiple uncertainties employed to the soft constraints and objective function, but also analyze the individual and interactive effects of uncertain parameters on system cost. The FPSP method is then applied to planning MES of Beijing under considering the impacts of renewable energies and EVs. Solutions in association with different constraint-violation levels, satisfaction degrees and confidence levels have been obtained. Results disclose that introducing EVs to the study MES can effectively mitigate pollutant emissions, and the emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and inhalable particles (PM10) can be reduced 7.9%, 10.8% and 9.1%, respectively. Results also imply that the city's MES can be adjusted towards a cleaner pattern through developing renewable energies and EVs. Findings can provide support for planning energy system through introducing EVs to high-traffic city and offer scientific information to decision makers for mitigating pollutant emissions under multiple uncertainties. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Emission mitigation; Multiple uncertainties; Municipal-scale energy system; Planning; Renewable energies","Decision making; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Planning; Pollution; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Sulfur dioxide; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Emission mitigation; Energy systems; Environmental problems; Multiple uncertainties; Renewable energies; Scientific information; Uncertain parameters; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056199215

Interactions between the actuators and nonlinear behavior of the system make the problem difficult to handle using classical control design methods. Therefore, we propose an offset-free model predictive control system in this paper. It is based on the combined design integrating the disturbance model and the state observer. Furthermore, the method of reduced-order design for H∞ problem is addressed.

However, little work has been able to meaningfully reflect the collaborative way in which provinces are assigned targets on a sub-national regional basis. Suggesting a modified data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach which recognises the two objectives of income maximization and pollution abatement cost minimisation, this paper introduces the potential collaboration between industrial units to the modelling framework. Our theoretical work exposits the roles collectives of industrial decision making units may play in optimising against multiple target functions. Considering the period 2012–2014, we illustrate clearly how China's three regional collaborations interact with the stated aims of national policy. Developed eastern China may take on greater abatement tasks in the short-term, thus freeing central and western China to pursue the economic growth which will then support later abatement. Policy-makers are thus given a tool through which an extra layer of implementation can be evaluated between the national allocation and setting targets for regional individual decision making units. China's case perfectly exemplifies the conflicts which must be accounted for if the most economical and efficient outcomes are to be achieved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon abatement cost; Carbon allocation; Data envelopment analysis; Regional collaboration","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Economic analysis; Regional planning; Carbon abatement; Carbon allocation; Decision making unit; Individual decision making; Modelling framework; National policies; Pollution abatement; Regional collaboration; Cost benefit analysis; abatement cost; biomass allocation; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; decision making; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; national planning; optimization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054924301

Besides providing vehicle access to lower income households, it lowers emissions and reduces vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as well as the number of vehicles registered. Despite these benefits, carsharing systems have been slow to develop in China. Little is known about carsharing demand in China's context, and subsequent system design parameters. This paper explores potential carsharing demand, fleet size, and economic performance in Beijing. To determine these, carsharing mode split is estimated by a stated preference choice modeling exercise. Adequate fleet size is estimated through a Monte Carlo simulation that includes factors such as vehicle types (electric or gasoline vehicle), charger types for electric vehicles (level 2 or level 3 chargers) that influence charging time, arrival rates, travel distance, and travel time based on the time intervals (peak or non-peak hours). In addition, this study estimates the payback period to recover sunk costs. Results indicate that the carsharing mode split ranges from 9% to 32% and an electric vehicle fleet with level 2 chargers is more appropriate for carsharing in Beijing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Economic analysis; Electric automobiles; Intelligent systems; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Demand estimation; Design parameters; Economic performance; Gasoline vehicle; Number of vehicles; Stated preferences; Transportation congestion; Vehicle-miles traveled; Fleet operations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056157107

However little is known about how changing the spatial composition of landuse could improve climate change resilience. Consideration of climate change impacts when spatially allocating landuse could be a useful and fundamental long term adaptation strategy, particularly for regional planning. Here, we identify climate adaptation scenarios based on existing extents of three landuse classes using multi-objective genetic algorithms for a 9982 km 2 region with 3.5 million inhabitants in South Korea. We selected five objectives for adaptation based on predicted climate change impacts and regional economic conditions: minimization of disaster damage and existing landuse conversion, maximization of rice yield, protection of high species richness areas, and economic value. We generated 17 Pareto landuse scenarios by six weighted combinations of the adaptation objectives. Most scenarios, although varying in magnitude, showed better performance than the current spatial landuse composition for all adaptation objectives, suggesting that some alteration of current landuse patterns could increase overall climate resilience. Given the flexible structure of the optimization model, we expect that regional stakeholders could efficiently generate other scenarios by adjusting model parameters (weighting combinations) or replacing input data (impact maps), and selecting a scenario depending on preference or a number of problem-related factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

Calculating energy efficiency fairly is paramount for formulating energy policies, given the different development levels of provinces. This study employed a three-stage data envelopment analysis model that considered environmental constraints to evaluate the energy efficiency of China’s 30 provinces in 2015 and redefined traditional energy efficiency as energy environment efficiency which calculated under environmental constraints. Different factors, such as urban development level and industrial structure in relation to energy environment efficiency, were analyzed. Three main results were obtained. First, the average energy environment efficiency in 2015 was only 0.73, which showed that China has roughly 30% capacity for improvement in the future. Second, stochastic frontier analysis demonstrated that the industrial structure, energy consumption structure, and central heating systems exerted negative impacts, and the level of city design and the degree of openness exerted positive effects on energy environment efficiency. Third, capital, manpower, and the extent of industrial concentration in central and western regions should be increased to improve China’s energy environment efficiency. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","China; Energy environment efficiency; Regional equity; Three-stage DEA model","data envelopment analysis; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; industrial structure; stochasticity; urban development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049596013

As new scheduling algorithms are being developed particularly to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles, there is increased potential for cyber-attacks on TSC that can undermine the benefits of new algorithms. Attackers can learn the behavior of scheduling algorithms and launch attacks to get scheduling priority and/or to create traffic panic and congestion. These attacks can compromise the system and significantly increase traffic delay and make TSC completely ineffective. In this paper, we compare the performance of different backpressure-based scheduling algorithms when they are under attack. We consider four different backpressure-based schemes, namely, delay-based, queue-based, sum-of-delay-based, and hybrid scheme that combines delay-based and queue-based schemes. We consider time spoofing attacks where individual vehicles arriving at an intersection can alter their arrival times. Through detailed simulation analysis we show that while the delay-based scheme has better fairness performance, it is more vulnerable to time spoofing attacks than the other schemes. We explore drawbacks of the delay-based scheme under different scenarios including non-homogeneous arrivals both for isolated intersection as well as multiple intersections. This study throws light on how to prevent time spoofing attacks on next generation TSC. © 2018 IEEE.","Backpressure-based Scheduling; Delay distribution; Fairness; Simulation analysis; Time spoofing attacks; Traffic signal control","Autonomous vehicles; Network security; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Back pressures; Delay distributions; Fairness; Simulation analysis; Spoofing attacks; Traffic signal control; Traffic signals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062487634

Methods and materials: We reviewed the records of 82 patients with inoperable NSCLC treated between 2009 and 2016 with concurrent chemoradiation. All patients received positron emission tomography–based treatment planning, 4-dimensional computed tomography simulation to define an internal target volume, and daily cone beam computed tomography. We quantified variations in target volume margins with a margin deviation index (MDI), calculated as the percentage change in equivalent uniform dose between the original planning target volume (PTV) and a standard reference PTV 10 mm beyond the original gross tumor volume, consistent with the minimum margins mandated by recent NSCLC trials. Greater MDIs equated to smaller effective target volume margins. We dichotomized patients by the upper tercile MDI value (5.8%). Endpoints included time to locoregional progression and time to grade ≥ 3 radiation esophagitis (RE3) or radiation pneumonitis (RP3), modelled with the Fine-Gray method. Results: Median follow-up was 37.8 months (range, 5.9-58.1 months). Larger MDIs correlated with smaller clinical target volume (CTV) + PTV margins, larger gross tumor volumes, later treatment year, and intensity modulated radiation therapy use. The risk of locoregional progression did not differ for MDI ≥5.8% versus <5.8% (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.88; P = .76), but the risk of RE3 or RP3 was decreased for MDI ≥5.8% (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.27; P = .027). Patients with MDI ≥5.8% were treated with smaller CTV + PTV margins (median, 5.6 vs 8 mm; P < .0001) and a marginally lower volume of esophagus receiving ≥50 Gy (median, 31.1% vs 35.3%; P = .069). Conclusions: Smaller margins were used for larger tumors but were not associated with an increase in locoregional failures. Additional studies could clarify whether smaller margins, when used alongside modern radiation therapy techniques, decrease treatment-related toxicity for inoperable NSCLC. © 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology",,"carboplatin; cisplatin; etoposide; paclitaxel; acute toxicity; adult; aged; Article; cancer grading; cancer growth; cancer risk; chemoradiotherapy; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; cone beam computed tomography; controlled study; esophagitis; female; follow up; four dimensional computed tomography; gross tumor volume; human; human tissue; intensity modulated radiation therapy; local recurrence free survival; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; photon therapy; planning target volume; positron emission tomography; priority journal; radiation injury; radiation pneumonia; retrospective study; simulation; tumor volume; adenocarcinoma; chemoradiotherapy; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; esophagitis; image processing; lung tumor; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; prognosis; radiation pneumonia; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; surgical margin; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Chemoradiotherapy; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Esophagitis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Margins of Excision; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prognosis; Radiation Pneumonitis; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Retrospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054124548

Using the “2006 IPCC and the Chinese Guidelines”, the carbon footprint (CF), carbon carrying capacity, carbon deficit and carbon deficit pressure index of Xi'an were measured from 2007 to 2016. Then, the decoupling indicator was used to analyse the dynamic relationship between the urban CF and economic growth using partial least squares to explore the driving factors of CF. The results show that: (1) the CF increased from 23.34 million t CO2eq to 32.25 million t CO2eq, with average annual growth being 4.01%. The energy consumption accounts contributed 69.51%, far exceeding other accounts. (2) The carbon carrying capacity of Xi'an decreased from 7.78 million t CO2eq to 7.45 million t CO2eq, with an average annual reduction of 0.47%. The carbon deficit index fluctuated in the interval [−2.57%, 17.09%], indicating that Xi'an was in the ecological stress relief and the mildly enhanced zone. The total CF and the CF of each account exhibit a relationship of “connecting-decoupling-re-hook-re-decoupling” with economic growth. (3) The most important driver of CF growth is the per capita residential building area, while the urbanization rate restrains the growth of the CF. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon deficit pressure index; Carbon footprint; Decoupling index; Driving factors; Xi'an","Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Least squares approximations; Stress relief; Urban growth; Average annual growth; Decoupling index; Driving factors; Low-carbon development; Partial least square (PLS); Pressure index; Residential building; Xi'an; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056700406

Congestion may increase carbon emissions from road traffic. It is worthwhile to study whether it is possible to achieve the goal of road traffic reduction by controlling congestion; that is, to achieve the equilibrium between traffic congestion and a low-carbon economy. The innovation of this paper is mainly reflected in the innovative topic selection, the introduction of a traffic index, and the establishment of the first traffic congestion and low-carbon economic equilibrium model. First, the relevant calculation method of the traffic index is introduced, and the traffic index is used to quantify the traffic congestion degree. Using the traffic index, GDP, and road passenger traffic volume, a nonlinear regression model of road traffic carbon emissions is constructed. Then, the calculation method of the carbon emission intensity of road traffic in the region is proposed. The equilibrium model of traffic congestion and a low-carbon economy is constructed to look for the degree of road traffic congestion that may occur under the permitted carbon emission intensity. Taking Beijing, where electric vehicles account for less than 3% of the total vehicles, as an example, it is difficult to achieve the equilibrium target between road traffic congestion and a low-carbon economy by alleviating traffic congestion in 2020. If the target of traffic carbon emission reduction in 2020 is adjusted from 40%-45% to 19.7% based on 2005, the equilibrium will be achieved. A negative correlation between road traffic carbon emissions and the reciprocal of the traffic index (1/TI) is found after eliminating the effects of GDP and PTV (road passenger traffic volume). As the traffic index decreases by units, the carbon emission reduction accelerates. The results show that carbon reduction targets cannot be simply allocated to various industries. The results of the research on the degree of the impact of traffic congestion on carbon emissions can be used as a basis for carbon reduction decisions of the traffic sector. The research method of this paper can provide a reference for the study of the equilibrium of traffic congestion and a low-carbon economy in other regions. © 2018 by the author.","Carbon emission reduction; Equilibrium; Low-carbon economy; Multivariate nonlinear regression model; Road traffic carbon emissions; Traffic congestion","carbon emission; Gross Domestic Product; innovation; multivariate analysis; pollution tax; regression analysis; research method; road traffic; traffic congestion; Beijing [China]; China; Peru tomato mosaic virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059528166

Comparison between simulations and measurements in western China showed that the model can capture the key spatial and temporal features of meteorological elements and surface BC concentrations. The modeling framework was then used to quantify the relative contributions of different emission sectors to BC concentrations via sensitivity experiments. Our results show that the residential emission sector presented the largest contribution in western China. The second largest contributor for the highly populated mega-cities (HM) region including Sichuan and Guanzhong basins, and for the remote background (RB) region covering the central part of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), was the industrial sector and the transportation sector, respectively. Power plants and open biomass burning sources played minor roles in the regional BC concentration. The seasonality of BC concentrations showed higher values in winter, mainly due to the residential winter heating under conditions of lower precipitation scavenging and poor boundary layer mixing. A further evaluation of emission control strategies shows that a 50% reduction of residential emissions caused annual mean surface BC concentrations in the RB and HM regions to decrease by 36.2% and 36.7%, respectively. In contrast, a 50% reduction in industrial emissions or transportation emissions led to less than 12% decreases in both regions. The 50% reduction of transportation emissions caused BC concentrations to decrease by 9.2% in the RB region, larger than the 5.9% decrease caused by a 50% reduction of industrial emissions. Transportation emissions were responsible for more BC pollution than industrial emissions for the RB region, in contrast to the highly-industrialized HM region. Therefore, more attention should be paid to transportation emissions when designing control strategies for air pollution over the TP. The results from this work provide useful information for local governments to prepare and implement air pollution guidelines in western China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Control strategies; Emission sources in Asia; Highly populated region; Tibetan Plateau","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Boundary layers; Carbon; Emission control; Housing; Precipitation (meteorology); Black carbon; Control strategies; Emission sources; Highly populated region; Tibetan Plateau; Weather forecasting; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; carbon emission; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; human activity; megacity; pollutant source; residential location; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053558618

Using a mixed method cross-sectional research approach on smallholder farmers in the Bosomtwe district, 152 farmer respondents were sampled from 12 communities by a simple random sampling technique. The quantitative data gathered were subjected to the tools of binary logistic regression analysis, multiple regression analysis, contingency tables and frequencies, embedded in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 17. Farmers’ observations were consistent with meteorological data which revealed that temperature has been increasing since 1981 and rainfall pattern has been erratic. Perception of deforestation (p < 0.05) was a significant and positive predictor of climate change. A binary logistic regression analysis performed on disposition of farmers persistently practicing a particular adaptation strategy indicated that irrigation, mulch, use of agrochemicals and changing the type of crop cultivated were positive and significant at p =.027, p =.000, p =.020 and p =.035, respectively. Policy on adaptation must make room for and capitalize on local knowledge for sustainable climate action. Agroforestry should be introduced to farmers to curb such maladaptive practices of clearing of forests and help sustain forest and agriculture. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Increases in the population and land urbanization levels in China's eastern region would promote SO2 and NOx, but reduce PM2.5; increases in population and land urbanization levels in the central and western regions reduced air pollutants. The population scale and industrialization had a promoting impact on air pollutants; the energy efficiency had a slight inhibitory impact.

However, it is challenging to improve the carbon price forecasting accuracy due to its non-linearity and non-stationary characteristics, especially in multi-step-ahead forecasting. In this paper, a hybrid multi-step-ahead forecasting model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), fast multi-output relevance vector regression (FMRVR), and the multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (MOWOA) is proposed. VMD is employed to extract the primary mode for the carbon price. Then, FMRVR, which is used as the forecasting module, is built on the preprocessed data. To achieve high accuracy and stability, the MOWOA is utilized to optimize the kernel parameter and input the lag of the FMRVR. The proposed hybrid forecasting model is applied to carbon price series from three major regional carbon emission exchanges in China. Results show that the proposed VMD-FMRVR-MOWOA model achieves better performance compared to several other multi-output models in terms of forecasting accuracy and stability. The proposed model can be a potential and effective technique for multi-step-ahead carbon price forecasting in China's three major regional emission exchanges. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon price forecasting; Chinese carbon emission exchange; Fast multi-output relevance vector regression; Multi-objective whale optimization algorithm; Variational mode decomposition","Carbon; Commerce; Forestry; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; Carbon price; Mode decomposition; Multi-output; Optimization algorithms; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060022295

However, with the rapid expansion of the economy, increasingly serious air pollution is apparent. In order to control urban air pollution effectively, Chinese governments at all levels have invested large sums every year. However, it has become a difficult issue which influences public government decisions with respect to how and according to what standard to distribute financial funds so as to improve air quality while saving money at the same time. Taking Beijing as an example, this paper investigates the ten-year change in the annual daily mean of inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the year of 2006 to 2015, researches the invested funds in environmental protection in Beijing, and establishes a relationship between the atmospheric indexes of the above three parameters and government-invested funds in environmental protection. According to model analysis, government financial input has an obvious influence on the improvement of air quality. However, during the long period of financial input, the degree of air quality improvement will reduce gradually as time goes by. There exists a direct link between the effectiveness of government financial input to promote air quality and the air quality index, which means when the pollutant standards index is poor (i.e., the corresponding pollutant concentration is higher), the effectiveness will be more apparent. On the contrary, when the index is at a good level, the effectiveness of government financial input is very small. To achieve the best air quality conditions, the government should set the detailed financial input at or over the first-grade standard according to urban air quality standards. © 2018 by the authors.

In this paper, we estimate the dynamic performance of the total-factor green use efficiency of industrial land (TGUEIL) in China by using a global non-radial directional distance function (GNDDF) and the non-radial Malmquist performance of industrial land green use (NMPILGU). The results show that the TGUEIL had a rising trend in most years during 2006–2015. The eastern region enjoys the greatest TGUEIL, and the gaps in the TGUEIL between regions are narrowing. Technical progress in the industrial sector contributes more to the NMPILGU than efficiency progress. To raise the TGUEIL, we should increase the internal expenditures in R&D activities, the number of effective inventions and R&D staffs in industrial enterprises. We should promote the use of clean energy in industrial production and increase efforts in energy-saving and emission reduction. We should prohibit local governments from selling land to cover the deficit. The government should pay more attention to industrial labor redundancy in eastern China and guide orderly redundant industrial labor force transfer from eastern regions to central and western regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Green use efficiency; Industrial land; Land management; Malmquist productivity index; Non-radial directional distance function (NDDF)","Emission control; China; Directional distance function; Industrial land; Land managements; Malmquist productivity index; Use efficiency; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056160883

There is an increasing consensus about the importance of integrating ES into ecological policy but quantifying the potential impacts of different policy on ES has proven difficult. We designed a remote sensing, geographic information system and scenario analysis-based approach to estimate and analyze the relationship between ES (soil conservation and carbon sequestration) and ecological policy designed to improve human welfare in the Chongqing municipality in the upper reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China; a densely populated, highly modified watershed with serious soil erosion and flood hazard. Three alternative scenarios in 2050 were modeled for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area watershed. The model GEOMOD was used to predict future LULC changes due to policy planning. The ES models (Universal Soil Loss Equation model and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model) were designed to inform decisions, with an aim to align economic forces with conservation. We examine policy effectiveness by comparing scenarios for 2050 (Scenario1: Maintain current policy with no considerations of ES; Scenario2: Integrate ES into policy planning; Scenario3: Integrate ES into policy planning in view of the need of local people). Scenario-based LULC change analysis revealed that if the current afforestation policy continues (scenario 1), total ES would be further increased in 2050 due to expansion of forest cover. However, by targeting policy to improve ES provision (scenarios 2 and 3), ecological risks of soil loss can be significantly reduced and carbon sequestration enhanced. Scenario 3, thus, provided the best future environmental development scenario considering the need of local people in each region for ES. This scenario will theoretically help the Three Gorges Dam to harvest more ecological benefits through improvements in soil conservation and carbon sequestration. This study highlights the observation that including ES in policy planning and has a great potential to generate opportunities to maximize ES. This study highlights that including ES in policy planning has a great potential to generate opportunities to maximize ES. Hence, there is a need to encourage proper implementation of ecological policy to maintain and improve ES. © 2018 by the authors.","Ecological policy; Ecosystem services models; Land use/Land cover; Scenario analysis","afforestation; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental risk; flood damage; forest cover; GIS; integrated approach; land cover; land use; policy implementation; regional policy; soil conservation; soil erosion; watershed; China; Chongqing; Hubei; Three Gorges Dam; Three Gorges Reservoir",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059159101

This paper focuses on modeling of an SCR reactor and developing model-based urea dosing control strategy. A mathematical model of SCR reactors has been established. Model-based control strategy relies on the three-state and one-state reactor models established to accomplish urea dosing algorithm and is promising in limiting excessive NH3 slip. The SCR reactor model is further used in a simulation for the purpose of developing model-based urea dosing control strategies. The simulation results show that the NO sliding mode control requires a massive prestudy of the NOx reduction capability of the catalyst in order to set an appropriate control objective for each operating condition. However, this calibration work can be omitted in the optimal control and NH3 sliding mode control, which mitigates the workload of the controller design.

Since cities are the hubs for innovation regarding new technologies and infrastructures, investments and governance, they are playing an important role in decision-making and implementation processes on the way to a decarbonized economy and society. The national and provincial administrations in China have already started to address the issue of energy system transition toward a low-carbon pathway, but long-term integrated transition plans are not yet available on a regional level. In our paper, we therefore consider the main challenges of the energy system transition, such as efficiency improvement, coal reduction, decarbonization of transport, and multisector electrification with regional integration, focusing on two eastern coastal metropolitan regions of China. A systematic review of current near-term policies reveals how far these challenges have already been addressed on different administrative levels and which gaps may exist from an external perspective.

It is worth verifying the effect of the application of yeast extract to afforestation in a semiarid chestnut soil area. This study was conducted through a wild field afforestation experiment in Inner Mongolia, northern China. We designed an orthogonal experiment of 25 treatments with 30 repetitions on Pinus sylvestris(Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) sand Armeniaca sibirica(Armeniaca sibirica (L.) Lam). Three factors with different levels were considered: application to rhizosphere soil with the amounts of 0 g, 10 g, 20 g, 30 g, and 40 g; foliar spraying with concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%; and spraying at three moments. The results showed that yeast extract could enhance the seedlings of Pinus sylvestris and Armeniaca sibirica. When applying 40 g of yeast extract, the survival rates and root parameters were significantly boosted. Foliar spraying plays an important role in promoting the growth of seedlings. It was most effective for the two species to be sprayed with a concentration of 2% after leafing of the seedlings. The data also revealed that the application of yeast extract improved the properties of the rhizosphere soil. The porosities and moisture contents were increased, and the bulk densities were reduced. Forty grams (40 g) was the best amount to apply, especially for the soil at 20-40 cm where the seedling roots are mainly located.

The model was developed with the use of the General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). It is a bottom-up model coupled with the GIS-based tool making use of the georeferenced datasets describing buildings. These data sets include, among the others, the building boundaries, utility types, location, number of floors. At first, an energy demand for space heating was estimated at the building level. Then, the model solved the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem by taking measures: (i) on the supply side (e.g. fuel and/or technology switch) and (ii) on the demand side (e.g. replacement of windows, improving insulation of the building envelope and the roof). The objective function minimized by the model wasthe total cost of covering heat demand. A number of user-constraints were defined, including, e.g. limitations of emissions of air pollutants, dedicated budget for emissions reduction, priority given to either demand-side or supply-side measures. The applicability of the model was demonstrated in a case-study done for a town in Poland. Several scenarios were considered to show the strategies to decrease emissions and the respective implementation costs. The results showed that emission reduction could be achieved with negative costs due to investments in thermomodernization of energy intensive buildings. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution; Budget control; Decision support systems; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Housing; Integer programming; Sustainable development; Air pollutant emission; Decision support models; Developing strategy; Energy-economic model; Implementation cost; Mixed integer programming (MIP); Objective functions; Residential sectors; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062495025

This unique combination of measurement techniques is used to spectrally compare the DRL in n-type and p-type wafers and to investigate the DRL as a function of block height in a p-type block. Further, the dependence of DRL on interstitial and precipitated metallic impurities has been investigated by comparison of simulated concentration profiles of interstitial and precipitated iron with the spatial distribution of DRL. Our results indicate that the origins of the dislocation-related emission lines (D-lines) are independent of the doping type and suggest that the spectral shape, rather, is determined by the dominating recombination mechanism in the material. In regions with high structural defect density, we observe increased intensities of the D-lines D1-D4 in the DRL spectrum. In regions with a high concentration of either iron or other metallic precipitates, we observe reduced emission intensities of D3 and D4.

Different types and styles of climate leadership and pioneership and how they operate within multi-level and polycentric governance structures are identified and assessed. SDCs seem relatively readily willing to adopt transformational climate pioneership styles to create ‘green’ jobs, for example, in the offshore wind energy sector and with the aim of improving their poor external image. However, in order to sustain transformational climate pioneership they often have to rely on support from ‘higher’ levels of governance.

After determining the optimal distribution ratio and intermittent operation conditions, the dynamics of system inflow, outflow, and nitrogen removal were monitored. Theoretical analysis of the denitrification mechanism was carried out. The results showed that the optimum water distribution ratio was 2: 1, and a mean total nitrogen removal rate of 60.42% was achieved, which is 23.09% greater than that is typically achieved by the single-section ecological system. Under optimum distribution ratio conditions, the system also demonstrated effective removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), allowing the effluent to satisfy China's urban sewage treatment plant level B emission standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; Distribution ratio; Ecological soil system; Two-stage water distribution","Ammonia; Chemical oxygen demand; Denitrification; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Nitrogen removal; Soils; Wastewater treatment; Water distribution systems; Water treatment; Different distributions; Distribution ratio; Intermittent operation; Operating characteristics; Soil systems; Total nitrogen removal; Urban sewage treatment; Water distributions; Sewage treatment plants; ammonia; nitrogen; organic nitrogen; phosphorus; ammonia; chemical oxygen demand; denitrification; efficiency measurement; nitrogen; operations technology; phosphorus; pollutant removal; soil ecosystem; two-dimensional modeling; wastewater; wastewater treatment; Article; carbon source; chemical oxygen demand; denitrification; ecological soil system; ecosystem; nitrogen mineralization; oxidation reduction potential; sedimentation rate; sewage treatment plant; soil depth; waste water management; water supply; chemistry; denitrification; isolation and purification; procedures; sewage; soil; waste water; water management; China; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Soil; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056171219

In this study, CO2 shadow prices are estimated in 29 provinces of China from 2006 to 2015. Directional Environmental Production Frontier Function (DEPFF) measures the distance between actual production points and the effective production frontier surface, which yields the shadow prices of CO2 emission. With the relationship between CO2 emission and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth which is encapsulated in the shadow price, the provinces are classified into three groups: acceleration zone, buffer zone, and deceleration zone. The acceleration zone is characterized by a smaller emission growth driving a greater economic growth, and the provincial average price of CO2 is 184.16 US$/ton. In the buffer zone, a significant emission increase brings about less economic growth with the average shadow price at 86.57 US$/ton. In the deceleration zone, a high growth rate of CO2 emissions is accompanied with an economic output decrease, which implies that the shadow price of CO2 should be negative, and the mean value is -200.7 US$/ton. As the CO2 abatement potential differs significantly across provinces, the environmental policy and CO2 reduction targets should be region-specific. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 shadow price; Directional Environmental Production Frontier Function; Region-specific policies","abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; price determination; shadow pricing; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059991438

(2) A decomposition method is introduced to determine what factors will effect a change in the marginal abatement cost. (3) Marginal abatement cost curves are estimated to allocate the burden of emissions reduction for each province. The empirical results show the following: (1) Marginal abatement costs vary from province to province, and the average marginal abatement cost of China is approximately 1866.61 Yuan/ton. The energy intensity, dependence on foreign trade and industrial structure can significantly influence the carbon marginal abatement cost. (2) The decomposition results reveal that the overall technology advance has a negative effect on marginal abatement costs in most provinces. (3) The total reduction costs and inequality increased with time; hence, carbon emissions reduction targets should be reached as soon as possible. Additionally, areas with medium marginal abatement costs are the primary force for energy conservation and emissions reduction.

However, there exist considerable variations in the association between economic growth and vulnerability, especially at the sub-country scale. Based on climatic hazard impact (indicated by mortality and direct economic losses (DEL)) and economic development data for 31 provinces in the mainland of China from 1990 to 2015, trends of disaster impact, and trends of vulnerability (indicated by mortality rate and DEL rate), were detected using the Mann–Kendall trend test at the provincial level. Next, the relationship between income and vulnerability was characterized. At the provincial level during 1990–2015, there was a clear transformation of the climatic hazard impact landscape from high average annual mortality to high average annual DEL. Both the mortality and the DEL rates presented downward trends for most provinces. The magnitude of vulnerability decrease was higher in the economically developed provinces compared to the underdeveloped provinces, and vulnerability declined nonlinearly with income increase. A vulnerability trap appears to exist approximately below 1600 US$ for income—above this threshold, a province’s vulnerability significantly decreased. Mortality and economic vulnerability to climatic hazards are correlated with economic development, but causal links between economic development and vulnerability reduction need further investigation. Our findings suggest that shortening the transitional period from the low-income trap and reducing inter-provincial disparity of economic development may be powerful tools for reducing vulnerability to climatic hazards, especially for economically underdeveloped regions. These should also be important considerations in developing efficient adaption strategies for climate change. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Climatic hazards; Direct economic loss rate; Economic development; Mortality rate; Socioeconomic vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050955494

The results find the co-existence of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) and the Porter Hypothesis (PH) at an industrial level. PIIs, especially the labor-intensive PIIs, become geographically more dispersed to the peripheral YRD, while capital-, tax- and technology-intensive PIIs are still highly concentrated in the core YRD. Uneven environmental regulations (ERs), such as pollutant emission controls and government supervision, have directly reshaped the spatial patterns of PIIs. The modelling results also suggest that regional differences in factor endowment, ecosystem, and upgrading and innovation milieu play an important role in PIIs (re)distribution, and PIIs with diverse industrial characteristics respond differently to the changes in ERs and other place-specific attributes. Relatively loose ERs, low production cost, and high environmental bearing-capacity can promote the formation of “pollution havens” for labor-intensive or low-end PIIs.

Since 1999, the Grain to Green Program (GTGP) has been implemented in the region. This study aimed to analyze spatial and temporal variations of ecosystem services from 2000 to 2015 to assess the effects of the GTGP, including carbon sequestration, water regulation, soil conservation and sand fixation. During the study period, the area of forest land and grassland significantly expanded, while the area of farmland decreased sharply. Ecosystem services showed an overall improvement with localized deterioration. Carbon sequestration, water regulation and soil conservation increased substantially. Sand fixation showed a decreasing trend mainly because of decreased wind speeds. There were synergies between carbon sequestration and water regulation, and tradeoffs between soil conservation and sand fixation. It was concluded that ecological projects have contributed significantly to the rehabilitation of the fragile ecosystems of this region. To make these projects more successful and sustainable, long-term management procedures are necessary to maintain and consolidate the improvements. © 2019 Wu et al.

Alterations have been made to the shape of the canister, the spacing of the rear wall of the canister with regard to the carbon filter, and the bracketing between (i) the particulate filter and the carbon bed and (ii) the carbon bed and the canister wall. The pressure drops across the canister and the residence time distribution at the rear of the carbon bed have been analyzed in detail based on an extensive parametric analysis involving the aforementioned variations. It has been demonstrated that the non-uniform porosity profile of the carbon bed resulted in alternating regions of high and low velocity close to the canister wall, providing a possible route for breakthrough. Designs, which included a bracket at the rear of the carbon bed, blocked this route and consequently had a longer minimum mean residence time than those, which did not. It has also been shown that the spacing between the carbon bed and the canister rear wall had a large impact on both residence time and pressure drop. In cases where the carbon backed directly onto the canister rear wall flow in the axial direction from the outside wall toward the canister axis resulted in far greater pressure drop and a reduction in minimum mean residence time within the carbon bed. © 2019, © 2019 JOEH, LLC.","Canister geometry; chemical biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) filter; powered air-purifying respirators; Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations","carbon; air filter; chemistry; equipment design; exposure; gas mask; hydrodynamics; prevention and control; theoretical model; Air Filters; Carbon; Equipment Design; Hydrodynamics; Inhalation Exposure; Models, Theoretical; Respiratory Protective Devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060142249

This urban turn in environmental governance has been accompanied by normative claims and high expectations regarding a leading role of cities in coping with climate change. However, while time pressures for effective action are growing, little is known about the social learning processes involved in such urban climate governance innovations, and what they actually contribute to achieve the required transformations in urban systems. Therefore, this special issue presents eight selected papers that explore learning in urban climate governance practices in a variety of local, national and international contexts. Their findings point to a more ambiguous role of these practices as they tend to support incremental adjustments rather than deeper social learning for radical systemic change. Against this backdrop we propose a heuristic distinguishing basic modes and sources in governance learning that aims to facilitate future empirical research and comparison, thus filling a critical theory gap. Using this framework for interpretation illustrates that urban climate governance learning urgently requires more openness, parallel processes, exogenous sources, as well as novel meta-learning practices. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate change; learning; mitigation; Urban governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058848637

It does so by assessing the capacity available to prepare for, initiate and steer a path-deviant sustainability transformation of the urban energy systems in three cities in South Korea–a country facing major challenges in this regard due to a heavy dependence on imported fossil energy resources and centralized institutions. The findings illustrate how synergies between local leadership, empowered communities of practice and trusted intermediation stand out as key drivers for learning transformative governance, in particular if linked to open experimentation, while also shaping the role of international exchange in this. In turn, national policy tends to constrain transformative capacity development and favor incremental modifications. Across all cities studied, major gaps still remain in terms of developing social learning processes that involve systems thinking, sustainability foresight, as well as suitable approaches for embedding more radical innovations. In conclusion, transformative capacity provides a useful lens to understand the potentials and limits of emerging urban governance innovations for unlearning dominant paradigms, and for triggering systemic change that enables more sustainable urban futures. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change mitigation; energy system transformative capacity; social learning; Urban governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052089736

In this context, network characteristics have been introduced which explicitly take spatial information into account. Among others, edge directionality properties have recently gained particular interest. In this work, we investigate the applicability of mean edge direction, anisotropy, and local mean angle as geometric characteristics in complex spherical networks. By studying these measures, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate the existence of a systematic bias in spatial networks where individual nodes represent different shares on a spherical surface, and we describe a strategy for correcting for this effect. Moreover, we illustrate the application of the mentioned edge directionality properties to different examples of real-world spatial networks in spherical geometry (with or without the geometric correction depending on each specific case), including functional climate networks, transportation, and trade networks. In climate networks, our approach highlights relevant patterns, such as large-scale circulation cells, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and the Atlantic Niño. In an air transportation network, we are able to characterize distinct air transportation zones, while we confirm the important role of the European Union for the global economy by identifying convergent edge directionality patterns in the world trade network. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Air transportation; Atmospheric pressure; International trade; Spheres; Air transportation networks; Geometric characteristics; Geometric correction; Large-scale circulation; Network characteristics; Southern oscillation; Spatial informations; Transportation zones; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059841600

Observations indicate that local effects induce a warming in most locations, while many climate models show a global mean cooling when simulating global deforestation. We show that a nonlocal cooling in models, which is excluded from observations, may strongly contribute to these conflicting results. For the MPI-ESM, the globally averaged nonlocal cooling exceeds the globally averaged local warming by a factor of three, for global deforestation but also for realistic areal extents and spatial distributions of deforestation. Furthermore, the globally averaged nonlocal effects dominate the local effects in realistic scenarios across a range of climate models.

The addition of food waste to green waste compost operations is becoming more common, but its effect on GHG emissions is less understood. As more food waste diversion occurs as a result of recent implementation of climate smart policies in California, more information is needed to address the sustainability of composting different combinations of waste types. We monitored GHG emissions from compost windrows comprised of green waste alone and a green/food waste mixture (green waste : food waste = 9:1, by wet weight) at the University of California, Davis Student Farm in 2016 using a modified, open, flow-through chamber technique. When comparing total emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), the green/food waste mixture produced 110 kg CO2 eq./ton DM (dry matter, std error = 12.2), which were slightly lower than emissions produced by the green waste alone (152 kg CO2 eq./ton DM, std error = 15.9).

Smallholder systems heterogeneity requires local specific climate adaptation for reducing the negative impacts of changing climate in regions heavily relying on small farms agriculture. This study examined the trend in climate in Ghana, how smallholder horticultural farmers perceive this changing climate and how they are responding to its perceived effects. A survey of 480 resource-constrained horticultural producers was conducted in two municipalities of Ghana. Descriptive analysis and Weighted Average Index were employed to rank identified adaptation strategies and challenges. The results showed that farmers are already experiencing increasing temperature and declining rainfall patterns consistent with trends of observed climate changing in the last two decades. To reduce vulnerability and improve resilience of smallholders’ production activities, a range of farmer driven soil, water and crop conservation measures and farm management practices are being adopted. The most important adaptation practices identified include fertilization, supplementary irrigation, crop rotation, intercropping and mixed farming. Enhancing households’ climate adaptive capacity is dependent on factors such as improved access to financial resources, climate and production information, market accessibility, farm equipment, storage facilities and other institutional support. To facilitate effective and successful adaptation at the local level, government and institutional support are recommended to complement households’ autonomous strategies for improved decision-making, adaptation plans and actions. © 2018 The Authors","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Climate variability; Ghana; Horticulture; Smallholder farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058621167

We utilized an observational study design to (i) examine the medium-term impact of active management on carbon storage in live and dead vegetation in mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco)–dominated stands in western Oregon, and (ii) provide baseline estimates of total non-soil carbon storage during the mature phase of stand development for this forest type. Stands aged 106–193 years at the time of sampling were selected to represent a gradient in harvest intensity, from passive (reserve-based) management, to low-intensity (commercial thinning) and high-intensity (regeneration harvest with structural retention) active management. Active management treatments were implemented following the onset of maturity in stands with no prior management history, and sampling was conducted an average of 38 years and 22 years following treatment (mean for thinned and retention harvest conditions, respectively). Total non-soil carbon storage was significantly greater in stands managed using a reserve-based approach (mean of 575 Mg C ha−1) than those subject to retention harvest (mean 257 Mg C ha−1) 17 to –34 years previously, but was not different from stands managed over extended rotations with commercial thinning (mean 546 Mg C ha−1). A similar trend was evident for carbon storage in live overstory trees, which were also the dominant component of total non-soil carbon in all management conditions. Dead wood pools varied greatly among stands, but estimates did not indicate any systematic differences in carbon storage in dead wood between management conditions. Our results suggest that shifting from passive management to a high-intensity harvest regime in mature Douglas-fir stands will entail substantial reductions in carbon storage. By contrast, managing stands over extended rotations with light thinning may enable the provision of wood products while maintaining relatively high carbon storage in the forest ecosystem. In absolute terms, mean carbon storage across our full sample of unmanaged, low-intensity and high-intensity harvest conditions exceeded previously reported values from inventories of mature plots across a similarly broad range of site conditions, but remains below the potential upper bounds to carbon storage in Douglas-fir-dominated forests. However, total aboveground carbon stocks in excess of 700 Mg ha−1 in individual mature stands in our dataset implies that, under certain conditions, forest biomass approaches its maximum by the close of the mature phase of stand development in Douglas-fir-dominated forests. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon storage; Douglas-fir; Management; Mature; Retention harvest; Stand development; Thinning","Ecosystems; Harvesting; Management; Reforestation; Soils; Carbon storage; Douglas fir; Mature; Stand development; Thinning; Storage management; carbon sequestration; community structure; coniferous forest; dead wood; deciduous forest; dominance; forest management; harvesting; management practice; overstory; sampling; stand structure; succession; thinning; vegetation dynamics; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Management; Pseudotsuga; Reforestation; Thinning; Oregon; United States; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054610455

Recent efforts to assess the impact of land management on soil functionality proposed that an indicator- or proxy-based approach is a promising alternative to quantify soil functions compared to time- and cost-intensive measurements, particularly when larger regions are targeted. The objective of this review is to identify measurable biotic or abiotic properties that control soil organic carbon (SOC) storage at different spatial scales and could serve as indicators for an efficient quantification of SOC. These indicators should enable both an estimation of actual SOC storage as well as a prediction of the SOC storage potential, which is an important aspect in land use and management planning. There are many environmental conditions that affect SOC storage at different spatial scales. We provide a thorough overview of factors from micro-scales (particles to pedons) to the global scale and discuss their suitability as indicators for SOC storage: clay mineralogy, specific surface area, metal oxides, Ca and Mg cations, microorganisms, soil fauna, aggregation, texture, soil type, natural vegetation, land use and management, topography, parent material and climate. As a result, we propose a set of indicators that allow for time- and cost-efficient estimates of actual and potential SOC storage from the local to the regional and subcontinental scale. As a key element, the fine mineral fraction was identified to determine SOC stabilization in most soils. The quantification of SOC can be further refined by including climatic proxies, particularly elevation, as well as information on land use, soil management and vegetation characteristics. To enhance its indicative power towards land management effects, further “functional soil characteristics” particularly soil structural properties and changes in the soil microbial biomass pool should be included in this indicator system. The proposed system offers the potential to efficiently estimate the SOC storage capacity by means of simplified measures, such as soil fractionation procedures or infrared spectroscopic approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Clay mineralogy; Climate; Land use and management; Metal oxides; Microorganisms; Natural vegetation; Parent material; Soil aggregation; Soil fauna; Soil texture; Soil type; Specific surface area; Topography","Agglomeration; Agronomy; Animals; Clay minerals; Cost benefit analysis; Land use; Microorganisms; Organic carbon; Soils; Specific surface area; Stabilization; Storage (materials); Storage management; Surface topography; Topography; Vegetation; Clay mineralogy; Climate; Land use and managements; Metal oxides; Natural vegetation; Parent materials; Soil aggregation; Soil fauna; Soil textures; Soil types; Soil surveys; carbon sequestration; clay mineral; climate change; environmental conditions; environmental indicator; land management; land use planning; microorganism; organic carbon; oxide; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil fauna; soil texture; soil type; surface area; topography; vegetation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050186899

However, the specific climatic drivers of functional diversity across space and time remain unclear due largely to limitations in the availability of paired trait and climate data. We compile and analyze a global forest dataset using a method based on abundance-weighted trait moments to assess how climate influences the shapes of whole-community trait distributions. Our approach combines abundance-weighted metrics with diverse climate factors to produce a comprehensive catalog of trait–climate relationships that differ dramatically—27% of significant results change in sign and 71% disagree on sign, significance, or both—from traditional species-weighted methods. We find that (i) functional diversity generally declines with increasing latitude and elevation, (ii) temperature variability and vapor pressure are the strongest drivers of geographic shifts in functional composition and ecological strategies, and (iii) functional composition may currently be shifting over time due to rapid climate warming. Our analysis demonstrates that climate strongly governs functional diversity and provides essential information needed to predict how biodiversity and ecosystem function will respond to climate change. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Studies of community samples using a diagnostic interview are lacking, and evaluations of the proposed symptoms, comorbidities, and predictors of IGD are scarce. To provide such information participants in a Norwegian prospective community study were assessed with a clinical interview at age 10 years. Symptoms of other psychiatric disorders were measured with the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment at ages 8 and 10 (n = 740). Children, parents, and teachers provided information on demographics, temperament, intelligence, executive functions, self-concept, social skills, victimization, emotion regulation, family climate, and parenting. Results indicated that IGD was present in 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 0.7–2.7) of the participants (3.0% boys and 0.5% girls). Factor analysis revealed two factors: heavy involvement and negative consequences. The positive predictive value of withdrawal, tolerance, and unsuccessful attempts to control gaming symptoms to the disorder was low. Symptoms of other common disorders correlated weakly with IGD-symptoms (i.e., from r = 0.07 to r = 0.15). Upon adjusting for gender and gaming at age 8, only limited social and emotion regulation skills at age 8 predicted more age-10 IGD symptoms. In conclusion, IGD is already present in a small percentage of Norwegian 10-year olds. At least three of the proposed symptoms -- withdrawal, tolerance and unsuccessful attempts to control gaming -- merit further study given their weak associations with the disorder. Symptoms of IGD are only marginally associated with symptoms of other psychiatric disorders and only predicted by social skills and emotion regulation deficits. © 2018, The Author(s).","Comorbidity; Emotion regulation; Internet gaming disorder; Longitudinal; Social skills","addiction; child; child behavior; comorbidity; female; human; Internet; longitudinal study; male; Norway; self control; social behavior; video game; Behavior, Addictive; Child; Child Behavior; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Internet; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Norway; Self-Control; Social Behavior; Video Games",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045058592

To fill this gap, we have developed a method for testing planned actions to estimate potential impact on targets. The method can be performed at any scale, e.g., at the national, regional, or city level. The approach considers several factors, including the total consumption of an area, region-specific consumption-based environmental hotspots, the decision makers, the reduction targets and related measures, as well as multiple impact types. We present the method using the example of the municipality Gothenburg, Sweden. In collaboration with local authorities in Gothenburg, we co-created scenarios that bundle proposed measures intended to make progress towards their climate target of 3.5 tons carbon dioxide equivalents per capita. We then quantified how measures related to two known environmental hotspots, fuel and electronics, may affect climate change impact levels by the target year of 2035.

We report that nanoporous gold (np-Au) films, with pore sizes ranging from 10 to 30 nm, represent promising electrocatalytic architectures for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their large electrochemically active surface area, relative abundance of grain boundaries, and ability to support pH gradients inside the nanoporous network. Electrochemical studies show that np-Au films support partial current densities for the conversion of CO2 to CO in excess of 6 mA cm-2 at a Faradaic efficiency of ∼99% in aqueous electrolytes (50 mM K2CO3 saturated with CO2). Moreover, np-Au films are able to maintain Faradaic efficiency greater than 80% for CO production over prolonged periods of continuous operation (110 h). Electrocatalytic experiments at different electrolyte concentrations demonstrate that the pore diameter of nanoporous cathodes represents a critical parameter for creating and controlling local pH gradients inside the porous network of metal ligaments. These results demonstrate the merits of nanoporous metal films for the CO2RR and offer an interesting architecture for highly selective electrocatalysis capable of sustaining high catalytic currents over prolonged periods. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","CO2 reduction; Electrocatalysis; Grain boundaries; Nanoporous cathode; PH gradient","Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Cathodes; Efficiency; Electrocatalysis; Electrolytes; Gold; Grain boundaries; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Network architecture; Pollution control; Pore size; Potash; Reduction; CO2 reduction; Electrochemical conversion; Electrochemical studies; Electrochemically active surface areas; Electrolyte concentration; Faradaic efficiencies; Nano-porous; pH gradients; Gold compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064895041

Currently, many studies calculate vehicle emissions from integrating the microscopic traffic simulation model and the vehicle emission model. However, conventionally vehicle emission models are presented as a stand-alone software, requiring a laborious processing of the simulated second-by-second vehicle activity data. This is inefficient, in particular, when multiple runs of vehicle emission calculations are needed. Therefore, an integrated vehicle emission computation system is proposed around a microscopic traffic simulation model. In doing so, the relational database technique is used to store the simulated traffic activity data, and these data are used in emission computation through a built-in emission computation module developed based on the IVE model. In order to ensure the validity of the simulated vehicle activity data, the simulation model is calibrated using the genetic algorithm. The proposed system was implemented for a central urban region of Nanjing city. Hourly vehicle emissions of three types of vehicles were computed using the proposed system for the afternoon peak period, and the results were compared with those computed directly from the IVE software with a trivial difference in the results from the proposed system and the IVE software, indicating the validity of the proposed system. In addition, it was found for the study region that passenger cars are critical for controlling CO, buses are critical for controlling CO and VOC, and trucks are critical for controlling NOx and CO2. Future work is to test the proposed system in more traffic management and control strategies, and more vehicle emission models are to be incorporated in the system. © 2019 Sciendo.

Preoperative evaluation of regional lung function is essential to planning and predicting the outcomes of surgery. The traditional planar approach is inaccurate for lobar contribution since it is not based on anatomy. We developed a novel approach combining single photon emission tomography (SPECT) with CT, offering accurate quantitative characterization of ventilation and perfusion at a lobar level.

This study synthesizes predicted climate change impacts and future biosecurity threats to New Zealand's plantation forests. Projected productivity increases for radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), the main commercial forest species in New Zealand, are slight due to changing climatic conditions. However including photosynthetic effects from increasing CO 2, productivity gains across New Zealand averaged 19 per cent by 2040 and 37 per cent by 2090. This increased productivity results in marked increases in wind risk due to trees becoming taller and more slender. The average season length with 'very high and extreme' climatic fire risk increases by 71 per cent up to 2040 and by 83 per cent up to 2090. Currently, the most significant biotic disturbances in New Zealand plantations come from two needle cast diseases, for which climate projections show slight increases or decreases depending on the disease and region. Although insect pests currently cause little damage to New Zealand plantations, damage may increase in the future with projected increases in population and host susceptibility. It has not been possible to fully account for the effects of any new introductions of pests and pathogens and evidence from other countries with a significant resource of planted forests suggest this should not be underestimated. Potentially invasive weedy and damaging tree species are likely to expand their range under climate change and compete more strongly with plantations. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2018.

In the irrigated systems of developing countries, significant scope exists for increasing water use efficiency through new soil, water and fertiliser management approaches (such as Conservation Agriculture, Direct Seeding, Alternate Wetting and Drying, Site Specific Nutrient Management and Nutrient Expert) and crop diversification. In addition to the development of weather agro-advisory services and weather index insurance, the options available in rain-fed systems differ markedly from those available in irrigated systems, namely, to optimise every drop of available rainfall or to avoid drought stress situations. Whilst breeding for heat tolerance and diversified cropping systems are likely to be the principal short-term responses to increased mean global temperatures and extreme heat events, changes over the longer term are predicted to be quite dramatic, especially with regard to a productive expansion of temperate crops towards the poles. Whilst significant opportunities exist to ameliorate the effects of climate change, these opportunities generally involve risk. In developed countries, the private sector (seed, fertiliser, pesticide, irrigation, credit and insurance suppliers) is generally at hand to advise farmers how to address the challenges posed by climate change. Conversely, in most developing countries, there are few sources of advice and support for smallholder farmers. This situation leaves many smallholder farmers in developing countries without the advice and support that they desperately need. Ultimately, the most vulnerable farmers and communities, namely, smallholder subsistence and market oriented farmers in marginal environments, are those who face the most extreme climate change-related challenges at the same time as being the least able to adapt. Whilst international agricultural research centres (CGIAR), advanced research and development-focused centres of developed countries, and both local and international NGOs strive to both develop and translate evolving crop management approaches; the dissemination of climate smart agricultural practices is extremely slow. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078642140

These values can be used to report the aggregate economic costs of climate change. They can also be used to assess the marginal economic cost of emissions, which can be used in the economic appraisal of new policies or projects. The relevant metric for the latter is the marginal damage cost of a tonne of emissions, known as the social cost of carbon (SCC). Estimating the economic costs of climate change is extremely challenging and while estimates are improving, there remains a wide range. This reflects uncertainties in climate change, impacts, coverage, and choices of decision variables (notably discount rate and equity) on which there is currently no consensus. As a consequence, there is a large range of reported values and alternative approaches are sometimes used as a proxy, notably the use of marginal abatement costs (MAC). These do not estimate damages, and are also uncertain, but they have a role when predefined GHG reduction targets have been set, as they can be used to set values to ensure such targets are achieved cost-effectively. This article summarizes the state-of-knowledge for valuation of GHGs. It also presents a number of case studies to provide practical examples of monetary values and applications of their use in policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This change in the hydrologic cycle is expected to intensify under future climate change. Soil and water conservation professionals responsible for advising farmers and other land managers are on the front lines of adaptation to these climate change impacts. This study uses a survey of Soil and Water Conservation District staff (n = 260) in the United States Upper Midwest to better understand adaptation planning and implementation and the factors influencing adaptations by public organizations. In contrast to a typical planning-implementation gap finding, our respondents report a greater emphasis on some kinds of adaptation actions over planning. We find that the concerns of individual government employees about climate change have a greater association with adaptation planning strategies (e.g., planning document updates) compared to implemented adaptations on-the-ground (e.g., stream buffer installation). Also, weather projections were being used in conjunction with both adaptation planning and implementation. This study contributes to efforts to open up the black box of adaptation decision-making in the public sector, revealing the important role of individual concerns and information use. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change concern; Soil and water conservation; Weather projections","Decision making; Information use; Managers; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil conservation; Soils; Storms; Water conservation; Water quality; Zoning; Adaptation; Adaptation decisions; Climate change impact; Extreme precipitation events; Extreme storm events; Government employees; Soil and water conservation; Water quality problems; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate prediction; conservation management; extreme event; nature-society relations; planning process; precipitation (climatology); runoff; soil conservation; storm; water; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058095849

However, it remains a challenge since few models are capable of providing a reasonably accurate prediction of P losses under manure treatment. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was applied to simulate the impacts on dissolved reactive P (DRP) losses through surface runoff and subsurface drainage from a solid cattle manure-amended corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation on a clay loam soil (Vertisol) located in the Lake Erie region. Simulations of DRP loss in surface runoff and tile drainage were satisfactory; however, EPIC did not consider DRP loss directly from manure, weakening its accuracy in the prediction of DRP loss in surface runoff. Having previously drawn on EPIC-predicted surface runoff to initiate SurPhos (Surface Phosphorus and Runoff Model) predictions of DRP losses strictly in surface runoff, no comparison had been made of differences in manure application impacts on EPIC- or SurPhos-predicted DRP losses-accordingly, this was assessed. The SurPhos improved the estimation of DRP loss in surface runoff (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, 0.53), especially when large rain events occurred immediately after or within 6 wk of manure application. Generally, EPIC can capture the impacts of manure application on DRP loss in surface runoff and subsurface drainage; however, coupling of the EPIC and SurPhos models increased the accuracy of simulation of runoff DRP losses.

Thus, this paper studied the contribution of non-fossil fuel power generation to CO2 emission reduction from electricity sector for 30 provinces over the period 1991–2015. The empirical results of panel quintile regression model show that, a 1% increase of non-fossil fuel power generation share can generally reduce electricity-related CO2 emissions by over 2%, however, those effects appear heterogeneous among quantiles from low to high. Moreover, comparing the two sub-samples, i.e., the pre-reform period (1991–2002) and post-reform period (2003–2015), the separate estimates indicate the emission reduction effects of non-fossil fuel power generation are more obvious even for each corresponding quantile in the post-reform period, implying the essentiality of market-oriented and clean-oriented power reform. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission reduction; Non-fossil power; Panel quintile model; Power mix","Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Gas emissions; Regression analysis; CO2 emission reduction; Electricity sector; Emerging countries; Emission reduction; Environmental problems; Non-fossil fuels; Non-fossil power; Regression model; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056202311

Existing researches have focused on estimating national CO2 emissions efficiency, but have ignored the industrial heterogeneity in the region or explanation for inefficiency. To fill the gaps, this paper applies a metafrontier-Malmquist index analysis method combined with a three-level common frontier model to comprehensively estimate and decompose the carbon emissions efficiency and dynamic changes of China's industries and regions during 2010–2015. First, we use data envelopment analysis with directional distance function by considering three-level frontiers to calculate CO2 emissions efficiency. Results show that China's overall CO2 emissions efficiency is at the middle level with an average value of 0.511. The efficiency of CO2 emissions in the eastern region is the highest, followed by the central and western regions, and the CO2 emissions efficiency in the tertiary industries is greater than that in the primary and secondary industries. Second, we decompose CO2 emissions efficiency into technological, industrial and management efficiency, and found that management efficiency is the main reason for low CO2 emissions efficiency in developed regions and industries. Third, the Malmquist-Luenberger index is utilized to decompose CO2 emissions efficiency into 9 items, and we obtained that continuous technological progress is the leading cause driving different degrees of improvement in CO2 emissions efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon policy; CO2 emissions efficiency; Three-level common frontier model","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Renewable energy resources; Carbon emissions; Carbon policy; CO2 emissions; Directional distance function; Malmquist-Luenberger indices; Management efficiency; Technological progress; Three-level; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055976188

This study investigates the long-term changes in human-perceived temperatures (e.g., summer heat stress and winter wind chill conditions) over South China and quantifies the possible effects of urbanization. Daily observations at 86 stations during the period of 1961–2014 are collected and analyzed. Analysis results show that heat stress and wind chill temperature increase faster than air temperatures (i.e., daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures), and these increases are stronger in winter than in summer. The probabilities of hot extremes increase throughout the study period, whereas those of cold extremes decrease. Compared with those in non-urban areas, the warming trend in both seasons and the increase (decrease) in hot (cold) extremes are even more substantial in highly developed urban areas, such as the Pearl River Delta, indicating a remarkable effect of urbanization. It is estimated that urbanization contributes as much as half of the warming trend in summer and around one-third of the trend in winter. These results are helpful for mitigating climate change and reducing the impacts of extreme events. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Heat stress; Human-perceived temperature; Long-term trend; Urbanization effect; Wind chill","Atmospheric temperature; Thermal stress; Heat stress; Long term change; Long-term trend; Minimum temperatures; Pearl River delta; Perceived temperature; Temperature increase; Urbanization effect; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; heat wave; long-term change; seasonal variation; temperature effect; trend analysis; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053148846

In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and N-doped rGO were synthesized by a facile approach via microwave reduction with a low energy input and short reaction time. The activities of the derived carbocatalysts were evaluated by catalytic ozonation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). Compared with thermally annealed rGOs in argon atmosphere, microwave treated rGO demonstrated a better performance in catalytic oxidation, and N-doping would further improve the catalytic activity. It is discovered that microwave irradiation not only gave rise to more edging sites and dangling bonds in rGO, making higher catalytic potentials for ozone decomposition than that from thermal annealing, but also resulted in a higher concentration of N dopants. XPS studies revealed that more graphitic N species were incorporated into the carbon basal plane during the microwave reduction processes. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 4-NP oxidation were evaluated and identified by liquid-phase electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical scavenging tests, which indicated the generation of O2[rad]−, [rad]OH and 1O2 for 4-NP degradation.

In this paper, the carbon emission abatement index (CACI) consisting of equal weighted efficiency and equity indexes is employed to figure out the allocation of carbon emission mitigation quotient when the inclination and capacity in each province are all taken into consideration. Then, the novel spatial panel data model combined with economic weight matrix is used to estimate the spatial dependence of the carbon emission reduction potential at the provincial level. Moreover, the driving forces are examined. The result suggests that the provinces with low marginal cost and per capita carbon emissions should take on more burdens regarding carbon emission reduction (e.g. Ningxia, Shanghai, Shanxi, Qinghai and Tianjin), while the provinces with low economic development and carbon intensity can be allocated relatively less loads (e.g. Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Anhui and Hunan). Furthermore, the capacity of carbon emission mitigation is negatively affected by urbanization and positively affected by per capita GDP, population density and energy intensity. The coefficients of economic development and energy utilization efficiency are also statistically significant, and indicates mutual effects among regions. © 2019","Carbon emission abatement capacity index; Provincial level; SDM model; Spatial analysis; Spillover effects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048879096

In particular, it explores the current and potential issues in climate adaptation planning through in-depth investigation of four cases, namely Highways England, Network Rail, Transport for London and Environment Agency (London), and Devon County Council. Although considerable adaptation measures and actions have been implemented at both the national and regional levels in the last decade, the road and rail systems in the United Kingdom still confront diverse challenges. These include, but are not limited to, insufficient scientific data, aging infrastructure, unclear planning horizon, and unspecialized climate risk management. A combined analysis of the relevant literature, local reports, news, and interviews with domain transport experts offers a broad view of adaptation planning in UK roads and railways and valuable insights for creating an integrated inland transport adaptation system. An analysis of road and rail adaptation measures to climate change not only benefits both sectors by cross-reference but also generates new adaptation solutions in terms of using one system to enhance the resilience of the other when climate risks occur. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Drought risk assessments are necessary to provide support for local governments. This study aimed to establish an integrated drought risk model based on the relation curve of drought joint probabilities and drought losses of multi-hazard-affected bodies. First, drought characteristics, including duration and severity, were classified using the 1953–2010 precipitation anomaly in the Taoerhe Basin based on run theory, and their marginal distributions were identified by exponential and Gamma distributions, respectively. Then, drought duration and severity were related to construct a joint probability distribution based on the copula function. We used the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model to simulate maize yield and historical data to calculate the loss rates of agriculture, industry, and animal husbandry in the study area. Next, we constructed vulnerability curves. Finally, the spatial distributions of drought risk for 10-, 20-, and 50-year return periods were expressed using inverse distance weighting. Our results indicate that the spatial distributions of the three return periods are consistent. The highest drought risk is in Ulanhot, and the duration and severity there were both highest. This means that higher drought risk corresponds to longer drought duration and larger drought severity, thus providing useful information for drought and water resource management. For 10-, 20-, and 50-year return periods, the drought risk values ranged from 0.41 to 0.53, 0.45 to 0.59, and 0.50 to 0.67, respectively. Therefore, when the return period increases, the drought risk increases. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate modeling; crop yield; drought; hazard assessment; integrated approach; maize; probability; regional climate; return period; risk assessment; weather forecasting; yield response; China; Taoer Basin; Animalia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041555591

The potential reductions of energy and CO2 emission are estimated from agglomerated city perspectives. The global meta-frontier non-radial direction distance function is used to conduct an empirical analysis of agglomerated cities among Eastern, Central China and South Korea. The results show the potential reduction of 7.58 billion tons of CO2 emissions in Korea and another potential reduction of 1930.62 toe energy for the research period in China, if Korea and China proactively collaborate with each other. The empirical results conclude several unique findings and their implications. First, there are significant differences between the Chinese and Korean cities, in energy efficiency, CO2 emission performance, and meta-technology gaps. Korean cities play a leading role at benchmarking efficiency level with meta-frontier technology. Second, there is no significant difference between total-factor and single-factor performance indexes in the Korean cities, because South Korea requires large capital stocks to replace energy in the production process. However, the opposite is true for Eastern and Central China cities. Finally, there is huge potential for the Chinese cities to reduce energy and CO2 emissions by ""catching up"" internally as well as by the collaborative efforts with Korean cities. © 2019 by the authors.","Benchmark; CO2 emission performance; Energy efficiency; Global meta-frontier non-radial direction distance function; Potential CO2 emission and energy reduction","agglomeration; benchmarking; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; emission control; empirical analysis; energy; energy efficiency; numerical method; technology; China; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060115691

The outcomes also confirm that these factors affect the intensity of pollutant emissions in neighboring regions through social, economic, and spatial networks. Agglomeration has a negative spillover effect on the intensity of pollutant emissions in surrounding cities via social and spatial networks, while environmental regulations affect pollutant emissions intensity in related cities through social networks. Technology can effectively lower pollutant emissions through economic networks.

We combined a spatial survey of surface sediments with sediment core analyses to quantify the limnological changes over the last two centuries for an oligo-mesotrophic lake, which was dammed in 1957 and reinforced during 1987–1990, respectively. A water depth inference model constructed from surface sediment clay components was applied to a well-dated sediment core for water level reconstruction. The inferred water depth increased from 6.2 ± 0.9 m to 8.7 ± 1.7 m after dam construction and further to 13.6 ± 2.6 m after dam enforcement, resulting in an increase in the magnitude of water level fluctuation (WLF). Accordingly, bulk sediment C/N ratio and median grain size spiked in ∼1957 and ∼1990, respectively, reflecting a large input of terrestrial sources due to impoundment. With a consistent loss of littoral zone and benthic diatoms over time, a significant decrease in C/N ratio and an abrupt depletion of carbon isotopic signal suggested a shift of carbon transfer towards a pelagic pathway after ∼1990. While there was a significant increase in algal production since ∼1990, the accumulation rate of carbon and nitrogen burial displayed an accelerating drop since ∼1957, reflecting a diluting effect derived from expanding water storage. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in both the ratio between inorganic and organic carbon fluxes and sediment burial of inorganic carbon, reflecting enhanced degradation and low storage of aquatic organic carbon in stratified deep waters since ∼1990. Hydro-morphological variables were found to exert strong impact on diatom communities, with an increasing interplay with nutrient and climate variables over time. While there existed a significant shift of diatom composition in ∼1960, species richness and community dissimilarity showed a significant decrease when water depth was raised to above ∼10 m or the magnitude of WFL was above ∼2 m. Thus, our sediment surveys provide evidence on the significant impact of lake regulation on hydro-morphology, carbon burial and ecological shift over time, as well as its stronger interaction with other forcing with increased impoundment intensity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Algae; Carbon burial; Lake impoundment; Paleolimnology; Water level fluctuation","Algae; Ecology; Lakes; Paleolimnology; Surficial sediments; Surveys; Water levels; Carbon and nitrogen; Community dissimilarities; Ecological impacts; Hydrological controls; Limnological change; Organic carbon fluxes; Sediment core analysis; Water-level fluctuation; Organic carbon; carbon; nitrogen; organic carbon; water; carbon; accumulation rate; carbon cycle; carbon flux; dam construction; diatom; diatomite; ecological impact; grain size; hydrological change; impoundment; intertidal environment; lacustrine environment; organic carbon; paleolimnology; sediment core; species richness; succession; surficial sediment; temporal analysis; water depth; water level; water storage; algal community; Article; bioaccumulation; carbon cycling; China; climate; dam (barrier); degradation; diatom; hydrology; impoundment intensity; investigative procedures; lake; lake sediment; littoral; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; paleolimnology; particle size; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; sea surface waters; sedimentation rate; signal processing; spatiotemporal analysis; species richness; storage; water and water related phenomena; water depth; water level fluctuation; water supply; carbon cycle; hydrology; sediment; China; algae; Bacillariophyta; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; China; Geologic Sediments; Hydrology; Lakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055272288

The study results showed that the temporal changing of PM2.5 in the 13 cities showed well correlation at the haze beginning, maintenance, and ending period due to the similar 500 hPa circulation and surface sea level pressure pattern. The increasing of surface relative humidity (RH) and temperature preceded PM2.5 accumulation when haze began. RH usually reached up to 90–95% during the period of PM2.5 peak, suggesting the possible contribution of high humidity to extreme PM2.5 values. In contrast to the similar circulation of upper air and surface pressure pattern, the divergences of local PBL meteorology, especially their vertical structure, were very obvious, which was the major meteorology cause for the different PM2.5 levels in these cities. The temperature rise at 850 hPa layer was higher than that at 925 hPa, which was higher than that at 1000 hPa, leading to the formation of temperature inversion. This was the most important trigger factor for haze. PM2.5 maximum generally occurred within 12 h after the formation of the strongest inversion in each city. PM2.5 levels in the 13 cities strongly depend on their reverse intensity: for the cities where the inversion was strong and long lasting, its PM2.5 was often the highest. Stable inversions are more likely to form in the transitional area from the northwestern mountains to the southeastern plains because of the mountain's blocking of cold air and the warming of boundary layer by sinking airflow from the mountaintop. This is the major meteorology cause for the frequent occurrence of the extreme PM2.5 levels in middle-south plain of Hebei province. This study reminds us that local boundary layer and inversion conditions, closely related with geographical location and local topography, contributes greatly to local PM2.5 levels and should be fully considered in the emission reduction and industrial layout policy by government. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Central-east China; Planetary boundary layer; PM2.5; RH; Temperature inversion","Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Emission control; Rhodium; Sea level; Topography; East China; Geographical locations; Inversion conditions; Planetary boundary layers; PM2.5; Temperature inversions; Urban agglomerations; Vertical structures; Boundary layers; boundary layer; cold air; concentration (composition); emission control; geographical region; haze; local government; meteorology; mountain region; particulate matter; pollution policy; relative humidity; sea level pressure; suspended particulate matter; temperature inversion; temporal variation; urban area; air pressure; air temperature; Article; boundary layer; China; city; cold air; environmental protection; haze; humidity; meteorology; particulate matter; pollution; priority journal; sea level; seashore; surface property; thickness; visibility; warming; wind speed; China; Hebei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055880778

In this study, we explore the characteristics of CO2 emissions from commuter travel in Beijing from different perspectives. A bottom-up approach from a macro perspective is used to analyze recent changing trends of carbon emissions due to commuter travel modes in Beijing, and to identify the main sources of carbon emission increases that affect transportation. To identify CO2 emission characteristics and influencing mechanisms in Beijing, the proportion of commuting modes, commuting distance, and commuting-related CO2 emissions by Ring Roads was analyzed. The commuting-related CO2 emission model, based on Tobit models from the microscopic perspective, was constructed to explore the main factors affecting CO2 emissions of individuals/households. Results show that CO2 emissions due to commuting in Beijing in recent years has presented an increasing trend. In 2014, the amount of CO2 emissions from commuters had already reached the level of 553.68 × 104 t, with CO2 emissions generated by car trips accounting for 75-80% of emissions. Average individual/household commuting-related CO2 emissions on the Ring Road inside the main urban areas of Beijing shows a gradual increasing trend, with the growth trends between the 3rd-5th Ring Road being the largest. Household locations separated by Ring Roads and the occupation type of residents are important factors affecting CO2 emissions. Commuters with access to a car, those having a higher income, and those located in the outer regions of the main urban areas produce more CO2 emissions. To reduce the increasing trend of CO2 emissions in Beijing, it is important that the government accelerates the development of public transport, industry, and residential facilities along the outskirts of the city, along the Ring Road, and along the radix road. © 2019 by the authors.","Beijing; Commuting CO2 emission; Commuting modes; Commuting time; Human travel","bottom-up approach; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; commuting; occupation; public transport; travel time; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059973163

With the improvement of living standards, residential consumption have become an important contributor to regional carbon emissions. Using an input-output model, we calculated direct and indirect carbon emissions from both urban and rural residential consumption in the BTH region from 2002 to 2012, and then explored the main factors contributing to indirect carbon emissions from residential consumption using a structural decomposition analysis. Results showed that direct carbon emissions from residential consumption increased from 47.13 million tons (MtC) in 2002 to 123.34 MtC in 2012 and indirect carbon emissions from residential consumption increased from 210.36 MtC in 2002 to 550.00 MtC in 2012. Carbon emission intensity and residential consumption level were the main factors affecting indirect carbon emissions during 2002–2012, with varying effects in different sub-regions. Carbon emission intensity played negative effects in Beijing (−37.19 MtC) and Tianjin (−55.39 MtC), positive effects in Hebei (92.89 MtC). Residential consumption level played positive effects in the three sub-regions (79.94 MtC in Beijing, 31.91 MtC in Tianjin and 155.52 MtC in Hebei). Increases in intermediate demand, residential consumption level and population size enhanced indirect carbon emissions.

Igneous rocks are alkaline to calc-alkaline, and chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) plots show enrichment in REEs that is consistent with other regional Laramide igneous rocks. Five assemblages of weak to moderate intensity phyllic alteration with distinct paragenetic relationships exist at the deposit and are classified as: early phyllic, quartz-sericite-pyrite (QSP), sericite-quartz, sericite-carbonate and late QSP. Carbonate is common and is part of some phyllic and the potassic alteration assemblages. Carbonates and phyllosilicates were analyzed by electron microprobe. White micas show substantial substitution of Al by Fe and Mg, and secondary biotite is Mg-rich. Relative to other porphyry Cu systems, the micas from Copper Flat contain, on average, greater F. Carbonates from veins and the replacement of mafic silicates and feldspars were determined to be mostly calcite, but reduced metal carbonates such as ankerite and rhodochrosite are also present in the alteration assemblages. The fluid(s) responsible for alteration are inferred to be CO2-rich and pH neutral as interpreted from the widespread presence of carbonates in both the potassic and phyllic alteration zones, and the white mica composition. Carbonate mineral compositions and absence of sulfates in the potassic alteration suggest that the hydrothermal fluids were not highly oxidized and were sulfur-poor. These features of alteration and geochemistry at Copper Flat are atypical of most porphyry Cu-Mo deposits in the southwestern U.S. and may be more characteristic of porphyry Cu-Au and porphyry Mo deposits. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonate; Copper Flat; Electron microprobe; New Mexico; Phengite; Phyllic alteration","Alkalinity; Binary alloys; Calcite; Carbonates; Carbonation; Copper; Copper alloys; Deposits; Electron probe microanalysis; Exploratory geochemistry; Feldspar; Gold alloys; Gold deposits; Igneous rocks; Mica; Molybdenum deposits; Pyrites; Quartz; Rare earths; Silicate minerals; Sulfur compounds; Electron microprobes; Hydrothermal fluids; Hydrothermal system; Mineral composition; New Mexico; Phengite; Phyllic alteration; Porphyry cu-mo deposits; Copper deposits; carbonate; copper; electron probe analysis; enrichment; fluid composition; geochemistry; hydrothermal alteration; hydrothermal system; ore deposit; phengite; rare earth element; New Mexico; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056863702

In addition to the better environmental performance, miscanthus can be grown on marginal land where no competition with feed and food crops is anticipated. On marginal land however, biomass yields are significantly lower than on good agricultural land. This raises the question of the economic and environmental sustainability of miscanthus cultivated on marginal land for biogas production. This study assessed the environmental and economic performance of miscanthus cultivated on marginal land for biogas production by conducting a Life-Cycle Assessment and complementary Life-Cycle Cost analysis. The functional unit chosen was 1 GJ of electricity (GJ el. ). The substitution of a fossil reference was included using a system expansion approach. Electricity generated by the combustion of miscanthus-based biogas in a combined heat and power has considerably lower impacts on the environment than the fossil reference in most of the categories assessed. In the impact category “climate change”, the substitution of the marginal German electricity mix leads to a carbon mitigation potential of 256 kg CO 2 e/GJ el. . At 45.12 €/GJ el. , the costs of miscanthus-based biogas generation and utilization are considerably lower than those of maize (61.30 €/GJ el. ). The results of this study clearly show that it can make economic and environmental sense to cultivate miscanthus on marginal land as a substrate for biogas production. The economic sustainability is however limited by the biomass yield. By contrast, there are no clear thresholds limiting the environmental performance. The decision needs to be made on a case-by-case basis depending on site-specific conditions such as local biodiversity. © 2018 The Authors.

Vascular plant carbon may encounter multiple potential intermediate storage pools and transport trajectories, and the age of vascular plant carbon accumulating in marine sediments will reflect these different pre-depositional histories. Here, we examine down-core 14C profiles of higher plant leaf wax-derived fatty acids isolated from high fidelity sedimentary sequences spanning the so-called “bomb-spike” and encompassing a ca. 60-degree latitudinal gradient from tropical (Cariaco Basin), temperate (Saanich Inlet), and polar (Mackenzie Delta) watersheds to constrain integrated vascular plant carbon storage/transport times (“residence times”). Using a modeling framework, we find that, in addition to a “young” (conditionally defined as &lt; 50 y) carbon pool, an old pool of compounds comprises 49 to 78 % of the fractional contribution of organic carbon (OC) and exhibits variable ages reflective of the environmental setting. For the Mackenzie Delta sediments, we find a mean age of the old pool of 28 ky (±9.4, standard deviation), indicating extensive pre-aging in permafrost soils, whereas the old pools in Saanich Inlet and Cariaco Basin sediments are younger, 7.9 (±5.0) and 2.4 (±0.50) to 3.2 (±0.54) ky, respectively, indicating less protracted storage in terrestrial reservoirs. The “young” pool showed clear annual contributions for Saanich Inlet and Mackenzie Delta sediments (comprising 24% and 16% of this pool, respectively), likely reflecting episodic transport of OC from steep hillside slopes surrounding Saanich Inlet and annual spring flood deposition in the Mackenzie Delta, respectively. Contributions of 5–10 year old OC to the Cariaco Basin show a short delay of OC inflow, potentially related to transport time to the offshore basin. Modeling results also indicate that the Mackenzie Delta has an influx of young but decadal material (20–30 years of age), pointing to the presence of an intermediate reservoir. Overall, these results show that a significant fraction of vascular plant C undergoes pre-aging in terrestrial reservoirs prior to accumulation in deltaic and marine sediments. The age distribution, reflecting both storage and transport times, likely depends on landscape-specific factors such as local topography, hydrographic characteristics, and mean annual temperature of the catchment, all of which affect the degree of soil buildup and preservation. We show that catchment-specific carbon residence times across landscapes can vary by an order of magnitude, with important implications both for carbon cycle studies and for the interpretation of molecular terrestrial paleoclimate records preserved in sedimentary sequences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Leaf waxes; Organic matter; Radiocarbon; Residence time; Sediment; Terrestrial carbon","carbon sequestration; deltaic deposit; fatty acid; leaf; marine sediment; organic carbon; organic matter; residence time; vascular plant; watershed; wax; Atlantic Ocean; British Columbia; Canada; Cariaco Basin; Caribbean Sea; Mackenzie Delta; Northwest Territories; Saanich Inlet; Embryophyta; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055734999

The relationship of the adverse effects obtained, against cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) and Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence (Microtox) assays with the physicochemical characteristics, the heavy metal concentration levels of rainwater samples and the meteorological parameters governing the climatic conditions in each region, were studied in detail. All samples showed pH values in the range of 5.37–7.17, high concentrations of ΝΗ4 + and the presence of SO4 2− and NO3 −. The metals Al, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sb, Cd, were detected in most of the samples, with maximum concentrations ranging from 0.16 μg L−1 (for Co) to 86.6 μg L−1 (for Fe). The CBMN assay showed statistically significant rainwater cytotoxic activity at 5% (v/v) concentration in all cities during all months studied and at 10% (v/v) in Agrinion and Corfu in May. No genotoxic effect was induced at 5% (v/v) concentration of rainwater, except for Corfu city during November, whereas 10% (v/v) of rainwater led to statistically significant increase in micronuclei frequencies in all three cities. The highest (100%) and the lowest (14%) inhibitory effect exhibited by the rainwater in the Vibrio test were noticed at Corfu city during May and December, respectively. Considering the inter-relations obtained among the abiotic and biotic variables measured in all cases, conductivity, SO4 2−, NH4 +, and total metal burden could be related with both CBMN and Microtox assays data, regardless of the site- and month-specific differences. The multidisciplinary approach presented here showed that the physicochemical profile of rainwater precipitation could be significantly related with the induction of adverse effects on biota. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anions; CBMN assay; Heavy metals; Rainwater; Vibrio fischeri","Cytotoxicity; Heavy metals; Negative ions; Heavy metal concentration; Maximum concentrations; Meteorological parameters; Multi-disciplinary approach; Physico-chemical profiles; Physicochemical characteristics; Rainwater; Vibrio fischeri; Assays; aluminum; ammonia; antimony; arsenic; cadmium; cobalt; copper; iron; nickel; nitrate; rain; sulfate; zinc; assessment method; bacterium; bioassay; concentration (composition); heavy metal; ion exchange; precipitation intensity; rainwater; toxicity; Aliivibrio fischeri; Article; assay; bioassay; bioluminescence; case study; concentration (parameters); conductance; controlled study; cytokinesis block micronucleus assay; cytotoxicity; environmental impact assessment; genotoxicity; geographic distribution; Greece; lymphocyte culture; Microtox assay; nonhuman; pH measurement; physical chemistry; precipitation; priority journal; seasonal variation; water quality; water sampling; Greece; Western Greece; Vibrio; Vibrio fischeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052085784

Summer sea ice extent has declined by 45% over the last three decades, allowing increased shipping activity. Arctic glaciers have lost their protective cap of perennial ice and are melting at accelerated rates, permafrost is thawing rapidly, northern coastlines are exposed to increased wave action and erosion, and there are pronounced effects on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Indigenous communities are facing difficult challenges to maintain their traditional lifestyles, and built infrastructure is vulnerable to damage from flooding and permafrost collapse. Climate-induced changes in the North will increasingly affect biodiversity, sea level, weather patterns and Earth’s energy and carbon balance, with policy implications at all scales, from local decision-making to global actions. Adaptation policies require attention to strengthening resilience, and to preparing for the extreme changes that lie ahead. Conservation policies are now more important than ever, including protected wilderness areas and “last ice” refuges. Climate projections show that reduced greenhouse gas emissions and thereby less warming can make a huge difference in reducing ice loss, permafrost carbon release, and the risks to northern infrastructure, and that collective mitigation policies and action are urgently required to avoid devastating impacts on northern environments and all of humanity. Research and knowledge exchange (including Indigenous Knowledge) are vitally important to understand and plan for the future state of the Arctic, and to provide the foundation for informed decisions. © The Author(s) 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085326294

Using case studies specific to coastal communities in the Pacific island nations and elsewhere, we demonstrate that adaptation policies and strategies that take into account of communities’ own knowledge, and build on the dynamics embedded in their social systems are likelier to succeed. Traditional knowledge is a part of many policy processes, including under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Pacific Regional Ocean Policy, and has a role in assisting coastal communities in Pacific Island countries in responding to the impacts of climate change through the development of adaptation strategies and the maintenance of cultural integrity. It is not yet known whether traditional knowledge itself could adapt and keep pace with the forecasted rapid changes, including in the events of displacement and migration. Ultimately, we emphasize the importance of co-creation of knowledge, recognizing the value of both scientific and traditional knowledge equally, as the future policy direction for Pacific Islands. In doing so, we acknowledge that the relationship between island nations and their marine environment is deeply cultural, and goes beyond viewing the ocean as simply a source of food and other services. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Background data: LJSGH is a recently described rare disease with controversial treatment results. As of today, 13 publications report surgical treatment approaches. The use of CO2 laser and cryotherapy was reported only in one study. The use of PDT was not previously reported. Patients and methods: A 9-year-old male patient was referred to our institution with the chief complaint of asymptomatic ""inflamed gingiva"" starting 1 year before. Clinical examination revealed an erythematous line accompanying the gingival contour, with a certain degree of hyperplasia. The diagnosis of LJSGH was performed based on clinical features and later confirmed histopathologically. A novel approach using PDT was then proposed. The photosensitizer was methylene blue, and a semiconductor laser diode was used. Results: One week after starting PDT, gingival hyperplasia was partially reduced. Immediately after the end of treatment, a significant reduction of gingival hyperplasia was observed. PDT proved to be safe, quick and painless, with no esthetic harm. Conclusions: This case illustrates the benefit of a more conservative approach as opposed to surgical procedure, with good clinical response and decreased morbidity over a 2-year follow-up period.","Juvenile Spongiotic Gingivitis Hyperplasia; low-level laser therapy; photodynamic therapy","methylene blue; photosensitizing agent; case report; child; diode laser; gingiva hyperplasia; human; male; photochemotherapy; procedures; Child; Gingival Hyperplasia; Humans; Lasers, Semiconductor; Male; Methylene Blue; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065639563

Singapore is an island country which has limited potential towards various renewable options. On the UN's request to submit the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) against carbon emissions, Singapore, as a promoter of efficient energy, has come up with an elaborate Climate Action Plan towards carbon emission reduction. Solar PV is the most promising renewable energy option for the country. An aspiring leap towards 350MWp PV capacity by 2020 is on trial, which would involve numerous PV installation projects. The project on installing PV with Energy Storage System (ESS) in Jurong Port (JP) distribution grid is one of them. This paper proposes a 3.3MWp PV installation in the low voltage side of the JP distribution grid by providing comprehensive steady-state analyses in different loading scenarios. Comparison among different configurations of PV and ESS is done and it is found that the PV could reduce line congestions and circumvent substantial transmission losses. Also, during light loading, it sends surplus power back to the grid. © 2018 IEEE.","Energy Storage System (ESS); Jurong Port; Load Flow Study; Solar Photovoltaic (PV)","Carbon; Electric load flow; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy storage; Carbon emission reductions; Distribution grid; Energy storage systems; Jurong Port; Load flow studies; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaics; Steady-state analysis; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062067583

There are a number of alternatives to fossil fuels that can avoid a net carbon emission and can also decrease pollutant emissions. However, many have significant difficulty in competing with fossil fuels due to either limited availability, limited energy density, high cost, or a combination of these. Methanol (CH3OH) is one of these alternatives, which was demonstrated in large fleet trials during the 1980s and 1990s, and is currently again being introduced in various places and applications. It can be produced from fossil fuels, but also from biomass and from renewable energy sources in carbon capture and utilization schemes. It can be used in pure form or as a blend component, in internal combustion engines (ICEs) or in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). These features added to the fact it is a liquid fuel, making it an efficient way of storing and distributing energy, make it stand out as one of the most attractive scalable alternatives. This review focuses on the use of methanol as a pure fuel or blend component for ICEs. First, we introduce methanol historically, briefly introduce the various methods for its production, and summarize health and safety of using methanol as a fuel. Then, we focus on its use as a fuel for ICEs. The current data on the physical and chemical properties relevant for ICEs are reviewed, highlighting the differences with fuels such as ethanol and gasoline. These are then related to the research reported on the behaviour of methanol and methanol blends in spark ignition and compression ignition engines. Many of the properties of methanol that are significantly different from those of for example gasoline (such as its high heat of vaporization) lead to advantages as well as challenges. Both are extensively discussed. Methanol's performance, in terms of power output, peak and part load efficiency, and emissions formation is summarized, for so-called flex-fuel engines as well as for dedicated engines. We also briefly touch upon engine hardware changes and material compatibility. Methanol fuel reforming using engine waste heat is discussed, as a potential route towards further increases in efficiency and decreases in emissions. Next to the experimental work, research efforts into modelling the behaviour of methanol as a fuel are also reviewed, including mixture formation, normal and abnormal combustion. Methanol's properties such as high latent heat, fast burning velocity, high knock-resistance and no carbon-to-carbon bonds are shown to leverage engine technology developments such as increased compression ratios, downsizing and dilution; enabling much increased engine efficiencies. Finally, we point out the current gaps in knowledge to indicate which areas future research should be directed at. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Combustion; Emissions; Fuel blends; Internal combustion engine; Methanol; Renewable","Air quality; Blending; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Global warming; Heat resistance; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Particulate emissions; Renewable energy resources; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Compression ignition engine; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs); Fuel blends; Internal combustion engines (ICEs); Material compatibility; Physical and chemical properties; Renewable; Renewable energy source; Internal combustion engines",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054805255

This opens up the possibility of improving the management of biomass, which can be used for obtaining economic benefits from its energetic use. For the stems, biomass volume functions were determined from their diameter and length with r2 of 0.96. For the whole plant, biomass volume functions were determined from the diameter of the projected area in the soil and the height of the plant with r2 of 0.95. For energetic characterisation, the density, higher heat value, and the composition of this wood were measured in terms of following elements: carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulphur and chlorine, volatiles and ash.

We study how an agnostic approach to policy, based on Pascal's wager and allowing for subjective prior probability beliefs about whether climate deniers are right, prices carbon. Using the DICE integrated assessment model, we find that assigning a 10% chance of climate deniers being correct lowers the global price on carbon in 2020 only marginally: from $21 to $19 per ton of carbon dioxide if policymakers apply ‘Nordhaus discounting’ and from $91 to $84 per ton of carbon dioxide if they apply ‘Stern discounting’. Agnostics’ reflection of remaining scientific uncertainty leaves climate policy essentially unchanged. The robustness of an ambitious climate policy also follows from using the max-min or the min-max regret principle. Letting the coefficient of relative ambiguity aversion vary from zero, corresponding to expected utility analysis, to infinity, corresponding to the max-min principle, we show how policy makers deal with fundamental climate model uncertainty if they are prepared to assign prior probabilities to different views of the world being correct. Allowing for an ethical discount rate and a higher market discount rate and for a wide range of sensitivity exercises including damage uncertainty, we show that pricing carbon is the robust response under rising climate scepticism. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ambiguity aversion; Climate model uncertainty; Climate scepticism; DICE integrated assessment model; Differential discount rates; Max-min, min-max regret; Robust climate policies","carbon dioxide; climate modeling; discount rate; environmental policy; policy approach; policy making; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054698884

Leishmaniases are diseases caused by different species of Leishmania that mainly afflicts poorer populations of tropical and subtropical regions and immunocompromised individuals. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effector response of murine neutrophils to species of Leishmania causing American cutaneous leishmaniasis and zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis by evaluating pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and intracellular and extracellular effector microbicide activity. When exposed to Leishmania parasites, mouse neutrophils produced superoxide, released enzymes in the extracellular space and generated neutrophil extracellular traps, although PRR gene expression is negatively regulated. L. infantum, L. guyanensis, and L. shawi inhibited enzymatic activity, whereas L. amazonensis reduced the emission of extracellular structures. These findings indicate that although neutrophils trigger several microbicide mechanisms, Leishmania parasites can manipulate extracellular effector mechanisms. The present study also provides evidence that neutrophils can internalize parasites by coiling phagocytosis. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Degranulation; Innate immunity; Leishmania spp.; Mouse neutrophils; Neutrophil extracellular traps; Oxidative burst; Pattern recognition receptors; Phagocytosis","pattern recognition receptor; superoxide; pattern recognition receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell activity; controlled study; effector cell; enzyme activity; extracellular space; gene expression; Leishmania amazonensis; Leishmania guyanensis; Leishmania infantum; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; phagocytosis; priority journal; skin leishmaniasis; visceral leishmaniasis; animal; cell line; cytoplasm; immunology; innate immunity; Leishmania; leishmaniasis; metabolism; neutrophil; parasite; pathogenicity; skin leishmaniasis; visceral leishmaniasis; Animals; Cell Line; Cytoplasm; Immunity, Innate; Leishmania; Leishmaniasis; Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous; Leishmaniasis, Visceral; Mice; Neutrophils; Parasites; Phagocytosis; Receptors, Pattern Recognition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056281017

They drive benthic−pelagic coupling by filtering dissolved and particulate organic matter from the water column, alter water chemistry in association with their symbiotic microorganisms, and increase habitat structural complexity. Anthropogenic degradation of coastal waters is widespread and can reduce the density and diversity of foundation species such as sponges, potentially diminishing their contributions to ecosystem processes. We used a novel mesocosm design that minimized artifacts associated with traditional single-species and closed-system filtration experiments to examine the effects of water turnover and sponge biomass on water-column properties. Using a 3-factor, fully-crossed design, we manipulated water turnover and the biomass of 10 sponge species common in Florida Bay, Florida (USA), and measured the effects of their feeding on concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus) and plankton (measured as chl a and bacterioplankton). High sponge biomass and low water turnover greatly reduced chl a, ammonium, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water and increased concentrations of nitrites, nitrates, and phosphates. Sponge species identity had idiosyncratic effects on water-column constituents, especially with respect to the influence of sponges on chl a, DOC, and ammonium. This study demonstrates the importance of sponge biomass and species-specific filtration on nutrient cycling and highlights how changes in the abundance and diversity of sponges in coastal ecosystems can drastically alter water-column properties. © Inter-Research 2019.","Community; Density; Ecosystem function; Florida Bay; Flow regime; Sponge","anthropogenic effect; benthic-pelagic coupling; biomass; coastal water; community dynamics; ecosystem function; environmental degradation; experimental study; hydrological regime; marine ecosystem; nutrient cycling; population density; shallow water; sponge; symbiont; tropical environment; water chemistry; water column; Florida Bay; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059901509

In this context, the coefficient of determination (R2) is widely used as a means of evaluating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by a model. However, the validity of R2 for comparing observed versus predicted values has been challenged in the presence of bias, for instance in remote sensing predictions of forest biomass. We tested suitable alternatives, e.g. the index of agreement (d) and the maximal information coefficient (MIC). Our results show that d renders systematically higher values than R2, and may easily lead to regarding as reliable models which included an unrealistic amount of predictors. Results seemed better for MIC, although MIC favoured local clustering of predictions, whether or not they corresponded to the observations. Moreover, R2 was more sensitive to the use of cross-validation than d or MIC, and more robust against overfitted models. Therefore, we discourage the use of statistical measures alternative to R2 for evaluating model predictions versus observed values, at least in the context of assessing the reliability of modelled biomass predictions using remote sensing. For those who consider d to be conceptually superior to R2, we suggest using its square d2, in order to be more analogous to R2 and hence facilitate comparison across studies. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Climate change will alter the land suitability for walnut cultivation around the world, especially in arid and semi-arid regions like Iran. Here, land suitability for the cultivation of walnut (Juglans regia L.) in Iran was determined using the GIS for present and future conditions (2020–2049) with an approach to climate change. Accordingly, data from 375 synoptic stations throughout Iran were gathered for climatic factors including average, minimum and maximum temperatures, relative humidity and chilling requirement. Also, ASTER sensors (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) and their data provided this research with cells that make a precision of 150 m (5 s), and the data were used for gauging geological parameters such as altitude and land slope. The electrical conductivity (EC) of soil and water were informed by the data bank of the Iranian Water Resources Management. The results of temperature simulations for the future (2020–2049) were analyzed by 21 AOGCM-AR5 models under the RCP4.5 emission scenario. In the first phase of evaluations, the maps of land suitability were constructed for present conditions by considering a network of the above-mentioned parameters. By combining these layers of information, the final map of land suitability was illustrated for walnut cultivation. In the second phase, the NEX-GDDP was used in order to determine land suitability for the future (2020–2049). The results showed that Iran currently has 582844 km2 of land suitable for walnut cultivation. However, the future will see less suitable lands: the current area will be reduced by 6.19%, from 582844 km2 to 546710 km2. In general, the northern, northwestern and western margins of Iran are currently suitable for walnut cultivation. By approximation, these lands will also be major areas for prospective cultivations of walnut in the future (2020–2049), even though their current stretch will be reduced. © 2019 Vahdati et al.

But, if plants are not fully constrained by climate, their expansion could be facilitated or hindered by other factors such as biotic interactions. Here, we assessed the composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils along an elevation gradient (i.e. 900 m, 1600 m, 2200 m and 2700 m a.s.l.) through a fungal DNA meta-barcoding approach. In addition, we studied in the greenhouse the effects of AMF on growth and phosphorous (P) nutrition of seedlings of the alien trees Gleditsia triacanthos, Ligustrum lucidum and Pyracantha angustifolia cultivated in soils from those elevations, spanning the elevation at which they already form monospecific stands (below 1450 m a.s.l.) and higher elevations, above their current range of distribution in montane ecosystems of Central Argentina. For comparison, we also included in the experiment the dominant native tree Lithraea molleoides that historically occurs below 1300 m a.s.l. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition showed strong community turnover with increasing elevation. The effects of these AMF communities on plant growth and nutrition differed among native and alien trees. While P nutrition in alien species’ seedlings was generally enhanced by AMF along the whole gradient, the native species benefited only from AMF that occur in soils from the elevation corresponding to its current altitudinal range of distribution. These results suggest that AMF might foster upper range expansion of these invasive trees over non-invaded higher elevations. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Belowground microorganisms; DNA meta-barcoding; Invasion ecology; Montane ecosystems","altitude; arbuscular mycorrhiza; belowground biomass; community composition; deciduous tree; DNA; elevation; environmental gradient; evergreen tree; experimental study; fungus; growth; invasive species; mountain environment; native species; range expansion; recruitment (population dynamics); seedling; shrub; soil microorganism; spatial distribution; turnover; Argentina; Fungi; Gleditsia triacanthos; Ligustrum lucidum; Lithrea molleoides; Pyracantha angustifolia; Anacardiaceae; Argentina; ecosystem; Gleditsia; growth, development and aging; introduced species; Ligustrum; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; Pyracantha; tree; Anacardiaceae; Argentina; Ecosystem; Gleditsia; Introduced Species; Ligustrum; Mycorrhizae; Pyracantha; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056637890

Sustained gains in plant breeding rely on variation in crop gene pool. Over 231,000 sorghum accessions are conserved globally, with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) genebank holding 39,234 accessions from 93 countries. Representative subsets in the form of core and mini core collections and reference sets have been developed and used to identify new sources of variations for stress resistance, phenology, seed yield and quality, and for bioenergy traits. Ethnolinguistic diversity, human migration, and social boundaries have shaped the abundant diversity among landraces, which significantly impacted conservation and distribution of on-farm diversity. Sorghum is a genomic resources rich crop. Genome-wide association mapping unraveled many significant marker-trait associations: flowering, plant height, tillering, culm length, inflorescence architecture, number of panicles, panicle length, seed weight, and stalk sugar; resistance to anthracnose, grain mold, and rust; increased seed yield under P-deficient or Al-toxic soils; or seed quality, with many of these markers comapped on the same linkage groups previously reported as harboring quantitative trait loci (QTL) or candidate genes associated with some of these traits. The sequencing of diverse sorghum germplasm and its comparison with a reference genome has revealed substantial untapped diversity, which offers a great opportunity for the genetic improvement of sorghum. Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genome (TILLING) populations unraveled new variations not previously known in sorghum. Genomic tools and information are being applied to harness new sources of variations by using S. halepense and S. propinquum to adapt sorghum to extreme climatic conditions, both in tropical and temperate regions. © ASA and CSSA, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711, USA.","BIN; Biological nitrification inhibition; EST; Expressed sequence tags; Gene pool; GP; Harvest index; HI; ICRISAT; INDELS; Insertions and deletions; International crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics; QTL; Quantitative trait loci; Simple sequence repeat; Single nucleotide polymorphism; SNP; Soil plant analysis development; SPAD; SSR; Targeting induced local lesions IN genome; TE; TILLING; Transpiration efficiency; Water extraction; WE",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101483762

This is evident from leapfrog move to Bharat Stage VI stringent emissions norms, by just providing a mere window of three years to the automotive industry. The challenge is not to manufacture new subsystems but is getting customized emission solution technology tested and validated for Indian conditions to meet BSVI emission norms by April 2020. With reference to recent reports published by NITI Aayog (Government of India Think Tank), xEV's can be incentivized and promoted as an emission free solution. With internal combustion engine complex architectures to meet BSVI emission norms and proposed government incentive, many passenger car OEM's are considering electric vehicle (EV) powertrain development. In view of this, a study was envisaged to estimate EV powertrain challenges for Pune (India) city real world driving conditions. Test data such as vehicle speed, engine speed was measured on conventional passenger car using data acquisition system for city routes. A conventional powertrain simulation model was developed using Ricardo IGNITE® which was then validated for MIDC fuel economy. An equivalent EV powertrain architecture such as motor rating, HV battery size was identified to maintain traction power, speed and electric range of 100 km. This identified EV architecture was implemented in simulation model along with battery thermal management &amp; regenerative braking strategy. The EV simulation model was used to predict fuel and hence CO2 savings for MIDC and real-world drive condition. The study of Effect of real world driving conditions on range was also carried out. It was observed that electric vehicle is viable option for CO2 savings. Real world driving conditions impacts electric range mostly due to traffic conditions requiring repeated acceleration and braking events. This study could not focus on driving conditions observed in other Indian cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, etc. where driving pattern may be different. Also, this study has not considered PHEV architecture as it is the most complex in terms of hardware as well as controls. Study concludes that EV architectures are specific to application and driving conditions. A range of 100 km on one route can't assure similar range for another route.

Traditional theories have attributed the increasing food insecurity in the region to problems of poor governance, corruption and climate change. In view of the persistent and increasing nature of armed conflict in the sub-region, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of increasing armed conflict on food security in Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) member countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilized the dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) to investigate the effect of conflict intensity on food security in the 14 member states of the ECOWAS using annualized panel data from 2005 to 2015. Findings: The findings reveal that armed conflict is a significant predictor of food security in West Africa. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the study bring to fore, the urgent need to rethink global initiative for combating food insecurity. The effort must also identify the causes of armed conflicts and design sound strategies for de-escalating the armed conflicts. Resolving the escalating armed conflict entails developing a conflict resolution framework that is extremely sensitive to the causes of conflict in Africa and adopting localized ex ante institutional diagnostics that would help in understanding the nature of the conflicts. Originality/value: Traditional theory perceives climate change, social injustices, property right, food insecurity, religious extremism and bad governance as the predictors of armed conflicts. In this study, the authors departed from the traditional theory by demonstrating that the nature and trend of armed conflict could also pose a serious threat to food security. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Armed conflict; ECOWAS; Food security","climate change; food security; property rights; religion; social conflict; social justice; socioeconomic status; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053031301

It is a cutting-edge spectral multicomponent analysis software for displaying, fitting and analyzing astronomical spectra of complex emission and absorption line profiles. Equipped with statistical and verification tools it accelerates complex mathematical precision checks and confirms the uniqueness of the calculated physical parameters and the number of the absorption components that construct every Broad Absorption/Emission Line (BAL/BEL) and Discrete Absorption Components (DACs). DACs (in the case of Hot Emission Stars) and BALs/BELs (in the case of Quasars) are spectral lines of the same ion and the same wavelength as the main spectral line, shifted at different Δλ as they are created in different density regions which rotate and move radially with different velocities. The currently accepted view is that BELs, BALs and DACs may be due to a flow of many individual density enhancements, called clouds, cloudlets or clumps which are optically thick and very small compared with the size of the central continuum source. These density enhancements are not preexisting entities but are formed inside an unstable and turbulent wind and they are indicated by very complex profiles. According to this phenomenon, a prevailing view is that they are not simple absorption/emission lines, but the synthesis of a group of classical absorption line components of the same spectral line. ASTA software equipped with a multicomponent analysis model is a novel approach to curve fit these complex lines focusing on the physical representation of the calculated parameters of each of these components.

My study provides the first synthetic analysis of ecological effects of TCs on key ecosystems along a reef-to-ridge gradient in the region. This gradient includes outer and mid-shelf, and nearshore coral reefs, seagrass communities, mangrove forests, and lowland, and upland rain forests. Firstly, I synthesize published research on ecological effects of HES events on natural ecosystems along the reef-to-ridge gradient, with a particular focus on evaluating their ecological resistance and resilience to HES events. Secondly, utilizing two case studies, I compare and contrast the large-scale wind energy effects of two severe tropical cyclones (TC Larry and TC Yasi) on natural ecosystems along their respective reef-to-ridge gradients, with a focus on damage patterns and early stages of recovery for key ecosystems. Finally, I consider the likely effects of climate change on future HES events, and how these may affect the resistance and resilience of ecosystems along the reef-to-ridge gradient. Damage patterns for ecosystems along the reef-to-ridge gradient for both TCs were largely determined by distance from the TC track, side of track, shelf position in the case of reefs, topography in the case of forests, forest type, and forest integrity (contiguous vs. fragmented). Major structural damage to coral reefs and contiguous rain forests after both TCs was patchy, suggesting some degree of larger-scale resistance of these ecosystems to HES events. In the case of littoral forests, small forest remnants, regrowth forests, and riparian forests much lower levels of resistance to high-energy winds were observed, due to patch size and edge effects. Apart from mangroves, most intact ecosystems along the reef-to-ridge gradient have shown early stages of recovery. However, small forests remnants and riparian forests in the agricultural matrix had lower levels of recovery compared with areas of contiguous forest. Anthropogenic climate change may reduce the resistance and resilience of ecosystems along the reef-to-ridge gradient to cope with future HES events, due to increased wind and wave energy, higher storm surges, higher intensity rainfall, and larger river plume events. © 2019 The Author.","climate change; damage patterns; ecological resilience; ecological resistance; large-scale wind effects; Special Feature: High-Energy Storms; tropical cyclones",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061092290

Evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation efforts will require measurement of both the emission rate and its change over space and time. The relative performance of different emission estimation methods is a critical requirement to support mitigation efforts. Here we compare results of CO 2 emissions estimation methods including an inventory-based method and two different top-down atmospheric measurement approaches implemented for the Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A. urban area in winter. By accounting for differences in spatial and temporal coverage, as well as trace gas species measured, we find agreement among the wintertime whole-city fossil fuel CO 2 emission rate estimates to within 7%. This finding represents a major improvement over previous comparisons of urban-scale emissions, making urban CO 2 flux estimates from this study consistent with local and global emission mitigation strategy needs. The complementary application of multiple scientifically driven emissions quantification methods enables and establishes this high level of confidence and demonstrates the strength of the joint implementation of rigorous inventory and atmospheric emissions monitoring approaches. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Fossil fuels; Atmospheric emission; Atmospheric measurement; Emission estimation; Emissions mitigation; Inventory-based methods; Joint implementation; Quantification methods; Relative performance; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; flux measurement; fossil fuel; joint implementation; numerical method; spatiotemporal analysis; trace gas; urban area; urban pollution; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; carbon dioxide transport; carbon footprint; city; climate change; evaluation study; global climate; greenhouse gas; Indiana; intermethod comparison; pollution monitoring; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; synthesis; urban area; winter; air pollutant; Indiana; Indiana; Indianapolis; United States; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Fossil Fuels; Indiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059621476

Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are common dryland soil surface communities of bryophytes, lichens, and/or cyanobacteria that bind the soil surface together and that may play an important role in regulating the climatic sensitivity of the dryland C cycle. Major uncertainties exist in our understanding of the interacting effects of changing temperature and moisture on CO 2 uptake (photosynthesis) and loss (respiration) from biocrust and sub-crust soil, particularly as related to biocrust successional state. Here, we used a mesocosm approach to assess how biocrust successional states related to climate treatments. We subjected bare soil (Bare), early successional lightly pigmented cyanobacterial biocrust (Early), and late successional darkly pigmented moss-lichen biocrust (Late) to either ambient or + 5°C above ambient soil temperature for 84 days. Under ambient temperatures, Late biocrust mesocosms showed frequent net uptake of CO 2 , whereas Bare soil, Early biocrust, and warmed Late biocrust mesocosms mostly lost CO 2 to the atmosphere. The inhibiting effect of warming on CO 2 exchange was a result of accelerated drying of biocrust and soil. We used these data to parameterize, via Bayesian methods, a model of ecosystem CO 2 fluxes, and evaluated the model with data from an autochamber CO 2 system at our field site on the Colorado Plateau in SE Utah. In the context of the field experiment, the data underscore the negative effect of warming on fluxes both biocrust CO 2 uptake and loss—which, because biocrusts are a dominant land cover type in this ecosystem, may extend to ecosystem-scale C cycling. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature (This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply).","Bayesian statistics; biological soil crust; ecosystem model; gross primary production; moisture sensitivity; net soil exchange; semiarid shrublands; soil respiration; temperature sensitivity","arid region; bare soil; Bayesian analysis; bryophyte; carbon cycle; carbon flux; carbon sink; climate change; cyanobacterium; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem modeling; global warming; lichen; moisture content; primary production; semiarid region; shrubland; soil carbon; soil crust; soil respiration; temperature effect; terrestrial ecosystem; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061406332

This was observed during the Intensive Cloud Aerosol Measurement Campaign (IMPACT) (European Integrated project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air quality Interaction (EUCAARI) project) in the Benelux Union during May 2008. To better understand this cloud formation variability, the indirect effects of aerosol have been included within the WRF-CHIMERE online model. By comparing model results to the aircraft measurements of IMPACT, to surface measurements from EMEP and AIRBASE and to MODIS satellite measurements, we showed that the model is able to simulate the variability and order of magnitude of the observed number of condensation nuclei (CN), even if some differences are identified for specific aerosol size and location. To quantify the impact of the local anthropogenic emissions on cloud formation, a sensitivity study is performed by halving the surface emissions fluxes. It is shown that the indirect radiative effect (IRE) at the surface is positive for both shortwave and longwave with a net warming of +0.99 W/m 2 . In addition, important instantaneous changes are modelled at local scale with up to ±6 °C for temperatures and ±50 mm/day for precipitation. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerosol indirect effect; Meteorology-chemistry coupled model; Model evaluation; Online model; WRF-CHIMERE model","Air quality; Emission control; Surface measurement; Aerosol indirect effect; Aerosol-cloud interaction; Anthropogenic emissions; Coupled modeling; Meteorological condition; Model evaluation; Online modeling; Satellite measurements; Aerosols; aerosol; air quality; airborne survey; climate modeling; cloud condensation nucleus; cloud microphysics; comparative study; emission control; radiative forcing; Benelux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059683079

Because the pressure drop within the DPF reduces engine performance, it must be predicted with accuracy. The purpose of this study was to improve the accuracy of a DPF simulation model under transient conditions by parameter optimization. The DPF model under consideration consists of an inlet channel, a cake layer, wall layer, and an outlet channel. The pressure drop is influenced by the location, mass, and density of the deposited soot. Therefore, the model includes the following sub-models:Sub-model 1: Calculates the soot density deposited in the wall layerSub-model 2: Computes the filtration efficiency and mass of the wall and cake layerSub-model 3: Calculates the soot density deposited in the cake layer Because the sub-models include some empirical formulae, the first step in refining the model was to optimize their fitting parameters. Two sets of experiments were conducted: soot loading experiments under steady-state conditions for parameter optimization, and soot loading experiments under transient conditions for model validation. Therefore, the fitting parameters were optimized based on the experimental data using the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient method, revealing that two of the fitting parameters depend on the Space Velocity (SV) and PM diameter. These parameters were therefore represented as polynomial functions of the SV and PM diameter, which were implemented in the DPF model as sub-models. Finally, the DPF model with the polynomial sub-models was validated under transient conditions, showing that the polynomial sub-models yielded lower prediction errors than were obtained using constant fitting parameters. The revised model will be used to predict DPF pressure drops under other transient conditions such as those associated with Worldwide-harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) mode. © 2019 SAE International.

Nowadays, gas turbines operate under transient conditions to support their renewable partners. Gas turbine dynamic performance simulation provides the means for assessing the engine behavior and designing engine controllers that will enable them to fulfill their new operating role. This paper presents a novel gas turbine performance system for representing the nonlinear behavior of a two-shaft gas turbine engine. The developed gas turbine engine model in MATLAB/Simulink environment is capable of simulating both steady state and transient operating conditions, and to facilitate the design of controllers for stable engine operation. Validation of the developed engine model with a gas turbine simulation package confirmed the excellent agreement among all the simulated measurements at transient conditions. The simulated behavior of a hybrid gas/wind power plant enabled the development of an optimized controller for empowering the gas turbine to support the intermittent wind turbines. The time responses of the main parameters of the hybrid gas/wind power plant demonstrated the significant amount of transient conditions that a gas turbine experiences for fulfilling the energy gap imposed by the wind turbines. Finally, the performance comparison of the hybrid power plant to a twin gas turbine power plant highlighted the effective reduction in NOx emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Engine control; Gas turbine performance; Hybrid power plant; MATLAB/simulink; Transient performance","Aircraft propulsion; Controllers; Gas emissions; Gas turbine power plants; MATLAB; Wind turbines; Engine control; Gas turbine performance; Hybrid power plants; MATLAB /simulink; Transient performance; Gas turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055148257

A novel iron-air battery characterized by high performance, safety and reliability for operation at intermediate temperatures (500–650 °C) is demonstrated. The iron-air rechargeable battery is based on a new configuration where both the nickel-electrode and the hydrogen/water redox processes, generally utilized in high temperature ceramic batteries, are avoided in this system completely operating in the solid state. This can increase the durability and reliability of the battery while providing excellent performance (specific energy of 0.46 Wh g−1, specific capacity of 0.5 Ah g−1, faradaic efficiency 80%). These characteristics favourably compare to low temperature iron-air batteries. Excellent performance and cyclability are achieved at 650 °C for the iron-air solid-state battery showing no relevant degradation after more than 100 cycles. The concept is based on a composite iron-ceria anode in contact with an oxygen anion-conducting lanthanum gallate electrolyte and a mixed conductivity lanthanum ferrite perovskite-based cathode. This combines both simplicity of operation and intrinsic safety with high energy density and durability. The excellent dynamic behaviour, the absence of influence of external environmental conditions and the use of cost-effective ceramic materials, with the possibility to produce high quality heat to cover the chain of electrical and thermal energy, make such systems largely appealing for applications related to renewable power sources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ceramic materials; Energy storage; Fe-air battery; Renewable energy; Solid-state battery","Carbon footprint; Ceramic materials; Cerium oxide; Cost effectiveness; Durability; Electric energy storage; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Iron; Lanthanum; Perovskite; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solid state devices; Temperature; Environmental conditions; High energy densities; High temperature ceramics; Intermediate temperatures; Lanthanum gallate electrolytes; Renewable energies; Renewable power sources; Solid state batteries; Solid electrolytes; alternative energy; carbon footprint; ceramics; degradation; electricity; electrode; electrolyte; energy resource; energy storage; environmental conditions; equipment; high temperature; low temperature; operations technology; performance assessment; perovskite; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055114708

Such organizations have a complex role: engaging with policy-makers, as well as their memberships and the public, to pursue the interests of their specific communities. This paper includes an examination of how farm producer organizations communicate about climate and weather to these various audiences, and the specific needs and recommendations they advance. Of particular interest are commodities related to pasture-based grazing, which is underrepresented in the climate adaptation literature. A collection of 95 publicly available documents is analyzed, representing a snapshot of climate- and weather-related public and policy engagement of Canadian and Albertan farm and livestock producer organizations from 2010 to 2015. Qualitative coding by scale, commodity, and audience revealed three significant patterns within this exploratory study. First, while national ‘‘umbrella’’ organizations speak climate to government, Alberta-based livestock/forage organizations speak to their members with a focus on weather. Second, while the two national umbrella organizations examined are politically divergent, they appear to be united on the topic of climate change.

The Ca-based sorbent injection process in pulverized lignite fired boiler furnace with tangentially arranged burners is simulated. In simulations sorbent particles are distributed among the burner tiers, where they are injected together with coal, and also through sorbent injection ports located above the burners. The sorbent reactions model was adapted to be efficiently implemented in the code for CFD simulations of complex processes considering both the calculation time and the results accuracy. The sorbent particles reaction model was simplified with several assumptions to allow for faster calculations and significantly reduce simulation time without loss in calculation precision during the particle tracking in boiler furnace. Two phase gas-particle flow is modeled, with coal and sorbent particles reactions and interactions with gaseous phase. Test-cases based on fuels with different composition and combustion organization were simulated in details, and results showed that significant increase in reduction of SO2 at furnace exit could be achieved by proper sorbent injection. The sorbent injection locations were analyzed with special care to enable maximum SO2 capture in the case-study furnace under investigated conditions. Most of the test-cases with low SO2 capture had one or more of the following problems: intensive particle sintering, low local temperatures (leading to low calcination rates), or bad particles distribution. Significant SO2 retention was possible when the process was organized in such a way that particles were exposed to optimal temperature range, and injected in the furnace zones with high SO2 concentration simultaneously. It was shown that better results can be achieved by injection of sorbent through multiple burner tiers, with SO2 emission reduction efficiency around 60% at the furnace exit in several well optimized test-cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ca-based sorbent; Furnace sorbent injection; Numerical model; Pulverized coal combustion; SO2 emission reduction","Boilers; Coal fueled furnaces; Computational fluid dynamics; Emission control; Flow of solids; Furnaces; Gas emissions; Lignite; Numerical models; Sintering; Sorbents; Sorption; Sulfur; Two phase flow; Ca-based sorbents; Lignite-fired boilers; Particles distribution; Pulverized coal combustion; SO2 emissions; Sorbent injection; Two-phase gas-particle flow; Utility boiler furnaces; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052729002

However, climate studies of other planets indicate that seasonal asymmetry can also be caused by a hemispheric asymmetry in geography such as the ocean-continent distribution or topography. A global climate model is used to investigate whether orbital forcing or hemispheric asymmetry in geography is more important for the seasonal asymmetry in Titan's climate and the distribution of polar methane deposits. Titan's large-scale topography generally decreases from equator to pole and thereby induces meridional circulation with upwelling at low latitudes and downwelling at high latitudes due to near-surface horizontal temperature gradients. This circulation is stronger in the southern hemisphere, which contains steep slopes at mid latitudes, and acts to transport dry air downward near the south pole and to reduce the precipitation in southern summer. Consequently, the annual precipitation minus evaporation is substantially smaller in the south polar region than in the north polar region. Orbital parameter variations quantitatively affect the polar precipitation, yet are unable to reverse the vast hemispheric asymmetry in the polar precipitation. The accumulation of Titan's lakes near the north pole could therefore be a semi-permanent feature related to Titan's topography and may resist the Croll–Milankovitch cycle. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Atmospheres; Meteorology; Surface; Titan",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052094236

During the recent decades, Himalaya has experienced rapid urbanization mainly in response to population growth, improved road connectivity, development of tourism and economic globalization. As a result, urbanization has emerged as one of the important drivers of land use and environmental changes depleting natural resources and biodiversity, and disrupting natural drainage and ecosystem services; and increasing vulnerability of anthropogenically modified slopes to a variety of natural risks, particularly under climate change. The paper analyzes the emerging threats of unplanned urban growth in the densely populated Middle Himalayan Ranges with a case illustration of Nainital Town located in Uttarakhand. It was observed that the rapid urbanization is increasing the susceptibility of intensively modified and densely populated fragile slopes to the active processes of mass movement and landslides. Moreover, the rapidly changing climatic conditions, particularly the climate change induced hydrological extremes are posing severe threats to the sustainability of fast-growing urban ecosystem by increasing the frequency, intensity and severity of geo-hydrological hazards in the town and its surrounding region. The city development plan and also the state disaster risk reduction framework and climate change adaptation plan did not make any provision for addressing the emerging risks of climate change in Nainital and other towns of Uttarakhand. A comprehensive climate change vulnerability assessment and mapping of the town should be carried taking into account all the critical parameters of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of urban ecosystem involving a range of institutions and stakeholders. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

The second one refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects and seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Today’s cities are first concerned by adaptation as they are faced with numerous climate-related threats, most visibly the increase of extreme weather events such as floods, storms and heat waves. In France, local urban development plans are worthy of interest as tools for rehearsing and implementing climate change adaptation. Indeed, they are both local urban planning documents and sources of law, and their elaboration involves a large number of institutions and actors both from the local government and the society. The chapter looks at the plan drafted by the Eurometropolis of Strasbourg (France), which came into force on January 2017, and offers a good example of the way the local authorities can integrate the issue of adaptation to climate change into their urban planning and governance policies. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Philippe Hamman.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121176976

We perform a spatial analysis of woodland creation between 1988 and 2014 using site suitability scores generated through the Forest Research Ecological Site Classification (ESC) methodology. We further conduct in-depth interviews with fourteen stakeholders within the grant-scheme application process to explore the influence of ecological suitability on woodland planning. We find that 92% of woodlands are suited to current climate conditions, and that suitability has improved under the latest grant scheme. This is concurrent with an increased emphasis on suitability modelling in decision-making, though could be explained by cultural changes or a more rigorous approvals process. We find that ecological variables are used to inform woodland location and species selection, but that woodland type is more commonly determined by grant structure. Finally, we discuss other potential limits to grant scheme success, including climate change, edaphic variables and woodland management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Benefit realisation; Ecological Site Classification; Ecological suitability; Forestry policy; Scotland; Woodland expansion","forest management; forestry policy; land use planning; modeling; stakeholder; woodland; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055741145

We analyzed long-term (1993–2017) trends in summer (January–February) abundance of WAP pteropods in relation to environmental controls (sea ice, sea surface temperature, climate indices, phytoplankton biomass and productivity, and carbonate chemistry) and interspecies dynamics using general linear models. There was no overall directional trend in abundance of thecosomes, Limacina helicina antarctica and Clio pyramidata, throughout the entire WAP, although L. antarctica abundance increased in the slope region and C. pyramidata abundance increased in the South. High L. antarctica abundance was strongly tied to a negative Multivariate El Niño Southern Oscillation Index the previous year. C. pyramidata abundance was best explained by early sea ice retreat 1-yr prior. Abundance of the gymnosome species, Clione antarctica and Spongiobranchaea australis, increased over the time series, particularly in the slope region. Gymnosome abundance was positively influenced by abundance of their prey, L. antarctica, during the same season, and late sea ice advance 2-yr prior. These trends indicate a shorter ice season promotes longer periods of open water in spring/summer favoring all pteropod species. Weak relationships were found between pteropod abundance and carbonate chemistry, and no long-term trend in carbonate parameters was detected. These factors indicate ocean acidification is not presently influencing WAP pteropod abundance. Pteropods are responsive to the considerable environmental variability on both temporal and spatial scales—key for predicting future effects of climate change on regional carbon cycling and plankton trophic interactions. © 2018 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"abundance; biogeography; biomass; carbonate; climate change; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; ice retreat; ocean acidification; open water; phytoplankton; sea ice; sea surface temperature; trophic level; zooplankton; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; West Antarctica; Clio pyramidata; Clione antarctica; Limacina helicina antarctica; Pteropoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060217101

Due to the influence of complex hydrological regime, annual intrusion of sea water in the dry season has caused barriers and constraints for existing agricultural practices. However, the projection of saline simulation indicated that the occurrence of salt intrusion is likely further inland and severe intensity in the Hau River and coastal areas of the Ca Mau Peninsula in line with the rise of sea levels under climate change effects. This paper aims to propose mitigation and adaptation measures of salt tolerance for sustainable agricultural development in the Ca Mau Peninsula up to 2030 in accordance with projected scenarios of sea level rise. Methodology: The study inherited the results of forecasting salt intrusion in scenarios of sea level rise until 2030 by using the MIKE 11 HD-AD model in a previous research of the authors, in order to suggest mitigation and adaptation measures against salt intrusion for agricultural activities in the Ca Mau Peninsula. The documents relating to salt tolerance of crops, state of irrigation structures and land use were also collected and analyzed to provide more information for better proposed solutions. Findings: The paper presents some feasible measures to mitigate and adapt salt intrusion as sea level rise under impacts of climate change including appropriate land use planning; reasonable shifts in agricultural practices, in particular in the selection of plants and crops which can be tolerant to various salt limits; applying advanced cultivation techniques such as less water irrigation practices of alternate wetting and drying and salt tolerance enhancement; and hard-engineered structures for salt prevention and freshwater conveyance in freshwater-scarce areas. Practical implications: The study will be very meaningful for local farmers in the Ca Mau Peninsula to develop agriculture sustainably, especially, the famers can select crops which are suitable with the salt concentrations or change land use and cultivation models for higher yields. Social implications: The measures proposed in this study will help to increase the efficiency of agricultural production toward a sustainable agriculture-based economy, which will bring sustainable livelihoods for farmers in the peninsula where agriculture and aquaculture are their main economic activities. Originality/value: Until now, mitigation and adaptation measures of salt intrusion in the Ca Mau Peninsula have not been perfected. They were suggested by general view only, and not based upon scientific evidences.

The beneficial properties of sludge, such as its high calorific value and nutrient content, along with stringent regulations on sludge disposal, provide incentives to viewing sludge as a resource rather than waste. Along these lines, anaerobic digestion is considered to be an attractive sludge-management practice because it offers waste reduction, greenhouse gas mitigation, and renewable energy production opportunities while stabilizing the sludge.

Bringing together the latest research in climate science, renewable energy technology, employment and resource impacts, the book breaks new ground by covering all the elements essential to achieving the ambitious climate mitigation targets set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. For example, sectoral implementation pathways, with special emphasis on differences between developed and developing countries and regional conditions, provide tools to implement the scenarios globally and domestically. Non-energy greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios define a sustainable pathway for land-use change and the agricultural sector. Furthermore, results of the impact of the scenarios on employment and mineral and resource requirements provide vital insight on economic and resource management implications.

China’s government has promulgated a Guiding Opinion, setting key regions to establish an emission reduction target of air pollutants during the 12th five year plan (2011–2015). Thus, there is a different regional treatment of industrial waste gas in China. This study considers the waste gas treatment expenditure as a new input and employs the non-radial directional distance function in the framework of the meta-frontier model to investigate the energy and emission reduction performance of China’s industrial sectors. The study is aimed at finding a significant and expanded technical gap between key and non-key regions in the energy and emission reduction efficiencies. The empirical result presents an effective method to improve the performance by increasing the emission treatment expenditure to reduce emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","China’s industrial sector; Emission reduction; Energy-saving; Meta-frontier; Non-radial directional distance function; Performance improvement","Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Directional distance function; Emission reduction; Industrial sector; Meta-frontier; Performance improvement; Industrial waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060553831

Diploids fed L2 showed significantly improved growth and reduced liver, hepatic steatosis, and viscerosomatic indices, while fish fed L3 showed suppressed growth rate 14 weeks post feeding. In contrast, dietary NP level had no effect on triploid performance. Whole body mineral composition, with exception of copper, did not differ between diet or ploidy. Whole fish total AAs and N-metabolites showed no variation by diet or ploidy. Free circulating AAs and white muscle N-metabolites were higher in triploids than diploids, while branch-chained amino acids were higher in diploids than triploids. Diploids had higher whole body α-tocopherol and hepatic vitamins K1 and K2 than triploids. Increased tissue B-vitamins for niacin and whole-body folate with dietary NP supplementation were observed in diploids but not triploids, while whole body riboflavin was higher in diploids than triploids. Hepatic transcriptome profiles showed that diploids fed diet L2 was more similar to that observed in triploids fed diet L3. In particular, sterol biosynthesis pathways were down-regulated, whereas cytochrome P450 metabolism was up-regulated. One‑carbon metabolism was also affected by increasing levels of supplementation in both ploidies. Collectively, results suggested that, for optimised growth and liver function, micronutrient levels be supplemented above current National Research Council (2011) recommendations for Atlantic salmon when fed low marine ingredient diets.

The research output will be helpful in integrating farmers’ choices with government programs in the selected regions. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) was selected because it is highly vulnerable to climate change, which could adversely affect the sustainability of the rice-wheat production system and the food security of the region. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can mitigate the negative effects of climate change and improve the efficiency of the rice-wheat-based production system. To assess farmers’ choices and their WTP for the potential climate-smart technologies and other interventions, scoring and bidding protocols were implemented through focus group meetings. Laser land leveling (LLL), crop insurance, and weather advisory services were found to be the preferred interventions in the Eastern IGP, whereas, in the Western IGP, farmers preferred LLL, direct seeding, zero tillage, irrigation scheduling, and crop insurance. Through the bidding approach, farmers implicitly expressed their WTP for new technologies that could transform current agricultural practices into relatively low-carbon impact and more productive farming methods. But actual large-scale adoption of the preferred climate-smart technologies and other interventions would require access to funding as well as capacity building among technology promoters and users. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Preference; Scoring; Smallholders contingent valuation; Technology",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084706285

Considering the potential relationship between environmental quality and thermal sensation in outdoor spaces— an emerging topic in perceived comfort, this study offers a new approach for planning and design for climate resilience in cities. This paper presents the results of an outdoor thermal comfort survey conducted on hot summer days in Hong Kong. Diverse patterns of PET-comfort ratings relationships were found in different urban settings. The study revealed that air temperature, subjective assessments of solar radiation and wind environment were strong determinants of thermal sensation and evaluation. In our analysis, wind condition showed a significant indirect effect on comfort through subjective perception. Statistical modelling showed that subjective perceptions on microclimate condition and comfort are moderated by various aspects of environmental quality. The findings of this study help inform future design for climate resilience in outdoor urban spaces in hot-humid subtropical cities. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","environmental quality; high-density; Outdoor thermal comfort; thermal sensation; urban microclimate","Thermal comfort; Tropics; Urban planning; Environmental conditions; Environmental quality; Meteorological condition; Microclimate conditions; Outdoor thermal comfort; Subjective perceptions; Thermal sensations; Urban microclimate; Sensory perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050341529

The energy use rate of the traditional cooling and heating unit is low. A distributed cooling, heating, and power (CHP) system can achieve cascade use of energy and reduce the long-distance transportation of energy. Along with the wide use of ground-source heat pumps and energy storage technology, the combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system coupled with a ground-source heat pump and energy storage technology is increasingly being used. Firstly, we proposed the construction of a CCHP system driven by distributed energy resources (DERs) including three subsystems of an electricity subsystem, a CCHP subsystem and an auxiliary heating subsystem as the object of study in this paper. Besides, with the goals of reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and minimizing system cost, a constraint mechanism based on the DOM-PSO (dynamic object method/particle swarm optimization) algorithm was applied. Finally, taking Tianjin Eco-City as an example, we used the PSO algorithm to analyze the operating characteristics of the cold and power cogeneration system under the uncertainty of the wind power output. The simulation results show that the joint optimization mode operation strategy can balance the results of different optimization modes by increasing the robust coefficient of wind power. Of all scenarios examined, the CCHP system coupled with the ground-source heat pump and energy storage technology performed best. © 2019 by the authors.","Distributed energy; Energy storage; Ground-source heat pump; PSO algorithm; Robust scheduling optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060392071

However, the responses of plant metallic nutrients to climate warming have been rarely addressed. Furthermore, in previous field investigations, the influence of temperature on plant metallic nutrients has been not effectively separated from that of precipitation; hence, there exists some uncertainties in the relationships between plant metallic nutrients and temperature. To minimize the effect of precipitation, this study collected plant samples over broad geographical scale along the 400 mm isohyet in China with a temperature span of 14.8 °C. The temperature effects on variations in leaf potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were assessed. For all species pooled together, leaf Ca and Mg kept relatively stable, whereas leaf K, Fe, Mn and Zn decreased with increasing temperature. The responses of leaf Ca, Mg and Mn to changing temperature were almost similar at functional group, genus and species levels and independent of vegetation and soil type. It suggested that the relationships between leaf Ca, Mg and Mn and temperature should be general results. However, the patterns of leaf K, Fe and Zn vs. temperature varied across functional groups, genera and species and were affected by vegetation and soil type, which indicated that the observed patterns were local phenomena. Our results suggested that global warming might have no effect on leaf Ca and Mg, but could decrease leaf K, Fe, Mn and Zn. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Isohyet; Metallic nutrients; Temperature gradient","Global warming; Metals; Temperature; Thermal gradients; Vegetation; Changing temperature; Climate warming; Field investigation; Geographical scale; Increasing temperatures; Isohyet; Plant nutrients; Temperature span; Nutrients; calcium; iron; magnesium; manganese; potassium; zinc; metal; rain; global warming; metal; nutrient dynamics; plant; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; temperature effect; temperature gradient; uncertainty analysis; Amaranthus retroflexus; Article; biological variation; China; climate change; controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental temperature; geography; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant nutrient; plant yield; Plantago; Plantago depressa; precipitation; priority journal; Setaria viridis; soil; temperature sensitivity; vegetation; chemistry; plant; temperature; China; China; Metals; Plant Leaves; Plants; Rain; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050496447

Building from no prior coverage to a sparse array, deployments are based on prior knowledge of water mass properties, mean frontal locations, mean circulation and eddy variability, winds, air-sea heat/freshwater/carbon exchange, prior Argo trajectories, and float simulations in the Southern Ocean State Estimate and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Twelve floats deployed from the 2014–2015 Polarstern cruise from South Africa to Antarctica are used as a test case to evaluate the deployment strategy adopted for SOCCOM's 20 deployment cruises and 126 floats to date. After several years, these floats continue to represent the deployment zones targeted in advance: (1) Weddell Gyre sea ice zone, observing the Antarctic Slope Front, and a decadally-rare polynya over Maud Rise; (2) Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) including the topographically steered Southern Zone chimney where upwelling carbon/nutrient-rich deep waters produce surprisingly large carbon dioxide outgassing; (3) Subantarctic and Subtropical zones between the ACC and Africa; and (4) Cape Basin. Argo floats and eddy-resolving HYCOM simulations were the best predictors of individual SOCCOM float pathways, with uncertainty after 2 years of order 1,000 km in the sea ice zone and more than double that in and north of the ACC. © 2018.

Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) are linked to increases in premature mortality, and the simultaneous control of both pollutants through modified combustion strategies presents a significant challenge. In this work, the effects of displacing diesel fuel with hydrogen on exhaust emissions were investigated in both a single cylinder research engine and in a demonstration vehicle. In the initial stage, tests were undertaken on a supercharged, direct injection, single cylinder diesel research engine at different engine loads, intake air pressures and EGR levels. Hydrogen was aspirated with the intake air, and EGR was simulated by supplying the intake pipe with compressed nitrogen gas. The results showed a reduction in CO2 and particulate emissions with increasing H2 addition, and an increase in NOx emissions at H2 levels greater than 10% of the total input energy to the engine. The next stage involved tests on a chassis dynamometer with a small van equipped with the multi-cylinder version of the single cylinder research engine. The van was fitted with a programmable H2 augmentation system, with H2 addition levels specified by accelerator pedal position. During full drive cycle tests conducted with and without H2 augmentation up to 10%, an average rate of 1 kW of H2 was supplied to the engine. With H2 augmentation, over the total drive-cycle, reductions in CO, NOx and particle number were observed, but a higher total PM mass was recorded. © 2018 The Author(s)","Chassis dynamometer; Combustion; EGR; Emissions; Hydrogen; Particulates","Air intakes; Air pollution control; Air quality; Chassis; Combustion; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Dynamometers; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Augmentation systems; Chassis dynamometers; Comparative analysis; Emissions legislation; Particulates; Simultaneous control; Single cylinder engine; Single-cylinder research engines; Engine cylinders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057979708

We found that, in electrolytic CO2 reduction using an electrolytically plated Cu-Co electrode, a hydrocarbon product with high faradaic efficiency (FE) could be obtained with low-FE CO. The plated electrodes have a Co solid solution on the Cu surface. The non-localized Co changes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediate in CO2 reduction. Consequently, by increasing the Co content in Cu, HCOOH can be selectively produced. Further, in electrolytic CO2 reduction with an applied potential of − 1.19 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the selectivity of methane (CH4) production improved, while the selectivity of ethylene (C2H4) formation lowered. In the reduction using the plated electrode containing 14% Co, the FE of CH4 production reached the highest at 47.7%. These results suggested that mixing Co in Cu promotes the hydrogenation of CH2 * to CH3 * and inhibits the dimerization of CH2 * species. Furthermore, this research on plated electrodes is useful for the development of catalytic electrodes for electrolytic CO2 reduction.

In particular, academics' and practitioners' expectations have resulted in notable initiatives that incorporate sustainability assessment in managerial decision-making. The sustainability paradigm investigates practices and policies that simultaneously account for economic, environmental, and social aspects. Drawing on the perspective of a sustainability-conscious decision maker, this paper centers on the evaluation of logistical locations with capacitated production levels through a two-phase assessment procedure. To design a supervisory framework to measure the sustainability performance of the supplying facilities under investigation, we develop a double bootstrap data envelopment analysis model with undesirable factors in the first phase. We, then, use the obtained bias-corrected efficiency estimates in the second phase to establish sustainability-based policies in the context of facility location problems. The proposed model is applied to an energy case study of fossil fuel power plants in the United States. We present empirical evidence corroborating a considerable difference between the results of the case where the decision maker explores the environmental and social impacts of the power plants and the conventional formulation by which only financial outcomes are considered. Our numerical findings reveal that the proposed approach substantially diminishes greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of slight increases in total expenses. In addition to such an improvement in the environmental efficiency, we provide evidence of a dramatic enhancement in the social performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Capacitated facility location problem; Double bootstrap data envelopment analysis; Energy sector; Sustainability performance measurement","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; nitrous oxide; bootstrapping; data envelopment analysis; decision making; design; error correction; facility location; fossil fuel; performance assessment; power generation; sustainability; Article; bootstrapping; carbon footprint; decision making; electric power plant; energy yield; performance measurement system; social aspect; United States; decision making; electric power plant; productivity; United States; Decision Making; Efficiency; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054174992

The conversion rate was calculated at each reaction time by analyzing the results of in-situ gas measurement inside the iron ore sintering reactor during the combustion. Both the emission of NO and the conversion rate were found to be higher in the lower-temperature region in the combustion layer, corresponding to the beginning of coke combustion.

Classical Realist ethical analysis differs from ideal normative theory in that it addresses state decision-makers rather than individuals, assumes highly imperfect compliance with the demands of justice, and is concerned with feasibility and transition rather than end-states. Classical Realists urge leaders to prioritise state security over private moral concerns, to assess rival policies against their likely consequences and to seek the 'lesser evil' among feasible choices. But how does Realism respond when the prudent pursuit of state security risks rendering much of the planet uninhabitable? In the 1950s, the development of the hydrogen bomb created just such a dilemma as status quo politics now carried a significant risk of thermonuclear omnicide. In response, Hans Morgenthau argued that states should manage systemic risk by working in concert to safeguard expanded, collective national interests. The Classical Realist mode of thought suggests an analogous response to systemic climate risks: States' conceptions of national interest must expand to include cooperative system-preservation alongside traditional security concerns. Classical Realist arguments might then be mobilised to overcome resistance from vested interests and to support state-directed low carbon innovation, adaptation and mitigation agreements that prioritise ambition over distributional justice. © 2018 British International Studies Association.","Climate Change; Consequentialism; Paris Agreement; Realism; Solar Geoengineering",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052660660

Located between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, Indonesia is mostly influenced by some climate variabilities, such as the monsoon, El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). These climate variabilities affect significantly on the Indonesian rainfall that further increase the chances of crop failure, specifically on the tobacco yield over Temanggung Regency which is known as the producer of good quality tobacco in Indonesia. Tobacco needs a sufficient dry condition prior to the harvest stage due to maintains its productivity and leaf quality. This ideal condition could be achieved when the dry season, typically in the mid of the year for Temanggung, is not affected by any wet climate variability. Moreover, based on this study, it was found that there was the most remarkable decline in tobacco productivity in 2016 since the required dry condition was interrupted by the prolonged significant rainfall which depicted by strong mid-year negative-IOD indices. The analysis utilized the dataset of tobacco productivity, daily rainfall intensity, and the indices of monsoon, ENSO, and IOD for the period of seven years, from 2010-2016. This study concludes that the climate variabilities give a huge contribution to the profitable tobacco cultivation. Furthermore, efforts to adapt and to mitigate the impacts of the climate variability in Indonesia, specifically for the agriculture sector, is needed by way of increasing the various stakeholder's knowledge that involved in policy planning and decision-making as well as involving the farmers in the training on climate adaptation and mitigation. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Cultivation; Decision making; Ocean currents; Productivity; Rain; Tobacco; Agriculture sectors; Climate variability; Climate variability and change; Daily rainfall; Dry condition; El Nino southern oscillation; Indian ocean dipoles; Policy planning; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063051141

The state and ratio of elements on the surface at different probing depth was revealed using variable radiation energy. A non-uniform in-depth distribution of silver and copper states was established. Two silver states were detected on the initial surface: (1) highly oxidized Ag &gt;1+ ions from AgCuO 2 lattice and (2) impurity Ag 0 metallic species. The appearance of metallic species was related to AgCuO 2 surface reduction by adsorbed carbon admixtures during air-storage. It was shown that highly oxidized copper species can be identified by the analysis of shake-up satellites in Cu2p region during step-by-step exposure to X-rays. This approach, considering all spectral changes versus time, allowed us to reveal the presence of copper with the oxidation level higher than +2 on the initial AgCuO 2 surface. It was found that a long-term exposure to intense X-rays significantly modifies the composition and state of the AgCuO 2 surface. Possible causes of such modification are discussed in relation to the AgCuO 2 reaction properties. © 2018","Ag 2 Cu 2 O 4; AgCuO 2; High-valent copper; Mixed silver-copper oxide; Synchrotron radiation; XPS","Oxidation; Photoelectrons; Photons; Synchrotron radiation; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Ag2Cu2O4; AgCuO2; Depth distribution; Long term exposure; Shake-up satellite; Silver-copper oxides; Surface reduction; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies; Copper oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052447708

This approach is based on the construction of the distribution function of grains in their size for a set of regions in which the temperature gradient is sufficiently small. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to avoid calculating formation and growth of a single embryo and to proceed to modeling the structure in a relatively large cell, which can significantly reduce computational costs. To solve the problem of determining the distribution function of temperature fields, it is proposed to use a new approach based on integral heat transfer equations; this allows, on one hand, estimating the accuracy of calculations by the mismatch vector and, on the other hand, averaging thermophysical characteristics in a natural way and solving the problem on large-scale grid splits. Owing to the nonlinearity of the task and the need to use iterative procedures, integral equations provide the necessary conditions for their convergence. As a result of creating specialized software and carrying out a series of numerical calculations, it is possible to theoretically determine the necessary conditions for heat treatment for products made from steel of a particular grade: size and power of the heating inductor, the speed of its movement, the type of coolant and its feed rate, the depth of the hardened layer, etc.; as a result, this will make it possible to determine in advance the structure of the heat-treatable layer and reduce the total costs of experimental work. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","heat treatment; mathematical modeling; microstructure of material; reinforcing phase; software","Abstracting; Computer software; Control nonlinearities; Cost reduction; Distribution functions; Heat transfer; Heat treatment; Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Computational costs; Heat transfer equations; High carbon steels; Large scale grids; Numerical calculation; Reinforcing phase; Specialized software; Thermophysical characteristics; Integral equations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065563919

Geoengineering offers an immediate response to climate change which might instantly offset these “dangerous” impacts by deliberately altering the climate system to cool the planet. This arguably places geoengineering experts at the centre of future climate change and security policies. Based on empirical data from interviews with renowned geoengineering scientists, this article explores how these geoengineering specialists label and delimit their work when seeking to claim scientific expertise and autonomy from security politics, while arguing for the relevance of their research on climate change. The study shows an ambiguity between how the geoengineering specialists see the scientific potential of their research, and their unease towards the security applications of this very research. A clear distinction between “geoengineering” and “geopolitics” is drawn and upheld using different rhetorical styles, but dissolves when personal strategies and security politics emerge. On this background, the article discusses the imaginary boundary between (security) politics and (geoengineering) expertise, and suggests more transparent and reflexive science in society. © 2019, © 2019 The Royal Danish Geographical Society.","boundary work; climate change; expertise; Geoengineering; securitization","climate change; environmental policy; environmental research; perception; politics; security; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061229443

Although a number of studies have addressed responses of plant phenology to warming and altered precipitation individually, their interactions can alter plant phenology differently than either does independently. To explore how the interactions between global change drivers alter alpine ecosystems, we conducted a factorial experiment manipulating warming (ambient and +2°C) and altered precipitation (50% decrease, control, and 50% increase) simultaneously in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Over two years, we monitored plant phenological events, leaf-out day and first flowering day, for 11 common plant species that account for 74.4% of the total above biomass. Surprisingly, there was no interaction between warming and changes in precipitation on community plant phenology, but warming advanced leaf-out and first flowering day by 7.10 and 9.79 d, respectively. Unlike the community response, plant functional groups had a variety of direct and interactive responses to the experimental climate drivers. While the phenology of legumes was most influenced by temperature, temperature and precipitation interacted to alter the phenology of grasses and forbs. To explore how plant phenological sensitivity on the Tibetan Plateau is compared with other meadow ecosystems, we combined our dataset with a global plant phenology dataset. Interestingly, the phenological sensitivity of leaf-out day and first flowering day on the Tibetan Plateau is 7.3 and 37.8 times greater than global phenological sensitivity, respectively. This result highlights that a meta-analysis of global phenological sensitivity may significantly underestimate change in some regions—even regions as large as the Tibetan Plateau. Together, our results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may experience rapid change as temperatures warm and that these changes will likely be more rapid than in other regions of the world. Further, our study highlights that if we are to make accurate predictions of how plant phenology may change with warming, we need to understand the specific environmental cues that drive phenological responses across different areas. © 2019 The Authors.","alpine meadow; altered precipitation; climate change; global warming; phenological sensitivity; plant functional groups; Tibetan Plateau",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061093720

However, it is largely unknown whether this warming urban climate may modify the short-term effects of air pollution. Objectives: To test whether warmer urban climates intensify the acute mortality effects of air pollution on pneumonia in Hong Kong. Methods: Participants who died of pneumonia from a prospective Chinese elderly cohort between 1998 and 2011 were selected as cases. Urban climatic (UC) classes of cases were determined by an established Urban Climatic Map according to their residential addresses. UC classes were first dichotomized into cool and warm climates and case-crossover analysis was used to estimate the short-term association of pneumonia mortality with air pollution. We further classified UC classes into climate quartiles and used case-only analysis to test the trend of urban climate modification on the short-term association of pneumonia mortality with air pollution. Results: Among 66,820 elders (≥65 years), 2208 pneumonia deaths (cases) were identified during the 11–14 years of follow-up. The effects of air pollution for cases residing in the warm climate were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) higher than those living in the cool climate. There was an increasing linear trend of urban climate modification on the association of pneumonia mortality with NO 2 (nitrogen dioxide) (p for trend = 0.035). Compared to climate Quartile 1 (the lowest), deaths resided in climate Quartile 2, 3, and 4 (the highest) were associated with an additional percent change of 9.07% (0.52%, 17.62%), 12.89% (4.34%, 21.43%), and 8.45% (−0.10%, 17.00%), respectively. Conclusions: Warmer urban climate worsened the acute mortality effects of pneumonia associated with air pollutants in Hong Kong. Our findings suggest that warmer urban climate introduced by climate change and urbanization may increase the risks of air pollution-related pneumonia. © 2018","Air pollution; Case-crossover study; Case-only study; Nested case-control study; Pneumonia; Urban climate map","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Nitrogen oxides; Air pollutants; Case crossovers; Case-control study; Nitrogen dioxides; Pneumonia; Short-term effects; Urban climates; Warm climates; Climate change; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; climate change; health risk; map; mortality; pneumonia; urban climate; urbanization; aged; air pollution; Article; climate change; environmental temperature; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; mortality; pneumonia; priority journal; seasonal variation; urbanization; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; environmental exposure; epidemiology; pneumonia; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; China; Hong Kong; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Hong Kong; Humans; Mortality; Pneumonia; Prospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050469638

The variability of urban heat islands (VUHIs) is known to influence the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies; however, the understanding of VUHIs is still limited. Here, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal VUHIs in 245 Chinese cities that varied in population and physical size based on the remotely sensing data from 2002 to 2012. Taking the 2012 VUHIs as an example, we examined the relationships between VUHIs and underlying drivers of background climate and urbanization. The results showed that: (1) the VUHIs from 2002 to 2012 had obvious periodicity in different years while significant diurnal and seasonal variability; (2) the explanation rates of local background climate for the diurnal VUHIs were 30% (spring), 19% (summer), 29% (autumn), and 25% (winter), respectively; (3) the explanation rates of urbanization for the diurnal VUHIs were 13% (spring), 22% (summer), 11% (autumn), and 21% (winter), respectively; (4) these two variables also accounted for 32% and 12% of the seasonal VUHIs during the daytime, and 25% and 23% during the nighttime, respectively. Our research suggests that the improvement of urban climate-change adaptation necessitates local “climate-smart” strategies, a reduction in local anthropogenic heat emissions, and rational use of green planning for sustainable urban development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic heat; Energy consumption; Global warming; Urban green; Urban warming; Urbanization","Atmospheric temperature; Energy utilization; Global warming; Population statistics; Adaptation strategies; Anthropogenic heat; Climate change adaptation; Seasonal variability; Sustainable urban development; Urban green; Urban warming; Urbanization; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056192397

The complexes are related to [Re(CO)3Cl(dppz)] (dppz = dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine) but have an additional nitrogen heteroatom in the distal phenazine (phz) aromatic ring of the dppz ligand which is known to promote potential photoinduced CO2 binding and reduction in related complexes. We use Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV/Visible, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopies to investigate how the location of the additional nitrogen atom, and how the nature of the substituents affects the photophysical properties. In addition, the one electron reduced catalysts are generated following bulk electrochemical reduction and characterised in CH2Cl2. TRIR experiments in d6-DMSO, CH3CN, CH2Cl2, THF and toluene reveal that excitation generates a 3MLCT(phz) (phz = phenazine) excited state in all compounds. In CH3CN and d6-DMSO (not for [Re(CO)3Cl(dppp2)]), we observe the concomitant formation of an 3IL ππ* (IL = intra ligand) excited state. For [Re(CO)3Cl(dppp2)] and [Re(CO)3Cl(dppp3)] in toluene, a mixture of 3MLCT(phen) (phen = phenanthroline) and 3MLCT(phz) states appear to form together, and decay at the same rate. Inclusion of an nitrogen atom in the phz moiety of the dppz ligand lowers the ‘phz’ localised lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy potentially favouring population of the 3MLCT(phz) state. This effect is more pronounced for [Re(CO)3Cl(dppp3)] with a more positive reduction potential (E½ = −1.16 vs Fc+/Fc in CH2Cl2) compared to [Re(CO)3Cl(dppp2)] (E½ = −1.20 V vs Fc+/Fc in CH2Cl2). For [Re(CO)3Cl(dppp2Br)], lowering of the LUMO energy results in an even more positive potential (E½ = −1.10 vs Fc+/Fc in CH2Cl2) and this can be seen to affect the photophysics. We find the excited state lifetime for each complex increases with decreasing dielectric constant, where their lifetime in toluene is greater than 100 times longer than that observed in d6-DMSO. © 2018","CO2reduction; Electrochemistry; IR spectroscopy; Photophysics; Time-resolved IR","Bromine compounds; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Chlorine compounds; Electrochemistry; Electrolytic reduction; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Excited states; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Infrared spectroscopy; Ligands; Molecular orbitals; Nitrogen; Paramagnetic resonance; Synthesis (chemical); Toluene; CO2reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR); Fourier transform infrared; Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital; Photophysics; Time resolved infrared spectroscopy; Time-resolved; Rhenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057122729

Also, the predictions of the models correlated well with the observed concentrations as shown by the average values of R (0.8) and index of agreement (0.74). Additionally, when some PM10 and PM2.5 reduction scenarios were modelled, the ML models predicted various degree of reductions in the roadside concentrations. In conclusion, well trained ANN and BRT models can be successfully applied in predictions of roadside PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. Moreover, they can be applied in measuring the effectiveness of roadside particle reduction scenarios. © 2019","Air quality; Boosted regression trees; Machine learning; Neural networks; Particulate matter; Traffic emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049444107

However, a rising consumption of natural gas leads to increased import dependency, while greenhouse gas emissions are only reduced by a fraction. Renewable methane, as could be produced by biogas and sewage treatment plants, offers an interesting substitute for natural gas. This article assesses the potentially available amount of methane from the existing plant stock within an Austrian region. It further analyses the production costs of existing biogas and sewage treatment plants according to type of upgrading and injection. The results show average production costs of 115.6 € MWh−1 (biogas plants), 150.4 € MWh−1 (sewage treatment plants) and 105.4 € MWh−1 (collective plant systems). Despite the higher production costs when compared to natural gas, expanding the domestic production capacity of renewable gas can be advantageous. Due to the regional increase in value-added, revenues resulting from the production of methane provide valuable income, especially in economically lagging regions. In order to maintain the infrastructure in future, it is necessary that renewables use the natural gas grid. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomethane; Energy union; Natural gas substitute; Production costs; Renewable methane","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas substitutes; Sewage treatment plants; Biogas plants; Biomethane; Domestic production; Energy union; Natural gas grids; Plant systems; Primary energy source; Production cost; Natural gasoline plants; anaerobic digestion; biogas; economic analysis; greenhouse gas; methane; natural gas; nonrenewable resource; power generation; wastewater treatment plant; Australia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053156230

Most pavement designs are based on historical climate variables such as temperature and precipitation that are already changing across much of the United States, and do not reflect projected trends. As pavements are typically designed to last 20 years or more, designs that do not account for current and future trends can result in reduced performance. However, incorporating climate projections into pavement design is not a trivial exercise. Significant mismatches in both spatial and temporal scale challenge the integration of the latest global climate model simulations into pavement models. This study provides a national-level overview of what the impact of climate change to flexible pavement could look like, and where regional focus should be placed. It also demonstrates a new approach to developing high-resolution spatial and temporal projections that generates hourly information at the scale of individual weather stations, and applies this as input to the AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design™ model. The impact of three different future climates on pavement performance and time to reach failure thresholds in 24 locations across the United States are quantified. Changes to projected pavement performance differ by location, but nearly all result in decreased performance under current design standards. The largest increases in distress are observed for permanent deformation measures, especially toward the end of the century under greater increases in temperature. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,"Climate models; Groundwater; Pavement overlays; Climate projection; Climatic conditions; Failure thresholds; Flexible pavement designs; Flexible pavements; Global climate model simulations; Pavement performance; Permanent deformations; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060955637

In assimilating the new data into accepted theories, K. S. Davis treated the land-forms of non-temperate climatic regions as deviants from the ŉormal’ scheme. In Germany each climatic region was thought to have its own assemblage of characteristic landforms and sequences of development. There are three central themes which require discussion in any treatment of climatic geomorphology. They are: the view that landforms differ significantly between different climatic areas; that these differences are the result of areal variations in climatic parameters and their effect on weathering and run-off; and that, though considerable, climatic changes in Quaternary times have not disguised the climate-landform relationship. © 1969 Methuen & Co.

In the European Union (EU), ambitious targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emission are linked to aspirations of fostering green growth at national and regional levels. These aspirations have been manifested in a recent radical policy change through the introduction of the smart specialisation research and innovation strategy (RIS3) for national and regional development. The novelty of the RIS3 compared with previous EU innovation policy is that it aims to develop regional competitiveness based on the harnessing of regional assets rather than focusing on the provision of innovation infrastructure. In this article, the authors employ a mixed-methods research approach both to explore the nature and content of energy-related priority settings in RIS3 strategies in the EU and to address the question of regions’ abilities to foster renewable energy through their place-based strategies. The article contributes to the literature on policy strategies for realising EU energy and emissions targets and the RIS3 aim of developing competitive advantages. The main conclusions are that energy-related priority settings vary substantially within RIS3, and that regional innovation policy ambitions may be hindered by unconducive policy frameworks at national levels. © 2018, © 2018 Norwegian Geographical Society.","Catriona Turner; Europe; innovation policy; regional development; renewable energy; Rune Njøs; smart specialisation","alternative energy; European Union; innovation; policy reform; regional development; specialization; Europe; Catriona",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058715563

The damaging effects of air pollution in general have been known in Germany for several centuries. For Germany, the problem of transboundary air pollutants is largely an issue of protecting German forests and advancing the state of technology to reduce emissions. Since the 1950s, regulation of air pollutants has periodically appeared on the German policy agenda and led to a series of public statements and actual regulations. German policy on transboundary air pollution changed considerably over time. Beginning with a long history of scientific research into the causes and effects in the vicinity of emitters, Germany began to develop air quality regulations which were health-based and technology-driven. © Arild Underdal and Kenneth Hanf 2000.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077607408

One approach to offset carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions may be to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by reducing soil disturbance by changing from conventional tillage (CT) to no tillage (NT). In this analysis, the cost to increase SOC sequestration achieved on cropland by changing from CT to NT is estimated. The marginal cost of increasing SOC is determined by the amount SOC can be increased and the difference in profit of changing from conventional to no-till. Landowner costs and profit are derived from crop enterprise budgets, county yield data, and regional crop prices. A risk factor is also used to increase the cost of no-till adoption to account for the apparent reluctance of landowners to adopt no-till. The SOC sequestration potential on corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) cropland combined is about 49.1 Tg CO 2  year −1 (1 Tg = 10 12  g) of which 47.6 Tg CO 2  year −1 (nearly 97%) could be attained for less than $20-Mg −1 CO 2 (1 Mg = 10 6  g).

The majority of strains carry out oxygenic photosynthesis (water-oxidizing, oxygen-evolving, plant-like photosynthesis). With few exceptions, they synthesize chlorophyll a as the major photosynthetic pigment and phycobiliproteins as light-harvesting pigments. They fix CO2 as the sole source of carbon using primarily the reductive pentose phosphate pathway. Their chemoorganotrophic potential generally is restricted to the mobilization of reserve polymers during dark periods. They display some of the most sophisticated morphological differentiation among bacteria, and many species are truly multicellular organisms. Cyanobacteria have left fossil remains as old as 2000-3500 million years, are ultimately responsible for the oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere, and constitute the evolutionary ancestry of the photosynthesizing plastids of algae and higher plants. Today, with a global biomass estimated to exceed 1015 g, they contribute importantly to the global primary production of the oceans and become locally dominant in many extreme environments. Blooms of cyanobacteria are important features for the ecology and management of many eutrophic fresh and brackish water bodies. The aerobic nitrogen-fixing capacity of some makes them important players in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle of tropical oceans, terrestrial environments, and in some agricultural practices. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Very recent studies, however, have shown that the apparent health effects are associated with different particle chemical constituents and different emission sources. For this article, Beijing and Guangdong have been used, two typical geographic districts located in North and South China, respectively, which have high PM2.5 pollution levels as case examples. The chemical compositions and source contributions are expected to be different at these two locations. The annual PM2.5 concentration in Beijing was found to be 101 µg m-3, twice the level of 50 µg m- 3 measured in Guangdong. The percentages of crustal elements and nitrate in the PM2.5 were higher in Beijing, and the relative contribution of sulfate was higher in Guangdong. The contributions of coal combustion and road dust were much higher in Beijing, whereas contributions for vehicle emissions were similar between the two districts. The human health effects from PM2.5 in North China may be greater than that in South China. Both natural (sandstorms) and anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 can lead to extreme high pollution events in Beijing, but because of their distinctly different source contributions, natural and anthropogenic sources can have dissimilar effects on respiratory deaths. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the effects of land use and climate change on SOC, a heuristic cellular automaton (HCA) model was proposed and applied to a plains area in eastern China with a high population density and rapid urbanization rate. The HCA model was designed to simulate the geographical variation in SOC dynamics over the long term (2080), and lateral carbon (C) migration is represented by revised neighbourhood variables at the macro scale. Three widely used soil mapping techniques were applied for comparison: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM) and kriging with external drift (KED). The HCA model enhanced the accuracy of the predicted SOC by 15.27% over MLR, 12.31% over SVM and 10.98% over KED. Future land use maps were produced using legacy land use data and artificial neural network-based cellular automata (CA), and the simulation results showed the rapid urbanization of this area, where the percentage of cropland declined by 23.75% and that of village/urban areas increased by 22.90% from 2010 to 2080. The overall SOC concentrations are anticipated to increase by 2080 given the rising mean annual air temperature and mean annual precipitation. Our results also suggested that land use change clearly influenced the change in soil C, with village/urban areas exhibiting higher SOC than cropland. To provide stakeholders with accurate soil information, it is important to understand the comprehensive impacts of land use and climate change on soil evolution; this study illustrates the value of integrating pedogenetic information in soil C simulation models. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Carbon migration; Soil carbon sequestration; Spatial prediction; Urbanization","agricultural soil; artificial neural network; carbon sequestration; cellular automaton; climate change; land use change; mapping method; organic carbon; population density; prediction; soil carbon; spatial analysis; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054430438

Exploring this spatial association and dependence is conducive to the implementation of effective and coordinated policies for regional level CO2 reduction. This study calculated CO2 emissions from 2005-2016 in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration with the IPAT model, and empirically explored the spatial structure pattern and association effect of CO2 across the area leveraged by the social network analysis. The findings revealed the following: (1) The spatial structure of CO2 emission in the area is a complex network pattern, and in the sample period, the CO2 emission association relations increased steadily and the network stabilization remains strengthened; (2) the centrality of the cities in this area can be categorized into three classes: Chengdu and Chongqing are defined as the first class, the second class covers Deyang, Mianyang, Yibin, and Nanchong, and the third class includes Zigong, Suining, Meishan, and Guangan-the number of cities in this class is on the rise; (3) the network is divided into four subgroups: the area around Chengdu, south Sichuan, northeast Sichuan, and west Chongqing where the spillover effect of CO2 is greatest; and (4) the higher density of the global network of CO2 emission considerably reduces regional emission intensity and narrows the differences among regions. Individual networks with higher centrality are also found to have lower emission intensity. © 2018 by the authors.","Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration; CO2 emission; Effect; Social network; Spatial association","agglomeration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; network analysis; quantitative analysis; social network; spatial analysis; spillover effect; urban area; Chengdu; China; China; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059040177

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bounded with ultrafine particles were investigated as well. A total of 188 graded PM in four-stage size segregated aerosol particles were collected and analyzed by GC-MS in 2016 to investigate the sources and distribution patterns of PAHs in metropolis-Beijing. A significant seasonal variation of 16 PAHs in PM2.5 around in Beijing was observed with 32.93 ± 15.19 ng m−3, 17.77 ± 8.08 ng m−3, 31.61 ± 12.67 ng m−3 and 78.06 ± 40.97 ng m−3 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. The ratio of SO2/NO2 demonstrated that vehicle emissions significantly contributed to air pollution. On the contrary, the lower ratio of PM2.5/CO showed high direct discharge from combustion. Seasonal distribution patterns of PM0.2/PM2.5 suggested that abundant secondary aerosols were produced in the autumn and winter. The spread of pollutants was not significant in winter. Both the combustion of fuel and coal were the primary sources of PM2.5-bound PAHs. A health risk assessment was represented by benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaPeq) indicating potential cancer risk in Beijing. Furthermore, the lifetime excess cancer risk (ECR) was 3.00 × 10−4, which was higher than the guidelines of USEPA and European Commission, indicating high carcinogenic risk of PM2.5 in Beijing. Therefore, more strictly control measures should be taken to reduce PAHs emissions from coal and vehicle. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Fractions; Health risk assessment; Particulate matter; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); Sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048971756

Here, we explored the systematic effects of urbanization on China's health and environmental nexus based on survey data. Then, we optimized the diets of 18 age-gender groups to reduce carbon emissions, water consumption, and land use while meeting the healthy nutrition goals of both DRI guidelines. The results showed that the optimal diets based on the DRI 2013 outperformed these on DRI 2000 in improving China's environmental sustainability, although these diets did not always perform better at an individual scale.

This paper deals with a specific network flow problem where the mixed municipal waste as a secondary and partly renewable energy carrier is transported from waste producers (municipalities), through pre-processing facilities, to its final treatment in waste processing units and in which the optimal flow is desired. The results obtained for the minimum total costs, including treatment and transportation, correspond to production and savings of a certain amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases which is described by Global Warming Potential (GWP). The average cost was 74 EUR/t and average GWP was 37 kg CO2eq/t. The GWP contribution varies among the waste producers as a result of treating waste in different places and various technologies. However, to identify the individual contributions, the detailed waste flow identification is required. The flow distribution is unknown due to the effect of merging and splitting waste streams in the network. For this reason, a consequent network flow problem for exact waste flows identification is proposed. The model follows the principle ideas of multi-commodity network flow modelling and it reveals the variability of cost and GWP contribution for all producers in the investigated area. The proposed method has been tested through a case study considering treatment of mixed municipal waste. The results obtained by the original implementation in GAMS are presented and discussed in detail. The GWP contribution varied between −173 and 880 kg CO2eq/t and significant waste producers were identified in the network regarding GWP. The results are important for setting the target for emission reduction in individual regions and for particular producers. The principle can be applied in general to any commodity and network flow problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity allocation; Flow identification; GWP contribution analysis; Multi-commodity; Reverse logistics; Waste network flow","Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Logistics; Supply chains; Capacity allocation; Contribution analysis; Multi-commodity; Network flows; Reverse logistics; Waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056175532

There is emerging consensus that slow-cycling SOM generally consists of relatively low molecular weight organic carbon substrates that enter the mineral soil as dissolved organic matter and associate with mineral surfaces (referred to as “mineral-associated OM,” or MAOM). However, much debate and contradictory evidence persist around: (a) whether the organic C substrates within the MAOM pool primarily originate from aboveground vs. belowground plant sources and (b) whether C substrates directly sorb to mineral surfaces or undergo microbial transformation prior to their incorporation into MAOM. Here, we attempt to reconcile disparate views on the formation of MAOM by proposing a spatially explicit set of processes that link plant C source with MAOM formation pathway. Specifically, because belowground vs. aboveground sources of plant C enter spatially distinct regions of the mineral soil, we propose that fine-scale differences in microbial abundance should determine the probability of substrate–microbe vs. substrate–mineral interaction. Thus, formation of MAOM in areas of high microbial density (e.g., the rhizosphere and other microbial hotspots) should primarily occur through an in vivo microbial turnover pathway and favor C substrates that are first biosynthesized with high microbial carbon-use efficiency prior to incorporation in the MAOM pool. In contrast, in areas of low microbial density (e.g., certain regions of the bulk soil), MAOM formation should primarily occur through the direct sorption of intact or partially oxidized plant compounds to uncolonized mineral surfaces, minimizing the importance of carbon-use efficiency, and favoring C substrates with strong “sorptive affinity.” Through this framework, we thus describe how the primacy of biotic vs. abiotic controls on MAOM dynamics is not mutually exclusive, but rather spatially dictated. Such an understanding may be integral to more accurately modeling soil organic matter dynamics across different spatial scales. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","mineral-associated organic matter; rhizodeposition; root carbon; shoot carbon; soil carbon; sorptive affinity; substrate use efficiency; terrestrial carbon cycle","aboveground biomass; carbon cycle; chemical composition; deposition; mineral; rhizosphere; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; substrate; carbon; mineral; organic compound; adsorption; bioremediation; carbon cycle; chemistry; metabolism; microbiology; plant; soil; Adsorption; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Minerals; Organic Chemicals; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057043781

The belowground rhizosphere pathway (that is, carbon exiting the living root) is theorized to form stable soil carbon more efficiently than the aboveground pathway. However, while several mechanisms have been invoked to explain this efficiency, few have been empirically tested or quantified. Here, we use soil microcosms with standardized carbon inputs to investigate three posited mechanisms that differentiate aboveground from belowground input pathways of dissolved organic carbon—through the microbial biomass—to the mineral-stabilized soil organic carbon pool: (1) the physical distance travelled, (2) the microbial abundance in the region in which a carbon compound enters (that is, rhizosphere versus bulk soil) and (3) the frequency and volume of carbon delivery (that is, infrequent ‘pulse’ versus frequent ‘drip’). We demonstrate that through the microbial formation pathway, belowground inputs form mineral-stabilized soil carbon more efficiently than aboveground inputs, partly due to the greater efficiency of formation by the rhizosphere microbial community relative to the bulk soil community. However, we show that because the bulk soil has greater capacity to form mineral-stabilized soil carbon due to its greater overall volume, the relative contributions of aboveground versus belowground carbon inputs depend strongly on the ratio of rhizosphere to bulk soil. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"biomass; carbon cycle; microbial activity; microbial community; microcosm; organic carbon; rhizosphere; soil carbon; soil stabilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056801633

Lignocellulose is the most abundant renewable resource on Earth, and it constitutes a large component of the wastes originating from municipal, agricultural, forestry, and some industrial sources. The more widespread geographical distribution of lignocellulose sources, compared to fossil reserves, can provide security of supply by using domestic sources of energy. The use of lignocellulosic materials would minimize the conflict between land use for food (and feed) production and energy feedstock production. Biofuels from lignocellulose generate low net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reducing environmental impact, particularly on climate change. Currently, some countries are producing ethanol from cellulosic feedstock at different development stages. The process for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bioethanol requires extensive processing, involving multiple steps for hydrolysis and fermentation. Feedstock availability, pretreatment, saccharification, fermentation, and ethanol recovery are all factors that influence the production and need R&D efforts for overall improvement of the production economics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

An economic analysis was conducted for the plantation, the environmental effect was calculated and the social outcome was determined. An environmental impact analysis (EIA) showed, that the biomass combustion process emits far fewer pollutants than coal: 8 times less carbon oxide and 6 times less sulfur dioxide. The environmental effect is significant due to the reduction of pollutant emissions. The willow Salix viminalis L. is a plant, which easily adapts to vegetation on any soil. The plant growing does not require any special agrotechnical treatment. By the establishment and maintenance of willow plantations can contribute to rural development, increase income and reduce unemployment in the country.

In this review, we synthesize information on changes in climate and hydrologic processes during the past century for the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau and discuss future projections for the 21st century. We develop midcentury projections of temperature and climate for the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau at timescales relevant to managers (2020 − 2050) and discuss concepts and strategies for adapting to the projected changes. For the instrumented record in the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (1985 − 2011), a temperature increase of 0.7 − 1.4°C has been documented, but changes in precipitation have been relatively minor with no clear trends. Climate projections for 2020 − 2050 indicate that temperatures will continue to increase, especially in winter and during the night. Precipitation is more difficult to project, and estimates range from an 11% decrease to 25% increase depending on location. Recent records indicate that the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau are becoming more arid, a trend that is projected to continue. Droughts are likely to become more frequent and last longer, invasive annual grasses are likely to continue to expand, and the duration and severity of wildfire seasons are likely to increase. Climate projections can help in developing adaptive management strategies for actual or expected changes in climate. Strategies include reducing the risks of nonnative invasive plant spread and wildfires that result in undesirable transitions, planning for drought, and where necessary, facilitating the transition of populations, communities, and ecosystems to new climatic conditions. A proactive approach to planning for and adapting to climate change is needed, and publicly available Internet-based resources on climate data and planning strategies are available to help meet that need. © 2018","changes in precipitation; climate adaptation; increasing aridity; managing for transitions; temperature increases","adaptive management; aridity; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; desert; environmental planning; grass; hydrological cycle; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; strategic approach; temperature effect; terrestrial deposit; wildfire; Columbia Plateau; Great Basin; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051973688

One such technology that has received considerable interest is hybrid electric vehicles. City buses are ideally suited for hybridization due to the potential to recover significant kinetic energy during the frequent stop/start events typically experienced by a city bus. The fuel economy and emissions benefits of a hybrid electric vehicle are largely determined by the performance of the energy management strategy employed on the vehicle. Within this paper, a specific hybrid electric bus is introduced, and a new fuzzy rule-based energy management strategy to determine the motor torque request during acceleration and cruise events is proposed. The proposed strategy is evaluated using a validated vehicle model and the MLTB drive cycle. Results from simulation indicate a 2.2% cumulative fuel consumption reduction in comparison to the existing energy management strategy present on the physical vehicle. The results from this test demonstrate that the proposed strategy is capable of reducing the fuel consumption and emissions on this vehicle. © 2018 IEEE.","Energy Management Strategy; Fuzzy Logic; Hybrid Bus; Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Parallel Hybrid; Public Transport","Buses; Electric railroads; Electric utilities; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Highway administration; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Railroads; Roads and streets; Ship propulsion; Ships; Emissions regulations; Energy management strategies; Existing energies; Fuel consumption reduction; Hybrid bus; Hybrid electric bus; Parallel hybrids; Public transport; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062072648

Techniques to improve food production in regions of harsh climate or vacillating weather include more efficient irrigation, climate-defensive agronomics, genetic improvements which resist unfavorable weather, and the management of crops with information systems. While rising energy costs and loss of prime farmland are slowly constraining conventional agriculture, they are also nudging many of the climate-independent food technologies closer towards cost-effectiveness and commercial reality. Irrigation, or artificially supplied water, is widely used to minimize the impact of excessively dry climate or unusually dry weather on food crop production. Native food supplies come in seasonal bursts, depend on marginal and fragile distribution paths, and are especially vulnerable to losses due to bad weather and unfavorable climate. © 1981 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Increasing pressures from sea-level rise (SLR) will influence the number, types, and value of ecosystem services expected in the future. These pressures combined with the geological history of Florida put the Everglades at the ""forefront of transition."" In the peat-based portions of the Everglades, where water depths can be altered either by changes in water elevation due to sea level and rainfall or by changes in elevation of the peat surface due to biophysical processes, slight changes in the depth and period of inundation can influence the presence and distributions of plant species and communities. As a flat, low-lying landscape, the conventional thinking is that Everglades coastal habitats will gradually migrate upslope with increases in sea level as a transgressive transition of saltwater into freshwater sawgrass marshes. Inland transgression of mangroves has been suggested as a means by which subtropical and tropical coastal landscapes will ""adapt"" to increasing sea-level rise (SLR). However, erosion of coastal peats, inundation ponding, and overstep (salt water encroachment too fast for all communities to retreat) has already been observed in the southeast saline Everglades. In several areas of coastal Everglades National Park, freshwater and oligohaline Everglades wetlands are expected to be exposed to increased duration and inundation of seawater, impacting processes that may lead to peat collapse. In some cases, the freshwater marsh has collapsed by some 0.5. m over a period of a few decades and has converted to an open water, mangrove-free environment. If coastal communities cannot adapt to the salinity changes associated with increasing sea levels, then significant coastal wetland loss may occur, dramatically altering and increasing the vulnerability of the south Florida coastline. Without restoration of freshwater flow to the Everglades, saltwater intrusion-induced peat collapse may be enhanced and landward migration of mangroves into freshwater peat soils stymied. © 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc..","Anthropocene; Mangrove; Peat collapse; Restoration; Sea-level rise; Transgression",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080633759

France has participated fully in all of the UNECE agreements on transboundary air pollution. French perceptions of transboundary air pollution are strongly conditioned by its unusual pattern of emissions. The publication of a German article on forest death in Der Spiegel in 1981 was followed by several French articles on air pollution and forests.

Energy-saving and emission-reduction policies have been proposed in the government's Five-Year Plans (FYPs) to achieve sustainable development. Yunnan (YN) province, which is in its economic infancy, is facing industrial structure adjustment and is a typical case of severe environmental degradation. In this study, a decoupling analysis was conducted to explore the performances of economic growth and environmental pressure during the period from 2006 to 2016. The author of this paper made an innovative use of the pollutant discharge fee (PDF) as the measure of environmental pressure and Gross domestic product (GDP) as the measure of economic growth. The trend analysis and decoupling analysis revealed that although YN has already transformed from a weak decoupling to a strong decoupling state in the long term, stable and strong decoupling cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, there was consistency between the decoupling conditions and the FYP cycle, all of which indicated that there was a shift from the target emissions to non-target emissions during the 11th (2006–2010) and 12th (2011–2015) FYPs. Thus, a single index for evaluating pollutant emissions cannot be adopted effectively to achieve adequate pollutant emission reduction. In addition, three industrial structures were considered in the decoupling analysis, which indicated that the tertiary industry will be a new key area for emission reduction, and the emissions of secondary industries have also been reduced. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decoupling analysis; Emission reduction; Gross domestic product; Industrial structure; Pollutant discharge fee","Emission control; Energy conservation; Sustainable development; Decoupling analysis; Emission reduction; Gross domestic products; Industrial structures; Pollutant discharges; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056181791

The lack of data for pre-commercial or newly-commercialised technologies has necessitated to the introduction of thermodynamic models giving mass and energy flows, especially in the case of bio-SNG. Limits due to geospatial case-specific constraints have been overcome by two studies introducing geographical information systems (GIS) based models to evaluate the impact of green gas production system on a regional level. Facility siting and sizing has been also found to be fundamentally important in evaluating the trade-off between profitability and environmental impact.

It is evident that anticipated increase in CO2, temperature, and altered precipitation are major consequences of climate change that has added the complexity and uncertainty to the plants and agroecosystem and threaten their sustainable management. Plant-microbe interactions are an important factor that influence the response of plants to alterations in climatic conditions. However, there are some beneficial plant-associated rhizobacteria and mycorrhiza that play an important role in reducing the ill-effects of climate change, such as drought, salinity, and plant diseases, etc. Apparently, it has been determined that climate change indirectly influences crop quality and plant-microbe relationships through the anthropogenic introduction of xenobiotics (pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.,) in terrestrial environments, posing risks to soil health by disturbing soil microbial enzyme activities and community structures. Considering the long-term effects of global climate change, it is essential to review the impacts of climate change on various life form sustaining components including soil-plant-microbe relationships with special reference to the belowground environment.

Acetogens are chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that perform reductive carbon fixation under anaerobic conditions through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP)/acetyl-coenzyme A pathway. The gene-encoding formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS), a key enzyme of this pathway, is highly conserved and can be used as a molecular marker to probe acetogenic communities. However, there is a lack of systematic collection of FTHFS sequence data at nucleotide and protein levels. In an attempt to streamline investigations on acetogens, we developed AcetoBase - a repository and database for systematically collecting and organizing information related to FTHFS sequences. AcetoBase also provides an opportunity to submit data and obtain accession numbers, perform homology searches for sequence identification and access a customized blast database of submitted sequences. AcetoBase provides the prospect to identify potential acetogenic bacteria, based on metadata information related to genome content and the WLP, supplemented with FTHFS sequence accessions, and can be an important tool in the study of acetogenic communities.

The book first discusses current physical understanding and modeling approaches of climate extremes (Chapters 2-6, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). Second, various methodologies to assess the impacts of climate extremes are presented, along with respective case studies, using state-of-the-art empirical, data-driven impact assessment methods, process-oriented impact models, or a combination of both (e.g., Chapters 7-11, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11). Third, challenges and opportunities of transdisciplinary research on weather and climate extremes and its complexities along with the human-environment nexus and coupled socio-ecological systems are presented (Chapters 12-17, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17). This includes, for instance, a discussion of different risk assessment approaches from a disaster risk reduction perspective, an overview of conflict dynamics, climate history, and challenges. The book concludes with an outlook (Chapter 18) on the need for more transdisciplinary work and global collaboration of scientists and practitioners to address emergent risks and extreme events and to improve risk reduction and resilience. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This approach treats energy as a strategic good that governments need to secure through political, diplomatic and economic involvement in energy trade. The geopolitical approach differs from the traditional EU stance to energy policy, which focuses on market liberalization, competition, and climate targets. Through an analysis of key policy documents and statements of top EU officials in charge of external energy policy, the article shows that the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) exemplifies a geopolitical approach to energy. In a second step, it highlights how the geopolitical logic that permeates the SGC has underplayed the important economic, technical and security challenges hindering the project. These challenges are compounded by Russia’s response, which aims at strengthening competition to SGC gas through new export pipelines (Turkish Stream). Finally, the article argues that, due to the multiple challenges faced by the geopolitical approach, the EU is more likely to achieve energy security through its traditional market liberal approach. As a large, integrated and well-regulated market, the EU can acquire sufficient and affordable energy resources by encouraging competition among external suppliers and by relying on the existing, underutilized import infrastructure. Furthermore, the implementation of the EU’s climate agenda makes long-term projects for the import of fossil fuels such as the SGC largely redundant. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"energy policy; European Union; geopolitics; liberalization; political economy; strategic approach; Caspian Basin; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039171455

Nevertheless, previous studies on decoupling analysis between economic growth and carbon emission were contextualized merely in individual countries rather than the globe, which are insufficient for developing the low-carbon economy as a global target. Carbon intensity (CI), carbon emission per capita (CP), and total carbon emission (TC) serve as three important indicators of the status of regional carbon emission, but only decoupling economic growth from TC was analyzed in previous studies. To close the two gaps, this study aims to investigate the global decoupling statuses of economic growth from not only TC but also CI and CP by using Tapio decoupling index. The decoupling statuses of 133 countries and income-level groups to which they are classified are identified using the data from 2000 to 2014. According to the results, it is observed that economic growth decouples from CI, CP, and TC in sequential order, which is called three-step decoupling. In the period, countries whose economic growth having decoupled from CI, CP, and TC, account for 74%, 35% and 21% respectively. Higher income-level group has the larger proportion of countries having reached their decoupling statuses. These findings may serve as valuable references for policy-makers to understand the current decoupling statuses and make three-step strategies if necessary towards the global low-carbon economy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; Decoupling status; Economic growth; Low-carbon economy; Three-step decoupling","Carbon; Environmental management; Renewable energy resources; Carbon emissions; Decoupling status; Economic growths; Low carbon economy; Three-step decoupling; Economic analysis; carbon emission; economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental economics; low income population; Article; carbon emission per capita; carbon footprint; carbon intensity; country economic status; economic development; environmental economics; environmental policy; geographic distribution; low carbon economy; priority journal; statistical analysis; Tapio decoupling index; developing country; economics; pollution; statistics and numerical data; carbon; Carbon; Developing Countries; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050497092

However, in-use performance consistently misses design specifications, particularly those of operational energy use and indoor environmental quality. This performance gap risks reducing design, technology, sustainability, economic, health and well-being benefits. In this paper, we compare settings of the Chinese and the UK buildings sectors and relate their historical context, design, construction and operation issues impacting energy performance, indoor environmental quality, occupant health and well-being. We identify a series of key, common factors of ‘total’ building performance across these two settings: the application of building regulations, the balance between building cost and performance, skills, construction and operation. The dynamic and complex interactions of these factors are currently poorly understood and lead to building performance gaps. We contend that a systems approach in the development of suitable building assessment methods, technologies and tools could enable the formulation and implementation of more effective policies, regulations and practices. The paper illustrates the application of the approach to the UK and Chinese settings. A full application of a systems approach may help to provide a more dynamic understanding of how factor interactions impact the ‘total’ building performance gaps and help address its multiple causes. © The Author(s) 2018.","Buildings; Built environment; China; Performance Gap; System dynamics; Systems thinking; UK","benzene; toluene; volatile organic compound; xylene; air quality; Article; building; building industry; carbon footprint; China; climate; construction work; cost control; energy conservation; environmental policy; government; health hazard; household; human; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; United Kingdom; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042522322

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for ascertaining any changes in streamflow over time. The developed model was calibrated over a seven-year period (2001-2007) and validated over another seven-year period (2008-2014). Any changes in streamflow were simulated for a combination of 10 land use and climate change cases, from 2015 to 2028, under the two scenarios of High and Low Demand for industrial wood pellets. Our results suggest that streamflow is relatively stable (<1% change) for land use and temperature-related cases relative to the base case of no change in land use and climate. However, changes in precipitation by ±10% lead to considerable changes (±25%) in streamflow relative to the base case. Based on our results, expected changes in precipitation due to the changing climate will determine any changes in the streamflow, rather than projected land use changes in the context of rising demand for industrial wood pellets for export purposes in the selected watershed, keeping land under urban areas as constant. This study contributes to our broader understanding of the sustainability of the transatlantic industrial wood pellet trade; however, we suggest undertaking similar research at a larger spatial scale over a longer time horizon for understanding trade-offs across carbon, biodiversity, and water impacts of the transatlantic industrial wood pellet trade. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Hydrological modeling; Land use change; SWAT; Wood pellets","Biodiversity; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Industrial research; Land use; Pelletizing; Stream flow; Watersheds; Wood; Change in land use; Growing production; Hydrological modeling; Land-use change; Potential impacts; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Wood pellet; Climate change; climate change; hydrological modeling; industrial production; land use change; precipitation (climatology); soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; temperature; wood; Georgia; Georgia; Oconee Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060013358

Using a database of over 140 global cities, including both national capitals and others, the chapter builds a comprehensive CO2 emissions model explaining 80% of the variance in urban CO2 emissions across the globe. While a variety of factors matter, OECD capital status plays a special role in reducing per capita CO2 emissions. The most plausible hypothesis explaining this outcome is the ground-breaking OECD work on urban pedestrianization and traffic management in the early 1970s. Capital cities are not the most prominent leaders in sustainability, with exceptional cities like San Francisco outperforming them. However, the national capitals of Stockholm and Seoul lead in terms of numerous policies and performance.

Such treatment is necessary because sea buckthorn contains reactive phenolic compounds that trigger non-enzymatic oxidative browning in sea-buckthorn wine. A direct regulation of the amount of phenolic compounds can improve sensory characteristics of sea-buckthorn wines, as well as increase their shelf-life. The research featured table dry wine made of 10 varieties of sea buckthorn grown in the Altai region. The chromatic characteristics were studied according to the existing guidelines of the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV, France). The index of yellowness served as an additional indicator for the colour assessment of the sea-buckthorn wines. Another objective indicator of colour assessment was the index of the displacement of the colour of x and y coordinates that corresponded with the green-red and yellow-blue chromatic axes. When 20-60 mg/100 ml of Granucol activated carbon was used during the winemaking process, it significantly improved the harmony of the sea-buckthorn wines.

Herein, hierarchical CoSx@MoS2 was synthesized via a one-pot solvothermal process. Formation of the heterostructure was confirmed by electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. CoSx@MoS2 showed competent electrocatalytic activity towards both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Superior electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the increase in number of active sites, betterment in charge transfer and facilitation of H- and O- containing active species adsorption-desorption at the active sites. Overall water splitting efficiency of CoSx@MoS2 was found to be superior in comparison to the state-of-the-art RuO2-Pt/C couple. Along with efficiency the heterostructure also exhibited long-term operational durability. Thus, hierarchical CoSx@MoS2 is a potential non-noble metal based bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the molecular mechanism of a series of chemical reactions to produce such compounds is not well understood. In this study, we simulate the shock compression state of a meteorite impact for a model system composed of CO2, H2O, and metallic iron slab by ab initio molecular dynamics combined with multiscale shock technique, and clarify possible elementary reaction processes up to production of organic compounds. The reactions included not only pathways similar to the Fischer–Tropsch process known as an important hydrocarbon synthesis in many planetary processes but also those resulting in production of a carboxylic acid. It is also found that bicarbonate ions formed from CO2 and H2O participated in some forms in most of these observed elementary reaction processes. These findings would deepen the understanding of the full range of chemical reactions that could occur in the meteorite impact events. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ab initio molecular dynamics; meteorite impacts; multiscale shock technique; organic compounds; shock waves","Carbon dioxide; Iron; Meteorites; Molecular dynamics; Organic compounds; Reaction kinetics; Shock waves; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Elementary reaction; Hydrocarbon synthesis; Late heavy bombardment; Materials synthesis; Meteorite impact; Molecular mechanism; Multi-scale; Meteor impacts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054767272

The marginal analysis method is used in the paper. The total cost and operation cost are respectively considered in the long and short run. We have five types of CETs and four scales of dairy farming. A CET is levied on milk, the main dairy product. We investigate the marginal costs and benefits of different scales and simulate the exit rates and mitigations. We conclude that 30 yuan/t CO2e is the suitable CET, leading to the mitigation of 0.79% with the cost of 0.17% revenue loss. The heterogeneity of marginal cost (MC) of each scale is a major factor affecting the exit rate, rather than the average MC. We also find there is a larger mitigation response in long run, and economies of scale are effective in resisting the CET. The revenue of CET can subsidize low-carbon dairy farms and silage, which will promote biogas digester engineering and harmless treatment of manure. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission tax; Heterogeneity; Mitigation","carbon emission; cost analysis; dairy farming; economic analysis; empirical analysis; environmental economics; heterogeneity; mitigation; pollution tax; subsidy system; China; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059735761

We used a coupled carbonclimate model that accounts for the carbon cost to plants of supporting nitrogen-acquiring microbial symbionts to explore how nitrogen limitation affects global climate. To do this, we first calculated the reduction in net primary production due to the carbon cost of nitrogen acquisition. We then used a climate model to estimate the impacts of the resulting increase in atmospheric CO2 on temperature and precipitation regimes. The carbon costs of supporting symbiotic nitrogen uptake reduced net primary production by 8.1 PgC yr -1 , with the largest absolute effects occurring in tropical forest biomes and the largest relative changes occurring in boreal and alpine biomes. Globally, our model predicted relatively small changes in climate due to the carbon cost of nitrogen acquisition with temperature increasing by 0.1 °C and precipitation decreasing by 6mmyr -1 . However, there were strong regional impacts, with the largest impact occurring in boreal and alpine ecosystems, where such costs were estimated to increase temperature by 1.0 °C and precipitation by 9mmyr -1 . As such, our results suggest that carbon expenditures to support nitrogen-acquiring microbial symbionts have critical consequences for Earth's climate, and that carbonclimate models that omit these processes will overpredict the land carbon sink and underpredict climate change. © 2019 Author(s).",,"alpine environment; biome; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; interspecific interaction; net primary production; nutrient limitation; precipitation (climatology); symbiosis; terrestrial ecosystem; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060589509

This new decomposition method can provide information about specific drivers of carbon emissions, including urban growth and resident living standards, rather than general demographic and economic factors identified by traditional methods. Using four Chinese megacities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) as case studies, we analyzed the factors that influenced per capita carbon emissions from 2010 to 2015. The results showed that per capita carbon emissions increased in Tianjin and Chongqing whereas decreased in Beijing and Shanghai, and that manufacturing was a key driving force. In these four megacities, energy conservation strategies were successfully implemented despite poor energy structure optimization during 2010–2015. Development of manufacturing and improvement of resident living standards in the cities led to an increase in carbon emissions. The unique dual-core urban form of Tianjin might mitigate the increased carbon emissions caused by the transportation sector. Reductions in carbon emissions could be achieved by further optimizing energy structures, limiting the number of private cars, and controlling per capita construction. © 2018","China megacities; Factor decomposition; LMID; Per capita carbon emissions","Carbon; Construction industry; Manufacture; Structural optimization; Urban growth; Carbon emissions; Construction sectors; Decomposition methods; Energy structures; Factor decompositions; LMID; Megacities; Transportation sector; Urban transportation; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; living standard; manufacturing; megacity; urban growth; Beijing [China]; China; Chongqing; Shanghai; Tianjin; carbon; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; city; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; China; Cities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045559167

The increase of CO2 emissions will not only effect country's own sustainable development, but also potentially pose a negative impact on the global climate stability. Since the socioeconomic development is sensitive to geographic scales and regional heterogeneity, a systematic investigation of spatiotemporal variations (SV) of CO2 emissions and their impact factors (IF) across different levels will help to develop more effective and reasonable policies and measures for CO2 emissions mitigation. However, multi-scale analysis of those issues is still lacking. Hence, using two administrative levels (e.g., prefectures or provinces) in China as experimental objects, this study attempted to quantify and compare SV and IF of CO2 emissions from nighttime light images and socioeconomic data at different levels using the variation coefficient (VC), spatial autocorrelation spatial model, and spatial econometric model. Our results show that the VC of CO2 emissions is uninterruptedly increases from 0.66 in 1997 to 0.73 in 2006, and then gradually decreases to 0.69 in 2012 at the provincial level, and it consistently decreases from 1.29 in 1997 to 1.03 in 2012 at the prefectural level. The Global Moran's I of CO2 emissions increases from 1997 to 2012 at the provincial and prefectural levels. Specifically, the Global Moran's I gradually increases from 0.23 in 1997 to 0.27 in 2012 at the provincial level, while it shows a rapid growth trend, from 0.23 in 1997 to 0.34 in 2012 at the prefectural level. The proportion of second industry has been demonstrated as a major factor influencing CO2 emissions at different levels, while gross domestic product, urbanization rate, and population play more important roles in CO2 emissions at the prefectural level. This study illustrates that China's CO2 emissions are sensitive to the spatial-temporal hierarchy of multi-mechanisms, and suggests that “proceed in the light of local conditions” strategies can help Chinese government for CO2 emissions mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Nighttime light; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial econometric model","Autocorrelation; Economic and social effects; CO2 emissions; Gross domestic products; Night-time lights; Nighttime light image; Socio-economic development; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial econometric models; Spatio-temporal variation; Carbon dioxide; autocorrelation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; emission control; global climate; growth; industrialization; light intensity; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; sustainable development; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054899599

Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs) can play an important role in helping communities adapt to climate change health impacts, however, effective coordination of this requires further understanding of their roles in implementing climate change-related adaptation actions in communities. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling was undertaken at the January 2017 conference for EHPs hosted by the South African Institute of Environmental Health in Cape Town. All EHPs who attended the conference were invited to complete a study questionnaire that requested information on participant demographics, as well as climate change related-knowledge, practices and perceptions. Results: Majority of participating EHPs (n = 48; 72.8%) had received formal or informal training on climate change and health. Thirty-nine percent of EHPs indicated that they had a climate change and health-related committee / working group in their department, a policy or strategy (41.0%) and budget allocated for climate change and health-related work (51.5%). A total of 33.3% had participated in climate change-related projects. Majority (62.2%) of EHPs believed that they should play a supportive role in addressing climate change while 37.8% believed that EHPs should play a leading role. Conclusions: Recognising the need for raising awareness about climate change adaptation as well as implementing appropriate interventions to combat climate-related ill health effects, especially among vulnerable groups, EHPs are well-placed to adopt significant roles in helping communities to adapt to climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).","Climate change; Environmental health; Health professionals; South Africa","adult; budget; climate change; cross-sectional study; demography; education; environmental health; female; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; male; middle aged; organization; policy; population health; poverty; questionnaire; South Africa; vulnerable population; Academies and Institutes; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Budgets; Climate Change; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Environmental Health; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Policy; Population Health; Poverty; Residence Characteristics; South Africa; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vulnerable Populations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059832979

Although the government has taken various measures to reduce emissions, the large-scale and intermittent occurrence of pollution is still a major issue. To understand the mechanisms and characteristics of pollution, Raman-Mie lidar and CE-318 sun photometer were used to study the aerosol vertical distribution and optical properties during dust, haze and clean periods in Beijing that occurred in September to October 2017. Combined with meteorological data, the sources and transmission paths of the pollution events were analyzed. The results are as follows. For the dust event, irregular particles with a large linear particle depolarization ratio played a leading role. The aerosol boundary layer height reached 3.5 km. The volume concentration of coarse particles was obviously larger in the volume size distribution. Strong northwest winds at high altitudes cause high-altitude long-distance transmission of pollutants. And this process can exacerbate air quality of Beijing. For the haze event, high-spherical water-soluble particles were dominant. The extinction coefficient exceeded 1 km−1 while the linear particle depolarization ratio was relatively small. The aerosol boundary layer height was &lt;1 km. The range of aerosol optical depth at 440 nm varied between 0.8 and 2.4. Compared with the dust process, meteorological conditions contribute differently to the haze pollution. Aerosols from the south-west is one of the major resources of haze in Beijing. Combined with static weather such as low wind speed, the pollution level can be continuously increased. During the clean period, favorable weather conditions, such as high wind speed, provided good conditions for the diffusion of local particles. The extinction coefficient and the linear particle depolarization ratio were significantly lower. The single-scattering albedo fluctuated between 0.75 and 0.85, the scattering of light was weak and the visibility was generally high. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol vertical distribution; Beijing; Lidar; Optical properties; Sun photometer","Aerosols; Air quality; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Depolarization; Dust; Meteorology; Optical radar; Photometers; Photometry; Wind; Beijing; Characteristics of pollution; Long distance transmission; Meteorological condition; Single scattering albedo; Sun photometers; Vertical distributions; Volume size distribution; Optical properties; aerosol; albedo; atmospheric pollution; autumn; boundary layer; lidar; metropolitan area; optical property; photometer; vertical distribution; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053561604

Especially missing is an understanding of the modes, sources and depth of learning in these constellations, and their relations to urban climate governance. This paper asks to better understand this learning relationship. It does so by applying guiding questions from policy transfer framework and governance learning literature to the cooperation between two German cities (Berlin and Freiburg) and one Israeli city (Tel Aviv-Yafo). By aligning qualitative methods with these frameworks, the paper reveals that in this constellation learning is mostly sequential, from exogenous sources and with no substantial contribution to urban climate governance in the recipient city (Tel Aviv). However, learning produces modest policy changes and has a potential of scaling horizontally and vertically in Israeli domestic settings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","city-to-city cooperation; learning; policy transfer; Urban climate governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058852567

The region provides ample opportunity to understand the dynamic relationship of the Indian and Eurasian plates, role in governing the global climate and controlling the earth surface temperature by carbon sequestration through weathering of rocks. The differential uplift along several thrust planes and associated climatic conditions are primarily governing the geomorphic evolution of the Ladakh, and amongst several agents of material movement, glaciers are the most effective agent. Overall ten glacial stages (~430–0.4 ka) are recognized from Ladakh. Additionally, the major sources of moisture to the Ladakh region are the Indian Summer monsoon (ISM) and the Central Asian westerlies contributing in subequal amounts. Several morphometric parameters suggest that tectonics is governing the topography. It was most pronounced at 27 ka, 23 ka, 17–19 ka, 11–10 ka and 6 ka along the Karakorum Fault and Indus Suture Zone. The climate studies suggest that during around 35–25 ka, the climate was cold and humid followed by the relatively dry at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A rise in lakes during ~17–5 ka was observed. However, major fluctuations in limiting the lake levels during the Older Dryas, Younger Dryas and 8.2 ka were also noticeable.

Nevertheless, the incurring losses over India remain uncertain due to limited measurements and significant uncertainties in the surface O3 simulated by chemistry-transport models, amongst other causes. Here, we revisit the ozone-attributable CYL using WRF-Chem model, with a set up previously shown to better reproduce the observed ozone variations over the contrasting chemical environments across the Indian region. WRF-Chem simulated ozone fields are converted to Accumulated Ozone above a Threshold of 40 ppbv (AOT40) for two primary crop growing seasons in India, i.e. Kharif (mid-June to mid-September), and Rabi (December to February). Relative Yield Losses (RYL) for wheat are found to be higher (∼21–26%) than those in a recent study based on observations (∼15%), as the model accounts for the rural chemistry which can be different from urban/suburban/high altitude environments where measurements are largely conducted. Additionally, RYL for rice estimated here (∼6%) is 3 times greater than a previous study using this model at a relatively coarser resolution to derive average surface ozone with a set of simulations with varying emission inventories, not evaluated in detail before deriving crop losses. The economic losses due to CYL estimated in this study (∼5 billion USD for wheat and 1.5 billion USD for rice) are on the higher side, when estimations from various studies are inter-compared (0.6–4.3 billion USD for wheat, and 0.5–1.5 billion USD for rice), for which increasing crop prices is also a contributing factor. Our study highlights an urgent need to conduct strategic ozone observations especially over agricultural fields, and the development of yearly regional-emission database to support policy making in India. © 2019 The Authors","Crop yield; Emission inventories; Ozone; Surface ozone impact; WRF-Chem","Crops; Cultivation; Losses; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural fields; Chemical environment; Chemistry transport model; Contributing factor; Crop yield; Emission inventories; Surface ozone; WRF-Chem; Ozone; ozone; agricultural land; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; crop yield; emission inventory; estimation method; food availability; growing season; multinational enterprise; ozone; rice; threshold; uncertainty analysis; altitude; Article; chemical environment; economic aspect; growing season; harvest; India; nonhuman; plant growth; priority journal; rice; suburban area; urban area; wheat; India; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060566217

However, food production and millions of farm-based livelihoods in this region will continue to be adversely affected by hydro-climatic change and variation, reduced land productivity, and declining groundwater levels. Thus, agricultural adaptations are essential for protecting and improving upon intersecting goals of food security, poverty alleviation, and wellbeing. Household “capital” (e.g., natural, human, financial, physical, and social) is commonly cited as an indicator of livelihood adaptability and innovation. We develop a series of mediated structural equation models to empirically evaluate the validity of capital as a suitable indicator for adaptation and adaptive capacity. These models assess the extent to which household capital mediates the relationship between over 1,000 socio-economically differentiated and randomly selected farm households, and their crop, livestock, and land management adaptations in the states of Haryana and Bihar. Central to our models is a single household capital variable, constructed by aggregating nearly 80 different measurements of households' (i) physical/infrastructural capital, (ii) owned or accessed assets, (iii) livelihood diversity, (iv) ability to reach market or commercialize, (v) access to weather information, and (vi) social capital. We find household capital is a significant predictor in adopting crop, land management, and livestock-related adaptation strategies across both states. Second, and in certain cases, lower castes and less educated households engaged in fewer agricultural adaptations—an outcome mediated by their lower composition of capital. Further, and across almost all contexts, household capital mediated the effect of owning a greater proportion of land, and the higher uptake of agricultural adaptation activities. While improvements in any capital category can improve adoption, we recommend programs that improve (i) access to public and private agricultural infrastructure for lower castes; (ii) education and shared knowledge spaces for less-educated households; and (iii) the availability of low-interest loans and the more efficient legal transfer of land for agriculturalists owning a smaller proportion of their land. Through this novel and large-scale analysis of household data, we provide short-term and immediate recommendations for more equitable agricultural adaptation in this breadbasket region of northern India. © Copyright © 2019 Shah, Wagner, Sanga, Park, Demange, Gueiros and Niles.","adaptation; agriculture; climate change; household capital; India; socio-environmental change; structural equation modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077638421

Lacking a dynamic sustainability assessment of technologies for electricity planning, this paper fills the gap with a multi-criteria and multi-stakeholder evaluation in an integrated assessment of energy systems. This allows to select the most preferred strategies for future planning of energy security in Egypt, with a focus on alternative energy pathways and a sustainable electricity supply mix up to 2100. A novel prototype model is used to integrate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) as a premium decision support approach with agent-based modeling (ABM). This tool is popular in analyzing dynamic complex systems. A GIS-based spatial ABM analyzes future pathways for energy security in Egypt, depending on the preferences of agents for selected criteria to facilitate the transformation of energy landscapes. The study reveals significant temporal variations in the spatial ranking of technologies between actors in the energy sector over this period. We conclude that in order to attain a sustainable energy landscape, we should involve relevant stakeholders and analyze their interactions while considering local spatial conditions and key dimensions of sustainable development. © 2019, University of Surrey.

Although those regulations seem to have improved preservation, they may have had unintended consequences in energy production. Here we show that while environmental constraints on hydropower may have preserved the wilderness and wildlife by restricting the development of hydroelectric projects, they led to more greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental regulations gave rise to a replacement of hydropower, which is a renewable, relatively low-emitting source of energy, with conventional fossil-fuel power, which is highly polluting. Our estimates indicate that, on average, each megawatt of fossil fuel power-generating capacity added to the grid because of environmental constraints on hydropower development led to an increase in annual carbon dioxide emissions of about 1,400 tons. Environmental regulations focusing only on the preservation of ecosystems appear to have encouraged electric utilities to substitute dirtier fuels for hydropower in electricity generation. © 2019 Edson Severnini.

It attempts to address a practically important question: does policy research actually make a difference in the processes of formulating and institutionalizing local climate change policy? Two case studies from Central Java Indonesia are presented. The analysis focuses on the policy development processes in the cities of Semarang and Pekalongan, both of which were based on an urban climate vulnerability assessment. We discuss and compare the policy-making processes in terms of three analytic dimensions: the type of policy measures, agent, and policy approach. We examine the relationship between assessment outcomes and the efforts to institutionalize climate change policy in the two cities. These case studies show that although policy actors in both cities have developed strategies and policy measures for addressing climate change, the quality of policy-relevant research was a marginal consideration in the policy formulation processes. An established agenda within a policy network had greater impacts on policy-making than research outputs, which were articulated and used in the context of this agenda. Advocacy coalitions re-defined and re-interpreted what research has shown. Understanding this ability is key to ascertain why or why not policy-relevant research matters. © 2017, © 2017 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.","advocacy coalition; Climate change adaptation; Indonesia; policy impacts; policy research; vulnerability assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030684964

In past transformational changes in other sectors, public monies played a key role across the innovation landscape. Public financing was central also in a number of past national energy transitions, as reviewed here for Iceland (from fossil to geothermal energy), Norway (from mainly non-electricity energy to hydroelectricity), France (from oil to nuclear) and the United States (from conventional to shale gas). In the current transition to low-carbon energy supplies, there is much public activity, most directed and concerted in China, but also reasons to doubt it is enough and applied in the right places to be able to finance the transition to a low carbon sector on timescales consistent with current climate change mitigation targets. A discussion of opportunities and challenges to a more central role for public financing concludes, drawing also on insights from the recent mission-oriented innovation literature. © Roger Fouquet 2019.

The novelty of separating a single rectangular cooking chamber into separate twin chambers (of 1-m2 aperture area each) improves the cooking performance as opening of one chamber for unloading of food cooked in lesser time (rice) does not disturb the stagnation temperature of the other chamber (pulses and meat) needing more time to cook besides resulting in reduction in side heat loss coefficient due to common wall. Aperture area and cooking volume of TCCS cooker are 9.54 and 35.33 times more as compared to single-chamber domestic solar (SCDS) cooker which makes it a community-scale large-capacity solar cooker. The developed solar radiation capture model and overall heat loss coefficient (Ul) computed for TCCS cooker have been used in a thermal model developed between various interactive components. First (F1) and second figures of merit (F2) values are 0.13 and 0.42, respectively, for TCCS cooker at par with ‘A’ grade category SCDS cooker. Techno-economic analysis shows that the net present value of TCCS cooker is Rs. 83,253 with break-even point occurring after cooking 43,461 meals with payback period of only 25, 50, and 72 months if used as a replacement for LPG, cow dung cakes, and wood-based cooking, respectively.

We investigated the associations between exposure to ambient air pollution and childhood cancers in Tehran, Iran. This project included children between 1 and 15 years-of-age with a cancer diagnosis by the Center for the Control of Non Communicable Disease (n = 161) during 2007 to 2009. Controls were selected randomly within the city using a Geographic Information System (GIS) (n = 761). The cases were geocoded based on exact home addresses. Air pollution exposure of cases and random controls were estimated by a previously developed Land Use Regression (LUR) model for the 2010 calendar year. The annual mean concentrations of Particulate Matter ≤ 10 μm (PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in the locations of cancer cases were 101.97 μg/m 3 , 49.42 ppb and 38.92 ppb respectively, while in the random control group, respective mean exposures were 98.63 μg/m 3 , 45.98 ppb and 38.95 ppb. A logistic regression model was used to find the probability of childhood cancer per unit increase in PM 10 , NO 2 and SO 2 . We observed a positive association between exposures to PM 10 with childhood cancers. We did, however, observe a positive, but not statistically significant association between NO 2 exposure and childhood cancer.

For example, a recent analysis for the USA examines aggressive strategies to cut carbon emissions in half by 2040 and finds that in order to achieve this emission reduction target, more than half of existing buildings will need comprehensive energy efficiency retrofits. Germany is targeting an overall primary energy consumption reduction of 50% in 2050 including increasing building renovation rate to 2% per year. In France, ambitious targets have also been set for existing buildings: 50% reduction of primary energy consumption in 2050 compared to the 2012 level. Multiple countries have realized the importance of comprehensive building retrofits and have begun to adopt policies to spur these improvements. For example, Germany is emphasizing grants and loans through the KfW Development Bank, complemented with building and heating system labels, a new “heating check” programme, and possible technical renovation requirements. France has established a goal of bringing all buildings up to “A” performance level (on their A–G scale) by 2050 in order for them to be sold or leased, with lower performance levels required as soon as 2020. In the USA, the focus has been on a combination of rating and disclosure of energy use, financing, and technical assistance. Focused community approaches show promise. This paper summarizes the efforts, successes and challenges, future directions, and savings of building retrofit policies in the three countries.

This approach has the potential to enable a rapid and effective inspection of O&amp;G facilities under voluntary or regulatory LDAR programs to identify and mitigate anomalously large CH4 emissions from a disproportionately small number of facilities. This is the first study of which the authors are aware to deploy, evaluate, and compare the CH4 detection volumes and cost-effectiveness of aerially guided and purely ground-based LDAR techniques. Two aerial methods, the Kairos Aerospace infrared CH4 column imaging and the Scientific Aviation in situ aircraft CH4 mole fraction measurements, were tested during a 2-week period in the Fayetteville Shale region contemporaneously with conventional ground-based LDAR. We show that aerially guided LDAR can be at least as cost-effective as ground-based LDAR, but several variable parameters were identified that strongly affect cost-effectiveness and which require field research and improvements beyond this pilot study. These parameters include (i) CH4 minimum dectectable limit of aerial technologies, (ii) emission rate size distributions of sources, (iii) remote distinction of fixable versus nonfixable CH4 sources (“leaks” vs. CH4 emissions occurring by design), and (iv) the fraction of fixable sources to total CH4 emissions. Suggestions for future study design are provided. Implications: Mitigation of methane leaks from existing oil and gas operations currently relies on on-site inspections of all applicable facilities at a prescribed frequency. This approach is labor- and cost-intensive, especially because a majority of oil and gas–related methane emissions originate from a disproportionately small number of facilities and components. We show for the first time in real-world conditions how aerial methane measurements can identify anomalously high-emitting facilities to enable a rapid, focused, and directed ground inspection of these facilities. The aerially guided approach can be more cost-effective than current practices, especially when implementing the aircraft deployment improvements discussed here. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

It is also becoming increasingly clear that fossil fuels impose a high price on society through local environmental pollution and Africa’s particular vulnerability to climate change. At the same time, Africa has an excellent renewable energy potential and prices for renewable energy are reaching the price range of fossil fuels. Comparing results from state-of-the-art Integrated Assessment Models we find different options for achieving a sustainable energy supply in Africa. They have in common, however, that strong economic development is considered compatible with the 2°C climate target. Taking both challenges and appropriate solutions into account, some models find that a complete switch to renewable energy in electricity production is possible in the medium term. The continental analysis identifies important synergy effects, in particular the exchange of electricity between neighbouring countries. The optimal energy mix varies considerably between African countries, but there is sufficient renewable energy for each country. The intermittency and higher capital intensity of renewable energy are important challenges, but proven solutions are available for them. In addition, we analyse the political economy of a sustainable energy transition in Africa. Key policy insights An almost complete shift towards renewable energy (RE) is considered feasible and affordable in Africa. By 2050, electricity generation could be sourced largely from solar, wind and hydro power. Prices for RE in Africa are now within the price range of fossil fuels, partly due to the excellent RE potential. The optimal energy mix varies strongly between countries, but RE is sufficiently available everywhere. Addressing intermittency is possible, but requires investments and cooperation on the grid. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Africa; development; energy mix; sustainability","alternative energy; economic development; electricity supply; fossil fuel; political economy; sustainability; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045055584

California, USA, is case study where large areas of wildland have a recent 100 plus year history of human suppression of fire that with extreme weather is combining to create large high intensity burns changing both species composition and increasing threats to life, health and property. The cool wet winters and hot dry summers in California produce a climate where fire is common and many environmental systems have evolved to rely on frequent fire for reproduction and health. Fire has been systemically removed creating a backlog of fuels as vegetation normally burned accumulates. Extreme weather enhanced by climate change is increasing the duration of the fire season and occurrence of extreme fire weather and events. The abundance of fuels and increase in probability of fire, primarily due to human-caused ignitions in the wildland-urban interface, are creating an increase of large catastrophic fires not typical of these ecosystems. These large high-intensity fires are an immediate threat to life and property, produce large amounts of smoke impacting human health far from the fire, and leave behind a burn area then susceptible to extreme rainfall events that create landslides and mudslides. Returning fire to the historic role it has played in sustaining these systems reduces the probability of catastrophic fire and the conditions where extreme rainfall can additionally cause further threats to life and property from debris flows. Exposure of the public to smoke from wildfire increases when high intensity burns occur. Wildland fire typical of this ecosystem which occurred before suppression limited the extent and amount of such exposure. There are current attempts to effect positive change to policy and give a voice to the role of fire in the ecosystem. Long-standing policy based on the unsustainable complete exclusion of fire and public pressure on air quality inhibits functional change to smoke and fire management. The collision of what current fire and smoke science advises as the appropriate action (inclusion of fire as a land management tool), and public opinion driving implementation of fire management decisions in California (the exclusion of fire) illustrates a global problem where climate change and policy driven by belief are synergistically worsening environmental and human health. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Extreme weather; Smoke management policy; Wildland fire",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086984396

Using an explicit process tracing approach, the article tests two hypotheses regarding the influence of upper level subnational governments on local policy. In Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a city that is a climate change leader, provincial government intervention cannot explain the results of climate change mitigation policy making. This suggests that local governments can exercise an important degree of autonomy over climate change policy, but also implies that where municipalities are less independently committed to climate action, active upper level government intervention will likely be needed. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization","climate change; environment; governance; urban studies","climate change; environmental policy; governance approach; intergovernmental relations; local government; policy making; urban area; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060112728

The type of management has an effect on the provision of these services. Often the demands for these services can lead to conflict – wood harvest can negatively impact biodiversity and climate change mitigation capacity. Although forest management differences are important, spatially explicit data is lacking, in particular on a global scale. We present here a first systematic approach which integrates existing data to map forest management globally through downscaling national and subnational forest data. In our forest management classification, we distinguished between two levels of forest management, with three categories each. Level 1 comprised primary, naturally regrown and planted forests. Level 2 distinguished between different forest uses. We gathered documented locations, where these forest categories were observed, from the literature and a database on ecological diversity. We then performed multinomial logit regression and estimated the effect of 21 socio-economic and bio-physical predictor variables on the occurrence of a forest category. Model results on significance and effect direction of predictor variables were in line with findings of previous studies. Soil and environmental properties, forest conditions and accessibility are important determinants of the occurrence of forest management types. Based on the model results, likelihood maps were calculated and used to spatially allocate national extents of level 1 and level 2 forest categories. When compared to previous studies, our maps showed higher agreement than random samples. Deviations between observed and predicted plantation locations were mostly below 10 km. Our map provides an estimation of global forest management patterns, enhancing previous methodologies and making the best use of data available. Next to having multiple applications, for example within global conservation planning or climate change mitigation analyses, it visualizes the currently available data on forest management on a global level. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Forest management; FRA 2015; Global; Global forest resource assessment; Land use mapping; Location factors; Multinomial logit model","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Economics; Ecosystems; Information management; Land use; Location; Mapping; Forest resource assessments; FRA 2015; Global; Land-use mappings; Location factors; Multinomial logit model; Forestry; biodiversity; climate change; conservation planning; ecosystem service; factor analysis; forest management; forest resource; global change; global perspective; land use change; logit analysis; resource allocation; resource assessment; socioeconomic conditions; vegetation mapping; Biodiversity; Conservation; Economics; Ecosystems; Land Use; Mapping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054744838

As a result, the use of petroleum products has continually decreased, and the use of renewable energy sources has increased. For the EU as a whole, however, the use of wood for energy has been fairly constant, even if its use has increased in several countries, for example, in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom (UK), and Germany. As the consumption grows, the demands are increasingly met by imports of wood pellets, especially in countries with small forest areas such as Denmark and the UK, but also in Germany. Even if the forest area is increasing in many European countries, the land use change for urban development and nature conservation efforts have furthermore reduced the contribution of the forest sector in some countries. Given this situation, this chapter analyzed how managed and unmanaged temperate forests of the deciduous broad-leaved European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and the evergreen coniferous Norway spruce (Picea abies) species, to see how these forests can best help to mitigate climate change by storage of carbon in the forest and substitution of fossil intensive materials. The assessment was based on yield tables, wood assortment tables, deadwood and product-decay functions, and on the measured growth data from managed and unmanaged forests. All results are expressed as wood volume (m3/ha) that either store carbon or is made available for substitution through harvesting. The time frame is based on a suggested natural life cycle of unmanaged forest which is 230 years for beech and 350 years for spruce. In such time frames, the mitigation effect by storage is approximately zero for unmanaged forests, as the produced biomass is subject to natural mortality and input to deadwood pools that decompose and return the CO2 to the atmosphere. In unmanaged forests the mean volume stock over 350 years was 324±252 m3/ha for beech and 406±295 m3/ha for Norway spruce. For managed forests, there are, in the same time frame, also no or only minor storage effects in the long term, unless substantial changes take place in forest management or wood use. But it is also important to protect these stocks and the stocks of wood products, which together were 543 m3/ha for managed beech and 624 m3/ha for managed spruce, and of these, 279 and 342 m3/ha are stored in the forest, respectively. The forest management effect only becomes apparent through substitution effects for fossil intensive materials and the fossil fuels. In this context the role of wood energy and products is complex. Only some wood residues substitute the fossil energy and only some products substitute materials with high energy cost. Products are a transient pool of wood, which is feed by forest harvest, and which loses wood during processing and after consumption for energy or other use. The total supply of wood for energy is 1177 m3/ha over 230 years in beech (5.1 m3/ha/year) and of 3395 m3/ha over 350 years in spruce (9.7 m3/ha/year). Thus the contribution for climate change mitigation is larger for coniferous than for broadleaved species, and managed forests contribute more than unmanaged forests to storage. The implications of nature conservation, land use change are discussed, together with various options for improving incentives for forest management through international greenhouse gas accounting systems, which must still avoid double accounting. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Regarding the forecasted increase in CO2-Emissions from this sector, undertaking responsibilities for its environmental impact are needed. Although technical and strategic solutions to reduce emissions have been introduced, or are in development, these rarely yield instant emission reduction potentials. A strategic approach to reducing them instantly, based on the given infrastructure and existing vehicle fleet, may be achieved through route optimization. Route optimization is a well-researched topic in the transportation domain. However, it is mainly used to reduce transportation times and expenses. Rising expectations towards sustainability by authorities and consumers led to an increased interest in route optimization in which environmental externalities, such as fuel consumption and CO2-Emissions are minimized. This paper introduces a Geographic Information System (GIS) based 3D-Routing-Model, which incorporates models to estimate vehicle fuel consumption while taking effects, such as road inclination and varying velocities into account. The proposed model utilizes a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to enrich a road network with elevation data. The 3D-Routing-Model is applied in different distribution scenarios within the framework of an artificial company in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, Portugal to evaluate the effects of road inclination on vehicles fuel consumption and its proportional CO2-Emissions. Results indicate that eco-friendly routes can yield significant fuel and emission saving potentials of up to 20% in the tested scenarios. However, eco-friendly routes are characterized by longer distances as well as operation times, which leads to increased expenses. The question remains if companies within the transportation sector are more interested in maximizing their profits, or investing in a sustainable future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2-Emissions; GIS Applications; Green Logistics; Route Optimization; Vehicle Routing","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Environmental protection; Fleet operations; Freight transportation; Fuels; Logistics; Roads and streets; Surveying; Sustainable development; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; CO2 emissions; Different distributions; Digital elevation model; Emission reduction potentials; GIS application; Green logistics; Road freight transportations; Route optimization; Geographic information systems; carbon monoxide; digital elevation model; emission control; environmental impact; freight transport; GIS; logistics; optimization; road transport; three-dimensional modeling; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051468663

We derive the sub-grid-scale ice thickness distribution (ITD) with respect to five ice thickness categories used in a sea ice component (Community Ice CodE, CICE) of climate simulations. This allows us to initialize the ITD in stand-alone simulations with CICE and to verify the simulated cycle of ice thickness. We find that a default CICE simulation strongly underestimates ice thickness, despite reproducing the inter-annual variability of summer sea ice extent. We can identify the underestimation of winter ice growth as being responsible and show that increasing the ice conductive flux for lower temperatures (bubbly brine scheme) and accounting for the loss of drifting snow results in the simulated sea ice growth being more realistic. Sensitivity studies provide insight into the impact of initial and atmospheric conditions and, thus, on the role of positive and negative feedback processes. During summer, atmospheric conditions are responsible for 50&thinsp;% of September sea ice thickness variability through the positive sea ice and melt pond albedo feedback. However, atmospheric winter conditions have little impact on winter ice growth due to the dominating negative conductive feedback process: the thinner the ice and snow in autumn, the stronger the ice growth in winter. We conclude that the fate of Arctic summer sea ice is largely controlled by atmospheric conditions during the melting season rather than by winter temperature. Our optimal model configuration does not only improve the simulated sea ice thickness, but also summer sea ice concentration, melt pond fraction, and length of the melt season. It is the first time CS2 sea ice thickness data have been applied successfully to improve sea ice model physics. © Author(s) 2019.",,"CryoSat; ice thickness; melting; modeling; sea ice; simulation; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059952665

In this study we examine these problems as they apply to interactive climate-visualization platforms, which allow their users to localize global climate information to support local political action. By scrutinizing the political implications of the “zoom” tool from the perspective of media studies and rhetoric, we add to perspectives of cultural cartography on the issue of scaling from our fields. Namely, we break down the cinematic trope of “zooming” to reveal how it imports the political problems of synopticism to the level of individual communities. As a potential antidote to the politics of zoom, we recommend a downscaling strategy of connectivity, which associates rather than reduces situated views of climate to global ones.

One way of reducing emissions in traffic is to establish the use of electric vehicles. However, given current market shares in Germany, the envisaged regime change from traditional combustion to electric engines seems rather unlikely, triggering the search for new options for dynamic market growth. Recent research has shown consumers’ insufficient knowledge and high uncertainty towards electric vehicle (EV) technology. To overcome such acceptance barriers, this study hypothesises that experience in using car-sharing services—especially EV car sharing—can lead to higher acceptance of EV technology, entailing higher market diffusion. Using the Technology Acceptance Model, a quantitative survey with car-sharing users and non-users was conducted to assess the impact of car-sharing experience on acceptance of EVs. Furthermore, five possible predictors of EV acceptance were tested: mobility, car ownership, urbanity, ecological awareness and technophilia. Car-sharing users rated perceived EV usefulness higher than people without car-sharing experience. They also show a higher intention of buying EVs than non-users. Intention to use EVs in car-sharing schemes is positive amongst both groups. Identifying predictors of EV acceptance, results show that urbanity, ecological awareness, technophilia and car-sharing experience generally increase EV acceptance. Study results indicate that greater EV acceptance could be achieved by addressing highly mobile individuals living in urban areas, especially by having users of traditional car sharing switch to EV car sharing. Promoting EV car-sharing services and pushing a modal shift—in terms of reducing car ownership and raising individual mobility—in urban areas can serve as a policy instrument to push the mobility regime change towards EV technology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Car sharing; Electric vehicles; Mobility; Quantitative model; Technology acceptance; Transition research","Carrier mobility; Climate change; Commerce; Competition; Ecology; Electric vehicles; Ecological awareness; Empirical studies; Individual mobility; Policy instruments; Quantitative modeling; Reducing emissions; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Electric automobiles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055910398

The regional impacts of sulfur-reducing technology, which would permit current high sulfurcoal production, are analyzed for their interaction with coal conversion and air quality. Regional air quality standardswhich limit average sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants can have important interactions with the spatial location of production activities if a premium is placed on low sulfur emissions.

Going forward, robust assessments of the impacts of inaction and impacts avoided by increasing mitigation ambition in line with the goals of the agreement are required. At the same time, the need for climate adaptation has become clear and most countries around the world are having adaptation strategies and plans in place. Climate impact science needs to serve the needs of both communities. Here, we argue that this might not be done best with a “one size fits all” approach, but that there are discernible differences in the objectives and scope, and therefore the methodological approach to impact science to inform mitigation policy and adaptation action. We contextualize the needs for both applications with the recent political and scientific developments and outline key differences with regard to factors such as timescales, resolution, and integration of the socioeconomic context. We discuss the paramount importance of the representation and assessment of impacts of extreme events in particular for adaptation-relevant approaches. While we find that clarity about the multiobjective nature of impact science going forward is important to best serve both communities and to avoid misunderstandings, we also identify substantial synergies and the need for continuous integration between both domains. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, firms have been devoting resources to reduce their carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions, and water use. However, the problem of measuring and acting upon water risk in the supply chain has not yet been tackled in the literature. Unlike other environmental concerns, water risk is a local phenomenon that needs to be quantified at the catchment level. Thus, the impact of a production process cannot be location-agnostic and must be analyzed within its particular context—ideally at the production site level. Furthermore, recent trends in manufacturing (such as “local production”) are expected to put increased pressure in areas where regulations are lax and water risk is high (e.g., India, China). Such considerations should be taken into account within the context of supplier management processes. We introduce a hierarchical framework, using Monte Carlo Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCAHP), to aggregate relevant indicators into an index score designed to assess suppliers' water risk based on their location. Our framework distinguishes between strategic sourcing decisions and tactical supplier management. Thus, it supports two applications of particular importance for managers: the top down identification of regional-level water-risk and variability, and the bottom up supplier management at a raw-material level. We illustrate the application of our framework with a case study conducted within a business unit of Procter & Gamble (P&G), the global consumer products company; examining 1066 direct suppliers in over 75 countries. Our strategic sourcing analysis identifies 340 suppliers with high water-risk and singles out 3 countries in critical condition; experiencing high water-risk in addition to precarious conditions for civilian access to water. Additionally, our bottom up analysis identifies a single supplier of a water-intensive raw material that is expected to become critical in the coming years; thus enabling targeted supplier management from a water-stewardship perspective. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","LCA; Supply chain management; Sustainable water utilization; Water footprint; Water risk","Carbon footprint; Catchments; Consumer products; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Bottom-up analysis; Critical condition; Environmental concerns; Production process; Strategic sourcing; Supplier management; Sustainable water; Water footprint; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055084595

Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS; EC 2.4.1.14) is a key enzyme to catalyze the form of sucrose in primary sucrose synthesis pathway. Plants SPS has a molecular size around 120 kDa, which consists of N-terminal domain, C-terminal domain, and central domain. We produced the recombinant sugarcane SPS (SoSPS1) in Escherichia coli, however, the expression often appears to be a shorter form with retained enzyme activity. In our result, we reported that the shorter form is suggested to have a truncated N-terminal 20-kDa region. The truncated form of So SPS1 (ΔN-SPS) tends to enhance the specific activity 10-fold compared to full-length SoSPS1. The full-lenght SoSPS1 showed a remarkable allosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), while none of the N-terminal truncated form had such a characteristic. By kinetic analysis of full-length SoSPS1, a higher substrate affinity was shown in the presence of G6P. Conversely, the ΔN-SPS showed a similar substrate affinity whether G6P was added or not. Based on these results, we revealed that N-terminal region of SoSPS1 has essential role for allosteric regulation by G6P and may function like a suppressor domain for the enzyme activity. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biochemistry; Cobalt compounds; Escherichia coli; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Sugar (sucrose); Allosteric activation; Allosteric properties; Allosteric regulation; Carbon partitioning; Glucose 6 phosphates; N-terminal domains; Substrate affinity; Sucrose-phosphate synthase; Enzyme activity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060014489

Efficient utilization of energy is necessary for reduction of CO2 emission, and smart city demonstration projects have been conducted around the world in order to reduce total energies and the amount of CO2 emission. The problem can be formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and various evolutionary computation techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), Differential Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (DEEPSO), Brain Storm Optimization (BSO), Modified BSO (MBSO), Global-best BSO (BSO), and Global-best Modified Brain Storm Optimization (GMBSO) have been applied to the problem. However, there is still room for improving solution quality. Multi-population based evolutionary computation methods have been verified to improve solution quality and the approach has a possibility for improving solution quality. The proposed MS-GMBSO utilizes only migration for multi-population models instead of abest, which is the best individual among all of sub-populations so far, and both migration and abest. Various multi-population models, migration topologies, migration policies, and the number of sub-populations are also investigated. It is verified that the proposed MP-GMBSO based method with ring topology, the W-B policy, and 320 individuals is the most effective among all of multi-population parameters. © 2018 by the authors.","Efficient utilization of energy; Global-best modified brain storm optimization; Multi-population evolutionary computation; Reduction of CO2 emission; Smart city","Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Smart city; Storms; Topology; CO2 emissions; Differential Evolution; Differential evolutionary; Efficient utilization of energy; Evolutionary computation techniques; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Multi population; Multi-population model; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060460940

However, climate change has emerged as a major threat to India's hard-earned success. Much of India's population depends on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing, and thus the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people are at risk. In fact, the country has already witnessed adverse impacts of climate change on food production, transportation, storage, and distribution. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, extreme weather conditions (such as prolonged droughts and floods), changing soil fertility, and new pest infestations are major factors contributing to stagnant agricultural growth. ""Climate-smart agriculture"" is considered a pragmatic approach to ensuring food security in a changing climate. Adaptation strategies based on the principles of climate-smart agriculture can counter the impacts of climate change, such as the promotion of conservation agriculture, the sustainable management of natural resources and the promotion of climate-smart crops. However, the existing problems of transboundary water conflict, universal insurance of crops, the significant reduction in food wastage needed and the improvement of food distribution are essential to achieving the goals for adaptation. It is also important to note that ready acceptance of ""climate-smart agriculture"" by farmers cannot be expected, even if the necessary technologies are made accessible to them. Rather, more community-based participatory research is needed to explore socioeconomic and location-specific variables that are influencing farmers' preferences towards the approach. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Climate change; Climate-smart crops; Conservation agriculture; Crop insurance; Food security; Food wastage; India; Public distribution of food",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078646081

Pollutants formed during combustion, depleting fossil fuels and continuous raising fuel price pushes the research community to find new alternative fuels which can be used along with diesel or replace the diesel without making major modifications in the current engine. The objective of this research work is to derive bio-diesel fuel from the source of algae and use it as a fuel by blending with commercially available diesel fuel. Heptanol is added along with algae bio-diesel and diesel blend to improve the ignition quality of the blend. Tests were conducted on a single cylinder constant speed, water cooled stationary diesel engine with different blends proportions of heptanol-biodiesel-diesel. The experimental results obtained for seven different types of blend proportions were compared with baseline diesel values.

A number of countries included wastes as a priority sector given the growing demand for sanitation and the large electricity costs and greenhouse gas emissions associated with water supply and wastes treatment. Wastes are valuable resources in the circular economy, and their safe management is an efficient investment in the health of humans and ecosystems. In this sense, the nutrient cycling of wastes is becoming a critical development and climate strategy for a number of countries. Microalgae/cyanobacteria play critical roles in energy fluxes and nutrient cycles by incorporating and redistributing dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients in the environment. These microorganisms show wide potential for use as biocatalysts in environmental biotechnology processes due to their robustness and simple nutritional requirements. In addition, microalgae/cyanobacteria can manufacture a wide range of biobased chemicals that are useful for diverse industrial applications. However, the life-cycle analysis of this process needs to be studied before large-scale deployment and adoption of this strategy once the limitation to the development of microalgae/cyanobacteria-based processes at a commercial scale is associated with their relatively high cost and negative energy balance. Divided into five discrete parts, the chapter covers topics on the current status of legislation in relation to the management of wastes, environmental applications of microalgae/cyanobacteria in the nutrient cycling, evaluation of microalgal/cyanobacterial sludge dewatering and drying systems, biobased products obtention from microalgal/cyanobacterial sludge and life-cycle analysis of microalgae/cyanobacteria-based processes, summarizing a range of useful technoeconomic opportunities to be applied to waste treatments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This paper considers different distributed generation systems as a main part to design a microgrid and the resources management is defined in a period through proposed dynamic economic dispatch approach. The inputs are obtained by the model predictive control algorithm considering variations of both pattern of consumption and generation systems capacity, including conventional and renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the proposed approach considers a benefits program to customers involving a demand restriction and the costs of regeneration of the pollutants produced by conventional generation systems. The dispatch strategy through a mathematical programming approach seeks to reduce to the minimum the fuel cost of conventional generators, the energy transactions, the regeneration of polluted emissions and, finally, includes the benefit in electricity demand reduction satisfying all restrictions through mathematical programming strategy.

In this paper, a novel optimisation strategy that maximises the CO2 storage capacity utilisation and net profits before tax is presented in a scenario of simultaneous CO2 injection and brine production to help control pressure build up and increase the effective storage capacity. The strategy is tested at the region surrounding the Forties and Nelson fields, assuming both as pure saline aquifer traps. The optimisation was performed considering constraints such that the CO2 plume distribution does not migrate outside the license boundaries, the fracture pressure is not reached within the reservoir, and the CO2 injection and brine production rates occur within feasible limits. The problem was first formulated analytically with the aid of surrogate models, and then optimised using the SIMPLEX and Generalized Reduced Gradient methods. Results for the Forties and Nelson fields show that by allowing five brine production wells producing up to 2.2 MMtonnes/year, the CO2 storage capacity increased between 112-145% compared to the case where no brine production is practiced. © 2018","CO2 storage optimization; Forties sandstone; storage capacity maximization; surrogate modelling","Aquifers; Gradient methods; Hydrogeology; Brine productions; CO2 storage; Fracture pressures; Generalized reduced gradient methods; Injection process; Pressure build up; Storage capacity; Surrogate modelling; Carbon dioxide; aquifer; brine; carbon sequestration; fluid injection; oil well; optimization; sandstone; storage structure; surrogate method; Atlantic Ocean; Forties Field; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057743151

The objective of this study was to evaluate mechanized options for dry direct-seeding of rice in terms of the productivity and production costs in rainfed lowlands. In a series of on-farm research trials over 3 years in Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand, we compared seeding by seed drills mounted on two-wheel tractors with manual broadcast seeding. Demonstration trials of seed drills and site-specific nutrient management in 2017 with 11 of 26 participating farmers produced 2.50 t ha −1 of grain yield, but unexpected heavy storms forced the other 15 farmers to switch from dry to wet direct-seeding or manual transplanting. The seed drills produced 32% higher grain yield than manual broadcast seeding (3.3 vs. 2.5 t ha −1 ) in 2014, and 14–24% higher yield (3.3–3.6 vs. 2.9 t ha −1 ) in 2015. Mechanized seeding enabled seeding rate reduction by 50% in 2014 and by 52–61% in 2015, resulting in lower production costs than with manual seeding. Our results suggest that mechanized dry direct-seeding of rice with improved nutrient management can enhance farmer livelihoods in rainfed environments in northeastern Thailand. This approach can significantly reduce production costs compared with manual transplanting, while maintaining or increasing productivity compared with conventional manual broadcast seeding.

Depending on the simulation-observation spatial scale mismatch, QM can be used for two different applications. The first application uses only the bias correction component, establishing transfer functions between observations and simulations at similar spatial scales. The second application includes a statistical downscaling component when point-scale observations are considered. However, knowledge of alterations to climate change signal (CCS) resulting from these two applications is limited. This study investigates QM impacts on the original temperature and precipitation CCSs when applied according to a bias correction only (BC-only) and a bias correction plus downscaling (BC + DS) application over reference stations in Central Italy. BC-only application is used to adjust regional climate model (RCM) simulations having the same resolution as the observation grid. QM BC + DS application adjusts the same simulations to point-wise observations. QM applications alter CCS mainly for temperature. BC-only application produces a CCS of the median ~ 1 °C lower than the original (~ 4.5 °C). BC + DS application produces CCS closer to the original, except over the summer 95th percentile, where substantial amplification of the original CCS resulted. The impacts of the two applications are connected to the ratio between the observed and the simulated standard deviation (STD) of the calibration period. For the precipitation, original CCS is essentially preserved in both applications. Yet, calibration period STD ratio cannot predict QM impact on the precipitation CCS when simulated STD and mean are similarly misrepresented. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; downscaling; mapping; observational method; regional climate; signal processing; transfer function; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042077942

It's been a challenge to reduce both pollutants at the source simultaneously, except by efforts through low temperature combustion concepts. NOx formation is dependent on the combustion temperature and thus the in-cylinder reduction of NOx formation remains of utmost importance. In this regard, water injection into the intake of a heavy-duty diesel engine to reduce peak combustion temperature and thereby reducing NOx is found to be a promising technology. Current work involves the use of 1-D thermodynamic simulation using AVL BOOST for modeling the engine performance with water injection. Mixing Controlled Combustion (MCC) model was used which can model the emissions. Initially, the model validation without the water injector was carried out with experimental data. Further to this, the water injector module was integrated to inject decided quantity of water from the experiment to get optimum emission reduction. 3D CFD analysis using CONVERGE was carried out in-order to assess the water spray characteristics. A selection of water injector based on the required injection quantity was carried out and engine experiments were carried out based on the recommendations of the simulation results. European Steady-state Cycle (ESC) and European Transient Cycle (ETC) emissions were carried out using water injection to assess the potential emission reduction. Water to fuel ratio was varied from 3 to 16% in-order to study the impact on NOx reduction. Results of CFD study showed placement of water injector in the intake air pipe down-stream the EGR mixing point helps to improve the evaporation characteristics of water spray. Engine experiment results show reduction of up to 13% NOx by use of 16% water to fuel ratio in ESC cycle and up to 7% reduction in ETC cycle. Use of higher quantity of water is limited by droplet size of water spray and thus tends to increase the soot emissions. It is recommended to use water to fuel ratio in the range of 3-16% in-order to avoid the NOx-PM trade off. © 2019 SAE International.

The methodology includes both quantitative target analysis and post-run target screening analysis. The quantitative method was validated after a previous optimisation of the single-stage Orbitrap fragmentation through the Higher-Energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) Cell. Overall, the quantitative method presented recoveries ranging from 78% to 119%, with a precision (RSD) lower than 20%, for the 18 substances in the scope of the target method. Limit of quantification (LOQ) for UV-inks photoinitiators ranged from 0.5 µg/kg−1 for Isopropyl Thioxanthone (ITX) and 2-Ethylhexyl 4-(dimethylamino) benzoate (EHDAB) to 5 µg/kg−1 for the rest of photoinitiators. LOQ for PAAs were 2 µg/kg−1 except for aniline (ANL) and 3,3′ dimethylbenzidine (3,3′-DMB) which was 2.5 µg/kg−1 in the two studied simulants (acetic acid 3% and ethanol 50%). For post-run target screening a customized theoretical database, that included Bisphenols, Polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs), Phosphorus Flame Retardants (PFRs) and other substances was built. For identification purposes, a mass accuracy lower than 5 ppm, and some diagnostic ions including isotopes and/or fragments were used. The strategy was applied to 18 samples collected in the Valencian region (Spain). No compounds were detected when the standardised migration test was applied. However, in the destructive test, benzophenone and EHDAB were determined from tetrabrick and pouch materials.

Here, we rightsize expectations for BECCS in ambitious climate response. This chapter evaluates potential constraints to BECCS at very large scale and in scenarios in which global temperatures peak and then decline. It also analyzes near-term opportunities for catalyzing BECCS development, demonstration, and deployment. The examples used include both global analyses and regional consideration of near-term options in the United States.

Community-based climate change adaptation programs become nothing more than a trap to circumvent the local communities to get some plans sanctioned, encoded by the external agencies. The reason is that participation is not a simple, straightforward notion. In this chapter, it is argued that given manifold comprehension of participation, its unshackled, combative frameworks and numerous as well as dubious operation methods and techniques, the actual implementation of the participatory projects and programs is in the hand of implementation agencies. Their willingness, understanding, skills, and capacities determine to a great extent how successfully local communities can be engaged in the climate change adaptation programs. If the community's participation in climate change adaptation projects needs to be enhanced, it is critical to explore how stakeholders including government officials, technocrats, project managers, and donor agencies conceptualize and idealize community participation. But, in climate change adaptation studies, no such initiative has ever been made. This chapter aims to identify stakeholders' perspectives on effective ways, steps and factors for ensuring effective community participation in climate change adaptation programs and projects based on a case study in the Wa West district of Northern Ghana.

Design/methodology/approach: Carbon steel was selected for this study. Winogradsky media was used for isolation of IOB and as test solution for corrosion measurements. Electrochemical tests and immersion test were conducted to estimate the corrosion rate and extent of pitting. The corroded surface was analysed by SEM and corrosion products formed over the metal surface were identified by XRD and Fourier transformed infrared. Biofilm formed over the corroded metal was analysed by UV-visible spectroscopy for its extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) constituents. Findings: Presence of IOB in Winogradsky medium enhances corrosion. Uniform and localized corrosion increases with increased bacterial concentration and EPS constituents of the biofilm. Iron sulphite formation as one of the corrosion products has been suggested to be responsible for increased corrosion attack in the inoculated media in comparison to control media where corrosion product observed is iron hydrogen phosphate which is protective in nature. Originality/value: This work correlates increased corrosion of steel in the presence of bacteria with the nature of corrosion products formed over it in case of IOB. Formation of corrosion products is governed by various electrochemical reactions; hence, inhibition of such reactions may lead to reduce or stop the formation of such products which enhances corrosion and thereby may reduce the extent of microbial induced corrosion. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon steel; Corrosion tests; EPS; FTIR; Iron oxidizing bacteria; XRD","Bacteria; Biofilms; Carbon steel; Corrosion protection; Corrosion rate; Electrochemical corrosion; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Iron compounds; Iron metallography; Localized corrosion; Microbial corrosion; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; Corrosion tests; Design/methodology/approach; Electrochemical reactions; Extracellular polymeric substances; FTIR; Iron oxidizing bacteria; Microbial influenced corrosions; Uniform and localized corrosion; Steel corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054788481

DI diesel engines with four valves per cylinder are widely used in off- highway applications because of the fundamental advantages of higher volumetric efficiency, lower pumping loss, symmetric fuel spray & distribution in combination with the symmetric air motion which can give nearly optimal mixture formation and combustion process. As a result, the fuel consumption, smoke levels and exhaust emissions can be considerably reduced. In particular, the four-valve technology, coupled with mechanical low pressure and electronic high pressure fuel delivery systems set different requirements for inlet port performance. In the present paper four valve intake port design strategies are analysed for off highway engine using mechanical fuel injection systems. Different intake port designs are experimentally evaluated on steady state flow test rig using AVL paddle wheel method for swirl and flow coefficient performance. A detail numerical analysis is carried out using AVL FIRE CFD simulation software to study effect of offset fire deck chamfer at cylinder head bottom face on velocity and pressure field which cannot be gained through experimental way. Moreover, the impact of design of directed port on in-cylinder flow field is studied through CFD simulation and the design is optimized to achieve higher swirl targets suitable to requirements of mechanical fuel injection system. Thus, two different approaches are numerically analysed and a promising design concepts are derived to raise the intake port performance for four valve intake port configuration. © 2019 SAE International.

Almost all types of critical infrastructure are reliant on energy supply, making energy infrastructure perhaps the most important component of today’s critical infrastructure networks. This chapter explores the vulnerability of power infrastructure to climate change, and examines the feasibility of using climate adaptation engineering to reduce potential climate change risks. A single aspect of the power infrastructure is considered, namely, power distribution poles. Probabilistic modelling techniques are used to complete the three stages in the analysis framework: (1) establish existing vulnerability, (2) quantify climate change impacts, and (3) assess the feasibility of different climate adaptation techniques using cost-benefit analysis. A case study is presented for each of these three stages. The climate change impacts case study shows that future climatic effects on power infrastructure can be significant, but are highly regionally variable. The climate adaptation assessment illustrates that a risk-based decision support can be used to develop cost-effective climate adaptation strategies, reducing climate-related opportunity costs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation practice can conserve water while reducing CH 4 emissions through the deliberate, periodic introduction of aerobic soil conditions. This paper is the first to measure the impact of AWD on rice field CH 4 emissions using the eddy covariance (EC) method. This method provides continuous, direct observations over a larger footprint than in previous chamber-based approaches. Seasonal CH 4 emissions from a pair of adjacent, production-sized rice fields under delayed flood (DF) and AWD irrigation were compared from 2015 to 2017. Across the 2 fields and 3 years, cumulative CH 4 emissions in the production season were in the range of 7.1 to 31.7 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 for the AWD treatment and in the range of 75.7-141.6 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 for the DF treatments. Correcting for field-to-field differences in CH 4 production, the AWD practice reduced seasonal CH 4 emissions by 64.5 ± 2.5%. The AWD practice is increasingly implemented for water conservation in the mid-south region of the United States; however, based on this study, it also has great potential for reducing CH 4 emissions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Emission control; Irrigation; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Anthropogenic emissions; Direct observations; Eddy covariance method; Field to fields; Irrigation practices; Methane emissions; Rice cultivation; WETTING AND DRYING; Wetting; methane; water; methane; agricultural land; anthropogenic effect; detection method; eddy covariance; emission control; methane; rice; seasonal variation; wetting-drying cycle; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; Eddy covariance; flooding; irrigation (agriculture); reduction (chemistry); rice; seasonal variation; United States; water conservation; agriculture; Oryza; season; soil; water supply; United States; Agriculture; Methane; Oryza; Seasons; Soil; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059653285

The use of refuse-derived fuels (RDF) in cement kilns is increasingly portrayed as a sustainable solution to reduce emissions while dealing with different types of waste. Nevertheless, the use of RDF in cement plants is contested by communities around the world, who are facing immediate environmental impacts. In this article, we examine the burgeoning movement against waste incineration in cement kilns legitimized as energy recovery. We start by revisiting the environmental justice literature, which laid the groundwork for the contemporary anti-RDF movement. Then, in order to highlight the energy dimension of RDF we focus on two energy-related concepts: energy justice and energy democracy. Through the case study of Can Sant Joan (Catalonia), we assess the suitability and usefulness of these concepts with the local movement against waste incineration. Our analysis suggests that the movement against RDF use can be further energized and strengthened by expanding into the realm of energy democracy. Both the anti-RDF and the energy democracy movement share a focus on the local scale, have similar typology of stakeholders involved, and favor a strong bottom-up approach while paying attention to unequal power relations. We also observe that these movements can mutually benefit from being better integrated with one another. Finally, we propose that a potential alliance between the Plataforma Antiincineració de Montcada i Reixac (PAMiR) and the Xarxa per la Sobirania Energètica (Xse) in Catalonia, can mobilize fruitful internal tensions toward a more inclusive and democratic future. © Copyright © 2019 Ruiz Cayuela and Turhan.","energy democracy; energy justice; energy sovereignty; environmental justice; refuse-derived fuels; waste incineration","Brickmaking; Cement industry; Cement plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Kilns; Waste incineration; Catalonia; Cement kiln; Energy; Energy democracy; Energy justices; Energy sovereignty; Environmental justice; Greenhouse gas emissions; Refuse-derived fuels; Cements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090331053

Biomass allocation, as one of these traits, is responsible for resource acquisition, and its plastic modifications can be of adaptive value in new environments before any genetic adaptations may occur. Our aim was to compare in situ biomass allocation in aboveground and belowground organs in an Antarctic and a Polish population of annual bluegrass (Poa annua), the only alien plant species successfully invading Antarctica. The Antarctic population was characterised by three times lower aboveground biomass, more compact plant growth habit and higher fraction of biomass allocated into belowground organs than in the Polish population. The differences between populations are probably a result of adaptation to local conditions. The modifications of the studied traits in the Antarctic population are most likely a response to extreme atmospheric and edaphic conditions and enable the species to survive and spread in this hostile environment. Our results are in accordance with the balanced growth hypothesis. At the same time, these trait values enhance species performance under Antarctic conditions making P. annua a potential threat to local plant communities under altering climate changes and growing human impact scenario. © 2018, The Author(s).","Biomass allocation; Invasive species; Phenotypic plasticity; Plant morphology","adaptation; anthropogenic effect; biomass allocation; climate change; ecomorphology; fitness; grass; invasive species; invasiveness; phenotypic plasticity; plant community; resource allocation; survival; Antarctica; Poa annua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055258543

The policy debate around this concept has been vigorous, but theoretical attempts to develop the concept are few. Covering fields of strategical importance, such as economic governance; growth and sustainable development; energy, environment and climate action; education, the labour market, and foreign affairs, this book is one of the first attempts to profoundly theorise the concept of ‘resilience’ in international relations by looking at several policy areas and countries. Faced with multiple crises (the economic crisis, the Brexit referendum, the refugee crisis, terrorist attacks, geopolitics such as events in the Ukraine), and challenges with its integration process, the European Union needs to become not only more intelligent, more inclusive and more sustainable, but also more resilient and more capable of reacting to different internal and external shocks. This book integrates a systemic assessment of the regions’ specific shocks and risks in relation to internal vulnerabilities (i.e. structural economic, social, institutional and political fragility) and to their long and medium-term impact on the stability, security and sustainable development in the region. © The Editor(s) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086205472

However, it does not simultaneously compensate for anthropogenic changes in further climate variables in a perfect manner. Here, we investigate to what extent a proponent of the 2 °C-temperature target would apply SGE in conjunction with mitigation in view of regional disparities in temperature and precipitation. We apply cost-risk analysis (CRA), which is a decision analytic framework that trades-off expected welfare-loss from climate policy costs and climate risks from transgressing a climate target. Here, in ‘Giorgi’-regional-scale analyses, we evaluate the optimal mix of SGE and mitigation under probabilistic information about climate sensitivity and generalize CRA in order to include regional temperature and precipitation risks. In addition to a mitigation-only analysis, social welfare is maximized for the following three joint-mitigation-SGE scenarios: temperature-risk-only, precipitation-risk-only, and equally weighted both-risks. We find that for regionally differentiated precipitation targets, the usage of SGE will be restricted. Our results indicate that SGE would save 70–75% of welfare-loss in the precipitation-risk-only and both-risks scenarios compared to a purely mitigation-based analysis with approximate overall welfare loss of 4% in terms of balanced growth equivalent from economic costs and climate risks. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Climate targets; Cost-risk analysis; Decision under uncertainty; Mitigation; Solar geoengineering","Climate change; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Climate targets; Cost risk analysis; Decision under uncertainty; Geoengineering; Mitigation; Risk analysis; analytical framework; anthropogenic effect; cost analysis; decision analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental risk; probability; regional climate; risk assessment; scenario analysis; sensitivity analysis; trade-off; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048038523

Therefore, it challenges the preservation of biodiversity and the provision of key ecosystem services for urban settlements. These services include leisure and recreation, climate and water regulation, water purification, and especially alleviation of natural hazards. Tsunami flood mitigation is a particularly valuable regulating service provided by these wetlands, as recently evidenced during the 2010 tsunami that hit the central coast of Chile. The Concepción Metropolitan Area (CMA), located on the central coast of Chile, has experienced noticeable wetland loss in recent decades. Our study focused on the Rocuant-Andalién wetland, which has been particularly affected by urbanization. This wetland strongly contributes to flood control, and has provided effective protection against the CMA's latest tsunamis (1835 and 2010). Based on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), we have quantified urban growth over the wetland, both executed and projected under the Metropolitan Urban Plan of Concepción (MUPC). Recent loss in wetland area by urban growth has been quantified using land use and cover change (LUCC) maps from 2004 to 2014, obtained from the classification of Landsat images. Prospective changes (considering the complete MUPC deployment) have been inferred by combining the MUPC with the 2014 land cover map. In addition, we quantified the observed effect and planned urban growth on the wetland protected area, geoforms and potential flooding based on the area affected by the last Tsunami. Results show that urban areas have increased by 28% between 2004 and 2014, while future increase is expected to reach 238%. In contrast, wetland area has decreased by 10% from 2004 to 2014 and is expected to decrease by up to 32 %. Thus, the MUPC is not contributing to the mitigation of wetland loss nor the preservation of its biodiversity and ecosystem services.

It is particularly interesting in the East Australian Current (EAC) system, as the region's eddy field strongly conditions nutrient availability and therefore phytoplankton growth. Numerical models provide unparalleled insight into these biogeochemical dynamics. Yet, to date, modelling efforts off southeastern Australia have either targeted case studies (small spatial and temporal scales) or encompassed the whole EAC system but focused on climate change effects at the mesoscale (with a spatial resolution of 1/10°). Here we couple a model of the pelagic nitrogen cycle (bio-Fennel) to a 10-year high-resolution (2.5- 5 km horizontal) three-dimensional ocean model (ROMS) to resolve both regional and finer-scale biogeochemical processes occurring in the EAC system. We use several statistical metrics to compare the simulated surface chlorophyll to an ocean colour dataset (Copernicus-GlobColour) for the 2003-2011 period and show that the model can reproduce the observed phytoplankton surface patterns with a domain-wide RMSE of approximately 0.2 mg Chl a m -3 and a correlation coefficient of 0.76.

Many SIDS recognize that adequate and effective adaptation to climate change are important components of sustainable development and, as such, are pursuing climate change adaptation policies and programs at the national level. Chapter 29 (Small Islands) of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that more needs to be learnt about how climate change mainstreaming can be practically achieved in these countries. Working within a resilience framework and interviewing senior government and regional organization officials from Caribbean and Pacific SIDS, this paper aims to understand the drivers of, and barriers to adaptation mainstreaming at the national level. In doing this, it finds multiple drivers–the three most commonly reported are institutional/organizational, ‘champions’/personalities/informal networks and risk and exposure. It also finds multiple barriers–the three most commonly reported are competing development priorities, poor planning/governance and insufficient manpower/human resources. Building on this knowledge, this paper then proposes a seven-step process towards practically achieving mainstreaming in SIDS, which can be used by national governments and regional organizations to guide their actions in this regard. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change adaptation; mainstreaming; resilience; small island developing states (SIDS); sustainable development","climate change; developing world; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; questionnaire survey; small island state; sustainable development; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036554414

Corallivores often prey on corals repeatedly, and this predation induces wounds that require extensive cellular resources to heal. The effects of corallivory on coral growth, reproduction, and community dynamics are well-documented, and often result in reduced growth rates and fitness. Given the degree of anthropogenic pressures that threaten coral reefs, it is now imperative to focus on understanding how corallivory interacts with anthropogenic forces to alter coral health and community dynamics. For example, coral bleaching events that stem from global climate change often reduce preferred corals species for many corallivorous fishes. These reductions in preferred prey may result in declines in populations of more specialized corallivores while more generalist corallivores may increase. Corallivory may also make corals more susceptible to thermal stress and exacerbate bleaching. At local scales, overfishing depletes corallivorous fish stocks, reducing fish corallivory and bioerosion, whilst removing invertivorous fishes and allowing population increases in invertebrate corallivores (e.g., urchins, Drupella spp.). Interactive effects of local stressors, such as overfishing and nutrient pollution, can alter the effect of corallivory by increasing coral-algal competition and destabilizing the coral microbiome, subsequently leading to coral disease and mortality. Here, we synthesize recent literature of how global climate change and local stressors affect corallivore populations and shape the patterns and effect of corallivory. Our review indicates that the combined effects of corallivory and anthropogenic pressures may be underappreciated and that these interactions often drive changes in coral reefs on scales from ecosystems to microbes. Understanding the ecology of coral reefs in the Anthropocene will require an increased focus on how anthropogenic forcing alters biotic interactions, such as corallivory, and the resulting cascading effects on corals and reef ecosystems. © 2019 Rice, Ezzat and Burkepile.","Acanthaster spp; Butterflyfishes; Corallivory; Global climate change; Nutrient pollution; Overfishing; Parrotfishes",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059748504

In The Governance of Solar Geoengineering, Jesse L. Reynolds draws on law, political science, and economics to show how solar geoengineering is, could, and should be governed.

With the rise of Internet of Things technologies (IoT) in recent years, many IoT-based remote sensing devices have been applied to plant phenotyping and crop monitoring, which are generating terabytes of biological datasets every day. However, it is still technically challenging to calibrate, annotate, and aggregate the big data effectively, especially when they were produced in multiple locations and at different scales. Findings: CropSight is a PHP Hypertext Pre-processor and structured query language-based server platform that provides automated data collation, storage, and information management through distributed IoT sensors and phenotyping workstations. It provides a two-component solution to monitor biological experiments through networked sensing devices, with interfaces specifcally designed for distributed plant phenotyping and centralized data management. Data transfer and annotation are accomplished automatically through an hypertext transfer protocol-accessible RESTful API installed on both device side and server side of the CropSight system, which synchronize daily representative crop growth images for visual-based crop assessment and hourly microclimate readings for GxE studies. CropSight also supports the comparison of historical and ongoing crop performance while different experiments are being conducted. Conclusions: As a scalable and open-source information management system, CropSight can be used to maintain and collate important crop performance and microclimate datasets captured by IoT sensors and distributed phenotyping installations. It provides near real-time environmental and crop growth monitoring in addition to historical and current experiment comparison through an integrated cloud-ready server system. Accessible both locally in the feld through smart devices and remotely in an offce using a personal computer, CropSight has been applied to feld experiments of bread wheat prebreeding since 2016 and speed breeding since 2017. We believe that the CropSight system could have a signifcant impact on scalable plant phenotyping and IoT-style crop management to enable smart agricultural practices in the near future. © 2019 The Author(s).","CropSight; distributed plant phenotyping; information system; IoT-based crop management; phenomics","Article; automation; calibration; crop; crop management; information processing; information system; microclimate; monitoring; nonhuman; phenotype; plant; plant growth; priority journal; anatomy and histology; Internet; phenotype; software; wheat; Crops, Agricultural; Internet; Microclimate; Phenotype; Software; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063293087

However, PDAs do not focus on nor do they prioritize measures in relation to specific social contexts. This study assessed socio-economic variables, energy consumption and indoor environments in households located in the city of Valdivia, through surveys and the monitoring of temperatures and indoor air pollution levels. We found that, during the winter months, 68% of the time living room temperatures were below 21 °C, and PM2.5 concentrations were above international standards. Furthermore, over 61% of households were to suffer a state of energy poverty. We urge decision-makers to consider social inequalities and energy consumption patterns in cities with high firewood consumption, prioritizing measures and focusing resources on reducing both air pollution and energy poverty.

Nearly half of the total paddy field in Kedah State, Malaysia cannot be utilized for paddy cultivation because of soft clay soil. The problem is related to the presence of weak hardpan structure that permits the soil to experience continuous wet condition. The soil also causes in the alteration of many processes soil organic carbon sequestration and turnover, but the main effect on the land is decrease in soil fertility. To investigate the effects of soft clay soil on soil organic carbon content, stock and change rate, the trial has been conducted in Alor Senibong paddy field area in Kedah, Malaysia examining the problematic paddy field that associated with soft clay soil problem. Hasil Tani Organic Compound (HTOC) was an organic soil amendment that used to enhance soil organic carbon in this study. Paddy field with the presence of soft clay soil showed a low soil organic carbon content and stock around 0.67% and 1.01 t·ha -1 , respectively (depth 0-15 cm). The reduction of soil organic carbon content in soft clay soil was likely because of the waterlogged soil environment, the stability of soil aggregates and decline in humification process which then reduced soil organic carbon input. After being treated with HTOC, soil organic carbon content and carbon stock in soft clay soil have significantly increased by 0.67-3.14% and 1.01-4.76 t·ha -1 (depth 0-15 cm), respectively, yielding a mean monthly carbon change rate of 4.36 g C kg −1 ·mth. −1 (depth 0-15 cm).

In the context of global change, identifying CSA management practices requires integrated information and full assessment on food production systems as well as associated environmental consequences (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions and changes in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles). Recent decades have witnessed unprecedented development in field observations and measurements, high-resolution remote sensing, and multiscale process-based modeling, which facilitates the comprehensive investigation of agroecosystem responses to and the environmental impacts of land management using an integrated agroecosystem modeling approach.

Anthropogenic forcing due to increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has driven changes in climate variables globally. Changes in climatological variables have severe impact on global hydrological cycle affecting the severity and occurrence of natural hazards such as floods and droughts. Estimation of projections under climate signals with statistical and dynamic downscaling models and integration with water resource management models for the impact assessment have gained much attention. The fine-resolution climate change predictions of dynamic regional climate model (RCM) outputs, which include regional parameterization, have been widely applied in the hydrological impact assessment studies. Advancement of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) program has enabled the use of RCMs in regional impact assessment which has progressed in recent years. CORDEX model outputs were considered to be valuable in terms of establishing large ensembles of climate projections based on regional climate downscaling all over the world. However, the simulations of RCM outputs have to be evaluated to check the reliability in reproducing the observed climate variability over a region. The present study demonstrates the use of bias-corrected CORDEX model simulation in analyzing the regional-scale climatology at river basin scale, Krishna river basin (KRB), India. The precipitation and temperature simulations from CORDEX models with RCP 4.5 were evaluated for the historical data for the period of 1965 to 2014 with India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded rainfall and temperature data sets cropped over the basin. The projected increase of precipitation under climate signals was predicted to be from 74.4 to 136.7 mm over KRB for the future time period of 2041-2060 compared to the observed periods of 1966-2003. About 1.06 °C to 1.35 °C of increase in temperatures was predicted for the periods of 2021-2040 and 2041-2060, respectively, compared to the observed period of 1966-2014 over KRB. The climate variable projections obtained based on RCM outputs can provide insights toward the variations of water-energy variables and consequent impact on basin yields and losses in river basin management. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Bias correction; Dynamic downscaling; General circulation model (gcm); Hydrology; Regional circulation model (rcm)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085448298

The lack of molecular insights on the mechanism and enantioselectivity in dual-catalytic reactions motivated the present study focusing on an important catalytic asymmetric Heck-Matsuda cross-coupling. A comprehensive density functional theory (M06 and B3LYP-D3) investigation of the coupling between a spirocyclic cyclopentene and 4-fluorophenyl diazonium species under a dual-catalytic condition involving Pd 2 (dba) 3 (dba = trans,trans-dibenzylideneacetone) and chiral 2,2′-binaphthyl diamine (BINAM)-derived phosphoric acids (BDPA, 2,2′-binaphthyl diamine-derived phosphoric acids) is presented. Among various mechanistic possibilities examined, the pathway with explicit inclusion of the base (in situ generated sodium bicarbonate/sodium biphosphate) is found to be energetically more preferred over the analogous base-free routes. The chiral phosphate generated by the action of sodium carbonate on BDPA is found to remain associated with the reaction site as a counterion. The initial oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the aryl diazonium bond gives rise to a Pd-aryl intermediate, which then goes through the enantiocontrolling migratory insertion to the cyclic alkene, leading to an arylated cycloalkene intermediate. Insights on how a series of noncovalent interactions, such as C-H⋯O, C-H⋯N, C-H⋯F, C-H⋯π, lp⋯π, O-H⋯π, and C-F⋯π, in the enantiocontrolling transition state (TS) render the migration of the Pd-aryl to the si prochiral face of the cyclic alkene more preferred over that to the re face are utilized for modulating the enantioselectivity. Aided by molecular insights on the enantiocontrolling transition states, we predicted improved enantioselectivity from 37% to 89% by changes in the N-aryl substituents of the catalyst. Subsequent experiments in our laboratory offered very good agreement with the predicted enantioselectivities. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Amines; Aromatic compounds; Catalysis; Catalysts; Density functional theory; Ions; Olefins; Phosphoric acid; Sodium bicarbonate; Sodium Carbonate; Substitution reactions; Asymmetric catalysis; Catalytic conditions; Catalytic reactions; Dibenzylideneacetone; Migratory insertion; Molecular insights; Non-covalent interaction; Oxidative additions; Enantioselectivity; 2,2' binaphthyl diamine derived phosphoric acid; 4 fluorophenyl diazonium; bicarbonate; cycloalkene; cyclopentene derivative; diazonium compound; phosphoric acid derivative; sodium dihydrogen phosphate; unclassified drug; Article; asymmetric catalysis; catalysis; chemical interaction; chemical modification; chemical parameters; cross coupling reaction; density functional theory; enantiocontrolling transition state; enantioselectivity; Heck Matsuda arylation; noncovalent interaction; reaction analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059689315

However, we still poorly understand the forest response to different environmental change drivers, which limits our ability to predict the future of tropical forests. Although some studies have evaluated drought effects on tree communities, we know little about the influence of increased water availability. Here, we evaluated how an increase in water availability caused by an artificial reservoir affected temporal changes in forest structure, species and functional diversity, and community-weighted mean traits. Furthermore, we evaluated how demographical groups (recruits, survivors and trees that died) contributed to these temporal changes in tropical dry forests. We present data for the dynamics of forest change over a 10-year period for 120 permanent plots that were far from the water’s edge before reservoir construction and are now close to the water’s edge (0–60 m). Plots close to the water’s edge had an abrupt increase in water availability, while distant plots did not. Plots close to the water’s edge showed an increase in species and functional diversity, and in the abundance of species with traits associated with low drought resistance (i.e., evergreen species with simple leaves and low wood density), whereas plots far from the water’s edge did not change. Changes in overall community metrics were mainly due to recruits rather than to survivors or dead trees. Overall stand basal area did not change because growth and recruitment were balanced by mortality. Synthesis. Our results showed that tropical dry forests can respond quickly to abrupt changes in environmental conditions. Temporal changes in vegetation metrics due to increased water availability were mainly attributed to recruits, suggesting that these effects are lasting and may become stronger over time. The lack of increase in basal area towards the water’s edge, and the shift towards higher abundance of soft-wooded species, could reduce the carbon stored and increase the forest’s vulnerability to extreme weather events. Further “accidental” large-scale field experiments like ours could provide more insights into forest responses and resilience to global change. © 2018 The Authors.

Emissions resulting from a variety of BSFs (cow dung cakes, wood, and agriculture residues) contain a significant amount of air pollutants, which are now recognized for their role in climatic change and adverse human health impacts. In the current study, daily variations in black carbon (BC) or Short-Lived Climate Forcer concentrations were studied from rural household kitchens using portable aethalometer. The hourly average concentration of BC ranges from 5.4 μg·m−3 to 34.9 μg·m−3 for various types of household kitchens. The peak levels of BC were found to be significantly higher, when compared to World Health Organization PM2.5 limits for ambient air and hence pose a threat to the health of the vulnerable population, i.e., women, children, older adults and those who have health problems. The study also highlights the variation of BC concentration in different kitchen type. The average BC concentration in indoor, outdoor and semi-open kitchen was observed to be 14.54, 14.28 and 24.69 μg·m−3, respectively. The excess lifetime carcinogenic risk for cooking 4 h/day in these kitchens in the North Indian villages was estimated to be 1.25 × 10−7, 1.22 × 10−7, and 2.12 × 10−7 respectively. Age-specific excess cancer deaths due to BC exposure were measured highest in children below four years of age in Chandigarh, India. Hence, there is a need to shift the BSF users to clean fuel alternatives to reduce the exposure to HAP. This can be achieved by generating local/regional evidences of BSFs associated health risks to support policy interventions. Further, more research is required to improve the air quality in indoor micro-environments and specifically in kitchens. Novelty: The first study reporting the near real-time measurements of BC from different types of rural households kitchens of north India. Diurnal pattern of BC concentration was also studied including the effect of chimney, ventilation and kitchen size on observed BC concentration. This study also estimates lifetime excess cancer risk due to BC exposure in rural households in India. The recent ‘Global Burden of Disease’ report identifies household air pollutants as a major cause of disease and disability in Asia. The study will help to plan suitable policies and intervention to reduce household air pollution in the region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass solid fuel; Cooking stove; Excess lifetime cancer risk, age-specific excess cancer deaths (ASECD); Rural households; Ventilation","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Carbon; Developing countries; Diseases; Fuels; Kitchens; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Rural areas; Ventilation; Agriculture residues; Average concentration; Cancer risk; Carcinogenic risk; Human health impacts; Rural households; Solid fuels; World Health Organization; Health risks; biofuel; black carbon; biomass burning; black carbon; cancer; carbon emission; concentration (composition); cooking appliance; diurnal variation; health risk; mortality risk; ventilation; village; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; cancer mortality; cancer risk; carbon footprint; carcinogenicity; child; chimney; concentration (parameter); cooking; environmental exposure; female; health hazard; household; human; India; infant; kitchen; middle aged; newborn; particulate matter; priority journal; risk assessment; room ventilation; rural area; young adult; analysis; environmental exposure; indoor air pollution; neoplasm; risk assessment; rural population; soot; statistics and numerical data; Chandigarh; India; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Humans; India; Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Rural Population; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057572629

Integrated farming systems (IFS) comprising of many agri-innovations have the potential to meet such requirements. An association of individual and interdependent components of farming on a given piece of land, taking cognizance of available natural resources and the differential requirement of a wide range of farming community, remains the guiding principle of IFS. Research conducted across arid and semi-arid regions is reviewed here in order to understand the role of IFS in enhancing production, income and livelihood; minimizing risk associated with farming in arid and drier semi-arid regions; utilizing and conserving the resources; and in enhancing mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It has been conclusively established that IFS involving integration of different enterprises (crop, livestock, horticulture, forestry, poultry and fish) enhanced productivity, profitability, resource use efficiency, generated more employment and minimized resources degradation and risks. IFS, therefore, could be a key form of farming intensification needed for achieving future food security and environmental sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions. Promoting adoption of the location-specific IFS in future is linked directly with coherent policy, institutional commitment, infrastructure development, better coordination among different agricultural and rural development programme and agencies, and a stimulus package of incentives. The relevance of IFS in adaptation to and mitigation of climate change is also discussed. © 2019 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

This paper analyses the environmental and economic impacts of the massive integration of RDG in Spain for 2020 by using an Input-Output approach. The induced production and employment effects in every sector due to new RDG project investments as well as the CO2 reductions attributed to a decline in conventional electricity consumption are estimated. The results indicate that investments in RDG based on photovoltaic and small-hydro have the greatest impact on employment generation. The RDG investments will lead to a decrease in emissions of 21.67% in 2020 compared with 2013. The RDG technologies become an alternative to reach a sustainable economic growth in Spain.

It is based on the Monte-Carlo technique, works in either plane-parallel or spherical-shell geometry, and accounts for polarization. The vector code is written in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and runs on GPUs (Graphic Processing Units). For typical simulations, the GPU-based code running on the Nvidia GTX 1070 card is shown to be 100 time faster than a state of the art CPU-based code running on an AMD PhenomIIx4 965 at 3.4GHz. This makes SMART-G competitive, in terms of computational efficiency, with codes based on other techniques (e.g., discrete ordinate, doubling-adding, matrix-operator, and successive-orders-of-scattering), while allowing maximum flexibility regarding the scope of the simulations. The monochromatic version of the code without trans-spectral processes (Raman scattering, fluorescence) is described, including the treatment of photon propagation and interactive processes (elastic scattering, absorption, reflection, refraction, but not thermal emission) and variance reduction (local estimate). Benchmark values are accurately reproduced for clear and cloudy atmospheres over a wavy reflecting surface and a black ocean. Results obtained for a diffusely reflecting ocean agree with those from a discrete ordinate code.

Here, we evaluate if a woody biochar can produce both agronomic and environmental benefits in deficit irrigation systems by ameliorating water stress, improving crop N uptake and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. To evaluate these responses, we established a maize field trial in northern Colorado under deficit irrigation treatments with a woody biochar amendment. Irrigation treatments included recommended irrigation (Full), recommended irrigation except during non-essential growth phases (Limited) and 50% of recommended irrigation (Drought). We measured crop biomass, grain yield, grain N uptake, mineral N availability, soil water content, soil field capacity, soil C sequestration and N2O emissions. Drought treatments reduced both grain and biomass yield while Limited irrigation showed no significant yield reduction relative to Full irrigation. Biochar amendments did not provide any yield improvements. Biochar also did not alter mineral N availability within the soil profile or grain N uptake. Biochar amendments increased gravimetric soil water content by 9.7% over the field season and increased water retention by 7.4%. However, these increases failed to alleviate the water stress coefficient, an index of how much the water content has dropped below the maximum soil water depletion acceptable between irrigation applications, which was correlated with yield. Biochar sequestered C primarily as coarse biochar particles with significant losses, likely a result of erosion. Across irrigation treatments biochar treatments trended towards a lower mean cumulative N2O emissions over the growing season, but such effect was not significant due to high spatial variability in N2O fluxes. Both biochar amendments and Limited irrigation treatments did not significantly impact yield-scaled cumulative N2O emissions or irrigation water-use efficiency.

The European Union has set ambitious targets to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030. There is special attention on reducing the life cycle emissions in the buildings sector. However, the focus has often been on new buildings, although existing buildings represent great potential within the building stock in Europe. In this study, four different renovation scenarios were analyzed with the commercially available life cycle assessment software that follows the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) standard. This study covers all life cycle steps from the cradle to the grave for a residential building in Borlänge, Sweden, where renewable energy dominates. The four scenarios included reduced indoor temperature, improved thermal properties of building material components and heat recovery for the ventilation system. One finding is that changing installations gives an environmental impact comparable to renovations that include both ventilation and building facilities. In addition, the life cycle steps that have the greatest environmental impact in all scenarios are the operational energy use and the building and installation processes. Renovation measures had a major impact on energy use due to the cold climate and low solar irradiation in the heating season. An interesting aspect, however, is that the building materials and the construction processes gave a significant amount of environmental impact. © 2019 by the authors.","Building materials; Building renovation; Climate change; District heating; Energy directive; Energy efficiency; Environmental impacts; Life cycle assessment","Building materials; Buildings; Climate change; Construction; District heating; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ventilation; Waste heat; Building renovation; District heating system; Energy directive; Energy-efficient renovations; European committee for standardizations; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle emissions; Residential building; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060915288

It is a key contributor to the food, nutritional, and economic security, especially in the Asian countries. To meet the growing demand of human population, innovative or improved, but above all, sustainable production strategies are required for important reasons such as (i) most farmers are poor and many external inputs are expensive, (ii) the water use and chemical fertilizer use efficiencies in farmers’ fields are often low, and (iii) potential risks to the ecological health because of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are high. In the strategies for sustainable agriculture, the important challenge is to stimulate the appropriate microbial activities at the optimal rates for plant health and productivities. Microbial activities in the rhizosphere are of great importance to rice plants. Nutrient cycling, especially carbon and nitrogen, stimulation or inhibition of rice plant growth, and the onset of diseases are largely due to the functioning of microbial communities; no single organism alone can be considered decisive to their functions. Interestingly, the rhizosphere of rice supports simultaneously both oxic (aerobic) processes, such as oxidation of ammonia, iron, sulfur, and methane, and anoxic (anaerobic) processes, such as reduction of nitrate, ferric iron, and sulfate and methanogenesis in different niches. To successfully manage the rhizosphere with desired microbial activities, with or without fertilizer application, it is necessary to identify all the microbial and plant factors that determine root colonization, to understand the structure and functions of microbial communities in greater detail, and to develop rapid and reliable methods to measure and monitor the dynamics of microbial communities. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Biofertilizer; Methane; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Rhizosphere; Sulfur",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085439295

Farmers agreed to implement climate adaptive farming which combines organic farming, biological pest control and drought-resistant seedlings from local varieties. Findings: The processes to adaptation required collective actions, paradigm shift and it also constitutes trial and error processes. Acceptance to innovation is mostly one of the major challenges. Working with “contact” farmers and “advance” farmers is the key to the community organizing strategy for innovation and adaptation. Research limitations/implications: This case study is limited to the adaptation program funded by Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund in four farmer groups in Purwosari Sub-District, GunungKidul district and Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Practical implications: Trainings and direct assistance to climate adaptive farming have benefitted the farmers that they are able to increase the farming production and reduce the risk of crop failure.

Conveniently, hydrogen can be converted back to electricity either via fuel cells or through combustion in gas turbines, or it can be mixed in low concentrations with natural gas or biogas for combustion in existing power plants. The cornerstone of a practical solar fuel production process is a stable, efficient, and scalable photocatalyst (a semiconductor material that accommodates photon absorption, charge carrier generation and transport, and catalytic reactions). Therefore, the quest for suitable photocatalyst materials is an ongoing process.Recently, carbon nitride (CN) has attracted widespread interest as a metal-free, earth-abundant, and highly stable photocatalyst. However, the catalytic efficiency of CN is not satisfactory because of its poor charge transport attributes. There is a direct relation between the photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport because the basic principle of light-promoted overall photodecomposition of water into H 2 and O 2 molecules (or, generally speaking, photoredox reactions) relies on separation and subsequent transfer of excited-state electron-hole pairs to relative redox couples. However, the excited states last for a very short time, typically nanoseconds to microseconds in liquids, and unless they are separated within this time frame, the excited-state electron-hole pairs undergo recombination with release of the captured light energy as heat or photon emission. To utilize light in a form other than heat or emitted photons by avoiding the recombination of excited-state electron-hole pairs, charged excitons must be scavenged before the absorption of subsequent photons to sustain a multielectron photoredox reaction. Otherwise, the extraction of charges becomes more difficult. This imposes a potential efficiency-limiting factor. An enhancement in water to hydrogen conversion efficiency in CN therefore requires the use of precious-metal cocatalysts (e.g., Pt) and sacrificial electron donor/acceptors to facilitate multielectron/multiproton transfers to overcome the high kinetic barriers. The use of Pt and sacrificial agents is not consistent with the notion of low-cost and sustainable hydrogen production from water. CN must overcome this dependence to stand out as a truly scalable photocatalyst. To make progress, the foremost requirement is to attain an in-depth understanding of the fundamental charge transport phenomena needed for the rational design of CN-based photocatalysts.In this Account, therefore, our aim is to provide a synopsis of current understanding and progress regarding charge-transport-related phenomena (e.g., recombination, trapping, transfer of charge carriers, etc.) and to discuss the effects of charge transport in enhancing the apparent quantum yield of hydrogen production in CN. This understanding is necessary to broaden the scope of CN for other catalytic applications, for example, efficient CO 2 reduction to methanol or methane, fixation of nitrogen to ammonia, and use as an active material in solar cells. We also identify research gaps and issues to be addressed for a more clear elucidation of charge-transport-related phenomena in CN. Thus, this Account may inspire new research opportunities for tuning the extrinsic/intrinsic photophysicochemical properties of CN by rational design to attain the most favorable properties for improved catalytic efficiency. © Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060010367

Calcium supersaturation and slag surface passivation are two aspects of the calcium extraction step that strongly influence the choice of operating conditions necessary for rapid and complete calcium leaching, which are investigated in the present work. To investigate these aspects, slag dissolution characteristics were studied in a closed high-pressure batch-reactor taking care to eliminate gas-liquid mass transport limitations. This experimental design has two distinct advantages: (1) rapid CO2 absorption necessary for dissolution under acidic conditions and to gain insights into calcium dissolution kinetics and (2) the closed system allowing measurement of the drop in reactor pressure, which along with elemental analysis of leachate is sufficient to determine the ionic species concentration and solution saturation state. The results provide evidence against surface passivation of residual slag by silica or calcium carbonate layers. Further, the experiments confirm high supersaturation with respect to calcite during the dissolution step, which we hypothesise to be a consequence of unfavourable calcite precipitation kinetics due to the low pH and high calcium to carbonate ion ratio. The results show scope for further enhancement in calcium solubility, up to the solubility limit of amorphous calcium carbonate, which can substantially reduce the water volume and CO2 pressure required for dissolution. Pressure-swing to atmospheric pressure led to spontaneous co-precipitation of rhombohedral calcite and amorphous silica, also a paper-filler with similar optical properties to PCC, with impurities less than 1.5 wt%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Batch reactors; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbonation; Dissolution; Extraction; Optical properties; Passivation; Silica; Slags; Solubility; Supersaturation; Amorphous calcium carbonate; Calcite precipitation kinetics; Dissolution kinetics; Mass transport limitation; Mineral carbonation; Operating condition; Precipitated calcium carbonate; Surface passivation; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058878081

We should be on alert for the negative impact that could be created by the terrorist threat and the forecast on climate change- with its cortège of cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons, storms, floods, heatwaves, droughts and fires, etc. France is all the more exposed to meteorological dangers, as its national territories are spread across several continents with different geo-climatic contexts. In order to anticipate the treatment of mass mental trauma caused by these wide-reaching events, the existing mechanisms for dealing with such cases must be improved and adapted. To that end, French hospitals’ emergency plans could potentially evolve by being supplemented with a psychological and psychiatric emergency plan, one which would constitute a mechanism in the future for the victims of exceptional, nonstandard events. This is the subject of this interview with Bluenn Quillerou, an emergency psychiatrist in Paris who specialises in emergency planning and liaison psychiatry. The deployment of an emergency plan could be conceived for each hospital structure where psychiatrists and psychologists are present. The proposal suggests that a manager should be appointed for each area, where their tasks would be: (1) making an inventory of every psychiatric hospital structure and their professionals who are trained to treat victims; (2) making an inventory of psychiatrists and psychologists who work outside of a hospital structure yet would be likely to be available for integration into a regional emergency plan; (3) keeping up and organising the network outside of periods of crisis; (4) taking care of training for any potential mental trauma support staff, organising continuous training; (5) coordinating with other emergency plans and guaranteeing cooperation should any crisis arise. This emergency planning could be taken to a larger geographical level, and plans could be put into place which would bring all zonal and regional emergency psychological and psychiatric plans under the same umbrella. This zonal or regional organisation could be supervised on a national scale. © 2018","Action plan; Attack; Disaster; Liaison psychiatry; Post-traumatic syndrome; Psychiatric emergencies; Trauma; Victim","Article; climate change; electric potential; health care planning; human; liaison psychiatry; mental hospital; psychiatric emergency; psychiatrist; psychologist; psychotrauma; terrorism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055973248

In this paper, the neutral wind observations from the Thermosphere Ionosphere and Mesosphere Electric Dynamics Doppler Imager experiment, the kinetic temperature observations from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument, and the total electron content (TEC) maps from globally distributed Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers during 2003–2017 are utilized to statistically study the Q6DW in both the neutral atmosphere and the ionosphere. Our statistical results show that (1) the Q6DW is most likely to occur during May and September, exhibiting a quasi-semiannual oscillation. (2) The periods of the Q6DW show two statistical crests at ~6 and ~7 days separately. (3) The ionospheric oscillations due to the Q6DW are positively related to both the 10.7-cm solar flux index and the neutral wave amplitudes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region. The stronger oscillations in TEC under higher solar activity conditions are due to the larger ionization rate and thus larger background TEC. A stronger Q6DW results in stronger wind dynamos in the E region, which leads to stronger F region responses indirectly.

At EU level and at the level of the member states, political support for biofuels has been motivated by expected contributions to the aims of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, security of energy supply, rural development and employment creation. However, the diffusion of mainly agricultural crop-based biofuels has been accompanied by a critical debate on a range of sustainability issues such as land use change impacts or impacts on resource competition. Moreover, biofuels’ costeffectiveness as a GHG mitigation option has been called into question. Between the two poles of high expectations and multi-faceted criticism, EU biofuel policy has proven a very dynamic policy field, with no small amount of policy uncertainty for market actors. Against the background of negotiations on a recast Renewable Energy Directive, this contribution discusses from an economic theory perspective whether there is a case for continuing a target which supports the use of biofuels and other low-carbon options in the transport sector; and if so, what lessons can be derived from EU biofuel policy so far for its design. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064369082

Nevertheless, considering the short term of political mandates and the instability of social-economic-legal variables in our changing world, urban planning practices will require more effective and rapid decision support systems to easily access and process information. The paper presents an optimised carbon accounting methodology to assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in specific urban environments and inform urban policies and design. In particular, this procedure, substantially inspired by the IPCC standard methodology for GHG emissions inventory of Nations, constitutes the framework of a “mediate model” with a dual role: to both assess the Carbon Footprint of urban neighbourhoods and to estimate the effects, in terms of Carbon Footprint mitigation, of action plans addressed to carbon neutrality. For demonstration, the carbon accounting framework has been performed based on average European values. The procedure started by profiling the typical household as functional unit, whose carbon footprint has been estimated 6.93 t CO2-eq/yr, referring to energy use for housing and mobility, domestic waste treatment and water use. The impact of the average European neighbourhood has been obtained by scaling up to 10,000 households (23,000 inhabitants) as benchmark for future applications. An additional outcome concerns the innovative spatial visualisation of results in terms of equivalent forestland (e.g. the emission of one average European household corresponds to the quantity of CO2 yearly absorbed by 0.51 ha of forest), that allows for understanding intensity and size of impacts in order to consistently support awareness raising initiatives targeting citizens and stakeholders and communication-dissemination activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint offset; Decision support system; Energy saving; Renewable energy; Sustainable mobility; Waste management","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decarbonization; Decision support systems; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Urban planning; Waste management; Waste treatment; Water treatment; Carbon accounting; Carbon neutralities; Climate change mitigation; Future applications; Process information; Renewable energies; Sustainable mobility; Urban environments; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055198641

The construction industry is a major consumer of energy in the world, so it is justified to aim at reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency and maximizing the use of waste energy and renewable energy. In the case of residential buildings, one use the most energy for heating of water for utility purposes and for central heating purposes. Not large multi-family residential buildings are characterized by similar parameters of energy needs as single-family buildings, which results primarily from the nature of use. The main difference between single and multi-family buildings is the area per capita. Smaller area reduces energy consumption for room. On the other hand, the higher demand for hot water follow the larger number of inhabitants. As a primary source of heat in urban areas, there are currently used solid fuel boilers, gas boilers or using system heat. Owing to the smog phenomenon, old coal boilers are being modernized to reduce pollutant emissions into the atmosphere. In this publication, the example of hot water installation in a multi-family building shows what effects will be achieved if we use alternative sources such as solar collectors or heat pumps for traditional gas water heating systems. For each of the two variants, the approximate investment outlays and costs associated with the operation of the system in the variant were estimated and the estimated annual emissions from the incineration of natural gas. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution; Boilers; Construction industry; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fuels; Gas emissions; Housing; Investments; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Water; Water treatment; Alternative energy source; Environmental considerations; Industrial development; Pollutant emission; Reducing energy consumption; Renewable energies; Residential building; Solid fuel boilers; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062535448

The brine acidity is expected to induce chemical reactions with the mineral phase of the host reservoir. A set of continuous radial CO2 flow experiments was performed on cylindrical carbonate rock samples under geological storage conditions. The objective was to interpret the dissolution network morphology and orientation involved. To explore the three-dimensional architecture of dissolution arrays and their connection integrity within core samples, we used computed tomography. A structural investigation at different scales revealed the impact of the rock heterogeneity on the dissolution pathways. The initial strike of the observed mesoscopic wormholes appears to be parallel to dilatational fractures, with a subsequent change in major trends of dissolution along master shears or, more specifically, a combination of synthetic shears and secondary synthetic shears. Antithetic shears organize themselves as slickolitic surfaces, which may be fluid-flow barriers due to different mineralogy, thus affecting the permeability distribution-wormhole growth geometry induced by CO2-rich solutions. © 2019 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Artificial karstification pattern; CO2-rich aqueous solution; Dissolution array; Morphology of wormhole; Radial injection; Regional strike-slip zone; Riedel shears; X-ray computed tomography",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060368908

By overturning decisions of local councils, the UK government has allowed companies to obtain licences to explore fracking sites, arguing that gas is a bridge fuel and preserves energy security. Critics note fracking’s relationship to earthquakes, water pollution, greenhouse gases, and argue that it delays sustainable energy solutions. The UK Trades Union Congress has passed a resolution for a moratorium on fracking, but there is tension within the ranks of labour. Activists from major unions play a critical role alongside communities in protesting against the development of the industry. They call for disinvestment, lobby the Labour Party, and work with members and the public to promote their message. Yet occupational positionality influences the trade unions’ position on energy: those representing energy workers tend to support fracking. This chapter discusses the role of non-state actors such as trade unions that organise to mitigate climate change, highlighting the importance of creating space for dialogue around conflicting ideas and building solidarity at the grassroots level. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff, Quentin Gausset and Simon Lex; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084894470

Deficiency and/or compromised vitamin status can result in a diversity of syndromes. Currently 13 vitamins are identified and commonly categorized as «fat-soluble» and «water-soluble» vitamins. Vitamins are not endogenously synthesized in humans to meet normal physiological needs. Therefore reference requirements are developed for individuals and populations to minimize risk of nutrient deficiency or excess in order to achieve optimal health and prevent disease. There are various factors and challenges for individuals and populations when meeting reference dietary requirements for vitamins. These include food availability, food choice, ethnicity, religion, age, season, climate, disposable income, food policies, public health strategies, and many other factors. These factors vary between different countries, populations, and communities.

However, phenological responses have been shown to differ greatly between species, with some species shifting phenology more than others. We analysed a database of 42,689 tundra plant phenological observations to show that warmer temperatures are leading to a contraction of community-level flowering seasons in tundra ecosystems due to a greater advancement in the flowering times of late-flowering species than early-flowering species. Shorter flowering seasons with a changing climate have the potential to alter trophic interactions in tundra ecosystems. Interestingly, these findings differ from those of warmer ecosystems, where early-flowering species have been found to be more sensitive to temperature change, suggesting that community-level phenological responses to warming can vary greatly between biomes. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; flower; growth, development and aging; plant development; season; temperature; tundra; Climate Change; Flowers; Plant Development; Seasons; Temperature; Tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058178081

It traces the City’s target for community-wide carbon neutrality from its 2003 strategy for Zero Net Emissions by 2020 (ZNE2020) to its 2018 Climate Change Mitigation Strategy 2020 to 2050. The City’s overriding political commitment to realise net zero emissions across the municipal territory has remained consistent throughout this period. However, the policy narratives, timeframes, geographies, technologies, and scales framing this objective have changed substantially, shifting most notably from a preference for carbon offsets towards investing in renewable energy. The analysis applies the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries to explore how emissions sources and sinks are known and organised through the City’s successive climate mitigation strategies. These efforts towards an urban green transition reshape conceptual boundaries around the urban environment and reconfigure relationships within and beyond the city in varied ways. Charting these phases against a backdrop of shifting circumstances - political, technological, and environmental - unveils persistent tensions between local government ambition and authority to act and between conceptions of the net zero emissions city as locally discrete and globally networked. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff, Quentin Gausset and Simon Lex; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084892972

Study of the film structure, using transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, showed a mixture of carbon atoms with sp2- and sp3-bonds. Structure of carbon film is determined by the presence of randomly oriented carbon clusters bound by diamond sp3-bonds (tetrahedral amorphous carbon, ta-C). Electron diffraction patterns demonstrate strongly distorted interfacial distances. Raman spectra show that there are carbon atoms with graphite sp2-bonds in the film, but a signal of graphite crystal lattice is absent in electron diffraction: This implies that hexagonal units are not shaped into a graphite crystal lattice. Broad D-band in Raman spectra shows strongly distorted carbon bonds in graphite. If diamond phase dominates, the space between diamond clusters is filled with carbon atoms with sp2-bonds (turbostratic structure).

The synthesized catalyst consisting of rhodium (Rh) supported on an octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) of different loadings, such as 0.5, 1, and 1.5% w/w, was studied, and 1% (w/w) loading gave the best results. This 1% w/w Rh/OMS-2 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the hydrogenolysis reaction because of better dispersion of rhodium, later revealed by characterization. Furthermore, 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst was well characterized in virgin and reused states using various techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), CO2-TPD, temperature-programmed reduction, H2 pulse chemisorption, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry analysis. The catalyst showed a higher surface area of 72 m2/g and the average size of the highly dispersed Rh metal of ∼2 nm. The studies were performed in a batch reactor; the catalyst offered almost 100% conversion of FFA with 87% selectivity to 1,2-PeD at 160 °C and 30 atm hydrogen pressure in 8 h. The reaction mechanism and kinetic model have been developed using a dual-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson mechanism. The activation energies were 12.3 and 27.6 kcal/mol, correspondingly.

Although the increasing suburbanization of warehouses is seen as a relevant land use trend, comprehensive analyses of their impact remain scarce. This study uses real data in modeling transport, costs, environmental and modal effects from warehouse relocations around Oslo and Trondheim (Norway). Results indicate that for Oslo, traffic performance (ton-km), CO2-emissions, and transport costs increase following warehouse suburbanization. For Trondheim, transport performance and CO2-emissions increase less, while transport costs decrease marginally. We conclude that specific case characteristics (geography and trade patterns) are important in determining the strength and direction of effects, and expect that common concomitant developments (warehouse centralization and consolidation) would lead to more pronounced results. Our findings confirm some, but challenge other, findings from the relatively scarcely literature available.

The catalytic activity for N2O decomposition in the absence or in the presence of NO and for N2O reduction with CH4 in the absence of O2 (CRN2O), or in the presence of O2 (SCRN2O) was investigated. The catalytic measurements were performed in a flow apparatus with GC analysis of reactants and products. On Fe-MOR, in situ FTIR and UV–vis characterization evidenced coordinatively unsaturated sites (c.u.s.) Fe2+ arising from two families of Fe3+ dimers with different reducibility. Characterization and catalytic results combined with operando FTIR experiments gave an insight into the transition metal ion (tmi) species working during N2O abatement and into the reaction pathways. For N2O decomposition the activity order was Co-MOR &gt; Fe-MOR in the absence of NO and Fe-MOR ≥ Co-MOR in the presence of NO, whereas Ni-MOR was always inactive. The decomposition occurred via redox mechanism passing through the formation of activated surface oxygen species, Oads*. The quasi-oxidic character of this activated oxygen in the Fe3+-O(1+δ)−—Fe(2+δ)+ intermediates with respect to the oxyl character of that in Co3+O‒ intermediates accounted for the lower activity and for the activity enhancement by NO addition to the feed of Fe-MOR with respect to Co-MOR. In Ni-MOR, both isolated or dimeric Ni2+ species were unable to be oxidized by N2O yielding Oads*. For N2O reduction, (CRN2O) and (SCRN2O), the activity order was Fe-MOR &gt; Ni-MOR &gt; Co-MOR. On all catalysts operando FTIR experiments revealed CHxOy intermediates (methoxy, formaldehyde and two types of formate species). The investigation of surface species changing the addition order of the reactants evidenced that the formation of CHxOy intermediates was favored on Co-MOR by pre-saturation with N2O, that yielded Co3+O− able to activate CH4, whereas on Ni-MOR by pre-saturation with CH4, that reduced Ni2+ dimers to Ni+ dimers, able to activate N2O. On Fe-MOR, the Fe2+ dimers formed during activation behaved as Co2+, whereas the Fe2+ dimers formed by reduction with CH4 behaved as Ni+ dimers. The formation and the stability of Oads* surface species were key factors for N2O decomposition and reduction pathways. These factors were affected by the mobility of the tmi electrons, that depends on the oxidation state, nuclearity and location in MOR framework of tmi. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Methane; MOR; N2O decomposition; N2O reduction; Operando FTIR","Catalyst activity; Dimers; Ion exchange; Metal ions; Metal working; Methane; Nickel compounds; Oxygen; Reduction; Transition metals; Activated oxygens; Activated surfaces; Activity enhancement; Co-ordinatively unsaturated; Ion-exchange methods; N2O decomposition; N2O reduction; Operando FTIR; Iron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052648671

The uptake of small grains has been very low among smallholder farmers in climate change affected districts in Zimbabwe in spite of expert advice. The paper seeks to interrogate this “refusal” by smallholder farmers to adapt through small grains. Data were collected using fifty (50) in-depth semi-structured interviews and five (5) key informant interviews in Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe to understand why smallholder farmers are not shifting to small grains production en masse in response to climate change to address food insecurity gaps. The paper finds that there are a plethora of reasons leading to the non-adoption of small grains as a climate change adaptation strategy. The explanations vary. The paper thematically provided a critical overview and analysis of the attitude of smallholder farmers on small grains cultivation. The literature systematically selected, provided a wide coverage of the small grains production value chain. The narratives of farmers through interviews reveal their lived experiences and attitudes on small grains. This paper provides a new understanding of why small grains programming has not been successful in Zimbabwe over the years. The paper recommends that the government takes practical steps to enhance the uptake of small grains production through assisting farmers by training and funding projects of such nature for resilience building. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Empirical growth and yield modelling methods derived from terrestrial forestry, which are often robust with respect to forestry forecasting and management, have not often been assessed in mangrove forests yet they are important for underpinning sustainable forest management. We surveyed 89 Rhizophora apiculata mangrove plantations with age ranges from 4 to 26 year old in Vietnam, destructively harvesting 25 trees for biomass measurements and 70 for stem analyses, to assess increments in biomass and standing timber. Systems of equations were developed to model site index, mean diameter, dominant height, stocking, biomass and timber volume. We found that conventional forest growth modelling methods fitted the observed data well. Similar to terrestrial forests, stand height is a good indicator of site productivity. Mean errors for stand volume and biomass estimated from yield tables were both less than 5.3%. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the biomass model was 12 and RMSE of the volume model was 10.8, suggesting that these methods are applicable to evenly aged monoculture mangrove plantations in Vietnam. Our research also indicated high variation in mean annual increment of biomass (MAI) in the surveyed plantations due to a wide range of age and site conditions. Some R. apiculata plantations in Vietnam can reach a peak aboveground biomass MAI of 22.7 Mg ha−1 year−1, which is among the highest of published values from plantations of the same species worldwide. Further studies addressing the application of terrestrial forest growth methods to mangrove systems are suggested in order to develop reliable and useful tools for sustainable management of this important ecosystem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Growth and yield modelling; Mangrove; Rhizophora apiculata plantation","Biomass; Climate change; Ecosystems; Mean square error; Surveys; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Growth and yield; Mangrove; Mean annual increments; Rhizophora apiculata plantation; Root mean square errors; Sustainable forest management; Sustainable management; Forestry; aboveground biomass; adaptive management; bioaccumulation; carbon sequestration; climate change; error analysis; forest ecosystem; forest resource; forestry modeling; mangrove; mitigation; plantation; sustainability; Biomass; Ecosystems; Forestry; Mangrove; Surveys; Sustainable Forest Management; Viet Nam; Rhizophora apiculata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054026090

The main aim of this research is to investigate the changes of mangrove forest associations in tropical regions and possible reasons of changes via the case study of the Can Gio biosphere reserve in Viet Nam by using remote sensing datasets (SPOT 4 and 5 imagery), object-based image analysis and Support Vector Machine classifier. The classification results showed that the highest overall accuracy of this combination was 81.6%, given 420 reference objects, confirming the applicability of using remote sensing on assessing the development of mangrove forests. For the case study, we found that there was a decrease of the Avicennia alba – Sonneratia alba (Association I) area by 20.1% caused by the development of aquaculture and other human activities, but there was an increase of the Rhizophora apiculata (Association II) area by 34.8%. These trends may result in the exacerbated risk of soil erosion and make the region become more vulnerable to climate change and tropical storm events.

This is because a key model input–namely the valuation of centennial climate damage–is highly unknowable for fundamental reasons discussed here. Problems with damage valuation are highlighted by the implicit implausibility to climate scientists of a leading model's (centennial) damage function, and by strong criticisms of damage functions by many climate economists. The claim that statistical analyses of past weather impacts on local economies, combined with structural modeling of sectoral impacts, can significantly improve centennial damage valuation rests on untestable, far-out-of-sample extrapolation. Testing centennial climate (natural) science projections is generally harder than testing predictions in astronomy, geology and other earth sciences, because of Earth's uniqueness, and the unprecedented degree of likely climate change; but stable underlying laws make climate modeling based on past observations meaningful. By contrast, the added complexity of human behavior means there are no quantitatively stable laws for modeling the value of centennial climate damage. I suggest that any carbon prices used to inform climate policies, be they carbon prices used as policy instruments, or complementary, non-carbon-price policies, should instead be based on marginal abatement costs, found by modeling low-cost pathways to socially agreed, physical climate targets. A pathway approach to estimating carbon prices poses challenges to many economists, and is no panacea, but it avoids any illusion of optimality, and facilitates detailed analysis of sectoral policies.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to assess changes in species suitability under environmental shifts, but whether they can portray population and community responses is largely undetermined, especially in relation to extreme events. Here we studied a shrubland community in SE Spain because this region constitutes an ecotone between the Mediterranean biome and subtropical arid areas, and it has recently suffered its driest hydrological year on record. We used four different modeling algorithms (Mahalanobis distance, GAM, BRT, and MAXENT) to estimate species’ climatic suitability before (1950–2000) and during the extreme drought. For each SDM, we related species’ climatic suitability with their remaining green canopy as a proxy for species resistance to drought. We consistently found a positive correlation between remaining green canopy and species’ climatic suitability before the event. This relationship supports the hypothesis of a higher vulnerability of populations living closer to their species’ limits of aridity tolerance. Contrastingly, climatic suitability during the drought did not correlate with remaining green canopy, likely because the exceptional episode led to almost zero suitability values. Overall, our approach highlights climatic niche modeling as a robust approach to standardizing and comparing the behavior of different co-occurring species facing strong climatic fluctuations. Although many processes contribute to resistance to climatic extremes, the results confirm the relevance of populations’ position in the species’ climatic niche for explaining sensitivity to climate change. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","climatic suitability; dieback; drought resistance; extreme climatic events; niche; SDMs","algorithm; arid region; aridity; climate change; coexistence; community response; dieback; drought resistance; drought stress; ecological modeling; environmental change; extreme event; Mediterranean environment; niche; plant community; shrubland; subtropical region; vulnerability; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045950310

Sustainable Land-Use Planning (LUP) is the activity of allocating resources and uses to specific sites and areas, with different purposes that depend on the decision maker. Examples of these include maximizing crop yields or the profits of landowners and minimizing environmental impacts such as water consumption or greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. Several environmental drivers and stressors can be considered in LUP, but one of the goals of environmental conservation is undoubtedly the reduction of carbon emissions. Considering the rapid growth of cities, which centralize resources, population, and consumers and thereby contribute to climate change, sustainable LUP planning of integrated urban and rural ecosystem can be the key to addressing such environmental and social issues. This chapter builds on the well-known LUP problem by investigating the relationship between transportation of people, i.e., mobility, and of food resources within a closed urban-rural ecosystem, and by determining how this affects the overall carbon emissions. The proposed LUP approach is based on a model that integrates agricultural properties such as soil features and crop yields, with the renewable energy potential of the area and the urban needs of accessibility and density. The discussed mix integer linear programming (MILP) model is implemented into a planning-support tool aimed at studying the optimal allocation of land uses in an urban-rural ecosystem with the goal of minimizing the carbon emissions. The model takes into account a closed ecosystem where agriculture, energy production, and residential areas satisfy different internal demands and needs. Some results obtained by the application of this tool are illustrated and discussed, showing the potential of the proposed approach in supporting the planning of low-carbon urban-rural ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To effectively manage these environmental impacts, spatially explicit information accounting for the differences in growing conditions and production practices across the production landscape is essential, allowing for high impact intensity corn to be identified and prioritized for improvement. To support these sustainability efforts, this study examines the spatially explicit life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of US county corn production, providing the most comprehensive assessment to date. Methods: A streamlined spatial life cycle assessment is conducted, focusing on the three key hotspots of corn production for spatial differentiation at the county scale across the contiguous USA, accounting for almost 60% of total average cradle-to-farm gate impacts. Variations in nitrogen fertilization types and rates, N 2 O emission rates, and irrigation emission rates are specifically revealed. Spatially distinguished hotspot inputs and related emissions are combined with static national average emission estimates from all other inputs used in corn production to gain a full picture and understand the relative contributions to total cradle-to gate impacts. Results and discussion: Results show significant variation across corn producing counties, states, and regions. High impact priority locations are highlighted and key contributors of impact for each location are illuminated, providing critical information on the spatially explicit levers to reduce impacts. Results increase the generalizability of emission estimates using expected yields to characterize emission intensity, enabling more practical integration into company supply chain sustainability assessments to align with the time horizons in which decisions are made. Conclusions: Streamlined life cycle assessment methods are an effective way to characterize spatial heterogeneity around key contributors of impact, helping deliver the necessary information for companies, stakeholders, and policy makers to target their influence to reduce these emissions through various engagement efforts. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Corn production; Green supply chain management (GSCM); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Spatial; Streamlined LCA","nitrogen; Article; carbon footprint; crop production; environmental factor; environmental sustainability; fertilization; fertilizer application; geography; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); life cycle assessment; maize; methodology; nonhuman; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052595289

To gain acceptance for larger-scale creation of wetlands, total values must be identified and revealed. Provisioning and regulating ecosystem services can be described as the quantitative effect, but cultural ecosystem services require other assessments. This study sought to determine whether peri-urban and urban wetland areas contribute to the well-being and quality of life of nearby residents, and to capture their value relative to two other types of green areas (i.e., parks and urban forests). A postal questionnaire survey, based on validated environmental psychology instruments, was distributed to residents in three municipalities with wetland areas of different structures and locations. In these municipalities, respondents (n = 474; response rate = 40%) reported that the wetland area contributed to several quality-of-life aspects, such as encountering nature and experiencing beauty. The areas also facilitated activities that support well-being, were perceived to have high restorative qualities, and evoked positive affective responses. All wetland areas were rated high on most of the measured concepts, but their value relative to other green areas differed possibly depending on the accessibility of the wetland and the availability of other green areas. The location and extent to which the wetland area was integrated in the residential area determined what quality-of-life aspects were most satisfied. Wetland areas can be ascribed cultural ecosystem service values based on how residents perceive their contribution to their quality of life. These values can be added to those of provisioning and regulating ecosystem services, forming the basis for planning urban environments. © 2018 The Authors","Created wetlands; Cultural ecosystem services; Environmental perception; Environmental psychology; Quality of life; Urban planning","Climate change; Flood control; Surveys; Urban planning; Wetlands; Created wetlands; Ecosystem services; Environmental perceptions; Environmental psychology; Quality of life; Ecosystems; culture; ecosystem service; perception; psychology; quality of life; urban planning; urban population; wetland; adult; article; city planning; controlled study; environmental psychology; esthetics; female; forest; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; perception; quality of life; questionnaire; resident; residential area; wellbeing; wetland; city; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; Cities; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Quality of Life; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050739044

Each particle can stay in one of two states: Excited state or ground state. Any particle at ground state is excited with a constant rate (pumping). The number of excited particles decreases by means of photon emission through interactions of the particles. We analyse the rare event of flashes, i.e., the emission of a very large number of photons B during a fixed time interval T . We employ the theory of large deviations to provide the asymptotics of the probability of such event when the total number of particles N tends to infinity. This theory gives us also the optimal trajectory of scaled process corresponding to this event. The stationary regime of this process we call the large emission regime. In several cases we prove that in the large emission regime a share of excited particles in a system is stable under the changes of the pumping and emission rates. © 2019 Independent University of Moscow.","Continuous-time Markov processes; Hamiltonian; Hamiltonian system; Infinitesimal generator; Large deviations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063409086

First, hydraulic and spray visualization tests have been performed, showing a potential advantage of such nozzle design in fuel–air mixing efficiency. Then, combustion performance has been assessed on a GM-designed 1.6-L four-cylinder engine. The engine has been installed on a dynamometric test bench and instrumented with an AVL cylinder pressure transducer for heat release rate analysis, as well as HORIBA MEXA gas analyzer for exhaust emissions and AVL 415 Smoke Meter. Engine efficiency and emissions have been analyzed on four different part-load steady-state points, representative of New European Driving Cycle and Worldwide harmonized Light duty Test Cycle certification cycles, and covering engine speeds from 1250 to 2000 r/min and brake mean effective pressure between 0.2 and 1.4 MPa. Results of indicated analysis show that counter-bore nozzles have significant differences in terms of pilot injection combustion at low load points, which in turn lead to a better ignition and shorter combustion of the main injection. In addition, an improvement of diffusive combustion is observed as load increases. Because of both, fuel consumption is reduced by approximately 1% with respect to a standard nozzle. Finally, an appreciable decrease in engine exhaust emissions has been recorded, especially in terms of particulate matter and hydrocarbon emissions. This reduction has been linked to the improvement of fuel–air mixing promoted by the counter-bore nozzle previously observed. © IMechE 2018.","combustion; Counter-bore; emissions; hydraulic; spray","Combustion; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Fuels; Gas emissions; Hydraulics; Ignition; Mixing; Nozzle design; Particulate emissions; Smoke; Spray nozzles; Spraying; Brake mean effective pressures; Combustion performance; Combustion pro-cess; Four cylinder engine; Heat release rate analysis; Hydrocarbon emission; Light-duty diesel engines; New european driving cycles; Engine cylinders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060143785

We compiled 2054 measurements of planted and natural individual tree and shrub biomass from across different regions of Australia (arid shrublands to tropical rainforests) to develop allometric models for prediction of BGB. We found that the relationship between BGB and stem diameter was generic, with a simple power-law model having a BGB prediction efficiency of 72–93% for four broad plant functional types: (i) shrubs and Acacia trees, (ii) multi-stemmed mallee eucalypts, (iii) other trees of relatively high wood density, and; (iv) a species of relatively low wood density, Pinus radiata D. Don. There was little improvement in accuracy of model prediction by including variables (e.g. climatic characteristics, stand age or management) in addition to stem diameter alone. We further assessed the generality of the plant functional type models across 11 contrasting stands where data from whole-plot excavation of BGB were available. The efficiency of model prediction of stand-based BGB was 93%, with a mean absolute prediction error of only 6.5%, and with no improvements in validation results when species-specific models were applied. Given the high prediction performance of the generalised models, we suggest that additional costs associated with the development of new species-specific models for estimating BGB are only warranted when gains in accuracy of stand-based predictions are justifiable, such as for a high-biomass stand comprising only one or two dominant species. However, generic models based on plant functional type should not be applied where stands are dominated by species that are unusual in their morphology and unlikely to conform to the generalised plant functional group models. © 2018","Acacia; Carbon; Eucalyptus; Multi-stemmed; Plant functional types; Roots; Shrubs; Stem diameter","Biology; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Efficiency; Forecasting; Hardwoods; Acacia; Eucalyptus; Multi-stemmed; Plant functional type; Roots; Shrubs; Stem diameter; Forestry; accuracy assessment; belowground biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem function; evergreen tree; functional role; mitigation; prediction; root system; shrub; stem; Biology; Biomass; Carbon; Efficiency; Forecasts; Hardwoods; Australia; Acacia; Eucalyptus; Pinus radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053400452

We examined these interactions by studying the ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities of pinyon pine seedlings (Pinus edulis) planted in a wildland ecosystem experiencing two decades of climate change-related drought. We established a common garden containing P. edulis seedlings of known maternal lineages (drought tolerant, DT; drought intolerant, DI), manipulated soil moisture and measured EMF community structure and seedling growth. Three findings emerged: EMF community composition differed at the phylum level between DT and DI seedlings, and diversity was two-fold greater in DT than in DI seedlings. EMF communities of DT seedlings did not shift with water treatment and were dominated by an ascomycete, Geopora sp. By contrast, DI seedlings shifted to basidiomycete dominance with increased moisture, demonstrating a lineage by environment interaction. DT seedlings grew larger than DI seedlings in high (28%) and low (50%) watering treatments. These results show that inherited plant traits strongly influence microbial communities, interacting with drought to affect seedling performance. These interactions and their potential feedback effects may influence the success of trees, such as P. edulis, in future climates. © 2018 The Authors.

Coal-fired power plants can either be (1) replaced by higher efficiency coal plants or (2) natural gas plants while units are not yet at the end of their lifetime and can be (3) retrofitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or (4) retrofitted to cofire coal and biomass coupled with CCS (BECCS) thereby achieving negative emissions. Our results show that if the 2°C emissions mitigation target should be achieved, the cost-optimal way of doing so is through an early implementation of BECCS. This strategy also helps to address the US Administrations’ concern for coal workers: there is a more gradual phaseout of coal, which allows to retain 40,000 jobs that would be loss due to the fleet retirement for aging. In addition, 22,000 new workers would be permanently employed in the coal sector by the end of midcentury, especially in areas where the deployments of BECCS would start already by 2030. Our modeling results indicate the Great Lakes area and the southeast United States as the greatest winners of this negative emissions strategy.

Besides India, the United States, the European Union, Canada, Japan, and China have already established or planned heavy-duty vehicle efficiency regulations addressing CO2 and NOX emissions. In addition, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea are all in various stages of developing policies to improve the efficiency of their commercial vehicle fleets. For CO2 emissions reduction standards, the U.S. mandates 27% reduction by 2027, EU is calling for 15% reduction by 2025, China for 27% by 2019 over 2012 levels, and India is mandating 10%-15% reduction by 2021 for phase 2 of the new standard. There has also been considerable focus on further reduction in NOX emissions from current levels (0.2 g/hp-hr), to the proposed ultra-low NOx standards (0.02 g/hp-hr) in the U.S. for heavy duty engines by 2024. Given these planned and proposed regulatory standards being implemented around the globe, there have been substantial studies and publications focusing on exploring and evaluating technologies that can help deliver the lower tailpipe NOx targets and understand the CO2 impact associated with it. Majority of the NOX emissions from engine, occur during the cold-start portion of the transient regulatory cycles, like HD FTP and WHTC. This is because, a typical heavy-duty diesel aftertreatment system does not achieve substantial NOX reduction until approximately 400-500 seconds into the cold-start cycle due to lack of heat from the engine. The result is untreated NOx escaping through to tailpipe. To achieve low NOx emission levels over the composite transient cycles, the engine must provide rapid exhaust heat energy, during the cold-start portion, to reduce the time required by the SCR catalyst to reach catalyst light-off temperature, while controlling the NOX emissions. Moreover, high NOX conversion efficiency must be maintained during the hot-start portion of cycle. For a conventional heavy-duty engine, providing rapid exhaust heat while controlling NOx emissions has been a challenge, because these are competing demands. Implementing secondary or auxiliary heat sources downstream in the exhaust after treatment system (ATS) comes at CO2 penalty and adds significant cost and complexity. This has been established in recent publications by organization like SwRI [1], CARB and Bosch [2]. Achates Power Opposed Piston (OP) engine technology provides ideal solution to this challenge. The opposed-piston engine has several inherent advantages over conventional four-stroke engines, like higher BTE (15-30% higher), higher power density, an air-system that results in reduced pumping work, the ability to control residual combustion gases, two fuel injectors per cylinder providing greater timing flexibility, and the ability to provide rapid engine out heat and temperature rise for the exhaust emission system while maintaining low engine out NOX. This paper demonstrates results from cold and hot start transient WHTC testing and WHSC testing, conducted at Achates Power, on a three-cylinder opposed-piston engine. Results show that the Achates Power OP Engine can deliver engine out heat and temperature rise that exceeded and sustained catalyst light-off temperature thresholds (250°C) within the first 60-100 seconds in the cold start cycle, while controlling engine out NOx to lower levels when compared to a conventional four-stroke heavy-duty diesel engine. As a result, the OP Engine not only meets current BS-VI and future regulatory emissions requirements but is also able to do so with a significant CO2 emissions advantage. Furthermore, the inherent advantages of the OP Engine offer unique aftertreatment optimization and downsizing opportunities thereby enabling cost reduction. © 2019 SAE International.

By comparing the current situation with a future hypothetical scenario (100% AVs penetration), this study highlights the positive effect, in terms of noise pollution, of the adoption of AVs on a real road network (city of Rome). For this scope, a traffic simulation-based approach was used to investigate the effects of AVs on the network congestion. Results show that the full AVs penetration scenario leads to an improvement in the network performances in terms of travel time and average network speed. Moreover, the amount of Vehicle Kilometre Travelled (VKT) shows an 8% increase on longer extra-urban routes, due to the higher capacity impact of AVs on highways, with a consequent load reduction for intra-urban shortcutting routes. These results are also reflected in terms of noise emission. In fact, the central area would benefit from lower noise emission, whereas an increase in traffic volume and speed lead to worsened conditions for some specific highway links of the network. Overall, it was shown that a 100% AVs fleet would have a beneficial effect for the noise pollution, leading to a general reduction of noise emissions, which is more pronounced for intra-urban roads. © 2019 S.

Focusing on long-term outcomes projected in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report and the World Bank's “Turn Down the Heat” reports, this paper examines processes of discourse structuration and institutionalization to identify the dominant discourses which frame climate action. We trace the dominant discourses identified in the scientific reports – Survivalism, Ecological Modernisation and Economic Rationalism – through the Paris Agreement and selected Leader Statements and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions from COP21. From the 24 states included in this analysis, Papua New Guinea (PNG) is developed as a case study to investigate the hybridity and institutionalization of discourses. Even though PNG's rhetoric and commitments at COP21 express Survivalism, the state's policy frameworks rarely move beyond solutions found in Economic Rationalism and Ecological Modernisation. This suggests that states strategically adopt hybrid discourses drawn from climate science in line with their positionality, political economy and interests. Understanding how discourses drawn from climate science manifest in national policies has significant implications not only for how science is communicated at the international level but also for understanding different state positions in the global climate governance regime. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate science; Discourse analysis; Papua New Guinea","climate change; ecological modernization; environmental policy; global climate; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; political economy; strategic approach; World Bank; Papua New Guinea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057377422

While many states have joined together in the Paris Agreements in support of green energy policies, it remains a stark reality that most of the efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions remain with private actors who operate the various industries, vehicles, and vessels that emit the gases in target. The risks of anthropogenic climate change cannot be solved by environmental law alone and will need complementary support from commercial, corporate, and private law. However, aspects of commercial law, securities law, and trade law can be shown to frustrate certain aspects of green energy policies, resulting in damaging ""green paradoxes"".

It looks at methodology, outlining definitions, concepts, and approaches to climate impact assessment in general. The chapter illustrates some techniques that are available for conducting impact analyses, drawing mainly from examples of studies conducted in agriculture. In an assessment of die impact of climatic variation on economies and societies, it is useful to make two broad distinctions: between approximate and proximate causes and between contingently necessary and contingently sufficient conditions. Government interest in climate impacts is largely a short-term concern. Many different types of models can be used to estimate biophysical sensitivity to climate.

The energy sector is also a large consumer of water, making water efficiency targets ingrained in SDG6 important constraints for long-term energy planning. Here, we apply a global integrated assessment model to quantify the cost and characteristics of infrastructure pathways balancing SDG6 targets for water access, scarcity, treatment and efficiency with long-term energy transformations limiting climate warming to 1.5 °C. Under a mid-range human development scenario, we find that approximately 1 trillion USD2010 per year is required to close water infrastructure gaps and operate water systems consistent with achieving SDG6 goals by 2030. Adding a 1.5 °C climate policy constraint increases these costs by up to 8%. In the reverse direction, when the SDG6 targets are added on top of the 1.5 °C policy constraint, the cost to transform and operate energy systems increases 2%-9% relative to a baseline 1.5 °C scenario that does not achieve the SDG6 targets by 2030. Cost increases in the SDG6 pathways are due to expanded use of energy-intensive water treatment and costs associated with water conservation measures in power generation, municipal, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Combined global spending (capital and operational expenditures) to 2030 on water, energy and land systems increases 92%-125% in the integrated SDG6-1.5 °C scenarios relative to a baseline 'no policy' scenario. Evaluation of the multi-sectoral policies underscores the importance of water conservation and integrated water-energy planning for avoiding costs from interacting water, energy and climate goals. © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper examines the relative costs of carbon mitigation from a life cycle perspective for 12 different hydrogen production techniques using fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewable sources by technology substitution. Production costs and life cycle emissions are parameterized and re-estimated from currently available assessments to produce robust ranges to describe uncertainties for each technology. Hydrogen production routes are then compared using a combination of metrics, levelized cost of carbon mitigation and the proportional decarbonization benchmarked against steam methane reforming, to provide a clearer picture of the relative merits of various hydrogen production pathways, the limitations of technologies and the research challenges that need to be addressed for cost-effective decarbonization pathways. The results show that there is a trade-off between the cost of mitigation and the proportion of decarbonization achieved. The most cost-effective methods of decarbonization still utilize fossil feedstocks due to their low cost of extraction and processing, but only offer moderate decarbonisation levels due to previous underestimations of supply chain emissions contributions. Methane pyrolysis may be the most cost-effective short-term abatement solution, but its emissions reduction performance is heavily dependent on managing supply chain emissions whilst cost effectiveness is governed by the price of solid carbon. Renewable electrolytic routes offer significantly higher emissions reductions, but production routes are more complex than those that utilise naturally-occurring energy-dense fuels and hydrogen costs are high at modest renewable energy capacity factors. Nuclear routes are highly cost-effective mitigation options, but could suffer from regionally varied perceptions of safety and concerns regarding proliferation and the available data lacks depth and transparency. Better-performing fossil-based hydrogen production technologies with lower decarbonization fractions will be required to minimise the total cost of decarbonization but may not be commensurate with ambitious climate targets. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon footprint; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Life cycle; Methane; Steam reforming; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Cost-effective methods; Hydrogen production technology; Life cycle emissions; Life cycle perspectives; Production techniques; Renewable energy capacity; Supply chain emissions; Technology substitution; Hydrogen production; benchmarking; carbon dioxide; cost; emission; fossil fuel; hydrogen; parameterization; production cost; pyrolysis; renewable resource; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060270040

Recently, several cities have enacted laws mandating owners of large buildings to publicly display an energy efficiency rating for their properties. While such transparency is necessary for market-driven energy reduction policies, the reliance on public-facing energy efficiency grades raises non-trivial questions about the robustness and reliability of methods used to measure and benchmark the energy performance of existing buildings. In this paper, we develop a building energy performance grading methodology using machine learning and city-specific energy use and building data. Leveraging the growing availability of data from city energy disclosure ordinances, we develop the GREEN grading system: a framework to facilitate more accurate, fair, and contextualized building energy benchmarks that account for variations in the expected and actual performance of individual buildings. When applied to approximately 7500 residential properties in New York City, our approach accounts for the differential impact of design, occupancy, use, and systems on energy performance, out-performing existing state-of-the-art methods. Our model and findings reinforce the need for more robust, localized approaches to building energy performance grading that can serve as the basis for data-driven urban energy efficiency and carbon reeduction policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy performance; City-specific energy benchmarking; Energy disclosure data; Energy efficiency labeling; Machine learning; XGBoost","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Buildings; Carbon; Climate change; Energy utilization; Grading; Learning systems; Structural design; Building energy performance; Energy disclosure data; Energy efficiency labeling; Specific energy; XGBoost; Energy efficiency; anthropogenic effect; benchmarking; building; carbon emission; climate change; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; federal system; machine learning; performance assessment; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055020089

For example, ammonia, amines, and nitrogen oxides are involved in aerosol formation and have significant environmental implications, including regional haze pollution, acid deposition, and eutrophication. In addition, nitrate and ammonium are major compounds of atmospheric particulate matter, contributing approximately one-third of PM2.5. Although the concentration of amines in the atmosphere is probably two or three orders of magnitude lower than that of ammonia, amines can significantly assist the growth of both neutral and ionic clusters. The goal of this chapter is to exhibit the role of Nr in haze pollution and the importance of Nr mitigation measures. This chapter first introduces the mechanisms of haze formation related to atmospheric Nr and then discusses the contribution of Nr to PM2.5 pollution across China. Ultimately, the effects of Nr mitigation on PM2.5 pollution are evaluated, and possible measures that could be taken in the future are provided. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085421491

In this chapter we will discuss the most recent available data for ACs performed with local anesthesia in comparison with craniotomies under general anesthesia (GA). Originally, ACs were used for epilepsy surgery, but it is now being used in the neuro-oncology field for glioma resection. As with every surgical technique, advantages and disadvantages coexist. Therefore it is imperative to select the most beneficial technique for each patient. Recent evidence suggests that glioma patients tend to benefit from awake procedures. This is due to the surgeon’s ability to perform more accurate cortical and subcortical stimulation, obtain a higher extent of resection, achieve better overall postoperative outcomes, achieve lower rates of postoperative complications which directly impact the patient’s quality of life (QoL), provide a shorter hospital stay, and lower overall health-care costs. However, during awake procedures, breathing rate cannot be controlled, making it difficult to have a controlled CO2 to reduce brain swelling. Awake procedures may also have a big impact on the psyche of the patient, and some of them are not able to tolerate the procedure. In these cases, GA is advantageous, and this technique is still widely used around the globe. Deep sedation is a good alternative for failed procedures, as well as for interventions in which patient positioning does not allow for an awake procedure. Even though GA has its benefits, in the right patient, craniotomies with local anesthesia tend to be more advantageous and provide a better postoperative outcome with a better QoL for the patient. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As a robust response to the vulnerability of food supply chains, it is essential to find ways of linking the concepts of sustainable development, climate change adaptation and risk governance into one paradigm. The risk governance of food supply chains is conducted by and across both private and public spheres. Hence, in this chapter, we introduce a dual system of governance to match the objectives of climate change adaptation, and discuss the multiplicity and potential integration of both corporate-led private governance and public governance based on the authority of governments and their institutions. The aim of this chapter is to highlight climate change adaptation in relation to the practices of risk governance of the food supply chains within a multilevel framework of private and public policies. It explores the outlook of climate change adaptation in food supply chains, probing the extent to which governance should be framed as an intergovernmental issue, a national/local issue, an upstream supply chain issue or a downstream supply chain issue. The study is carried out by delving into the international adaptation literature with focus on different levels of framing the food supply chain and its adaptation to climate. We conclude that it is important to marry the efficiency of food businesses with the attainment of wider societal objectives such as sustainable development, climate change adaptation and food security, in order to increase resilience of the overall food system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Climate change adaptation; Food supply chain; Multilevel governance; Resilience; Sustainable development; Vulnerability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078645755

One approach is to proxy willingness to pay by measuring either the added cost to society from increased air pollution, or equivalently the reduced costs associated with air quality improvement."" A second technique infers willing-ness to pay for better air quality from an analysis of the housing market, on the presumption that individuals will pay more for a unit located in an area with good air quality than for an otherwise identical unit located in an area with poor air quality.This paper investigates the methodological problems associated with the housing market approach. While several studies have used this methodology to estimate the demand for air quality improvements, they have paid little attention to the sensitivity of the resultsto the assumptions embedded in the procedures. Using data for the Boston housing market, we generate quantitative estimates of the willingness to pay for air quality improvements and test the sensitivity of these results to alternative specifications of the basic building blocks in the procedure. Our data base is superior to others because it contains a large number of neighborhood variables (necessary to isolate the independent influence of air pollution) and more reliable air pollution data. © Joseph Herriges and Catherine L.

Conservation-compliance initiatives require producers to meet specific conservation standards to qualify for payments from farm programs. However, these requirements do not require actual improvements in observed water quality. In this study, we introduce policies to reduce nonpoint source pollution that link eligibility for agricultural subsidies to compliance with water quality goals. We then use economic laboratory experiments to provide empirical evidence related to the performance of these policies. In the policy treatments, participants risk losing some or all of their subsidies if the ambient pollution level exceeds an announced target. A novel feature of our experiment is that we test a policy treatment that ensures that no subsidies are lost if a producer implements a verifiable conservation technology that reduces emissions. In these experiments, policies that link the receipt of subsidies to ambient water quality nearly achieve the socially optimal level of pollution. The results suggest that water quality policies that rely on the threat of subsidy reductions are a potentially viable option for reducing aggregate water pollution. Although a policy that allows polluters to avoid potential losses by implementing a verifiable conservation technology could increase political support for ambient-based policies, our results suggest that, depending upon the magnitudes of social damages from emissions and the cost of implementing a conservation technology, such policies may be less cost-effective for a comparable reduction in pollution. © The Author(s) 2018.

These indicators are aggregated by using their respective weights, which are derived through Principal Component Analysis. Further, farmers’ preferences are estimated by using the stated preference method. The results of this assessment reveal that the technologies highly preferred by the farmers are not necessarily the ones with high CSFI value but are those that save inputs even at the cost of productivity. This may be due to poor access to agricultural machinery, and the dominance of rainfed agriculture. But farmers are otherwise interested in replacing their traditional cultivation practices with climate-smart practices. The study brings out the gap between scientific knowledge about smart agriculture technologies, and the farmers’ preferences, which would be useful in investment decisions by policy makers. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Principal component analysis; Priority setting; Stated preference method",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085438850

Use of traditional methods contributes to global anthropogenic climate change, and has been attributed to at least 4 million premature deaths every year. In addition, increasing population in middle-and low-income countries pushes the demand for firewood to unsustainable harvest rates leading to deforestation. To address such challenges, many international organizations have worked to provide improved cookstoves for these communities. This study applies surveys incorporating research methods from social sciences focusing on the role of users to evaluate the impacts of these technologies in the field, as well as to understand what motivates consumers to change their traditional practices. By conducting surveys before and two months after dissemination of 390 improved cookstoves in Copan Ruinas, Honduras, this research evaluated the impact of the improved cookstoves for the users and their evaluations of the presented technology. Results suggest that approximately 85% of the households used the improved cookstove as their primary stove. The top three reasons for households to continue using the stove were reported as reductions in smoke emissions, firewood consumption, and time to cook food. For 80% of the households, the level of effort required to cook with the improved cookstove was reported as significantly less than traditional stove. Future work should include sensor-based monitoring and long-Term follow up to verify findings and examine impact over time. © 2018 IEEE.","Behavior assessment; design for development; improved cookstoves; technology adoption","Climate change; Cooking; Deforestation; Smoke; Social sciences computing; Surveys; Anthropogenic climate changes; Behavior assessment; Household energy demands; improved cookstoves; International organizations; Long-term follow-up; Low income countries; Technology adoption; Stoves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061775576

Prioritisation has been a feature of schemes in terms of focussing funding on individual species, habitats or regions. For the 2014–2020 Agri-Environment and Climate Scheme Scotland decided on an alternative prioritisation method; for a number (11) of management options funding was made available for areas (10 km × 10 km grid squares) with more than a threshold of priority species present (a subset of species on the Scottish Biodiversity List likely to benefit from the management options). This approach (Simple targeting) takes no account of the different abundances of the priority species or the possibility that rare species’ distributions are not nested within the more common ones. Three alternative methods were used to assess if that targeting could be made more efficient in its coverage of species’ ranges. Rarity Weighted targeting took into account range sizes of different priority species, Uniqueness targeting focussed on maximising the beta-diversity of targeted grid squares, and Marxan targeting used a reserve selection algorithm to solve the minimum set reserve design problem. Assessment was in terms of how well each method covered the range of the priority species, both on average and on minimum representation of each species on the priority list. Rarity Weighted targeting improved the mean representation of species’ ranges across all 11 options, whereas Marxan targeting performed best of the four methods in ensuring a high minimum representation of species. Uniqueness targeting was uniformly poor. These patterns were conserved whatever the threshold of species richness used in the Simple targeting. If funding for agri-environment options is to be targeted to areas where more species can benefit, then the current Simple targeting approach employed in Scotland can be improved upon in its efficiency at channelling funding to where the priority species are found. However, a strategic choice has to be made as to whether maximising the mean coverage of priority species is the most important objective of the targeting process or whether ensuring high minimum coverage of the species is more important; ensuring that rarer species with ranges poorly nested within those of rarer species are well represented in the targeted areas. © 2019 The Authors","Agri-Environment and Climate Scheme; Priority species; Scottish Rural Development Programme; Spatial prioritisation; Spatial targeting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062280253

I then use a commodity chains framework to (1) reveal how program managers in Scolel’te sought to protect the program in the face of such risk by using their relative positions of power to govern how carbon credit producing farmers operated and (2) illustrate the implications of this market risk and the decisions of program managers for farmers participating in the program. I find that the governance decisions made by program managers in the face of market risk led to a series of unintended outcomes that included the dissolution of the social relations of production between program managers and carbon credit–producing farmers as well as the social relations within participating communities. As a result, farmers began to leave the program, abandoning their agroforestry plantings and limiting the full realization of the program’s positive environmental and social outcomes in the region. © 2018, © 2018 by American Association of Geographers.","carbon market; carbono forestal; commodity chain; Mexico; risk","climate change; ecosystem service; emissions trading; environmental economics; local participation; poverty alleviation; risk; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059041175

On the one hand is the belief that nuclear is a green technology when viewed from the energy production and/or climate perspective. On the other hand is the argument that nuclear is not an acceptable green energy due to challenges around waste management and disposal. In this context, the Africa–European Union Energy Partnership (AEEP) took the form of a non-nuclear, low-carbon energy approach. Being one of the eight region-to-region connections established in 2007 under the Joint Africa–European Union Strategy (JAES) and, certainly, the most active, the AEEP sought to promote energy access and security across Europe and Africa focusing mainly on renewable energies. But the question remains: how impactful is the AEEP in addressing energy poverty in Africa, in particular when nuclear is side-lined? Further to this, the AEEP is still struggling to meet its 2020 energy targets, while the financial resources needed to achieve the targets are still incomplete with less than three years to the agreed dateline. Using data from secondary sources and ‘constructivism’ as its theoretical framework, this paper contextualises the potential role of nuclear in the AEEP, especially in the context of the political dynamics in Europe and Africa. © 2018, © 2018 South African Association of Political Studies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049553114

Moreover, the C isotope record seemingly precludes a dramatic increase in O2-liberating burial of organic C in the late Archean. However, organic C burial is not the only way in which the biosphere may oxidize the Earth's atmosphere. Biologically mediated burial of reduced mineral phases may also yield net oxidation. For example, reducing power can be transferred from organic matter to H2S via anaerobic respiration and ultimately stored in sedimentary pyrite (FeS2). Changes in pyrite burial may thus impact Earth's oxidation trajectory. Here, we revisit the earliest recognized episode of sulfide-rich (euxinic), pyrite-precipitating conditions in Earth's ocean, ∼200–300 million years prior to the GOE, as preserved in the ∼2.7–2.6 billion-year-old (Ga) Roy Hill Shale of the Jeerinah Formation. Applying Fe speciation and trace metal proxies to drillcore samples from two sites, we characterize both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the accumulation of H2S in the otherwise Fe-rich Hamersley Basin. We argue that extensive pyrite burial in these locally euxinic environments was the consequence of enhanced volcanic emanations of SO2 to the atmosphere rather than oxidative weathering of crustal sulfides. Because SO2 reduction and burial as pyrite is chemically analogous to CO2 reduction and burial as organic matter, we further posit that this alternative oxidation pathway contributed to Earth's protracted oxygenation during the GOE. Our results thus highlight the need for continued study of the interplay between solid-Earth, volcanic, and biological processes and their joint modulation of oceanic and atmospheric composition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","euxinia; Great Oxidation Event; oxygenic photosynthesis; pyrite; subaerial volcanism","Atmospheric composition; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Oxygenation; Photosynthesis; Sulfur compounds; Trace elements; Volcanoes; Anaerobic respiration; Biological process; Euxinia; Great Oxidation Event; Oxidative weathering; Oxygenic photosynthesis; Spatial and temporal heterogeneity; subaerial volcanism; Pyrites; air-sea interaction; Archean; atmospheric chemistry; burial (geology); hydrogen sulfide; isotopic composition; organic matter; oxidation; oxygenation; photosynthesis; pyrite; speciation (chemistry)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056879360

The model was based on three intensively sampled stations during both periods, corresponding to early, peak, and decline phases of a Phaeocystis and diatom dominated bloom (May), and flagellates dominated post bloom stages (August). The food web carbon flows were driven by primary production (290-2,850 mg C m-2 d-1), which was channeled through a network of planktonic compartments, and ultimately respired (180-1200 mg C m2 d-1), settled out of the euphotic zone as organic particles (145-530 mg C m-2 d-1), or accumulated in the water column in various organic pools. The accumulation of dissolved organic carbon was intense (1070 mg C m-2 d-1) during the early bloom stage, slowed down during the bloom peak (400 mg C m-2 d-1), and remained low during the rest of the season. The heterotrophic bacteria responded swiftly to the massive release of new DOC by high but decreasing carbon assimilation rates (from 534 to 330 mg C m-2 d-1) in May. The net bacterial production was low during the early and peak bloom (26-31 mg C m-2 d-1) but increased in the late and post bloom phases ( &gt; 50 mg C m-2 d-1). The heterotrophic nanoflagellates did not respond predictably to the different bloom phases, with relatively modest carbon uptake, 30-170 mg C m2 d-1. In contrast, microzooplankton increased food intake from 160 to 380 mg C m2 d-1 during the buildup and decline phases, and highly variable carbon intake 46-624 mg C m2 d-1, during post bloom phases. Mesozooplankton had an initially high but decreasing carbon uptake in May (220-48 mg C m-2 d-1), followed by highly variable carbon consumption during the post bloom stages (40-190 mg C m-2 d-1).

Although it is known that benthivorous fish can influence sediment and water column biogeochemistry, studies showing causal relationships are largely lacking. Here, we used a mesocosm approach with Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to unravel the effects of bioturbation on GHG and nutrient dynamics. We hypothesised that fish bioturbation decreases methane (CH4) emissions and increases carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by increased sediment oxygenation. Additionally, lower phosphorus (P) mobilisation was expected due to increased binding to ferric iron (Fe3+). We found that benthivorous fish increased water turbidity, and reduced CH4 diffusion to the atmosphere by 33%, and ebullition by 67%, probably because of sediment oxygenation. Simultaneously, however, CO2 emissions increased due to higher aerobic decomposition, leading to higher overall GHG emissions. In contrast to our hypothesis, we did not find indications of bioturbation affecting P mobilisation from the sediment, probably because P binding was already high in the control treatment as a result of high porewater Fe:P ratios. We conclude that bioturbation by fish has strong effects on GHG emissions as a result of higher overall decomposition rates offsetting reduced CH4 emissions. Depending on porewater Fe:P ratios, benthivorous fish may additionally reduce P mobilisation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","carbon dioxide; Cyprinus carpio; methane diffusion; methane ebullition; phosphorus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056793488

Yet, limited attention has been directed at investigating how individual differences in the subjective interpretation of extreme weather events as indications of climate change moderate the link between extreme weather experiences and climate change attitudes. This article contends that subjective attribution of extreme weather events to climate change is a necessary condition for extreme weather experiences to be translated into climate change mitigation responses, and that subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change is influenced by the psychological and social contexts in which individuals appraise their experiences with extreme weather. Using survey data gathered in the aftermath of severe flooding across the UK in winter 2013/2014, personal experience of this flooding event is shown to only directly predict perceived threat from climate change, and indirectly predict climate change mitigation responses, among individuals who subjectively attributed the floods to climate change. Additionally, subjective attribution of the floods to climate change is significantly predicted by pre-existing climate change belief, political affiliation and perceived normative cues. Attempts to harness extreme weather experiences as a route to engaging the public must be attentive to the heterogeneity of opinion on the attributability of extreme weather events to climate change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attribution; Climate change; Experience; Extreme weather; Risk perception","climate change; extreme event; flooding; heterogeneity; literature review; local participation; perception; psychology; public attitude; risk perception; weather; winter; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056861480

This article summarizes current market developments in the most important coal-producing and coal-consuming countries, resulting in a critical qualitative assessment of prospects for future coal exports. Colombia, as the world’s fourth largest exporter, is strongly affected by these global trends, with more than 90% of its production being exported. Market analysis finds Colombia in a strong competitive position, owing to its low production costs and high coal quality. Nevertheless, market trends and enhanced climate policies suggest a gloomy outlook for future exports. Increasing competition on the Atlantic as well as Pacific market will keep coal prices low and continue pressure on mining companies. Increasing numbers of filed bankruptcies and lay-offs might be just the beginning of a carbon bubble devaluing fossil fuel investments and leaving them stranded. Colombia largely supplies European and Mediterranean consumers but also delivers some quantities to the US Gulf Coast, and to Central and South America. Future coal demand in most of these countries will continue to decline in the next decades. Newly constructed power plants in emerging economies (India, China) are unlikely to compensate for this downturn owing to increasing domestic supply and decreasing demand. Therefore, maintaining or even increasing mining volumes in Colombia should be re-evaluated, taking into account new economic realities as well as local externalities. Ignoring these risks could lead to additional stranded investments, aggravating the local resource curse and hampering sustainable economic development. Key policy insights The climate policies of most of Colombia’s traditional trade partners target steam coal as the more emission-intensive fossil fuel, with many countries implementing or considering a coal phase-out. Coal exporters should re-evaluate their operations and new investments taking into account this new policy environment. To prevent a race to the bottom among coal producers that would favour weak regulation, climate policy makers should also consider the local social and external costs of coal mining, including on health and the local environment. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

These new geochemical datasets not only allow for an evaluation of carbon isotope covariance during one of the largest perturbations to the global carbon cycle over the past 550 Myr, but also constrain the cause of the excursion in carbonate δ 13 C values. The results support the hypothesis that a period of anoxia did not play a role in generating the positive carbonate δ 13 C values, but rather favour interpretations by previous workers that the proliferation of land plants destabilized the Carboniferous carbon cycle, setting the stage for a significant change in the carbonate δ 13 C values of contemporaneous marine carbonates. These results also demonstrate that one of the largest perturbations to the global carbon cycle did not produce synchronous variations in carbonate and organic δ 13 C values, emphasizing the importance of local depositional controls on carbon isotope covariance in the geological record in both modern and ancient environments. © 2018 The Authors.

While genetic predispositions play a role, environmental factors are a major contributor. Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture composed of metals, nitrates, sulfates and diverse adsorbed organic compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins. Exposure to atmospheric PM aggravates autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, among others. PAHs and dioxins are known aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. The AHR modulates T cell differentiation and directs the balance between effector and regulatory T cells in vitro and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of autoimmune disease. This study aims to identify pathways that contribute to autoimmune disease and their potential use as therapeutic targets to alleviate symptoms and the need for global immunosuppression. This study tests the hypothesis that atmospheric PM enhances effector T cell differentiation and aggravates autoimmune disease. Results: An atmospheric ambient urban dust PM sample, standard reference material (SRM)1649b, was tested for its effects on autoimmunity. SRM1649b PM enhanced Th17 differentiation in an AHR-dependent manner in vitro, however intranasal treatment of SRM1649b PM delayed onset of EAE and reduced cumulative and peak clinical scores. Chronic and acute intranasal exposure of SRM1649b PM delayed onset of EAE. Chronic intranasal exposure did not reduce severity of EAE while acute intranasal exposure significantly reduced severity of disease. Acute intranasal treatment of low dose SRM1649b PM had no effect on clinical score or day of onset in EAE. Delayed onset of EAE by intranasal SRM1649b PM was AHR-dependent in vivo. Oral gavage of SRM1649b PM, in the absence of AHR ligands in the diet, had no effect on day of disease onset or severity of EAE. Day 10 analysis of T cells in the CNS after intranasal treatment of SRM1649b PM showed a reduction of pathologic T cell subsets in vivo. Moreover, MOG-specific splenocytes require AHR to generate or maintain IL-10 producing cells and reduce IFNγ producing cells in vitro. Conclusions: These results identify the AHR pathway as a potential target for driving targeted immunosuppression in the CNS in the context of atmospheric PM-mediated autoimmune disease. The effects of SRM1649b PM on EAE are dependent on route of exposure, with intranasal treatment reducing severity of EAE and delaying disease onset while oral gavage has no effect. Intranasal SRM1649b PM reduces pathologic T cells in the CNS, specifically Th1 cells and Th1Th17 double positive cells, leading to reduced severity of EAE and AHR-dependent delayed disease onset. Additionally, SRM1649b PM treatment of antigen-specific T cells leads to AHR-dependent increase in percent IL-10 positive cells in vitro. These findings may shed light on the known increase of infection after exposure to atmospheric PM and serve as the first step in identifying components of the AHR pathway responsible for Th1-mediated immunosuppression in response to atmospheric PM exposure. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Autoimmune disease; Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; Particulate matter; T cell differentiation","interleukin 10; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cell; differentiation; dioxin; disease incidence; disease severity; experimental study; immune system; infectious disease; laboratory method; PAH; particulate matter; pathology; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; disease severity; dust; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; female; in vitro study; in vivo study; lymphocyte differentiation; male; mouse; nonhuman; particulate matter; spleen cell; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte subpopulation; air pollutant; animal; C57BL mouse; dust; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; particulate matter; Th17 cell; toxicity; Murinae; Air Pollutants; Animals; Dust; Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Particulate Matter; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Th17 Cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054448351

Few large-scale measurement studies have been conducted to confirm a baseline. This study used a vehicle-based gas monitoring system to measure fugitive and vented gas emissions across Lloydminster (heavy oil), Peace River (heavy oil/bitumen), and Medicine Hat (conventional gas) developments in Alberta, Canada. Four gases (CO2, CH4, H2S, C2H6), and isotopic δ13CCH4 were recorded in real-time at 1 Hz over a six-week field campaign. We sampled 1,299 well pads, containing 2,670 unique wells and facilities, in triplicate. Geochemical emission signatures of fossil fuel-sourced plumes were identified and attributed to nearby, upwind oil and gas well pads, and a point-source gaussian plume dispersion model was used to quantify emissions rates. Our analysis focused exclusively on well pads where emissions were detected &gt;50% of the time when sampled downwind. Emission occurrences and rates were highest in Lloydminster, where 40.8% of sampled well pads were estimated to be emitting methane-rich gas above our minimum detection limits (m = 9.73 m3d–1). Of the well pads we found to be persistently emitting in Lloydminster, an estimated 40.2% (95% CI: 32.2%–49.4%) emitted above the venting threshold in which emissions mitigation under federal regulations would be required. As a result of measured emissions being larger than those reported in government inventories, this study suggests government estimates of infrastructure affected by incoming regulations may be conservative.

The chemistry governing these species is strongly temperature sensitive, making heat losses critical for an accurate prediction. To account for the effects of heat loss in large eddy simulation (LES) using a precomputed reduced-order manifold approach, thermochemical states must be precomputed not only for adiabatic conditions but also over a range of reduced enthalpy states. However, there are a number of methods for producing reduced enthalpy states, which invoke different implicit assumptions. In this work, a set of a priori and a posteriori LES studies have been performed for turbulent premixed flames considering heat losses within a precomputed reduced-order manifold approach to determine the sensitivity to the method by which reduced enthalpy states are generated. Two general approaches are explored for generating these reduced enthalpy states and are compared in detail to assess any effects on turbulent flame structure and emissions. In the first approach, the enthalpy is reduced at the boundary of the one-dimensional (1D) premixed flame solution, resulting in a single enthalpy deficit for a single premixed flame solution. In the second approach, a variable heat loss source term is introduced into the 1D flame solutions by mimicking a real heat loss to reduce the post-flame enthalpy. The two approaches are compared in methane–air piloted turbulent premixed planar jet flames with different diluents that maintain a constant adiabatic flame temperature but experience different radiation heat losses. Both a priori and a posteriori results, as well as a chemical pathway analysis, indicate that the manner by which the heat loss is accounted for in the manifold is of secondary importance compared to other model uncertainties such as the chemical mechanism, except in situations where heat loss is unphysically fast compared to the flame time scale. A new theoretical framework to explain this insensitivity is also proposed, and its validity is briefly assessed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","large eddy simulation; nitrogen oxides; radiation; reduced-order manifolds; turbulent premixed flames","Adiabatic flame temperature; Air; Chemical analysis; Enthalpy; Fighter aircraft; Heat radiation; Large eddy simulation; Nitrogen oxides; Uncertainty analysis; Adiabatic conditions; Chemical pathway analysis; Reduced order; Temperature sensitive; Theoretical framework; Turbulent combustion; Turbulent flame structure; Turbulent premixed flame; Heat losses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048895422

This process is strongly linked to the Earth’s warm and cold periods, such as the ice ages. An increase in major atmospheric GHG levels results in a warmer planet and vice versa. Nevertheless, anthropic development since the industrial era has emitted GHG at an unprecedented rate, causing several alterations in the periodicity and intensity of climate cycles. in less than 150 years, Global sea level and land temperatures have risen by almost 0.2 m and 1°C, respectively in the last 150 years, and are rapidly approaching a state of no return where irreversible climate changes would occur. These impacts are supposed to affect all circulation cycles, causing more extreme climatic events, accelerating glacier melting and increasing sea levels. These changes are bound to cause major effects on biodiversity and would trigger migration processes among all living species because changes would happen faster than the times required by most species to adapt, and will generate new climates, allowing invasive species to colonize new territories. Human beings are expected to be one of the most affected species, since densely populated regions are most sensitive to these changes. In this chapter I aim to synthesize what anthropogenic climate change is and what makes it different from natural climate change, examining the causes that trigger it, the effects it could generate and the measures and policies that have been taken to try to reverse this phenomenon. Finally, I will present an overview of Chile as a special case of study. This country has an economic background with a historical development based on the exploitation of its natural resources, combined with a vast latitudinal extension, with presence of almost all world ecosystems and a high diversity of endemic biota. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Climate change; Ecosystems stress; Human adaptation; Natural adaptation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077829060

The Local Climate Zones scheme (LCZs) emerges as a system for characterising these measurements from the thermal perspective. The rapid embracing of the LCZs by researchers from many disciplines, altogether with its adoption for other purposes such as planning, has led to an inexistent or, at its best, flexible use of the source area definition. This practice might call into question the contextualisation of many measurements, highlighting the imperative need to shed light on the source area methods within the urban context. In this study, a systematic review is conducted to compile previous experiences in which the source area was applied in the built environment. Results obtained from the systematic search are summarized and presented according to three scales: the inertial sublayer, the roughness sublayer, and the urban canopy layer. These previous experiences are studied according to their methodological contribution to the source area definition, emphasizing those studies that have considered this concept altogether with the LCZ scheme. This review aims at promoting the knowledge about footprint methodologies and its correct application within the LCZs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Heat island; Local climate zones; Sensor footprint; Source area; Systematic review; Urban environment","Buildings; Heat island; Local climate; Sensor footprints; Source area; Systematic Review; Urban environments; Civil engineering; canopy; environmental conditions; heat island; literature review; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056813979

However, the interaction of the coal matrix with CO2 is closely related to the permeability of a coal reservoir, which is simultaneously influenced by various factors, e.g., the moisture, temperature, coal rank and effective stress. To investigate the impact mechanism and the contribution of each influencing factor for the reservoir permeability and provide helps for the implementation schemes during the geological CO2 sequestration, a series of corresponding permeability tests were conducted under different adsorption pressures (2–10 MPa), moisture states (dry and wet), temperatures (35–65 °C), coal ranks (Ro,max = 0.68%–3.33%), effective stresses (3–10 MPa). The results show that coal matrix swelling induced by CO2 adsorption narrows the cleat width and reduces the permeability of a coal reservoir, which phenomenon is more serious for supercritical CO2. Injecting CO2 into the wet coal causes a higher PALR than the dry coal, which can be owned to the synthesized influences of the CO2 adsorption swelling, moisture-induced swelling and water blocking effect. The temperature first reduces the permeability of CO2 bearing coal incipiently by the swelling strains (thermal swelling and CO2 adsorption swelling) and then alleviates the permeability loss due to the remarkable gas slippage effect. Although the medium rank coal possesses the highest PALR, its permeability is also larger than the low rank coal and the high rank coal after CO2 adsorption. A cyclic loading and unloading leads to an irreversible permeability loss of a coal, which is more obviously reflected on the CO2 bearing coals. The analysis of the permeability contribution ratio indicates that the coal rank, CO2 adsorption and effective stress variety are the main controlling factors for the reservoir permeability, followed by the moisture, and the influence of the temperature on the permeability drop is quite weak. In summary, taking into account the various influencing factors and optimizing the injection arrangement are conducive to the successful implementation of the geological CO2 sequestration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption swelling; CO2 geological sequestration; Effective stress; Influencing factors; Permeability loss","Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Geology; Moisture; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Unloading; Cyclic loading and unloading; Effective stress; Geological sequestration; Implementation scheme; Influencing factors; Main controlling factors; Permeability loss; Reservoir permeability; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057284542

Notwithstanding the recent developments in powertrain technologies, driving behavior is still an important attribute in lowering fuel consumption. Gear shifting strategy is a staple aspect of driving behavior that affects fuel consumption and engine emissions to a large extent in both manual and automated transmission systems. According to the definition of Optimum Operating Line (OOL), this article intends to illustrate that the closer the engine operating points to the OOL, the more efficient the driving. An optimal gear-shifting strategy is presented to minimize fuel consumption and number of gear shifts while maximizing drivability in the new European driving cycle (NEDC). In order to limit the engine operating region close to the OOL, a multi-objective grid search method is used to design the two square-root-like curves (two shifting thresholds), on both sides of the OOL, in the engine Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) map. The results show a 4% reduction in fuel consumption and a 6% increase in the driving performance when using the square-root-like shifting boundaries compared with using RPM-constant shifting boundaries. © 2019 SAE International.

While existing studies of the subject offer an understanding of how TMNs operate across scales, sectors, and actors, we have a limited understanding of the governance tools provided by these networks. I propose a framework that enables a systematic analysis of the governance tools provided by TMNs based on traditional soft and hard distinctions of governance. Through an empirical in-depth study of a particular TMN, 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), I show that we need to broaden our understanding of the governance mechanisms used in transnational city governance. I suggest that key governance tools offered by 100 Resilient Cities are developed from the top-down and framed by the 100RC’s central organisation.

Under pressure of an every-increasing population and related demand for water and land for cultivation and other uses of river basins, Africa's water resources are under high stress. Climate change-related impacts further aggravate this situation, manifesting in reduced rainfall, and more frequent occurrence of extreme events, including frequent droughts. As often, under such precarious conditions, overexploitation of resources has been the response of both authorities and communities to such changing environments. The two case studies presented in this chapter, the Senegal River in Senegal and the Pangani River in Tanzania, are examples of the many river systems in Africa that have been heavily affected by both human interventions, such as dams and large-scale irrigation schemes, as well as climate change. The negative implications of such interventions, in particular on the vulnerable estuarine environments and their dependent population, are often not well conceived from the onset. Based on the two case studies, this chapter reflects in particular on the interventions taken by Government, as well as the adaptive responses by communities confronted with changes in the river system. The chapter will argue in this regard, that it is only through an integrated system-wide approach that appropriate strategies can be developed to secure the long-term ecological future of Africa's river systems. © 2019 Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, residue concentrations, profiles, emission factors, and annual emissions of seven chlorobenzene compounds were investigated in fly ash and bottom ash samples of some industrial facilities including brick making plant, steel and zinc production plants, and industrial and municipal waste incinerators in northern Vietnam. Total concentrations of seven CBzs in the ash samples were generally decreased in the order: industrial waste incinerator &gt; municipal waste incinerator &gt; steel-making plant &gt; brick making plant. Emission pattern of CBzs varied considerably among different industrial plants, with 1,2- and 1,3-dichloro-, 1,2,3,4-tetrachloro-, and hexachlorobenzene as predominant compounds in the industrial waste incinerators and steel-making plants. Emission factors of CBzs estimated for the fly ash and bottom ash samples were in the range of 118–2020 and 5.3–22,600 μg ton −1 , respectively. Average annual emissions (AEs) of total seven CBzs estimated for fly ash and bottom ash in the investigated plants were in the range of 154–54,300 and 20,160–161,400 mg year −1 , respectively. The AEs of CBzs estimated for fly ash in the steel-making plant were higher than those in the waste incinerators. Meanwhile, CBz emissions for bottom ash were the highest in the steel-making plant, followed by the industrial and municipal waste incinerators.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach to data collection, the paper draws upon information collected from relevant literature and interviews with 18 key country resource personnel. Findings: Results revealed that most reviewed policies/programs/strategies do not mention “climate change” explicitly but propose some activities which indirectly address it. Interaction is fair within the government ministries but weak between these ministries and other institutions. Inadequate financial resources are being opined as the most important challenge stakeholders are (and would continue) facing as a result of adopting integrated approaches to climate change. Other challenges include inadequate coordination, insufficient sensitization and capacity building, ineffective implementation, inadequate compliance, lack of proper transparency and inadequate public participation. To redress the aforementioned constraints and challenges, the paper concludes by outlining a number of recommendations for policy design. Originality/value: The following recommendations were made: create a national technical committee to oversee and provide scientific guidance to the government on synergistic approaches; promote private sector investment and sponsorship on synergistic approaches; create local awareness, etc. It is important to underscore that minimal studies have been conducted to analyze multi-stakeholder perspectives on synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation in Cameroon. This study attempts to bridge this major gap. © 2019, Faith Ngum, Dieudonne Alemagi, Lalisa Duguma, Peter A.

Physics-based whole building energy simulation is widely used to access building energy performance, which requires large amount of information to specify values of input parameters and includes underlying assumptions. This study proposed an alternative model based on machine learning (ML) to predict cooling loads of buildings with few common parameters in the design phase. The ML models were developed and evaluated using a dataset of 243 buildings. Predicted cooling loads from these models were compared to those from the physics-based whole building energy simulation. The proposed model exhibits good agreement with the physics-based whole building energy simulation. The analytical results present that the ML models obtained the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.98–0.99, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.17–12.93% which shows the high agreement between observed and predicted values of cooling loads in building. Notably, the ensemble bagging artificial neural networks yielded the highest R of 0.99, the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 158.77 kW, the lowest MAE of 112.07 kW, and the lowest MAPE of 6.17% among all models in this study. This research contributes to (i) the state of the knowledge by examining various ML models that can predict cooling loads in the early building design stage; and (ii) the state of practice by providing an alternative tool in the design process through better understanding of relationships between building cooling loads and building characteristics for enhancing energy efficiency in buildings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cooling load; Data-driven model; Energy efficiency; Energy simulation; Machine learning","Air conditioning; Architectural design; Cooling; Emission control; Forecasting; Historic preservation; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Office buildings; Building energy performance; Building energy simulations; Cooling load; Data-driven model; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy efficient building; Energy simulation; Mean absolute percentage error; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055993278

Further, research on corporate transparency and financial disclosure has proliferated, notably in the extractives sector. Our work builds on these existing literatures, with a focus on shareholder resolutions on hydraulic fracturing (HF) in the United States. We analyze US HF-focused shareholder resolutions from 2010 to 2016 to evaluate filing strategies and outcomes. We argue that these resolutions provide space for a range of new actors to shape corporate governance—but their power is constrained. The constraints flow from the same political economy factors that enable shareholders to take collective action: the distance between individual investors and financial decisions; the structure of resolutions and managerial responses; and the complexity of investment vehicles and vote shares. We assess how shareholders respond strategically by altering the focus of resolution demands, liaising with external campaigns and networks, and engaging with government to enhance regulatory interventions. Our work reveals how the upstreaming of power in commodity chains intersects with the power of management boards and the challenges of financialization, with consequences for corporate and energy governance. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate governance; financialization; hydraulic fracturing; Shareholder resolutions; social movements; socially responsible investing (SRI)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055483186

Diverse multispecies shade tree canopies are increasingly replaced by monospecific shade, often dominated by non-native tree species. The loss of tree diversity and the nature of the dominating tree can have strong implications for ecosystem functions, for example, nutrient cycling ultimately reducing crop production. To understand direct and indirect impacts of shade trees on nutrient cycling and crop production, we studied coffee agroforestry systems in India along a gradient from native multispecies canopies to Grevillea robusta (Proteaceae) -dominated canopy cover. We identified 25 agroforests, across a broad rainfall and management gradient and assessed litter quantity and quality, decomposition, nutrient release, soil fertility and coffee nutrient limitations. Increasing G. robusta dominance affected nutrient cycling predominantly by; (a) changing of litter phenology, (b) reducing phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), boron (B) and zinc (Zn) inputs via litterfall, decelerated litter decomposition and immobilization of P and Zn due to low-quality litter, (c) reducing soil carbon (C) and micronutrients (especially sulphur (S), Mg and B). Coffee plants were deficient in several nutrients (nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), Mg and S in organic and B in conventional management). (d) Overall G. robusta-dominated agroforests were characterized by a reduction of P cycling due to low inputs, strong immobilization while decomposition and antagonistic effects on its release in litter mixtures with coffee. Synthesis and applications. The conversion of shade cover in coffee agroforestry systems from diverse tree canopies to canopies dominated by Grevillea robusta (Proteaceae) reduces the inputs and cycling of several micro- and macronutrients. Soil fertility is therefore expected to decline in Grevillea robusta-dominated systems, with likely impacts on coffee production. These negative effects might increase under the longer dry periods projected by regional climate change scenarios due to the pronounced litter phenology of Grevillea robusta. Maintaining diverse shade canopies can more effectively sustain micro- and macronutrients in a more seasonal climate. © 2018 The Authors.

Accurate estimation of forest biomass C is needed to provide information on C fluxes and balances in such systems. The objective of this study was to develop generalized biomass models using harvest data covering tropical semi-evergreen, tropical wet evergreen, sub-tropical broad leaved, and sub-tropical pine forest in North East India (NEI). Among the four biomass estimation models (BEMs) tested AGB est = 0.32(D 2 Hδ)0.75 × 1.34 and AGB est = 0.18D 2.16 × 1.32 were found to be the first and second best models for the different forest types in NEI. The study also revealed that four commonly used generic models developed by Chambers (2001), Brown (1989), Chave (2005) and Chave (2014) overestimated biomass stocks by 300-591 kg tree -1 , while our highest rated model overestimated biomass by 197 kg tree -1 . We believe the BEMs we developed will be useful for practitioners involved in remote sensing, biomass estimation and in projects on climate change mitigation, and payment for ecosystem services. We recommend future studies to address country scale estimation of forest biomass covering different forest types. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass estimation models; Forest ecosystems; Remote sensing; Winners curse","Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Remote sensing; Tropical engineering; Tropics; Accurate estimation; Biomass estimation; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem services; Forest degradation; Forest ecosystem; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Winners curse; Forestry; allometry; biomass; carbon balance; carbon cycle; carbon flux; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; estimation method; forest ecosystem; remote sensing; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystems; Remote Sensing; Tropical Engineering; Tropics; India; Pinus tropicalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061269361

Inherent minerals are reactive constituents that interact with organic contents during pyrolysis, significantly affecting the properties of the pyrolysis product. Despite their importance, their influence on biochar-carbon sequestration has been rarely studied. For this study four types of biomass were selected: barley grass, peanut hull, cow manure, and sewage sludge to investigate the influence of inherent minerals on carbon conversion during pyrolysis. Results showed removal of inherent minerals shifts the peak biomass conversion to a higher temperature (370 °C) compared to that of biomass with inherent minerals being present (330 °C). It also led to reduced emissions of low-molecular-weight organic compounds. Compared to pristine biomass, more carbon (3.5-30.1%) could be retained in biochar along pyrolysis after removing inherent minerals. And it showed increased resistance to chemical and thermal oxidation decomposition, indicating higher carbon stability and therefore carbon sequestration potential. Instrumental analysis showed removal of inherent minerals facilitated disappearance of oxygen-containing functional groups such as C=O, O=C-O, and C-O, while promoting C-C/C=C bonds, indicating higher aromatization of biochars. This study suggested that removing minerals prior to pyrolysis can be a promising approach for strengthening carbon-sequestration potential of biochar. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Biochar; Carbon retention; Chemical state of carbon; Inherent minerals; Oxidation resistance","Bioconversion; Biomass; Carbon; Chemical stability; Fertilizers; Oxidation resistance; Pyrolysis; Sewage sludge; Thermooxidation; Bio chars; Biomass conversion; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Chemical state; Instrumental analysis; Low-molecular-weight organic compounds; Oxygen-containing functional groups; Organic minerals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058637857

Best practices are often considered to provide answers to these challenges. At the national and international levels, it is usually taken for granted that the replication of best practice examples can lead to a policy change. However, this assumption lacks empirical evidence, as best practices feature sticky and place-bound characteristics. This limits their use for the diffusion of their content and the transition to a low-carbon society. This article critically investigates the main functions (enabling, lobbying, place-marketing, and replication) of best practices in the daily governance of climate change in municipalities. It draws on in-depth insights resulting from expert interviews, participatory observation, and documentary analysis of a set of German municipalities. Understanding the practicalities on the ground explains why the expectations about best practices and their actual effects differ significantly.

The accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is important for determining the optimal management strategy. Fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG PET) integrated with computed tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET/ CT) has emerged as a powerful imaging tool for detecting and evaluating various cancers, and it is used for staging, detecting local recurrence and distant metastasis, measuring therapeutic effects, and predicting prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Lately, FDG PET/CT-derived parameters, such as standardized uptake values (SUV), the metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), have been suggested as prognostic factors for various types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. However, there is no consensus regarding the best parameters for evaluating patient prognosis, operability, etc. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between operable and non-operable pancreatic cancer using FDG PET/CT-derived parameters, and to investigate whether volumetric parameters (TLG and the MTV) are superior to SUV-based parameters for predicting infiltration status/determining operability. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective study of the cases of 48 patients with clinically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who underwent FDG PET/CT imaging before treatment. In the operable group, the surgical specimens were subjected to histopathological examinations, and the cases were separated into those exhibiting less and greater infiltration. SUVmax, SUVpeak, the tumor background ratio (TBR), TLG, and the MTV were compared between these groups as well as between the operable and non-operable groups. Results Venous infiltration showed significant associations with several metabolic parameters (SUVmax, SUVpeak, and the TBR). However, it did not display any significant associations with volumetric parameters, such as TLG or the MTV. None of the FDG PET/CT-derived parameters exhibited significant associations with lymphatic or neural infiltration. Significant differences in volumetric parameters, such as the MTV and TLG, were detected between the operable and non-operable subgroups. Conclusions Metabolic 18 F-FDG PET/CT-derived parameters, such as SUVmax, SUVpeak, and the TBR, are useful for predicting venous infiltration status in patients with operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. © 2019 Myssayev et al.

The Italian National Energy Strategy 2017, in accordance with the long-term scenario of EU Energy Roadmap 2050, defined the actions to reduce GHG emissions and, in this context, the energy communities can play a strategic role. The Council of European Energy Regulators defines «local energy community» a cooperative / partnership / non-profit organization of final customers, which can involve different stakeholders, such as municipalities, local societies, public and private companies. The stakeholders work together in energy communities for: the production and distribution of energy generated from renewable sources, the optimization of energy demand and supply and the reduction of energy consumptions, GHG emissions and costs. The communities' objectives are to boost energy exchanges, to encourage the establishment of inter-company smart grids and to increase energy efficiency in participating companies. A choice for energy independence that guarantees the energy security with a low environment impact and affordable energy costs. Where energy communities are consolidated, there is a 20-30% savings on energy prices, and a self-production level of around 80% on energy needs.The challenge of this work is to present a future local energy community in Italy: a case study in the Pinerolo area of the Piedmont Region.

The reduction of energy-use in buildings could be one of the main drivers to improve the sustainability, livability and quality of urban environment, together with the production of energy from the available renewable sources. To achieve energy sustainability in the most critical high-density urban contexts, it is necessary to optimize: the energy consumptions compatibility of different users; the distribution of heat, for example through the district heating network; the use of all urban spaces, such as building envelopes and urban surfaces, to produce energy from the available renewable sources. The energy models at urban scale are a complex issue as they should be simplified to be applied on a vast territory. Indeed, detailed information are not given at territorial scale and short time of simulation are preferable; however, information should be detailed enough to describe properly the energy consumption of the whole urban environment from building to urban scale. Therefore, energy models should take into account also the urban morphology, people's behavior, social and economic conditions, local and national regulation, and the use of outdoor public spaces. The challenge of this work is to present three different energy-use models, to compare their characteristics and to find the best features of an «optimum» model to analyze and represent energy resources, future scenarios, energy efficiency solutions and best energy policies. The aim is to drive a smarter use of energy, matching it with the available and more efficient energy sources to help also public administrations in defining policies adapted to the real buildings heritage.

It is located in the plain area and is surrounded by the Alps and with a temperate climate.According to Sustainable Energy Action Plan of the Covenant of Majors initiative, Turin owns a public building stock of more than 8% of the entire city, with a significant impact on urban whole energy consumption of about 375,000 MWh/year at 2005. The City of Turin was therefore interested in managing its own energy consumptions and proposing a strategy to improve the energy performance of its building. In this context, the municipality was also interested in the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular with solar technologies for a reduction in GHG emissions.In this work, 71 public buildings owned by the City of Turin were cataloged and classified in 4 categories based on the type of use (48% are schools, 14% schools with swimming pool, 34% offices and 4% sports facilities). Energy consumptions with thermal and electrical energy-use data, were collected for three consecutive years. The analyzed public buildings consume an average of 74,803 MWh/year for space heating and 11,317 MWh/year of electricity and most of the public buildings are connected by natural gas and district heating network; this last is the largest in Italy and one of the largest in Europe.With the digital surface model (DSM) of the City of Turin, a 3D solar irradiation model was elaborated taking into account the monthly characteristics of solar irradiation and of atmosphere transparency in Turin. This model was used to calculate the availability of solar irradiation on the roofs of public buildings, the extent of free roof surfaces and then the potential of energy produced by the current and available solar technologies on the market.Finally, the energy performance of the most used solar technologies was evaluated with a cost/benefit analysis to evaluate future scenarios. A GIS-based project was also created to manage and to update the energy performances of public buildings. The results of this work showed that, for 31 buildings with a high intervention priority installing solar technologies there could be a reduction of 2-7% of space heating and of 5-15% of electricity consumptions.A more rational use of energy to manage energy demand and supply of the overall public buildings stock could be an effective strategy on targeted interventions that, combined with an efficient use of space, lead to take a virtuous path towards the sustainability of the urban environment. Then, the use of a GIS-based assessment is essential to compare the energy demand with the potential of energy produced by roof-integrated renewable energy technologies.

The CO2–brine interfacial tension (IFT) and the caprock wettability under reservoir temperature and pressure conditions are essential for storage capacity estimation. In this study, the CO2–brine (NaCl + KCl) IFTs were obtained by using the pendant drop method under 298–373 K temperature, 3–15 MPa pressure, and 1.0–4.9 mol·kg−1 salinity. A detailed analysis of the relationship of IFT with temperature, pressure, and salinity was conducted. In addition, an empirical equation was developed to estimate the CO2–brine IFTs in a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and salt molality. The contact angles (CAs) of brine on quartz, Berea Sandstone, and limestone surfaces in the presence of supercritical, liquid, and gaseous CO2 were measured by using the sessile drop method, and the wettability alteration of the rock surfaces in the presence of supercritical CO2 was systematically investigated. According to the results, the CO2–brine IFTs increased with salinity and temperature and decreased with pressure until reaching a plateau. For a CO2–mixed brine system, a linear relationship between the IFT increase (Δγ) and molality was observed. The CAs of the different rock samples varied with temperature and pressure. However, all the three rock samples became less water-wet when the CO2 phase state changed from subcritical to supercritical. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 saline aquifer storage; Contact angles; Drop shape analysis; Interfacial tension; Wettability","Aquifers; Contact angle; Drops; Lime; Potassium compounds; Reservoirs (water); Rocks; Sodium chloride; Storage (materials); Surface tension; Wetting; Drop shape analysis; Linear relationships; Reservoir temperatures; Saline aquifers; Storage capacity estimation; Sub- and super-critical; Temperature and pressures; Wettability alteration; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; limestone; aquifer; Article; contact angle; measurement; pressure; priority journal; rock; salinity; supercritical fluid; surface property; surface tension; temperature; wettability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053780296

One approach is to proxy willingness to pay by measuring either the added cost to society from increased air pollution, or equivalently the reduced costs associated with air quality improvement."" A second technique infers willing-ness to pay for better air quality from an analysis of the housing market, on the presumption that individuals will pay more for a unit located in an area with good air quality than for an otherwise identical unit located in an area with poor air quality.This paper investigates the methodological problems associated with the housing market approach. While several studies have used this methodology to estimate the demand for air quality improvements, they have paid little attention to the sensitivity of the resultsto the assumptions embedded in the procedures. Using data for the Boston housing market, we generate quantitative estimates of the willingness to pay for air quality improvements and test the sensitivity of these results to alternative specifications of the basic building blocks in the procedure. Our data base is superior to others because it contains a large number of neighborhood variables (necessary to isolate the independent influence of air pollution) and more reliable air pollution data. © Joseph Herriges and Catherine L.

Since the early 2010s however, policymakers in Australia, California, China, Japan and Korea have implemented carbon prices that regulate the consumption of carbon emissions, where points of compliance are further downstream, such as distributors or final consumers. This article identifies the pivot towards placing the point of compliance for carbon prices further downstream as an emerging international trend, describes the designs of different prices on carbon consumption around the world, and explains the various motivations of the policymakers implementing them. Findings reveal that policymakers tend to layer prices on carbon consumption on top of prices on carbon production in an effort to improve economic outcomes by addressing incomplete pass-through of the carbon price from producer to consumer, thereby facilitating more cost-effective abatement. Policymakers also use prices on carbon consumption to reduce emissions leakage or because large producers of carbon are not within their jurisdiction. The prevalence of prices on carbon consumption will likely increase as evidenced by proposals in China and Europe. Key policy insights The recent surge in the number of jurisdictions implementing prices on carbon consumption represents an emerging international trend. Policymakers use prices on carbon consumption in an effort to improve economic outcomes and capture environmental benefits. While this article offers insights that detail initial challenges and successes, whether these prices on carbon consumption actually achieve their intended goals is an academically rich topic that requires further research on individual policies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon consumption; carbon tax; cost of abatement; emissions leakage; emissions trading schemes","carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; leakage; policy making; pollution tax; trend analysis; Australia; California; China; Japan; Korea; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045084903

While significant effort has been devoted to the supply side and development of technology markets, our study questions the extent to which policy efforts have effectively and explicitly addressed behavioural factors affecting the adoption and the use of low-carbon energy technologies at the individual and household level. Building upon behavioural economics, we explore behavioural factors and the role of economic and noneconomic aspects affecting energy use and decarbonisation activities in the region. Overall, we argue that greater attention needs to be given to behavioural issues in policy design, implementation, and evaluation. At the same time, behavioural interventions are unlikely to be a panacea that can steer sustainable energy use by itself, and both price and nonprice interventions are required. We conclude that a more stringent, integrated behavioural and technological policymaking approach is needed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It includes cradle to gate value/supply chain-based life cycle analysis (LCA), a socio-economic analysis of small holder farmers in Para; and a discussion on how operational and supply chain management (SCM) methods can assist practical application of LCA results. The LCA consists of 4 stages: nursery; plantation management; harvesting and transport of fresh fruits; and, extraction of CPO. The analysis was based on direct data obtained between November 2014 and August 2015. The total carbon footprint (CFP) was 1.5 kgCO2eq /L CPO and the total energy footprint (EFP) was 5.1 MJ/L CPO. The life cycle based cost is US$ 0.7/L of CPO and the largest cost comes from harvesting and transport (45%). The study uncovered many sustainability hotspots. The carbon hotspots were: methane emissions from waste water at the Oil Extraction stage, and fertilizer use from the Plantation Management stage. Fertilizer use is a key hotspot in all 3 areas: carbon, energy and economic cost. Given the plantation is only 5 years old, high consumption of fertilizer is expected. However, reducing N-fertilizers will help lower all three footprints. A sensitivity analysis shows that if the direct N2O emission factor was doubled, the CFP value at plantation stage could go as high as 49%, and the total CFP value could increase by 18%. If fertilizers were produced using modern technology, the total CFP value could go down by 13%, while the value at the plantation would go down by 29%. For methane emissions, the use of modern technologies to capture biogas from waste water has potential to reduce emissions significantly. Biofuel use at the Extraction stage is a win–win outcome with regard to carbon emissions, energy use and economic cost. However, biofuel use causes significant local environmental pollution and human health risks such as dark smoke and particulate matter. The blue-water footprint was 6.8 per L of CPO. Reduction of water consumption by increasing water efficiency at the extraction mills is important, because water extraction by mills is a serious threat to the local river basin. As a fraction of the total number of employees in the entire system, the highest labour use (68%) is at the Plantation Management stage. The analysis of smallholder farmers raises questions about the popular justification of palm oil plantations as a provider of rural employer and argues that indicators like community welfare and income inequality must be evaluated, because the extent to which the industry will enhance sustainable development depend on the way they combine with local communities, directly and indirectly. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Brazil; Palm oil; Sustainable-development; Value-chain/life cycle analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056184380

The program completed 232 monthly core cruises, 40 sediment trap deployment cruises, and 40 microbiogeochemical process cruises. Upwelling along the southern Caribbean Sea occurs from approximately November to August. High biological productivity (320-628 g C m -2 y -1) leads to large vertical fluxes of particulate organic matter, but only approximately 9-10 g C m -2 y -1 fall to the bottom sediments (∼1-3% of primary production). A diverse community of heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic microorganisms, viruses, and protozoa thrives within the oxic-anoxic interface. A decrease in upwelling intensity from approximately 2003 to 2013 and the simultaneous overfishing of sardines in the region led to diminished phytoplankton bloom intensities, increased phytoplankton diversity, and increased zooplankton densities. The deepest waters of the Cariaco Basin exhibited long-term positive trends in temperature, salinity, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, phosphate, methane, and silica. Earthquakes and coastal flooding also resulted in the delivery of sediment to the seafloor.

Apart from increasing pressures of global climate change, deforestation, and shifts in land use pattern, air pollution is emerging as one of the major factors influencing ecosystem structure and function. Issues related to health, agricultural production, and economic losses due to air pollution in the tropical and subtropical regions are well known; however, information on air pollution-related effects on the tropical vegetation is limited. Therefore, based on the current literature, the status of air pollution and its effects on vegetation in the tropical and subtropical regions of the globe are explored in this chapter to understand the current scenario and to identify the knowledge gaps. Spatial and temporal variations were detected among different regions for particulate matter, its constituents, and gaseous pollutants including identification of the factors and sources influencing the air quality. Air pollution impacts were assessed based on changes in ecosystem structure and functions such as the patterns of biodiversity change, alteration in litterfall and decomposition, the response of leaf functional traits, and bioaccumulation in the community or individual plant species. Air pollution significantly influenced major ecological processes such as litterfall, decomposition, and plant diversity indirectly through changes in soil quality as well as through a direct effect on growth and physiol ogy of native plants. Plants respond to changes in air quality through alternation in growth and morphology, physiological plasticity, and modifying leaf functional traits. These responses are both species- and pollutant-specific, as not all species responded equally to air pollution. Bioaccumulation pattern also showed a distinct relationship between pollutant accumulation and species specificity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Air quality; Forest; Tree; Tropics; Urban; Vegetation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085431856

We investigated the impact of London's LEZ on air quality and children's respiratory health. Methods: We did a sequential annual cross-sectional study of 2164 children aged 8–9 years attending primary schools between 2009–10 and 2013–14 in central London, UK, following the introduction of London's LEZ in February, 2008. We examined the association between modelled pollutant exposures of nitrogen oxides (including nitrogen dioxide [NO 2 ]) and particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2·5 μm (PM 2·5 ) and less than 10 μm (PM 10 ) and lung function: postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 , primary outcome), forced vital capacity (FVC), and respiratory or allergic symptoms. We assigned annual exposures by each child's home and school address, as well as spatially resolved estimates for the 3 h (0600–0900 h), 24 h, and 7 days before each child's assessment, to isolate long-term from short-term effects. Findings: The percentage of children living at addresses exceeding the EU limit value for annual NO 2 (40 μg/m 3 ) fell from 99% (444/450) in 2009 to 34% (150/441) in 2013. Over this period, we identified a reduction in NO 2 at both roadside (median −1·35 μg/m 3 per year; 95% CI −2·09 to −0·61; p=0·0004) and background locations (−0·97; −1·56 to −0·38; p=0·0013), but not for PM 10 . The effect on PM 2·5 was equivocal. We found no association between postbronchodilator FEV 1 and annual residential pollutant attributions. By contrast, FVC was inversely correlated with annual NO 2 (−0·0023 L/μg per m 3 ; −0·0044 to −0·0002; p=0·033) and PM 10 (−0·0090 L/μg per m 3 ; −0·0175 to −0·0005; p=0·038). Interpretation: Within London's LEZ, a smaller lung volume in children was associated with higher annual air pollutant exposures. We found no evidence of a reduction in the proportion of children with small lungs over this period, despite small improvements in air quality in highly polluted urban areas during the implementation of London's LEZ. Interventions that deliver larger reductions in emissions might yield improvements in children's health.

To meet growing energy demands, solid waste is a great hope among the available renewable energy sources. Incineration dominates the waste-to-energy (WTE) market all over the world, and specifically in developed countries. After thermal processes, anaerobic digestion is the emerging technology in clean energy production. Incineration is one of the thermal processes with low environmental impact and reduces the waste volume to be dumped in landfills. For the evaluation of the environmental impact of WTE technology, life-cycle assessment helps to find a suitable option for a particular region. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and generation of alternatives to fossil fuels are major goals of WTE. Moreover, the development of compact, cost-saving, yet highly efficient technologies are required, with the best solutions for the disposal/utilization of filter ashes and residues from air pollution control devices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The paper presents a scenario-based holistic nexus tool, Energy Portfolio Assessment Tool (EPAT) that provides a platform for energy stakeholders and policymakers to create and evaluate the sustainability of various scenarios based on the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus approach. The tool is applied to a case study in Texas, USA. Scenarios considered are set by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA): EIA Reference Case – 2015, EIA Clean Power Plan (CPP) & Reference Case - 2030, and EIA No-CPP & Reference Case - 2030. In the presence of the CPP, total water withdrawal is expected to decrease significantly, while total water consumption is projected to experience a slight decrease due to the increase in water consumption in electricity generation caused by the new electricity mix. The CPP is successful in decreasing emissions, but is accompanied by tradeoffs, such as increased water consumption and land use by electricity generation. The absence of the CPP will lead to an extreme surge in total water withdrawn and consumed, and in emissions. Therefore, conservation policies should move from the silo to the nexus mentality to avoid unintended consequences that result in improving one part of the nexus while worsening the other parts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy policy; Energy portfolio; Energy sustainability; Energy system; Water footprint; Water-energy nexus; Water-energy-food nexus","Decision making; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Land use; Water supply; Energy portfolio; Energy sustainability; Energy systems; Water energy; Water footprint; Sustainable development; coal; natural gas; alternative energy; assessment method; conservation; decision making; electricity generation; energy planning; food security; holistic approach; sustainable development; water footprint; Article; bioenergy; carbon footprint; case study; decision making; electricity; energy conservation; energy portfolio assessment tool; energy resource; energy yield; environmental economics; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental parameters; environmental planning; environmental protection; finance; hydropower; land use; methodology; nuclear energy; priority journal; solar energy; Texas; water energy food nexus approach; water supply; water use; wind power; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053145423

Modelling plant floodplain vegetation responses to inform environmental watering outcomes is also challenging. We evaluated the effects of a large-scale environmental flow event on a semi-arid floodplain lakeside plant assemblage for meeting the management goal of increasing water-dependant taxa and functional groups. We developed a multi-taxon Bayesian hierarchical model to describe temporal and small-scale spatial patterns in taxonomic occurrences. We then examined community summary metrics (proportion of native taxa, plant functional groups) to evaluate patterns for the entire floodplain lakes system, the scale most relevant to management. Overall, in a system dominated by terrestrial dry plant taxa, 52.9% of terrestrial damp plant taxa showed a short-term increase in occurrence in response to the environmental flow, which translated into similar responses in some functional groups. However, nearly half of the plant taxa that increased then demonstrated a decline by 18 months after the flow event. Our community summary metrics captured these general results; however, they were disproportionately influenced by a few abundant plant taxa. These results highlight the advantages of multi-taxon models for interpreting flow responses and developing effective environmental flow management strategies, because they can be used to summarise community responses, while preserving important taxon-specific information. In semi-arid systems, where river regulation and climate change have reduced the frequency of flood events, the ability to deliver environmental flows during protracted periods of drought may be a policy option to restore or maintain the natural floodplain vegetation assemblage and prevents the transition to dryland taxa. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bayesian hierarchical model; environmental flow; flooding; plant community; water management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055183367

Practices in these regions, and the results of research on their effects towards carbon sequestration in soils, are certainly transferable to tropical regions. Soil management (e.g., tillage and amendment) and crop management (e.g., cropping system and cover crops) practices in the United States (with emphasis on the southern region) as well as new technologies and advances are covered in this chapter. Regulatory pathways for increasing carbon stores in managed agricultural lands in the United States are unlikely; therefore, willingness on the part of farmers to adopt practices aligned with C sequestration goals must be engendered. Reduced tillage and cover crop inclusion are being adopted more commonly in the United States. Reuse of organic waste materials for the benefit of agricultural production is also increasing. Breeding for greater or more stable root mass, and new methods for monitoring the flux of C from the soil to the atmosphere both represent exciting frontiers of discovery in this area. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Carbon longevity; Cover crops; Soil organic carbon; Tillage; United states",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084886445

The paddy field plays an important role in the various ecosystem functions such as flood control, groundwater recharge, improvement of water quality, local climate mitigation, fish culture and other non-rice productions, fostering culture and landscape, and maintaining biodiversity, among others. Paddy fields provide an important habitat to foster biodiversity. The remaining rice paddies in urban regions have an important role to alleviate the deterioration of the urban environment. In the first section, no-tillage cultivation studies carried out so far to investigate its effects on biodiversity in paddy fields are explained. Results show that spiders and carabid beetles prefer no-tillage soils in which the litter accumulate to the soil surface where abundant decomposers exist. Actually, in various types of crops, the density of soil-inhabiting predators such as spiders and carabid beetles is known to be higher in no-tillage or reduced-tillage cultivation field. The results also suggest that predation by spiders (especially lycosid spiders) is an important mortality factor for older larvae of the straight swift, and the effect is greater for the no-tillage paddy fields than the conventional paddy fields. In the following sections, an integrated rice farming method that uses crossbred ducks being practiced since 150 years ago, known as Aigamo farming in Japanese, is described. The rice-duck farming is a promising technique for producing organic rice in Southeast Asia. The farming system involves organic food certification systems, organic farmers’ cooperatives, community-wide organic farming, localized technical extension and educational services, and integration of farms and rice-duck. An experiment undertaken for the simultaneous cultivation of rice plants and baby crossbred ducks at the university farm in Fuchu, Tokyo, shows the effects of the release of crossbred ducks on the growth and quantities of rice plants, weeds, and diversity of the arthropod community. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085461028

They emerged at the beginning of the twenty-first century as designer solvents with low or negligible vapor pressure and the ability to dissolve a wide range of both organic and inorganic solutes. Their non-volatility under high temperatures or low pressure, recyclability, the great plasticity in terms of composition, and their simple preparation in pure state have positioned DESs in the spotlight of materials science for multiple applications. In the specific case of polymerizations, i.e. the chemical reactions that allow the formation of macromolecular chains or networks from monomeric units, the application of DES chemistry is in its infancy. Polycondensations and free-radical stand as the most studied mechanisms of polymerization, whether the monomers are dissolved in a DES or are taking part of it, as either hydrogen bond donor (HBD) or hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA). However, pioneering works on living/controlled free-radical, ring opening, electrochemical, enzyme-mediated, photopolymerizations, and other non-conventional mechanisms of polymerization, have started to appear in the literature. The applications explored are as diverse as hydrogels and particles for drug delivery systems, biomaterials and scaffolds for tissue engineering, supports for solid phase separation and chromatography, selective adsorbents for CO2 and other targets, strain and electrochemical sensors, and flexible electrodevices, among others. In this chapter a general survey of the last findings on polymers and related materials and polymeric composites that used DES is presented, with emphasis on the opportunities that DESs offer for the design and synthesis of polymeric materials within a sustainable framework. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Their absence can lead to more pronounced environmental and social consequences, for example the urban heat island effect. Evapotranspiration (Et) from trees reduces air temperature in the urban microclimate by converting sensible heat to latent heat. Quantification and valuation of the ecosystem services provided by urban trees is important for improving cost-benefit evaluations in support of protecting tree planting and maintenance budgets and, thus, for building climate change resilience into cities. Inclusion of Et cooling could improve ecosystem service valuation models by producing a more complete picture of the benefits that urban trees provide to society. This study explores two approaches for evaluating climate regulation as an ecosystem service of urban trees. Firstly, an enthalpy-based approach was adopted to valuate latent heat of evaporation from tree transpiration (in three case study urban forests) by equating it to an equivalent service from an active direct evaporative cooling system. Secondly, energy savings to air-conditioned buildings was modelled using TRNSYS and TRNFLOW simulation programs with and without air precooled and humidified by urban trees. Trees are shown to provide substantial urban cooling with an annual valuation of £84 m estimated using the enthalpy-based approach, or ranging from £2.1 m to £22 m using TRNSYS and TRNFLOW dynamic simulation programs; both for inner London case study. The latter savings arose from a modelled 1.28–13.4% reduction in air-conditioning unit energy consumption. Challenges around assumptions of homogeneity in both built form and urban forest canopy effects are discussed. The case study examples highlighted differences in Et cooling between tree species, with Castanea sativa, Prunus avium, Quercus petraea, Platanus hybrida and Fagus sylvatica typically providing more Et cooling than any of the other tree species commonly found in urban forests. The research highlighted a shortage of published Et data, particularly for urban environments. © 2018","Bowen ratio; Ecosystem services; Evapotranspiration; Heat comfort; Urban cooling","air temperature; Bowen ratio; climate change; cooling; deciduous tree; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; forest canopy; heat island; latent heat flux; microclimate; sensible heat flux; tree; tree planting; urban area; urban ecosystem; urban forestry; England; London [England]; United Kingdom; Castanea sativa; Fagus sylvatica; Platanus x acerifolia; Prunus avium; Quercus petraea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051661446

The need is arising to evaluate the risks conferred by individual components and sources of air pollution to provide a framework for the regulation of the most relevant components for public health protection. Previous studies in rodent models have shown diesel particulate matter has neurotoxic potential and could be a health concern for neurodevelopment. The present study shows an evaluation of pathological and protracted behavioral alterations following neonatal exposure to aerosolized diesel exhaust particles (NIST SRM 1650b). The particular behavioral focus was on temporal control learning, a broad and fundamental cognitive domain in which reward delivery is contingent on a fixed interval schedule. For this purpose, C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to aerosolized NIST SRM 1650b, a well-characterized diesel particulate material, from postnatal days 4-7 and 10-13, for four hours per day. Pathological features, including glial fibrillary-acidic protein, myelin basic protein expression in the corpus callosum, and ventriculomegaly, as well as learning alterations were measured to determine the extent to which NIST SRM 1650b would induce developmental neurotoxicity. Results: Twenty-four hours following exposure significant increases in glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the corpus callosum and cortex of exposed male mice were present. Additionally, the body weights of juvenile and early adult diesel particle exposed males were lower than controls, although the difference was not statistically significant. No treatment-related differences in males or females on overall locomotor activity or temporal learning during adulthood were observed in response to diesel particulate exposure. Conclusion: While some sex and regional-specific pathological alterations in GFAP immunoreactivity suggestive of an inflammatory reaction to SRM 1650b were observed, the lack of protracted behavioral and pathological deficits suggests further clarity is needed on the developmental effects of diesel emissions prior to enacting regulatory guidelines. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"glial fibrillary acidic protein; myelin basic protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein; myelin basic protein; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; body weight; brain cortex; brain ventricle; controlled study; corpus callosum; developmental toxicity; exhaust gas; exposure; female; infant; juvenile animal; learning; locomotion; male; mouse; neurotoxicity; newborn; nonhuman; particulate matter; perinatal period; priority journal; protein expression; air pollutant; animal; animal behavior; brain; C57BL mouse; drug effect; exhaust gas; exposure; growth, development and aging; instrumental conditioning; metabolism; motor activity; sex factor; toxicity; toxicity and intoxication; Air Pollutants; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Conditioning, Operant; Female; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Motor Activity; Myelin Basic Protein; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Particulate Matter; Sex Factors; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059499721

Methane (CH4) emissions in taiga–tundra boundary ecosystems have sparsely been evaluated from local to regional scales. We linked in situ CH4 fluxes (2009–2016) with vegetation cover, and scaled these findings to estimate CH4 emissions at a local scale (10 × 10 km) using high-resolution satellite images in an ecosystem on permafrost (Indigirka lowland, north-eastern Siberia). We defined nine vegetation classes, containing 71 species, of which 16 were dominant. Distribution patterns were affected by microtopographic height, thaw depth and soil moisture. The Indigirka lowland was covered by willow-dominated dense shrubland and cotton-sedge-dominated wetlands with sparse larch forests. In situ CH4 emissions were high in wetlands. Lakes and rivers were CH4 sources, while forest floors were mostly neutral in terms of CH4 emission. Estimated local CH4 emissions (37 mg m−2 d−1) were higher than those reported in similar studies. Our results indicate that: (i) sedge and emergent wetland ecosystems act as hot spots for CH4 emissions, and (ii) sparse tree coverage does not regulate local CH4 emissions and balance. Thus, larch growth and distribution, which are expected to change with climate, do not contribute to decreasing local CH4 emissions. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The 2015 Paris Conference set 2.0°C temperature rise above preindustrial values as a safe limit, with an aspirational target of 1.5°C. The world looks set to pass the 1.5°C limit as early as 2026, and the 2.0°C limit some time later. Some scientists argue that any rise beyond 1.5°C should be seen as dangerous. If temperatures do exceed safe levels, the only way atmospheric GHG levels and global temperatures could be reduced is by negative emissions technologies that draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These technologies include bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), biosequestration in plants and soils, and direct air capture and enhanced weathering of minerals. The latter two methods have heavy energy costs, while for biosequestration, the energy costs are much lower. Only BECCS is a positive energy generator. There is considerable uncertainty about the global potential for BECCS in a world with rising population and, consequently, food needs. Nevertheless, in some favored regions, BECCS could be of considerable help for emissions reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here we present a process-based model designed to correctly represent the main thermal, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes related to these emissions for general land surface modeling. We propose a new multilayer soil carbon and gas module within the Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (ISBA) land-surface model (LSM). This module represents carbon pools, vertical carbon dynamics, and both oxic and anoxic organic matter decomposition. It also represents the soil gas processes for CH 4 , CO 2 , and O 2 through the soil column. We base CH 4 production and oxydation on an O 2 control instead of the classical water table level strata approach used in state-of-the-art soil CH 4 models. We propose a new parametrization of CH 4 oxydation using recent field experiments and use an explicit O 2 limitation for soil carbon decomposition. Soil gas transport is computed explicitly, using a revisited formulation of plant-mediated transport, a new representation of gas bulk diffusivity in porous media closer to experimental observations, and an innovative advection term for ebullition. We evaluate this advanced model on three climatically distinct sites : two in Greenland (Nuuk and Zackenberg) and one in Siberia (Chokurdakh). The model realistically reproduces methane and carbon dioxide emissions from both permafrosted and nonpermafrosted sites. The evolution and vertical characteristics of the underground processes leading to these fluxes are consistent with current knowledge. Results also show that physics is the main driver of methane fluxes, and the main source of variability appears to be the water table depth. © 2018.

The NIST real gas model is used to incorporate thermophysical properties of actual refrigerants for accurate ejector performance prediction. A hydrocarbon ejector performance is analyzed according to different operating and geometric conditions, where a linear relationship between the expansion ratio and the compression ratio is obtained for Pentane with an accuracy of 0.5%. A set of Pareto Frontier performance curves are also recommended for designing and operating energy-efficient hydrocarbon ejector cooling systems. Our results show that a small area ratio leads to a high ejector compression ratio, which is desired in hot climate applications. The other geometric design parameters have minor effects on the ejector performance.

This paper explores the climate science-to-planning practice disconnect in the context of climate change adaptation in Southeast Asian cities generally, and Manila, Philippines specifically. We pose two simple, but important, questions: (1) what information do planning practitioners currently use to develop adaptive urban responses to climate change; and, (2) what additional knowledge and resources do planning practitioners need to effectively plan for climate change in the future? Survey and interview data collected across the Philippines suggest that planning professionals perceive access to, and sharing of, information as critical issues. Moreover, planning professionals contend that challenges with financial, technical, and staff resources, which have been perennial challenges of environmental management in Southeast Asia, persist despite significant new funding specifically earmarked for climate change adaptation. The climate science-to-practice disconnect, however, should be viewed as more than just an information/allocation deficit. Incomplete decentralization, haphazard urbanization, and the privatization of planning thwart attempts to translate climate science to planning practice in globalizing cities. As such, we argue that planning for adaptation to climate change requires more than just more and better information. It requires tackling the fundamental contradictions of planning in complex, globalizing cities. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate change; information needs; Southeast Asia; urban and regional planning","climate change; environmental management; environmental planning; globalization; planning practice; privatization; urban planning; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037726118

Since scheduling problem has a direct impact on energy consumption, developing the effective production scheduling is among the priorities in industries. Moreover, in practice, production and maintenance operations have been viewed as major source of energy consumption in industrial system. In this paper, we propose a stochastic mathematical model for a joint production and maintenance operations scheduling problem in a flexible job shop industrial environment in which both traditional and energy efficient aspects are modeled. The objective of this research is to minimize the expected makespan in the scheduling problem focusing on C02 emissions reduction in an actual workshop which breakdowns can happen at any moment and make machines unavailable for processing operations. In fact, energy usage associated with the C02 emissions of the industrial shop floor are formulated in the constraints with respect to different states of operation and idle.

A decade after sub-national demonstration projects to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) commenced, we examine why many REDD+ schemes appear to have fuelled social conflict while having limited success in addressing the drivers of forest loss and degradation. Our analysis is two-tiered: First we synthesise findings from a set of ethnographic case studies of REDD+ in Mainland Southeast Asia, conducted by the authors; second, we explore whether the insights from our regional synthesis apply globally, through a comparative review of published qualitative research on REDD+ field experiences. Our results reveal three major implementation dynamics that can undermine REDD+ in practice, which we conceptualise from science and technology studies and critical political ecology as follows: 1) problems with the enrolment of governments, civil society, and local forest users in REDD+ governance; 2) the prevalence of overly simplified codification systems for REDD+ implementation that mismatch targeted societies and landscapes; and 3) the consequent dissonance between REDD+ objectives and outcomes. Together, these problematic dynamics reveal how and why REDD+ so often misses its targets of reducing deforestation and delivering community benefits. In effect, it appears that REDD+ in the course of implementation maps onto local power structures and political economies, rendering it blunt as tool for change. The potential of REDD+ as a 'solution' in the global climate regime must therefore be scrutinized, along with other similar mechanisms espoused by the green economy. © 2018 Milne et al.","Carbon; climate change; ethnography; forests; governance; REDD+",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056767137

Through effects on mortality and regeneration, fire affects plant community composition, species richness, and carbon cycling. In some regions, changes to fire regimes could result in critical, non-reversible transitions from forest to non-forested states. For example, the Klamath ecoregion (northwest United States) supports extensive conifer forests that are initially replaced by hardwood chaparral following high-severity fire, but eventually return to conifer forest during the fire-free periods. Climate change alters both the fire regime and post-fire recovery dynamics, potentially causing shrubland to persist as a stable (i.e. self-renewing) vegetation stage, rather than an ephemeral stage. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of how changes in plant traits and fire regimes can alter the stability of communities in forest-shrub systems such as the Klamath. Our model captures the key characteristics of the system, including life-stage-specific responses to disturbance and asymmetrical competitive interactions. We assess vegetation stability via invasion analysis, and conclude that portions of the landscape that are currently forested also can be stable as shrubland. We identify parameter thresholds where community equilibria change from stable to unstable, and show how these thresholds may shift in response to changes in life-history or environmental parameters. For instance, conifer maturation rates are expected to decrease as aridity increases under climate change, and our model shows that this reduction decreases the fire frequencies at which forests become unstable. Increases in fire activity sufficient to destabilize forest communities are likely to occur in more arid future climates. If widespread, this would result in reduced carbon stocks and a positive feedback to climate change. Changes in stability may be altered by management practices. © 2018 The Authors","alternative stable equilibria; disturbance theory; theoretical modeling","carbon cycle; chaparral; climate change; community composition; coniferous forest; ecological theory; ecoregion; environmental disturbance; equilibrium; fire; mortality; plant community; recovery plan; regeneration; species richness; theoretical study; threshold; wildfire; United States; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052434394

It is also possible to combine anaerobic and aerobic biological breakdown in one system by exploiting the ability of plant cells to photosynthesize and release oxygen for the microbial aerobic metabolism of organic matter and to reduce the amount of CO2 released from microbial anaerobic metabolism. Wastewater treatment systems based on constructed wetlands offer enormous opportunities to reduce energy inputs associated with gaseous exchanges. They also offer opportunities for tailoring organic matter degradation according to the nature of organic matter present in wastewater, by exploiting the cooperative and mutualistic metabolism evidenced between plants and bacterial communities in both the plant rhizosphere and endosphere. Advances in algal pond treatment systems that incorporate the utilization of microalgae have demonstrated increases in municipal wastewater treatment capacity without associated economic, energy, and environmental costs. They will now deliver water for irrigation or discharge into a water resource, methane-rich biogas, and biomass for bioenergy and feed (where permitted).

This paper aims to offer experimental results comparing batch test and continuous experimental reactors under different conditions of humidity and solid content. Results show that both the investigated configurations may be used for converting OFMSW into a high quality biogas and that the increase of dry matter in the continuous process still allows to achieve significant biogas production rates. A slight reduction of the methane content was observed (less than 5% relative) that can be also related to the change in the level of volatile fatty acids.

This paper suggests the specific formulae and indicators for four equity principles for international climate policy including the ability to pay, egalitarianism, grandfathering, and historical responsibility. We introduce the carbon trading scheme into the integrated assessment model to assess and compare the global climate policies which are based on the four principles. To be specific, the regional emission caps are determined by the four equity principles, and all regions are allowed to buy and sell permits. Results show that none of the four equity principles creates a burden sharing arrangement that completely equalizes the benefits of each nation. To be specific, grandfathering is more beneficial to developed countries, while historical responsibility benefits developing countries more. From the global perspective, the global cumulative output of the grandfathering is 8% higher than that of the historical responsibility. In addition, international cooperation on climate change mitigation is necessary, because if individual nations undertake policies which are in their national self-interests, global cumulative CO 2 emission will be over two times as much as that in cooperative scenarios. © 2018, The Author(s).","Carbon trading; Emission permits; Equity; Grandfathering; Historical responsibility; Integrated assessment model","assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; emissions trading; environmental policy; equity; historical perspective; integrated approach; international trade",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050347195

First, this SV provides methods for constructing emission inventory from both production and consumption perspectives. These methods are useful to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of carbon accounting for international cities. Second, the climate change affects urban sectors from various aspects; simultaneously, GHG emissions caused by activities in urban sectors affect the climate system. This SV focuses on mitigation policies and assessment of energy, transport, construction, and service sectors. Third, climate change mitigation of cities is closely connected to urban sustainable development. This SV explores the relationships between climate change mitigation with urbanization, ecosystems, air pollution, and extreme events. Fourth, climate change mitigation policies can be divided into two categories: quantity-based mechanism (e.g., carbon emission trading) and price-based mechanism (e.g., carbon tax).

There has been a decline in oil & gas production in the North Sea caused by several factors, including the fall in global oil prices and the global transition towards a low-carbon energy future transition. Considering this, and questions of future energy security, the UK government adopted a strategy in 2016 to maximize the economic recovery (MER) and extract as much value as possible from the fields within the UKCS. The UK has to consider the MER strategy in light of the global energy transition, where energy supply is expected to transition from fossil fuels to low carbon sources with a view to accommodate the provisions of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change of 2015, the UK Climate Change Act 2008, the UK Carbon Plan, 2011 and the UK Clean Growth Strategy 2017. The UK therefore has to align its MER strategies with the strategies it presently has and will have to develop going forward on energy transition and the ambitious climate change objectives under the Paris Agreement and UK legislation and policies. The UK also has to take into account the likely impact of Brexit on its energy transition and climate change objectives, and the MER Strategy. This paper demonstrates that the successful implementation of the UK’s MER Strategy alongside achieving of the UK’s climate change obligations and energy transition targets will be challenging, and will require concerted sector-wide energy efficiency efforts and highly innovative low-carbon and emissions removal technology. Whether this is achievable will depend on the UK’s preparedness (both from policy and technological innovation) to offset the carbon emissions arising from the consumption of the oil and gas that will be recovered from the UKCS under the MER Strategy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Low carbon energy transition; Maximising economic recovery strategy; North Sea; Oil & gas",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086210897

When carried out through campaign-style enforcement drives, the nation's anti-air pollution policy and its implementation require all-levels of government to take measures to improve the air quality in a certain period. In this study, Xi'an, a city in northwest China, where serious haze occurs frequently, was chosen as the research sample. Based on a social network analysis of the Anti-pollution and Anti-haze Work Scheme of Xi'an for 2014 and 2015 as well as in-depth interviews with enforcement officials, we studied the attributes of the enforcement network, including the actors' respective tasks, the network's structure, and the 'centrality' of the network. Compared to 2014, the goals of the 2015 scheme were clearer and more challenging, with a larger number of specific tasks and tighter time limits. The structure of the enforcement network became flatter, with a 'horizontal' management arrangement that involved fewer actors. The core actors were shifted to the more authoritative departments, reflecting the reality that the campaign-style enforcement network structure had been adjusted toward the regulatory hierarchy system and routing administration. The results reveal that the implementation gap was narrowed by clearer and more specific roles and tasks, a simplified, flatter organizational network structure, greater decentralization of authority and responsibility to local departments, and more harmonious coordination among those departments with the most powerful leading actors. This study provides managers with an insight into the external and organizational factors involved in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-air pollution policy implementation. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution control; Campaign-style enforcement; Collaboration; Regulatory implementation; Social network analysis","air quality; atmospheric pollution; decentralization; haze; network analysis; policy implementation; pollution control; pollution policy; regulatory approach; social network; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059835531

The aims of this paper were to study the change from an energy system fueled by natural gas to District Heating by biomass in a building on the campus of the University of Valladolid-the School of Engineering (EII)-studying its consumption from its connection to the District Heating system. An energy management methodology such as ISO 50001 is carried out, applied to efficiency systems in buildings, thus establishing new criteria of sustainability and economic value. In this paper, energy management will also be analyzed in accordance with the proposed tools of an Energy Management System (EMS) applied to the EII building, through the measurement of energy parameters, calculation of thermal consumption, thermal energy savings as a result of the change from system to District Heating by biomass, economic savings, reduction of environmental impact and indicators of thermal efficiency I100 and CUSUM indicator. Finally, the primary renewable and non-renewable energy efficiency indicators for the new District Heating system will be determined.

This new economic model is based on the use of technology to allow companies, citizens and other actors to share and monetize the excess capacity of their assets (vehicles, houses, parking spaces, etc.). The potential effects of this model are difficult to quantify, but it has been ventured that this new economic relationship will yield greater efficiency to businesses across the world, especially in the supply chain and city logistics processes. Such prospect relies on the fact that it is based on the provision of opportunities to monetize resources that already exist, instead of creating additional infrastructures in order to meet the demand. In this context, the application of the shared economy model to logistics brings up concepts of logistics sharing capacity. Logistics sharing capacity assumes the access and sharing of operational capabilities, either by vehicle sharing, by vehicle capacity sharing, sharing warehousing or infrastructure sharing. The potential of logistic sharing solutions and respective transport capabilities to reduce emissions and mitigate the transport sector's impacts on climate change comes along with benefits to companies with the reduction of overall operating expenses, by reducing transport costs per kilogram and cutting maintenance and personnel costs, as fewer assets are needed. To the public sector, the benefits are still mostly felt in terms of environment as a consequence of the more effective use of resources. In fact, in spite the recent emergence of logistics sharing solutions, the topic has not been sufficiently explored under a perspective that: a) highlights the role that municipalities can play to benefit from the sharing economy model and; b) analyzes case studies in which municipalities provide owned assets to be shared by logistics players. The objective of this paper is to contribute to reduce that hiatus on research by assessing the impact of logistic sharing solutions under a public good perspective. Therefore, the paper analyses the potential impacts of promoting the shared usage of logistic parking infrastructure owned by public authorities. As a demonstration of that potential, the possible benefits of sharing parking spaces dedicated to urban logistics operations by other users were studied, in particular the parents taking children to kindergartens located in the area. The paper is supported by a case study carried out in a Portuguese city and the effects are quantified in metrics of transport performance, energy and environmental criteria. The scenario is compared to a baseline situation (BAU) and results show significant reductions in delay times, travel times, queue lengths and stopped times and increases in average speeds. Also, fuel consumption and emissions present considerable reductions in the tested scenario. As a result, the paper concludes that municipalities can take advantage of a sharing economy context, in which logistics sharing solutions can be exploited, by using their assets in a joint and more effective way. Those benefits are translated into the reduction of externalities and improvement of the quality of life in the city and, therefore, municipalities benefit from playing an active role in the emergent context of a sharing economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"baseline survey; capacity building; conceptual framework; economic analysis; efficiency measurement; freight transport; logistics; model; planning method; sustainability; technology adoption; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050861401

These approaches work well for a single variable and location and effectively mimic the observed temporal structure in the corrected series. The intervariable, interspace, and high- or low-frequency temporal dependencies that characterize observed hydrological records are often left untouched and lead to substantial biases in applications such as catchment modeling where their correct representation is critical. In the approach presented here, changes in the dependence attributes are ascertained by resampling of the historical ranks into what these might resemble in the future. The proposed approach is not limited in terms of the number of variables, grid points in space, and the time scale considered. Most importantly, it maintains the shift in dependence and other attributes between the current and the future climate as ascertained by a climate model. The approach is illustrated using daily time series of temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed simulated by a regional climate model at 8,910 grid points over Australia. Spatial, temporal, and cross-variable dependence attributes of the corrected simulations at daily and aggregated time scales are compared against quantile mapping and substantial improvements in performance identified. Resampling of corrected ranks offers a very simple, flexible, and effective general purpose multivariate, multitime, and multilocation bias correction alternative for current and future climate.

To evaluate the impact of a GLOF in the hydrography and biological components of the plankton in the Baker Fjord, we assessed the relative contributions of terrigenous versus marine plankton carbon sources to the particulate organic matter (POM) in the fjord before and after a GLOF in the austral summer 2014. We also evaluated whether terrestrial carbon brought into the fjord by the river may reach higher trophic levels via a deposit-feeding organism the juvenile pelagic Munida gregaria. Over a 10-day period, hydrographic profiles, water samples for POM, and zooplankton samples were collected daily from three stations and two depths along the fjord’s inner section. Samples of suspended POM and tissue from M. gregaria were analyzed for stable-isotope composition of carbon (δ 13 C). The GLOF arrival produced a thermal front in the fjord, followed by an oscillation of the pycnocline; an abrupt increase in the total organic carbon content of POM, which was attributed to terrestrial input; and a concurrent peak in the abundance of M. gregaria, suggesting an aggregation response to the GLOF. Understanding GLOF effects on local hydrography, productivity, and food web structure provides valuable insight on the potential responses of fjord ecosystems in general to climate change-induced variability. Given present climatic trends in high-latitude zones, more frequent GLOFs might be expected in Patagonian fjords and channels as well as in other high-latitude basins. © 2018, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Fjord; GLOF; Mixing; Squat lobster; Stable isotope; Trophic level","abundance; carbon cycle; fjord; food web; hydrography; lobster; outburst; particulate organic matter; stable isotope; terrestrial environment; total organic carbon; trophic level; zooplankton; Aisen; Baker Basin; Chile; Northern Patagonian Ice Field; Galatheidae; Munida gregaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052070074

However, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health during biofuel crop production could have a major impact on the GHG balance of biofuels. We assessed temporal changes (10 yr) in SOC stocks to a 90 cm depth in Cumulic Hapludolls from central Kansas under perennial and annual cropping systems. The perennial crops were miscanthus (Miscan-thus sacchariflorus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). The annual cropping systems were continuous corn (Zea mays L.), and corn, dual purpose–grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), sweet sorghum, and photoperiod-sensitive sorghum (PS) in rotation with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. All standing aboveground biomass was removed at harvest of corn, sorghum, and perennial crops. Stocks of SOC increased in the 0–15 cm depth under switchgrass and miscanthus by 0.8 and 1.3 Mg C ha –1 yr –1 , respectively. The SOC stocks did not change at the other depths or at any depth in the annual cropping systems nor throughout the soil profile under any crops. Root biomass measured in the seventh year of the study was 3.7 to 7.8 times greater in perennials than in annual crops. Increases on SOC were correlated with greater root biomass, abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizae and saprophytic fungi, and soil aggregate diameter. These results demonstrate the potential for perennial biofuel crops to enhance C sequestration and improve soil quality while providing feedstock for production of cellulosic biofuel. © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060248219

Findings from the study confirmed that insecure land tenure not only increases the exposure and sensitivity of marginalised communities to climate-related hazards but in many instances also adversely affects collective and individual capacities to adapt.

Climate change will exacerbate those pressures and the effects of habitat loss and species decline. Current approaches to conservation law in most countries focus on establishing protected areas and limiting activities outside reserves that might affect priority species, habitats, and ecological communities. These measures have had mixed success depending on scale and implementation, but are likely to perform poorly under conditions of future change. To prepare for the future, we consider how conservation law and policy needs to anticipate and manage for future change; widen its scope beyond species and ecological communities that are currently threatened; and support adaptive management of priority areas and species. Using Australian conservation law as a case study, we outline three possible routes by which this shift could occur.

Therefore, best fuel economy is one main influencing criteria for a decision to purchase motorcycles. Furthermore, increasingly stringent emission legislations limit and additional OBD requirements must be fulfilled. A new combined test approach has been developed that minimizes accuracy losses in the development process which compensates for the variability of driving behavior in the chassis dyno environment. An engine testbed combined with a belt drive transmission enables operation in single engine or in Powerpack (i.e. internal combustion engine including transmission) configuration as well as under steady state or dynamic operating mode. Since the belt drive transmission is integrated in the test rig, realistic inertia situation for the single engine operating test configuration is ensured. Furthermore, a vehicle- and continuous variable transmission (CVT) model, which is implemented in the testbed automation system, enables the simulation of real hardware components. This means that vehicle measurements usually only taken on the chassis dyno can be shifted to the engine testbed in early stages of development. Tests can be carried out even before first vehicle prototypes are available, as long as simulation models can be characterized and parametrized sufficiently. In addition, as a key advantage, measurements done on the engine testbed including the transmission and vehicle simulation are fully repeatable. It has also been observed that development target verification is more accurate compared to the previous procedure. All in all, the new solution incorporating latest testing tools, methodologies and technology, increases the development efficiency tremendously. © 2019 SAE International.

At the same time, sprawling development patterns contribute to climate change. Solving these problems will require public and private sector innovation, policy development, and ultimately, expanding the housing supply to address both affordability and sustainability goals. California’s Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (SB 375) aligns land use and transportation planning to encourage compact infill development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We assess the implications of SB 375 for housing planning and production, and find improved alignment of housing plans with sustainability goals. Still, the bill neither mandates nor sufficiently incentivizes the type and volume of housing production needed to address California’s affordability and climate crises. Both within SB 375 and broadly, more tools are necessary to drive development in the right places, and more sanctions are needed to address barriers to development. Recent housing legislation is a first step toward strengthening enforcement, and if paired with stronger incentives, SB 375 has the potential to encourage the sustainable, affordable development California needs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The chapter also presents examples of multijurisdictional climate governance, with a particular focus on cooperation within counties. SB 375 complements prior California legislation mandating emissions reductions from automobiles and other sources, aiming to reduce sprawl and auto dependency. However, SB 375 is a weak mandate, requiring metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to develop plans for compact, transit-oriented growth, but leaving local government implementation of the plans largely voluntary. County-level agencies receive little mention in the text of the law; yet they have played a surprisingly large role in helping local jurisdictions respond to SB 375 implementation. Findings from a survey and case studies suggest that county level encouragement of multijurisdictional collaboration on climate planning promotes a focus on compact development, particularly housing, and that such collaborations will occur given the appropriate policy signals from the state and MPOs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Replacing this stock with decent housing will entail significant costs and increase energy consumption and related CO2 emissions due to both upfront and long-term energy requirements. This paper assesses the life cycle costs (LCC), life cycle energy (LCE) and CO2 emissions impacts of filling the current housing gap with different building materials and technologies, and maintaining reasonable standards of indoor temperature and humidity. These outcomes are assessed under different climatic conditions and residential behavioural patterns, using urban and rural housing archetypes, and considering conventional as well as low-cost materials and energy-savings measures. The results demonstrate that stabilized-earth blocks are a preferred solution to the prevailing norm of fired bricks. Along with filler slab and roof insulation, they offer a win–win solution to reduce both LCC by 18% and LCE by 17% compared with conventional techniques in bridging the housing gap. LCE savings can be further increased to 28% without increasing the investment cost compared with conventional solutions.

Climate change also poses significant challenges for the industry in a number of ways, including risks to infrastructure and equipment, transport routes and the cost of energy supplies. The sector is of particular importance to Russia, and yet very little is known about how the sector positions itself in relation to this key issue. This article conducts an in-depth look at the response of the Russian metals and mining sector to climate change. It looks at the key actors, their willingness to engage with the issue of climate change, preferred policy options and the strategies adopted to further their interests. The role of companies, prominent individuals and business associations is considered. The evidence suggests that, although there is widespread acceptance of climate change as a phenomenon, there is significant variation within the sector, with some companies proactive on climate policy, and others more reluctant. Different responses are attributed to reputational factors and the disproportionate influence of international and domestic policy developments on companies. Russian coal companies, directly threatened by any international attempts to reduce coal consumption, display the strongest opposition to efforts aimed at curbing emissions. The Russian government, far from thinking of transitioning to a low carbon future, is vigorously trying to expand the coal industry. Key policy insights Understanding how Russia’s domestic position on climate policy is formed is fundamental for understanding the factors driving its international engagement on climate policy. The Russian government has no plans to phase out coal and is instead actively seeking to expand the coal industry. This highlights the obstacles to Russia’s commitment to climate policy at both the domestic and international levels. The socio-economic consequences of climate policy for the Russian coal industry are a key consideration for the government, with some regions heavily dependent on the industry for employment and electricity generation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; coal; environment; metals and mining industry; Russia; state–business relations","climate change; coal; environmental economics; metals industry; mining industry; state-business relations; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044258319

At the same time, adaptation to climate change has been a research interest in different academic fields; while private companies provide research and development efforts on the issue. Views from perspectives may contain common ground and discrepancies, but benefits from the discussion may differ among these three sectors. This study shows the application of collaborative approaches to analyze impacts and adaptation measures at a local level. A stakeholder workshop was held in the city of Bilbao to discuss impacts of climate change and adaptation in the local context of the Basque Country. The contributions were proposed on three axes: impacts from climate change, good practices proposed or already in action, and costs and benefits derived from those strategies. Participants were asked to rank a series of measures and practices extracted from their previous inputs.

Participants estimated that groups containing green adaptation measures and those that had potentially positive impacts over climate change mitigation were the most efficient measures, as reduced costs combined with high benefits could lead to win-win adaptation strategies, while grey infrastructures were seen as providing high benefits at high costs. © 2018 by the authors.","Green infrastructure costs and benefits; Stakeholder perceptions; Urban adaptation policy","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; expert system; perception; periurban area; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban area; urban policy; Basque Country [Spain]; Basque Country [Spain]; Bilbao; Bizkaia; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060586265

In this context, residual biomass from different crops has been considered as alternative. However, there are significant issues associated to this energy source, which are mainly related to the low density and high transportation costs. Therefore, in this paper is presented an optimization approach for the strategic planning for the use of waste biomass pellets in power plants for electric energy production. The proposed approach considers all the activities included in the supply chain since the collection of residues until the combustion of pellets in power plants. Particularly, the location and design of the pelleting plants in a macroscopic region, as well as the selection of biomass and transportation routes are considered to satisfy the needs of the power plants at the minimum cost and minimum environmental impact. A case study for the national case of Mexico is presented, where the results show that is possible to satisfy 50% of the national demand of the power plants through the use of residual biomass, and simultaneously the associated CO2 emissions can be reduced 25%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass residues; Pellets; Power plants; Supply chain optimization","Biomass; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Ore pellets; Pelletizing; Power plants; Strategic planning; Supply chains; Transportation routes; Waste incineration; Alternative energy source; Biomass residue; Electric energies; Macroscopic regions; Optimization approach; Residual biomass; Supply chain optimization; Transportation cost; Electric power plants; alternative energy; biomass; carbon emission; crop residue; electrical power; electricity generation; emission inventory; energy planning; environmental impact; fossil fuel; optimization; power plant; strategic approach; supply chain management; waste technology; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049898356

Whether this would lead to identifiable near-term responses in “iconic” climate quantities of wide scientific and public interest is unclear, because the climate response would be obscured by quasi-random internal variability. I define the climate response as an increase or decrease in a linear climate trend over the period 2021–2035, compared to 2006–2020, and establish the probability of such a trend change being caused by an assumed policy shift toward emissions reductions after 2020. I quantify the irreducible uncertainty in projecting such a trend change through very large (100-member) ensembles of the state-of-the-art climate model MPI-ESM-LR. Trends in global-mean surface temperature (GMST) are higher over the period 2021–2035 than over 2006–2020 in one-third of all realizations in the mitigation scenario RCP2.6, interpreted as implementing the Paris agreement, compared to around one-half in the no-mitigation scenario RCP4.5. Mitigation is sufficient to cause a GMST trend reduction with a probability of 0.40 and necessary with a probability of 0.33. Trend increases in Arctic September sea-ice area and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are caused by the emissions reductions with a probability of only around 0.1. By contrast, emissions reductions are necessary for a trend decrease in upper-ocean heat content with a probability of over one-half. Some iconic climate quantities might thus by year 2035 exhibit an identifiable response to a successful Paris agreement but sometimes with low probability, creating a substantial communication challenge.

Although many countries claim that they are meeting their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction commitments, the average global temperature and GHG emissions continue to rise. This has led to growing speculation that some countries may be taking advantage of the system by effectively exploiting a range of loopholes in global agreements. Using a case study approach, we critically review the evidence from Australia, exploring how Australia has participated in global climate change negotiations and the way in which this emissions intensive country’s national emissions reduction obligations have been met. The findings suggest that: (1) successful negotiation to include Article 3.7 (‘Adjusting the 1990 Baseline’ or ‘the Australia Clause’) in the Kyoto Protocol significantly favored Australia’s ability to meet its First Kyoto Commitment (2008–2012); and (2) successful bargaining for the accounting rule that allowed carbon credits from the first commitment period to be carried over to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol benefitted Australia by 128 MtCO 2 e. At the national level, a lack of bipartisan political support for an effective mechanism to drive emissions reduction has also been problematic. While the introduction of the Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM) in 2012 reduced emissions from electricity production from about 199.1 MtCO 2 e to 180.8 MtCO 2 e in 2014, a change of government led to the abolition of the CPM in 2014 and emissions from electricity production subsequently rose to 187 MtCO 2 e in 2015 and 189 MtCO 2 e in 2016 with adverse impacts in many sectors as well as Australia’s overall emissions. The current Australian government continues to undermine its commitment to mitigation and the integrity and credibility of its own emissions reductions policy, introducing a softer ‘calculated baseline’ for its own Safeguard Mechanism, which allows companies to upwardly adjust their calculated baselines on the basis of their highest expected emissions, permitting emissions in excess of their historical emissions. While disappointing in the context of the global emissions reduction project, Australia’s actions are sadly not unique and we also provide examples of loopholes exploited by countries participating in a range of other negotiations and emissions reduction projects. Such strategies undoubtedly serve the short-term political and economic interests of these countries; however, it is increasingly apparent that the cumulative impact of such tactics will ultimately impact the entire global community. © 2019 by the authors.","Australia; Clean development mechanism; Kyoto protocol; Nationally determined contribution","Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Australia; Clean Development Mechanism; Effective mechanisms; Electricity production; Global climate changes; Historical emissions; KYOTO protocol; Nationally determined contribution; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060960864

As a key strategy to address sustainable urban development, the EU has advocated the development of Nature-Based solutions, such as the implementation of Green Infrastructure (GI), which can deliver a wide range of Regulating Ecosystem Services (ES). In this article, the ES of climate regulation provided by GI has been analyzed in the Municipality of Rome, Italy, characterized by a complex territory and by a Mediterranean climate. The methodological approach allowed to characterize the UHI and to analyze its features in a spatially explicit way and on a seasonal basis, through the Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from Landsat-8 data. The cooling capacity of different GI elements (peri-urban forest, urban forest, street trees), as well as the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating ES were assessed. The results show that GI significantly mitigates the hot urban climate during summer, with an effect that is dependent on the GI element and the environmental constrains to which it is exposed. NDVI and tree cover resulted the main indicators of the provision of the ES of climate regulation, highlighting that GI elements such as urban and peri-urban forests have the highest potential to provide this ES in a Mediterranean city. In the context of the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) process, our results lend support to claims that GI is important for an ecosystem-based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments, contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators, relevant for decision-making in Mediterranean cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate regulation; Land Surface Temperature; Nature-Based solution; Street trees; Urban and peri-urban forests; Urban Heat Island","Decision making; Ecosystems; Forestry; Knowledge based systems; Landforms; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Thermal pollution; Urban growth; Climate regulation; Land surface temperature; Street trees; Urban forests; Urban heat island; Atmospheric temperature; ecosystem service; greenspace; heat island; land surface; Mediterranean environment; NDVI; periurban area; surface temperature; urban area; urban climate; vegetation cover; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057206495

Near Alcoota station in central Australia is a late Miocene fossil mammal site for Alcoota (10 Ma) and Ongeva (8 Ma) local faunas. The Alcoota fauna includes the largest known land bird (Dromornis stirtoni) and early diprotodontid (Kolopsis torus), but the geologically younger Ongeva fauna has a larger diprotodontid (Zygomaturus gilli). These faunas are evolutionary predecessors of Australian Pleistocene megafauna. Calcareous paleosols recorded a marked turn toward aridity compared with underlying thick lateritic duricrusts which lack fossils. Laterites of likely middle Miocene age are evidence of wet (>1100 mm mean annual precipitation) tropical (>17 °C mean annual temperature) paleoclimates, but these were deeply eroded and redeposited by the time of the late Miocene mammals. A succession of 19 paleosols of 5 pedotypes were recognized in the 19 m thick section, with shallow calcareous nodule (Bk) horizons as evidence of mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 400 mm, and mean annual range of precipitation of 50 mm, very similar to the modern climate of Alcoota (296 mm precipitation with 56 mm difference between wet and dry month). This was neither a rainforest nor monsoonal paleoclimate, and vegetation inferred from paleosols was open woodland and gallery woodland similar to that of today. Central Australia was not covered by monsoon rainforest during the late Miocene and its paleoclimatic history of Neogene desertification matches well that of other parts of the world. © 2018","Caliche; Laterite; Mulga; Paleoclimate; Paleosol; Rainforest","aridity; caliche; climate change; cooling; desertification; fossil record; laterite; mammal; Miocene; paleoclimate; paleosol; Pleistocene; rainforest; warming; woodland; Australia; Acacia aneura; Aves; Diprotodontidae; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056185645

Here, we spatially examined land use changes in Multan, Pakistan, and investigated public perception about urban sprawl and its impacts on the quality and provision of ecosystem services, using a survey instrument. The spatial analysis of the historical land cover of Multan indicated an exponential expansion of the city in the last decade. Large areas of natural vegetation and agricultural land were converted to urban settlements in the past two decades. The citizens of Multan believe that the quality and provision of ecosystem services have declined in the recent past and strongly correlate the deteriorating ecosystem services with urban sprawl. Education and income levels of the respondents are the strongest predictors of urban ecosystem health literacy. Citizens associated with laborious outdoor jobs are more sensitive to the changes in ecosystem services.

The Egyptian western desert of Egypt-USA joint program (Using Simulation Models for the Improvement of Strategic Crops in Egypt) aims to analyze the interactions between different irrigation systems and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) water requirements, comparing the EPICSIM predicted values and data from corn. Most people living in the newly reclaimed land areas in western Egypt depend directly or indirectly on agricultural production activities. Crop production in the region is often adversely affected by droughts and low soil fertility levels. The climate of the study area can be characterized as a hyper arid climate were the annual evapotranspiration reaches 1450 mm, and the annual precipitation is only 18.5 mm per year. An experiment based on using different quantities of irrigation from the Nile as a result of the negligible rainfall was performed. The measured values of grain yield were 34% larger relative to simulated values by the EPICSIM model when using all irrigation systems. For stover yield, the measured values were 35 % larger than simulated values by the EPICSIM model for all irrigation systems. The EPICSIM simulation model can reproduce the variability in the growth and yield for corn crops in the western desert region of Egypt. It is possible to adapt the EPICSIM simulation model to the characteristics of growth and yield of corn, but it is not yet possible for the EPICSIM simulation model to deal with regions within different conditions than Egypt.

The pyrolysis process is carried out in which the biomass is heated to a temperature high enough in the absence or with limited amount of oxygen for eliminating the moisture and the volatile matter. Biochar is made by pyrolysis at low temperature around 400 °C and intended to be used as a conditioning agent to remedy a rough soil. A broad aspect of the impact includes physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil as well as the yield of produce from the conditioned soil. Other benefits include enhanced carbon content and storage for carbon sequestration, boosted plant nutrients, amended soil structure, and improved hydrology management. Several variations of smokeless kilns have been produced. Using electric heating results in near smokeless carbonization but makes the product more expensive in the end. Recapturing and treating the flue gases require intricate design and construction that makes the kiln more expensive to construct. In Egypt, the new mechanized metal charcoal kiln is expected to improve local air quality by reducing emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and protect the local groundwater quality and land resources as well as vegetation and agricultural production from tar emissions. The sandy soil is incapable of retaining irrigation water and nutrients because it contains less amount of organic matter. Farmers apply organic matters or composts to improve the soil fertility. New lands in the Delta of Egypt are characterized by the absence of many diseases and contaminants that may be suffered by the old farmland in the sameregion. Using biochar and other value-added products instead of compost is one of the promising ways because it does not include the plant root diseases such as nematodes and fusarium and prevents from excessive application of pesticides and the resulting high production costs. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085414453

Here, we utilize India-specific supply chain data to estimate life cycle GHG emissions associated with power generated by combustion of Indian coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported from the United States. Life cycle impacts of domestic coal power vary widely (80% confidence interval (CI): 951-1231 kg CO2eq/MWh) because of heterogeneity in existing power plant characteristics such as efficiency, age, and capacity. Less variability is observed for LNG sourced from northeast United States and used in the existing Indian combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) fleet (80% CI: 523-648 kg CO2eq/MWh). On average, life cycle GHG emissions from LNG imported into India are ∼54% lower than those associated with Indian coal. However, the GHG intensity of the Indian coal-power sector may be reduced by 13% by retiring plants with the lowest efficiencies and replacing them with higher-efficiency supercritical plants.

In many countries, National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) are charged with providing climate services to diverse audiences. Climate services are important to foster adaptation to climate risks and in reducing vulnerability in developing world contexts. However, the production and delivery of user-oriented climate services place new burdens on NMHSs and require new skillsets, partnerships, and infrastructure. In this paper, we assess the capabilities of 22 NMHSs in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to understand whether and how NMHSs are fit for the purpose of providing climate services. Our assessment is framed around the five core pillars of the World Meteorological Organization's Global Framework for Climate Services. We find that the NMHSs face key capacity gaps in the technical production, translation, transfer, and facilitation of the use of climate information. Some of these gaps have historical roots and relate to the overarching legal, political, and institutional settings in which NMHSs were established and currently operate. Others relate to an increased emphasis on users in ways that contrast with traditional NMHSs’ engagement with stakeholders. These results suggest that investments that support the co-production of climate information while also addressing prevailing legal, political, and institutional disconnects and human resource constraints can strengthen the provision of climate services in Caribbean SIDS. © 2019 The Authors","Caribbean; Climate adaptation; Climate services; Global Framework for Climate Services; National Meteorological and Hydrological Services; Small Island Developing States","climate change; development strategy; hydrology; information management; meteorology; service provision; stakeholder; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060950094

Thai farmers have usually developed coping strategies to adapt to or reduce the negative impacts of climate change on their farming operations. This study aims at identifying the strategies that Thai farmers adopt in relation to the ongoing changes in climatic events and to determine the factors influencing farmers' adoption of adaptive strategies. The present study drew upon a survey of 364 farmers in Bophloi district, Kanchanaburi province of Thailand. Results showed that a majority of the farmers self-reported as having employed in adaptive behavior. The use of drought tolerant varieties was the most common adaptation strategy used. Whilst zero tillage was the least common adaptation strategy employed among the farmers. Using binary logistic regression, the results found that younger, more educated respondents with larger household size, access to credit, and possessing smaller land size, and/or contact with agricultural extension agents were more likely to employ adaptation strategies to climate change. These results provide a policy insight that government should facilitate infrastructure, support financial access, and encourage agricultural extension services to the farmers, all in order to promote adoption of coping strategies so as to tackle the adverse effects of climate change. © 2017 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

It is shown here that both, hydrogen- and oxygen gas binding into PIMs, also occurs under wet or “triphasic” conditions in aqueous electrolyte environments (when immersed in 0.01 M phosphate buffer at pH 7). For two known PIM materials (PIM-1 and PIM-PY), nanoparticles are formed by an anti-solvent precipitation protocol and then cast as a film onto platinum or glassy carbon electrodes. Voltammetry experiments reveal evidence for hydrogen and oxygen binding. Both, PIM-1 and PIM-PY, locally store hydrogen or oxygen gas at the electrode surface and thereby significantly affect electrocatalytic reactivity.

However, this is not always the experience of researchers, practitioners and decision makers responding to the challenges of a rapidly changing climate, despite the billions now being made available for investment in climate change adaptation initiatives throughout the world and particularly in developing countries. In recognition of the importance of information in adaptation planning, Article 7.7 of the Paris Agreement sets out clear guidance for parties to develop, share, manage and deliver climate change knowledge, information and data as a means to strengthening cooperation and action on adaptation. This article provides some key lessons and insights on climate change information and knowledge management (IKM) in small island developing States (SIDS) from the perspective of Pacific SIDS. A situation analysis of current climate change IKM practices in Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu was conducted and key barriers to effective climate change IKM identified. The outcome of this article is a range of pragmatic policy considerations for overcoming common barriers to climate change IKM in the Pacific, which may be of value to SIDS more widely. Key policy insights The partnership approach of co-investigating climate change IKM barriers in collaboration with Pacific SIDS generated considerable trust, a shared purpose and therefore rich IKM lessons and insights. Turning climate change IKM aspirations into practice is significantly more complicated than expected, and requires a long-term commitment from both national governments and development partners. Pacific SIDS need to establish national guiding climate change IKM Frameworks that leverage rather than duplicate growing national investments in whole-of-government IKM. Reframing climate change IKM in the Pacific towards demand and user needs will be critical to ensuring widespread ownership and participation in IKM solutions that lead to greater adaptation and resilience outcomes. It is also critical that IKM activities in SIDS support the development of national capacity to scope, develop, deploy and maintain decision support systems. Federated IKM systems are ideal for encouraging greater IKM collaboration. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change adaptation; information and knowledge management (IKM); Pacific; resilience; SIDS","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; information management; knowledge; small island state; Fiji; Tonga; Vanuatu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044767528

Such efforts remain relatively limited in developing economies due to inefficient management practices. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is adopted to identify integrated systems with minimal impacts and reduced emissions in a developing context coupled with an economic valuation and sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of varying influencing parameters individually. The results showed that the highest impact arises from landfilling with minimal material recovery for recycling and composting, while incineration coupled with energy recovery contributed to the least equivalent emissions (–111% with respect to baseline scenario) at a varying cost of −70% to +93% depending on the selected technology and the value of carbon credit. Optimizing material recycling, composting and landfilling with energy recovery contributed to 98% savings in emissions (with respect to baseline scenario) and remained economically attractive irrespective of the carbon credit exchange rate of 0.5–50 US$/MTCO 2 E. The sensitivity analysis showed that an improvement in landfill gas collection efficiency (up to 60%) can contribute to major savings in emissions (58%). The application of the LCA-based approach supports the development of integrated viable plans while quantifying advantages and disadvantages towards decision-making and policy-planning. © The Author(s) 2018.","carbon credit; economic analysis; emissions estimation; Integrated waste management; life cycle assessment","Carbon; Decision making; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Carbon credits; Developing economies; Economic implications; Emissions estimation; Influencing parameters; Integrated waste management; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management practices; Life cycle; biogas; fuel; carbon; composting; decision making; developing world; economic analysis; emission inventory; environmental economics; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; pollution tax; recycling; solid waste; valuation; waste management; acidification; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; composting; degradation; economic evaluation; energy recovery; environmental impact; eutrophication; fly ash; food waste; incineration; landfill; Lebanon; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; ozone depletion; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Lebanon; Carbon; Lebanon; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060880856

Assessing ESS and optimising the accuracy of ESS assessment is relevant to identify suitable indicators. This study aims to gain a better understanding of global climate regulation service assessments resulting from the application of several indicators that have been derived based on Co-Ordination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) land cover classes. Therefore, 17 CORINE land cover classes were used to evaluate their effects on the distributions of the annual total Gross Primary Production (GPP), the annual total Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and Carbon Stocks (CS) in the German federal state Schleswig-Holstein. In addition to the spatial distributions, correlations of distinct quantitative indicators (annual total GPP, annual total NPP, SOC and CS) and a qualitative indicator of Global Climate Regulation (GCR) derived from the ecosystem service matrix method were analysed. We found that qualitative and quantitative indicators of the global climate regulation service had significant correlations based on the comparison analysis of all indicators. The differences in mapping the service with the five indicators resulted from different strategies of the reclassified land covers. In addition, the distinct areas among the land cover classes contributed to the differences in global climate regulation mapping. The interrelations among the annual total GPP, the annual total NPP and statistical data on total harvest of different agricultural products also correlated significantly. Based on the results, GPP, NPP, SOC, CS and GCR are available indicators of global climate regulation service in Schleswig-Holstein. Nevertheless, we especially recommend CS as the indicator owning to its high accuracy in assessments. The indicators and methodology in our study can also be applied to other researches targeted with evaluating global climate regulation service. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon Stocks (CS); Gross Primary Production (GPP); Net Primary Production (NPP); Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)","Agricultural products; Mapping; Organic carbon; Carbon stocks; Comparison analysis; Gross primary production; Net primary production; Quantitative indicators; Regulation services; Schleswig holsteins; Soil organic carbon; Ecosystems; carbon; organic carbon; carbon; comparative study; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; global climate; land cover; mapping; organic carbon; primary production; soil organic matter; agriculture; Article; climate change; correlation analysis; environmental management; geographic information system; geographic mapping; Germany; harvest; land use; landscape; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; vegetation; Germany; Schleswig-Holstein",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052456373

In China, the major source of carbon (C) emissions derives from the transit system, and this problem is of particular interest in metropolitan regions, however there is a lack of clarity on past and projected future trends of C emissions from transit. This study aimed to model recent (2005–2014) historical spatio-temporal highway passenger transit C emissions (HPTCEs) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban region, and to predict future emissions to 2030 under three simulated contrasting management scenarios. We used a long-range energy alternative planning system (LEAP) model to predict emissions under baseline, business as usual growth, and partial and total emission control scenarios. Modeling showed that the total emission control scenario resulted in greater reductions in C emission compared with the baseline growth and partial control scenarios, however, regional total C emissions were predicted to continue to rise by 2030 under all three scenarios. C emissions per passenger kilometer were predicted to decrease over time, while total regional C emissions continued to rise and increase pressure for decision makers to reduce regional C emissions. While HPTCEs were historically greater in Beijing and Tianjin, those from Hebei Province had recently sharply increased to levels greater than in Beijing and Tianjin, and this trend was predicted to continue. This study demonstrates that science-based policy intervention and regulations could reduce C emissions in metropolitan areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","BTH region; Carbon emissions; Highway passenger transit; LEAP model; Scenario simulation; Spatio-temporal change","Carbon; Decision making; Emission control; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; BTH region; Carbon emissions; Highway passenger transit; Leap models; Scenario simulations; Spatio-temporal changes; Transit time devices; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; computer simulation; emission control; metropolitan area; scenario analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; air pollution control; Article; car; carbon footprint; China; city planning; energy consumption; environmental sustainability; highway; mathematical model; simulation; urban area; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054234105

The richness of epiphytic algae had a trend similar to that of P. crispus coverage, which increased in the first four months and then decreased in the following three months. The structural equation model (SEM) showed that P. crispus affected the richness of epiphytic algae by reducing nutrient concentrations (reduction in total organic carbon, total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand) and enhancing water transparency (reduction in turbidity and total suspend solids) to enhance the richness of epiphytic algae. The results indicated that high amounts of submerged macrophyte cover can increase the richness of the epiphytic algal community by changing water quality. © 2019 Lv, He, Hong, Liu and Yu.","Coverage; Epiphytic algae; Richness; Submerged macrophytes; Water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062806318

In this study, we used head capsules of Chironomidae larvae to assess community and diversity change between the past (estimated as Pre-Industrial Period) and present and to reconstruct changes in hypolimnetic oxygen conditions from 30 subarctic ecotonal lakes (northeastern Lapland) using the top-bottom paleolimnological approach applying surface sediment (topmost 0–2 cm) and reference (4–5 cm) samples. Subsequently, we tested the findings against dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of the sites. We found that the benthic communities were statistically dissimilar between the past and the present with largest changes occurring in the more transparent oligo-mesohumic lakes. However, murky polyhumic lakes displayed uniformly a decrease in diversity.

Here, we present a review of the added value of the regional climate modeling approach within the scope of paleoclimate research and discuss the current major challenges and perspectives. Two time periods serve as an example: the Holocene, including the Last Millennium, and the Last Glacial Maximum. Reviewing the existing literature reveals the benefits of regional paleo climate modeling, particularly over areas with complex terrain. However, this depends largely on the variable of interest, as the added value of regional modeling arises from a more realistic representation of physical processes and climate feedbacks compared to global climate models, and this affects different climate variables in various ways. In particular, hydrological processes have been shown to be better represented in regional models, and they can deliver more realistic meteorological data to drive ice sheet and glacier modeling. Thus, regional climate models provide a clear benefit to answer fundamental paleoclimate research questions and may be key to advance a meaningful joint interpretation of climate model and proxy data. © 2018 The Authors.

The spatial and vertical distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and black carbon (BC) were determined in 12 cores of recent (up to 20 cm long) sediments from the Gulf of Gdańsk in Poland, and Oslofjord/Drammensfjord in Norway. The Σ12PAHs levels in individual sediment layers varied from 250 to 4500 ng/g d.w. in the Gulf of Gdańsk, and from 210 to 4580 ng/g d.w. in the Norwegian fjords. Analysis of PAH ratios indicates that PAHs in both studied areas originated mainly from pyrogenic sources. The BC concentrations in sediments were up to 0.9% and were generally higher in the Gulf of Gdańsk (mean - 0.39%) than in Oslofjord/Drammensfjord (mean - 0.19%). The deposition history of anthropogenic emissions over the last 100 years was reconstructed based on the analysis of dated and well-laminated sediment cores from two stations from the Gulf of Gdańsk and two stations from the Norwegian fjords. The evolution in energy structure was especially evident in the Oslofjord, where transition from fossil fuel combustion to hydropower after 1960 coincided with a sharp decrease in sedimentary PAHs. Despite significant changes in the economic development in Poland, temporal patterns in PAH concentrations/profiles in the Gulf of Gdańsk were not as obvious. The historical PAH trends in the Gulf of Gdańsk may be related to the overwhelming PAH inputs from domestic combustion of solid fuels (coal, wood) for heating purposes. The implementation of legislation and other activities addressed to restrict the use of solid fuels in residential heating should reduce PAH emissions. © 2018","Atmospheric emission history; Black carbon; Gulf of Gdańsk; Oslofjord; PAH; Sediment","Carbon; Coal; Coal combustion; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Particulate emissions; Sedimentation; Sedimentology; Sediments; Wood fuels; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric emission; Black carbon; Combustion of solid fuels; Fossil fuel combustion; Oslofjord; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Vertical distributions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; black carbon; fossil fuel; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); electricity industry; industrial emission; marine sediment; PAH; pollutant source; sediment core; sediment pollution; vertical profile; Article; combustion; concentration (parameters); economic development; energy; energy transition; evolution; heating; hydropower; limit of detection; Norway; Poland; predictor variable; priority journal; sediment; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Drammensfjorden; Gulf of Gdansk; Norway; Oslofjorden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050456462

However, global warming and climate change have affected plant quality. As a result, technological greenhouses are replacing traditional tin houses as locations for mushroom planting. These greenhouses feature several complex parameters. If we can reduce the complexity such greenhouses and improve the efficiency of their production management using intelligent schemes, technological greenhouses could become the expert assistants of farmers. In this paper, the main goal of the developed system is to measure the mushroom size and to count the amount of mushrooms. According to the results of each measurement, the growth rate of the mushrooms can be estimated. The proposed system also records the data of the mushrooms and broadcasts them to the mobile phone of the farmer. This improves the effectiveness of the production management. The proposed system is based on the convolutional neural network of deep learning, which is used to localize the mushrooms in the image. A positioning correction method is also proposed to modify the localization result. The experiments show that the proposed system has a good performance concerning the image measurement of mushrooms. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image measurement; Mushroom cultivation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059946952

With ocean, sea ice, and cloud feedbacks included in a global aerosol-climate model, we show that BC emitted from the North China Plain can be transported to the oceans, which in turn changes cloud structure and land-sea thermal contrast. As a result, East Asian winter monsoon wind speeds decrease over the North China Plain. This decrease causes air stagnation that can further intensify haze. Our results suggest that in addition to the local BC-induced interactions between aerosol and the planetary boundary layer, BC can also amplify haze in the North China Plain by weakening East Asian winter monsoon through ocean, sea ice, and cloud feedbacks. It implies that reducing BC emissions could have significant indirect benefits for air quality in the North China Plain. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

Since orchard profitability can be affected by many factors, there is great disparity regarding the right planting density and training system for each condition. It is necessary to conduct long-term studies to find the best training system for each particular situation: cultivar, planting density, training system, climate, and economic conditions. A 2-hectare replicated field trial was planted in 1997 at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York, with 4 apple cultivars (‘Empire’ ‘Fuji’ ‘Gala’ and ‘McIntosh’), where we compared 8 tree planting densities (598, 840, 1026, 1283, 1655, 2243, 3262, and 5382 trees/ha), and two tree shapes (conic and V). The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic profitability of each combination of cultivar, planting density and tree shape. A secondary goal was to assess the effect of various economic factors on the profitability of each arrangement. After 20 years, Net Present Value (NPV) of ‘Gala’ planted at its optimum density and shape was over $100,000/ha, followed by ‘Empire’ with $77,000/ha, Fuji’ with $39,000/ha with ‘ and ‘McIntosh’ with $32,000/ha. Yield was one of the main factors affecting orchard profitability. A decrease in yield was predicted to be especially critical for profitability at densities greater than 2000 trees/ha. Fruit price was the other key variable that played a significant role in orchard profitability. High-density systems were more sensitive to fruit price than low-density systems. Break-even year to positive NPV (BYPNPV) was mostly driven by the balance between investment, yield and fruit price. For all the cultivars, the lowest (598 trees/ha) and the highest planting densities (5382 trees/ha) took the most years to be profitable. The high-density systems require substantially greater investments and thus have greater risk than moderate density systems. Taking into account NPV and BYPNPV, the best option for ‘Empire’ ‘McIntosh’ and ‘Gala’ was a conic shape and 2000, 2500 and 3000 trees/ha, respectively. The best option for ‘Fuji’ was a V shape at 1000 trees/ha. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Break-even year to cash flow; Empire; Fuji; Gala; Malus ×domestica; McIntosh; Net Present Value (NPV); Profitability","climate conditions; cost analysis; crop yield; cultivar; economic analysis; economic conditions; fruit; hybrid; orchard; profitability; tree planting; Geneva [Switzerland]; New York [United States]; Switzerland; United States; Malus x domestica; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047189715

To understand the nesting of energy and air pollution policies in Spain, it is necessary to highlight some attributes of energy policy-making. Spain has only been ready to assume abatement costs linked to the implementation of EC environmental directives on air pollution control where its interests have been taken into account and European funds have been available to co-finance the energy sector’s reconversion in order to make it more efficient.

These organisms perform anaerobic microbial processes such as methanogenesis, which can lead to methane emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate methane production and characterize the bacterial and archaeal communities found in HSSFs treating secondary urban wastewater during cold and warm seasons. The pilot system used in this study corresponds to four HSSFs, two planted with Phragmites australis (HSSF−Phr) and two planted with Schoenoplectus californicus (HSSF−Sch), the monitoring was carried out for 1335 days. Removal efficiencies for organic matter (biological and chemical oxygen demand) and total and volatile suspended solids were evaluated in each HSSF. Moreover, biomass from each HSSF was sampled during warm and cold season, and methane productions determined by Specific Methanogenic Activity assays(maximum) (SMAm). In the same samples, the quantification and identification of bacteria and archaea were performed. The results showed that the degradation of organic matter (53–67% BOD5 and 51–62% COD) and suspended solids (85–93%) was not influenced by seasonal conditions or plant species. Potential methane production from HSSF-Sch was between 20 and 51% higher than from HSSF-Phr. Moreover, potential methane production during warm season was 3.4–42% higher than during cold season. The quantification of microorganisms in HSSFs, determined greater development of bacteria (38%) and archaea (50–57%) during the warm season. In addition, the species Schoenoplectus californicus has a larger number of bacteria (4–48%) and archaea (34–43%) than Phragmites australis. The identification of microorganisms evidenced the sequences associated with bacteria belong mainly to Firmicutes (42%), Proteobacteria (33%) and Bacteroidetes (25%). The archaea were represented primarily by Methanosarcinales, specifically Methanosaeta (75%) and Methanosarcina (16%).

In this mode, a small quantity of jet-injection diesel fuel was used to ignite the premixed charge, which was prepared by the main pre-injection blended fuels of diesel and ethanol-gasoline. Experiments of JCCI mode combined with dual-direct injection strategy were conducted on a modified single-cylinder naturally aspirated diesel engine. Effects of jet-injection and pre-injection parameters on the combustion and emission characteristics were investigated in detail under four engine load conditions at the rated speed of 3000 r/min. Experimental results showed that the diesel fuel jet-injection could control the ignition timing and combustion phasing robustly at all the four engine load conditions. The combustion process was composed of two stages, the jet fuel spontaneous combustion stage and the pre-mixture combustion stage. Besides, sensitive analysis of the jet-injection and pre-injection parameters on the JCCI mode performance were also accomplished. Advancing the jet-injection timing could shorten the combustion duration and improve the indicated thermal efficiency (ITE), but along with an increase in the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, especially at higher engine loads. As the pre-injection energy ratio was upgraded, the local equivalence ratio and the diffusion-controlled combustion could be reduced, resulting in the reduction of soot emissions. Sensitivity interval was introduced to access the effects of pre-injection timing. Beyond this interval, the pre-injection timing showed insignificant effects on the combustion characteristics and emissions. With the increase of pre-injection pressure, more pre-injection fuels penetrated into the crevice and near liner regions, and the total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions were increased. Finally, the enhanced reactivity of pre-injection fuels was demonstrated to effectively reduce THC emissions at lower engine loads. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dual-direct injection; Emissions; Jet Controlled Compression Ignition (JCCI); Two-stage combustion","Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engine cylinders; Ethanol fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Preignition; Spontaneous combustion; Combustion characteristics; Compression ignition; Diffusion controlled; Emission characteristics; Indicated thermal efficiency; Injection parameters; Local equivalence ratio; Two stage combustion; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051758587

However, in water-limited temperate regions, the net biophysical effect of conversion from croplands to grasslands on regional climatic regulation remains poorly understood to date. To answer this concern, a modified land surface model (mEASS) and two different land use scenarios in a typical study area of the Loess Plateau of China were used in this study. We first validated the performances of mEASS model by using observations from six flux tower sites with different land cover and three metrics of the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the difference between the simulated and observed data (bias). Subsequently, the biophysical effect of conversion from croplands to grasslands was investigated. Results indicated that mEASS model could well capture the seasonal dynamics of net radiation and latent heat with high R2 and lower RMSE and bias at grassland, forest and cropland sites. In the context of semi-arid and semi-humid climatic conditions, conversion from croplands to grasslands caused the cooling effect (−0.3 W/m2) at the annual scale. Similar cooling effects were found in spring (−0.4 W/m2), autumn (−0.8 ± 0.1 W/m2) and winter (−0.9 ± 0.1 W/m2). The decreased latent heat (inducing warming effects) were completely offset by decreased net radiation (inducing cooling effects), which were responsible for the net cooling effects. However, a warming effect with 1.0 ± 0.1 W/m2 was observed in summer. This is because that magnitude of decreased latent heat is greater than that of decreased net radiation in summer. These findings will enrich our understanding for the biophysical effect of conversion from croplands to grasslands in water-limited temperate regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Land use change; Latent heat; Net radiation; Temperature regulation; Water-limited temperate regions","Biophysics; Land use; Latent heat; Mean square error; Vegetation; Coefficient of determination; Humid climatic conditions; Land use and land cover change; Land-use change; Loess plateau of chinas; Net radiation; Temperate regions; Temperature regulations; Radiation effects; agricultural land; cooling; grassland; land cover; land use change; latent heat flux; net radiation; seasonal variation; temperate environment; Article; autumn; biophysics; China; climate; cooling; cropland; forest; grassland; land use; priority journal; radiation; seasonal variation; semiarid climate; simulation; spring; summer; surface area; validation process; warming; winter; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051506262

In this paper, a cost-benefit analysis of the measures in place to reduce air pollutants [carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOX), fine particulate matter (PM2.5)] and greenhouse gases (GHGs) [carbon dioxide (CO2)] in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region by 2020 is conducted. Based on the design of five types of emission reduction scenarios and normalization of the emission reduction effect, the total costs and the cost-benefit of these reduction scenarios in the PRD region by 2020 are evaluated. Results show the scenario, which new cars bought after 2014 are all upgraded from China V emission standard to China VI emission standard and motorcycles are still China III emission standard (UES), has a significant effect with 717,690 tons of the air pollutants equivalent and 38,960 tons of the GHGs equivalent reduction, while the Eliminate Motorcycles (EM) scenario produces the worst emissions reduction result. Therefore the cost-benefit of the UES scenario is extremely high, and the unit cost of air pollutants and GHGs reductions is only 0.003 Renminbi/g (RMB/g), showing a win-win situation of emission reduction and cost savings. Although the total cost of the BPSevere scenario, giving priority to public transportation development to reduce the mobility for private cars and motorcycles, is the highest (197.47 billion RMB), it can effectively reduce 9925 tons of GHGs equivalent and bring significant climate benefits. Moreover, for any reduction scenarios, the cost-benefit cannot be improved by strengthening the control level. And the comparison of the unit reduction costs among four different sectors shows that the cost-benefits of reduction scenarios in the transportation sector are worse and more variable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-benefit analysis; Emission reduction measures; Pearl River Delta (PRD) region; Transportation sector","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Cost reduction; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Motorcycles; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Volatile organic compounds; Emission control measures; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Pearl River delta; Public transportation; Reduction measures; Transportation sector; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056161224

In this study, a methodological framework for assessing the carbon budget and its spatiotemporal changes from 2015 to 2017 inWuhan is proposed, which is able to monitor a large area. To estimate the carbon storage, a comprehensive coefficient model was adopted with carbon density factors and corresponding land cover types. Details regarding land cover were extracted from the Geographic National Census Data (GNCD), including forests, grasslands, croplands, and gardens. For the carbon emissions, an emission-factor model was first used and a spatialization operation was subsequently performed using the geographic location that was obtained from the GNCD. The carbon emissions that were identified in the study are from fossil-fuel consumption, industrial production processes, disposal of urban domestic refuse, and transportation. The final dynamic changes in the CECS, in addition to the net carbon emissions, were monitored and analyzed, yielding temporal and spatial maps with a high-precision at a small scale. The results showed that the carbon storage inWuhan declined by 2.70% over the three years, whereas the carbon emissions initially increased by 0.2%, and subsequently decreased by 3.1% over this period. The trend in the net carbon emission changes was similar to that of the carbon emissions, demonstrating that the efficiency of carbon reduction was improved during this period. Precise spatiotemporal results at the street-block level can offer insights to governments that are engaged in urban carbon cycle decision making processes, improving their capacities to more effectively manage the spatial distribution of CECS. © 2018 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Carbon storage; Geographic national census data; Spatial-temporal variation analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061112518

Identification of the major sources of VOCs from industrial parks has practical significance in emission reduction. In this study, the major species of VOCs from a residential area located downwind of a complex industrial park were sampled with Tenax absorption tubes and analyzed by thermal desorption coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). Receptor models of factor analysis with nonnegative constraints (FA-NNC) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) were employed to recognize the potential emission sources, which suggested an association with the production processes in the nearby industrial park. In order to validate the sources, the profiles of VOC emissions of related workshops under actual manufacturing processes were acquired. It was found that xylenes & amines, phenols and esters were the major species of VOCs for the workshops of foundry, refractory materials and printing, respectively. Similarity analysis indicated that the detected profiles of VOC emissions from the dominant industrial types had good correlations with the identified factors from receptor models. Source contributions to VOCs in the receptor region exhibited that foundry production was the primary contributor (56-64%), followed by refractory material production (22-26%) and printing (14-18%). This study provides a strategy for source apportionment of VOCs from a local complex industrial park, which is helpful in the development of targeted control strategies. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Amines; Chromatographic analysis; Emission control; Factor analysis; Factorization; Foundries; Refractory materials; Volatile organic compounds; Emission reduction; Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry; Manufacturing process; Positive Matrix Factorization; Production process; Similarity analysis; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Gas chromatography; amine; ester; phenol derivative; receptor; volatile organic compound; xylene; volatile organic compound; absorption; air pollution control; air sampling; Article; combustion; cross linking; decomposition; desorption; factor analysis; industrial area; mass fragmentography; method detection limit; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; residential area; water vapor; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; industrial waste; industry; wind; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Industrial Waste; Industry; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060391009

Aiming to assess the magnitude of CO2 emissions associated with freeway infrastructure construction activities and identify primary emissions sources in mountainous area, this study firstly assessed life cycle CO2 emissions of an entire freeway project in mountainous area in China, including pavement, bridge, tunnel, intersection, traffic safety facilities and temporary works into the system boundary. The results show that CO2 emissions related to road segment are one magnitude lower than that of bridge and tunnel. In addition, negligence of intersection, traffic safety facilities and temporary works could underestimate 4% of total CO2 emissions of the freeway project. CO2 emissions distribution of the different types of materials and equipment distribute as the similar Pareto Principle, which reminds that definition of system boundary could focus on the few of inputs that matter on the aspects of data limited, rough estimation and comprehensive understanding of environmental impact. Findings of this study could offer transport agencies more comprehensive references to understand the contribution of freeway infrastructure construction activities in the mountainous area to climate change, and provide decision makers insights to take measures in the planning phase, particularly in the construction phase in terms of equipment selection, construction design, and construction materials design. © 2018","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Freeway construction; Life cycle assessment; Mountainous area","Accident prevention; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Decision making; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Pareto principle; Phase change materials; Carbon dioxide emissions; Construction design; Equipment selection; Freeway construction; Infrastructure construction; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mountainous area; Transportation infrastructures; Bridges; concrete; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; life cycle analysis; mountain region; Article; carbon footprint; coal power; compressive strength; electric power plant; environmental impact; fly ash; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; recycling; traffic and transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053379891

Previous studies observed that, the ratios of mean emission in g/km from motorcycles and cars are very high, especially for HC in urban driving. The motorcycle industry is now faced with the pressure of emission regulation upgrade. In the present study, the possibility and degree of emission (especially for HC) reduction through lean burn were tried to be explored. In this paper, the HC emissions were studied by experimental measurements and combined simulations on a twin-spark motorcycle gasoline engine over a wide range condition. The appearance HC amount, detailed reaction pathway and intermediate products were thoroughly investigated, and the main interest is the influences of relative air/fuel ratio. The results illuminated that, the overall trend of engine-out HC amount decreases as relative air/fuel ratio becomes larger. For example, when λ changes from 0.85 to 1.2, at 100% engine load the HC amount drops, by ∼55% and ∼53% for 3000 rpm and 4000 rpm, respectively. Besides, the PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), soot and SOA (secondary organic aerosol) formation potentials were also analyzed in this paper. The results and analysis process indicated that, the combined simulation (between the GT-Power and ChemKin) is a useful tool to analyze the formation process of pollutants during combustion. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air/fuel ratio; Combustion; Gasoline engine; HC emission; Twin-spark","Combustion; Developing countries; Engines; Motorcycles; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Reaction intermediates; Air/fuel ratio; Combined simulation; Degree of emissions; Gasoline engines; HC emissions; Intermediate product; Motorcycle industry; Secondary organic aerosols; Gasoline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052148215

Fermentative l-threonine production from glucose has been achieved in Escherichia coli. However, there are still several limiting factors hindering further improvement of l-threonine productivity, such as the conflict between cell growth and production, byproduct accumulation, and insufficient availability of cofactors (adenosine triphosphate, NADH, and NADPH). Here, a metabolic modification strategy of two-stage carbon distribution and cofactor generation was proposed to address the above challenges in E. coli THRD, an l-threonine producing strain. The glycolytic fluxes towards tricarboxylic acid cycle were increased in growth stage through heterologous expression of pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and citrate synthase, leading to improved glucose utilization and growth performance. In the production stage, the carbon flux was redirected into l-threonine synthetic pathway via a synthetic genetic circuit. Meanwhile, to sustain the transaminase reaction for l-threonine production, we developed an l-glutamate and NADPH generation system through overexpression of glutamate dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, and pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase. This strategy not only exhibited 2.02- and 1.21-fold increase in l-threonine production in shake flask and bioreactor fermentation, respectively, but had potential to be applied in the production of many other desired oxaloacetate derivatives, especially those involving cofactor reactions. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","carbon distribution; cofactor generation; Escherichia coli; l-threonine; metabolic engineering","Adenosinetriphosphate; Aquaculture; Carbon; Escherichia coli; Glucose; Metabolic engineering; Metabolism; Nucleotides; Polypeptides; Carbon distribution; Cofactors; Glutamate dehydrogenase; Heterologous expression; l-threonine; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase; Tricarboxylic acid cycle; Amino acids; aspartate aminotransferase; aspartic acid; carbon; citrate synthase; formate dehydrogenase; glutamate dehydrogenase; glutamic acid; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) transhydrogenase; oxaloacetic acid derivative; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); pyruvate carboxylase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; threonine; carbon; glucose; threonine; aldol reaction; Article; bacterial strain; batch fermentation; cell density; citric acid cycle; controlled study; cytokine production; Escherichia coli; genetic code; glucose intake; glucose utilization; heterologous expression; metabolic engineering; mutagenesis; nonhuman; optical density; plasmid; promoter region; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; coenzyme; Escherichia coli; fermentation; genetics; metabolic flux analysis; metabolism; procedures; Carbon; Coenzymes; Escherichia coli; Fermentation; Glucose; Metabolic Engineering; Metabolic Flux Analysis; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Threonine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055487168

However, the results are mixed. Particularly, evidence is limited for Chinese pregnant women. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we matched the data of all pregnant women laboured in public hospitals during 2015–2016 in Yinchuan, a capital city of northwest China and the data of daily average PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) concentrations of the nearest monitor station. We calculated a time-dependent exposure over the entire pregnancy for each woman. We used a time varying Cox proportional hazards model to explore the association between PM2.5 exposure and the risk of congenital anomalies, after adjusting for individual confounders and other pollutants. Results: A total of 39,386 singleton live births were included in the study, and 530 (1.35%) were with congenital anomalies. An increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 exposure over the entire pregnancy was significantly associated with increased risk of congenital anomalies, with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.35 [95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.16, 1.58]. For subtype analyses, PM2.5 exposure exhibited a significant association with cardiac anomalies and other unclassifiable anomalies, with HRs of 1.60 (95%CI: 1.24, 2.08) and 1.42 (95%CI: 1.07, 1.89), respectively. The impacts of PM2.5 exposure on orofacial anomalies and musculoskeletal anomalies were not significant. Conclusion: Our results indicate high concentration of PM2.5 could increase the risk of congenital anomalies among Chinese, especially for cardiac anomalies. Self-protective measures involving reducing PM2.5 pollution exposure during pregnancy as well as environmental policies aiming to restrict PM2.5 emission could be helpful to reduce the burden of cognitional anomalies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cardiac anomalies; Congenital anomalies; PM2.5 exposure","Environmental protection; Hazards; Hospitals; Nitrogen oxides; Obstetrics; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Ambient particulate Matter; Cardiac anomalies; Confidence interval; Congenital anomalies; Cox proportional hazards models; Environmental policy; Nitrogen dioxides; PM2.5 exposure; Particles (particulate matter); nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; cohort analysis; concentration (composition); health risk; hospital sector; particulate matter; pollution exposure; population dynamics; pregnancy; adult; China; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); congenital malformation; disease association; environmental exposure; female; fetus malformation; fetus risk; gestation period; heart disease; human; live birth; major clinical study; male; maternal exposure; particulate matter; pollutant; population research; pregnancy; pregnant woman; priority journal; retrospective study; analysis; congenital disorder; cross-sectional study; maternal exposure; particulate matter; pregnancy; statistics and numerical data; China; Ningxia Huizu; Yinchuan; China; Congenital Abnormalities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056738681

At 300 K and 20 Pa, the saturated loading of benzene reaches 8.2 mmol/g, almost twice of (12,12) single-walled carbon nanotube with a similar pore size, and 93% of the benzene molecules in Mg-MOF-74 can desorb at 390 K. The energy analysis indicates that the van der Waals contribution still dominates 70-80% of the total fluid-wall interaction energy compared with the Coulombic contribution. We further analyzed the structure of benzene confined in Mg-MOF-74 by the molecular snapshots, pair correlation functions, orientational order parameters, and local density profiles. It is found that low temperature and high pressure make the structure of adsorbed benzene more similar to that of the liquid benzene. Moreover, the benzene molecules in the contact adsorption layer lie flat on the surface of adsorbent, whereas those molecules near the pore center have no particular orientations. Due to the existence of open metal sites, the structures of adsorbed benzene are more compact and ordered than those of bulk liquid benzene. Consequently, the self-diffusion coefficient of saturated benzene in Mg-MOF-74 at 300 K is significantly lower than that of bulk liquid benzene and confined liquid benzene in slit pores and disordered carbons by 4-5 orders of magnitude.

CISM is a parallel, 3-D thermomechanical model, written mainly in Fortran, that solves equations for the momentum balance and the thickness and temperature evolution of ice sheets. CISM's velocity solver incorporates a hierarchy of Stokes flow approximations, including shallow-shelf, depth-integrated higher order, and 3-D higher order. CISM also includes a suite of test cases, links to third-party solver libraries, and parameterizations of physical processes such as basal sliding, iceberg calving, and sub-ice-shelf melting. The model has been verified for standard test problems, including the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Higher-Order Models (ISMIP-HOM) experiments, and has participated in the initMIP-Greenland initialization experiment. In multimillennial simulations with modern climate forcing on a 4&thinsp;km grid, CISM reaches a steady state that is broadly consistent with observed flow patterns of the Greenland ice sheet. CISM has been integrated into version 2.0 of the Community Earth System Model, where it is being used for Greenland simulations under past, present, and future climates. The code is open-source with extensive documentation and remains under active development. © Author(s) 2019.",,"climate forcing; ice sheet; ice shelf; iceberg calving; melting; numerical model; steady-state equilibrium; Stokes formula; three-dimensional modeling; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060455069

However, motor vehicles powered by internal combustion engines directly emit harmful pollutants and climate-changing gases. New fuels and new automotive technologies offer the potential to simultaneously make motor vehicles much cleaner and more efficient by reducing tailpipe emissions and allowing the focus to be on the “upstream” emissions from fuels production. This can be accomplished through an increasing array of hybrid electric and pure electric vehicle types. This chapter reviews the current regulatory environment and vehicle technology status for improving fuel economy and reducing emissions from light-duty vehicles. The focus is on the United States, but the measures adopted in other countries are also reviewed briefly. Fluctuating oil prices have helped to create an uncertain future for alternative fuels and vehicles, but these continue to evolve rapidly creating a complex policy and technology interplay. Fuel economy standards and pollutant emissions standards have been important strategies for improving the energy and environmental performance of motor vehicles, but their cost-effectiveness has been debated. Incremental improvements to existing vehicle technologies have been responsible for many of the gains to date and additional improvements are likely over the next several decades. However, if substantially tougher energy and environmental performance is required in the future, motor vehicle technologies that break away from internal combustion of carbon fuels will be needed. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) appear to offer the most promising path forward, but existing PEVs face challenges in terms of cost, performance, and availability of support infrastructure. Electric-drive vehicles with zero-tailpipe emissions can either operate with electrochemical batteries, or batteries in conjunction with hydrogen fuel cells. Both are promising options, with differing advantages among different geographical settings and light/heavy vehicles types. A test program of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) focusing on driver reactions to the vehicles and fuel illustrates both the promise that new vehicle technologies may offer and the barriers new technologies will likely face. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

An improved control strategy based on health degree is established in terms of reducing the risk of cascading failures in coal-fired units (CFICFUs) in this paper. Firstly, health degree of generator (HDOG) is formulated to evaluate whether the load of coal-fired units need to be adjusted. On this basis, a mul-objective optimal model is proposed and the NSGA-II algorithm is used to calculate the Pareto solution set. Trend tracking of critical lines is used to find generators with a large utilization rate of line, whose outputs need to be adjusted to reduce the load rate of key lines which can prevent cascading failures. Therefore, this paper designs an improved control strategy combining prevention control and congestion control to ensure that the generator load in the fault state can be transmitted to other generators in time. Taken IEEE -39 system as an example to conduct simulation, the results show that the control strategy can effectively achieve the safe and reliable grid dispatching and avoid the occurrence of cascading failure in coal-fired units. © 2018 IEEE.","cascading failure; coal-fired unit; deteriorative degree; trend tracking","Coal; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Health; Health risks; Outages; Cascading failures; Coal fired units; Control strategies; deteriorative degree; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Improved controls; NSGA-II algorithm; Utilization rates; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061724993

However, restricted by its propagation loss and narrowband resonance in nature, it is a challenge for plasmonic material to provide a broadband DOS to advance its application. Here, we develop a novel nanoscale core-shell hyperbolic structure that possesses a remarkable coupling effect inside the multishell nanoscale composite owing to a higher DOS and a longer time of collective oscillations of the electrons than the plasmonic-based pure-metal nanoparticles. Subsequently, a giant localized electromagnetic wave of surface plasmon resonance is formed at the surface, causing pronounced out-coupling effect. Specifically, the nanoscale core-shell hyperbolic structure confines the energy well without being decayed, reducing the propagation loss and then achieving an unprecedented stimulated emission (random lasing action by dye molecule) with a record ultralow threshold (∼30 μJ/cm 2 ). Besides, owing to the radial symmetry of the nanoscale core-shell hyperbolic structure, the excitation of high wavevector modes and induced additional DOS are easily accessible. We believe that the nanoscale core-shell hyperbolic structure paves a way to enlarge the development of plasmonic-based applications, such as high optoelectronic conversion efficiency of solar cells, great power extraction of light-emitting diodes, wide spectra photodetectors, carrying the emitter inside the core part as quantitative fluorescence microscopy and bioluminescence imaging system for in vivo and in vitro research on human body. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","core-shell nanoparticles; hyperbolic structure; localized surface plasmon resonance; photonic density of states; random lasers","Core shell nanoparticles; Electromagnetic waves; Fluorescence microscopy; Metal nanoparticles; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Surface plasmon resonance; Bioluminescence imaging; Collective oscillations; Hyperbolic structures; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Photonic density of state; Quantitative fluorescence microscopy; Random lasers; Random lasing actions; Shells (structures)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059812366

A controlled case study was conducted in a test house to evaluate the model. The model-predicted evolving concentrations of benzyl butyl phthalate in indoor air and settled dust and on interior surfaces are in good agreement with measurements. Sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the effects of parameter uncertainties on model predictions. The model was then applied to a typical residential environment to investigate the fate of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and the factors that affect its transport. The predicted steady-state DEHP concentrations were 0.14 μg/m3 in indoor air and ranged from 80 to 46 000 μg/g in settled dust on various surfaces, which are generally consistent with the measurements of previous studies in homes in different countries. An increase in the mass concentration of indoor particles may significantly enhance DEHP emission and its concentrations in air and on surfaces, whereas increasing ventilation has only a limited effect in reducing DEHP in indoor air. The influence of cleaning activities on reducing DEHP concentration in indoor air and on interior surfaces was quantified, and the results showed that DEHP exposure can be reduced by frequent and effective cleaning activities and the removal of existing sources, though it may take a relatively long period of time for the levels to drop significantly. Finally, the model was adjusted to identify the relative contributions of gaseous sorption and particulate-bound deposition to the overall uptake of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) by indoor surfaces as functions of time and the octanol-air partition coefficient (Koa) of the chemical. Overall, the model clarifies the mechanisms that govern the emission of phthalates and the subsequent interactions among air, suspended particles, settled dust, and interior surfaces. This model can be easily extended to incorporate additional indoor source materials/products, sorption surfaces, particle sources, and room spaces. It can also be modified to predict the fate and transport of other SVOCs, such as phthalate-alternative plasticizers, flame retardants, and biocides, and serves to improve our understanding of human exposure to SVOCs in indoor environments. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Because of the complex interdependence of urban FEW systems, changing components of one system may lead to ripple effects on other systems. However, the inputs, intersectoral flows, stocks, and outputs of these FEW resources from the perspective of an integrated urban FEW system have not been synthetically characterized. Therefore, a standardized and specific accounting method to describe this system is needed to sustainably manage these FEW resources. Using the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) as a case, this study developed such an accounting method by using material and energy flow analysis to quantify this urban FEW nexus. Our results help identify key processes for improving FEW resource efficiencies of the DMA. These include (1) optimizing the dietary habits of households to improve phosphorus use efficiency, (2) improving effluent-disposal standards for nitrogen removal to reduce nitrogen emission levels, (3) promoting adequate fertilization, and (4) enhancing the maintenance of wastewater collection pipelines.

In this work, the synthesis of Co-based multi-metal borides nanochains with amorphous structure is reported for boosting the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) by one-pot NaBH4 reduction of Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ under ambient temperature. In all the investigated Co-based metal borides, NiCoFeB nanochains show the excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 46 mV dec-1, respectively, together with excellent catalytic stability, and robust HER performance with an overpotential of 345 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the excellent electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to optimal electronic structure by tuning the Co-3d band activities by the incorporation of Ni and Fe for enhanced water splitting via the potentially existed Co0 state. Moreover, the electrolyzer using NiCoFeB nanochains as anode and cathode offers 10 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.81 V, comparable to commercial Pt/C // Ir/C, providing a simple method to design and explore highly efficient and cheap bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For this study, thirteen plant species were investigated to quantify their capacity of PM accumulation under three atmospheric environments, that is, industrial, traffic and university campus (control), in Kunming City (Southwest China). The sampled sites represented different pollution levels (that is, high pollution, slight pollution and clean air, respectively). The plant species differed in their accumulation of PM by six- to eight-fold across the three sites. Magnolia grandiflora was the most efficient evergreen tree species, whereas Platanus acerifolia had the highest capture of PM among deciduous trees. The accumulation capacity of the same species varied with the degree of pollution. For example, Osmanthus fragrans, Loropetalum chinense and Cinnamomum japonicum were highly efficient for the capture of PM in the traffic and university campus areas; however, they exhibited medium accumulation in the industrial area. Prunus majestica demonstrated an intermediate accumulation capacity in the industrial area, but was low in the traffic and university campus areas. The capturing capacity of the same genus was also different among the different levels of pollution. For example, C. japonicum had a 2.9-4.2-times higher PM accumulation than did C. camphora across the three sites. There were significant differences in leaf surface area, stomata density/length, guard cell area, and trichome density/length among these species. The species-specific efficacy of PM capture was primarily contributed to by leaf size and surface roughness, stomata density, and trichome length. In particular, hairy-leaf leaves with medium stomatal density exhibited higher PM capture. Therefore, leaf micromorphology, leaf size and longevity appeared to be significant predictive factors for the accumulation of PM, which may aid in the selection of greening plant species for the remediation of pollutants in urban areas. © 2019 by the authors.

It is urgent to explore the urban traffic emission patterns for the low-carbon urban planning and traffic management. With this purpose, a new urban traffic emission analysis model is proposed in this paper. The traffic analysis zones (TAZs) are treated as the analysis unit. Then the spatial and temporal dynamic emission patterns are studied based on taxi GPS data in Beijing. The whole urban area of Beijing is divided into 33 TAZs depending on the feature of road networks. And the trip patterns of TAZs are extracted. The instantaneous emissions of CO2, NOx, VOC and PM within and between TAZs are estimated. The relationships between emissions and road densities are studied. The results demonstrated that (1) the highest taxi trips during the day occur at 10:00, 16:00 and 20:00. (2) The variations of the 4 pollutants within and between TAZs are similar. The emissions of TAZs with business centers, entertainment centers and transportation hubs are obviously higher than others. For TAZs within the 5th Ring Road, the northern emissions are stronger than the southern. Emission patterns can be divided into 3 types, corresponding to the time periods of 0:00–3:00, 3:00–6:00 and 6:00–24:00. (3) There is a positive relationship between emissions within and between TAZs and road densities. And when the road densities of TAZs are bigger than 0.6, emissions within TAZs will rise up obviously with the increasing road densities. The policy implications of results include the region function planning, traffic planning, the public transport improvement, optimal design of charging stations and new energy vehicles promotion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Data mining; Emission pattern; Traffic analysis zone","Data mining; Motor transportation; Pollution; Public policy; Taxicabs; Traffic control; Urban planning; Beijing; Emission pattern; Environmental problems; Low-carbon urban planning; New energy vehicles; Policy implications; Traffic analysis zones; Traffic-related air pollution; Roads and streets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054195908

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the highest and biggest plateau, and also one of the most sensitive areas to global warming in the world, which provides important shelters for a unique assemblage of species. Here, ecological niche-based model was employed to project the potential distributions of 59 key rare and endangered species under three climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Qinghai Province. I assessed the potential impacts of climate change on these key species (habitats, species richness and turnover) and effectiveness of nature reserves (NRs) in protecting these species. The results revealed that that climate change would shrink the geographic ranges of about a third studied species and expand the habitats for two thirds of these species, which would thus alter the conservation value of some local areas and conservation effectiveness of some NRs in Qinghai Province. Some regions require special attention as they are expected to experience significant changes in species turnover, species richness or newly colonized species in the future, including Haidong, Haibei and Haixi junctions, the southwestern Yushu, Qinghai Nuomuhong Provincial NR, Qinghai Qaidam and Haloxylon Forest NR. The Haidong and the eastern part of Haibei, are projected to have high species richness and conservation value in both current and future, but they are currently not protected, and thus require extra protection in the future. The results could provide the first basis on the high latitude region to formulate biodiversity conservation strategies on climate change adaptation. © 2018 The Authors.

In the process of consumer choice of green housing, residents’ psychological behaviors, product characteristics of green housing, and option framing methods all have an important influence on the willingness to pay (WTP). This paper analyzed WTP for green housing using two sets of experiments from the perspectives of consumer behavior theory and behavioral economics. Taking four cities with high levels of green housing development in China as examples to conduct large-scale empirical studies, we explored the impact of double-entry mental accounting on resident WTP for green housing. The results show that (1) each dimension of perceived benefits is significantly positively correlated with WTP, each dimension of perceived sacrifices is significantly negatively correlated with WTP, and the sensitivity coefficient of functional risk and policy risk is relatively large, i.e., WTP is more sensitive to functional risk and policy risk. (2) Double-entry mental accounting has a significant moderating effect between residents perceived value and WTP. The stronger the positive correlation between perceived benefits and the WTP when the larger pain of payment (large coefficient of pleasure attenuation or small coefficient of pain buffering) rather than smaller pain of payment meaning greater impact of perceived benefits on WTP. Negative correlation between perceived sacrifices and WTP is weak when residents have small coefficient of pleasure attenuation, indicating that the residents have higher psychological enjoyment when making consumption decisions. Hence, WTP is still high even in situations with higher perceived sacrifice. However, the coefficient of pain buffering has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between perceived sacrifices and WTP. (3) In the context of different framing effects, resident values mediate between perceived benefits and WTP, and the framing effect can influence resident WTP. Resident WTP for green housing is higher in the context of subtractive framing compared with additive framing.

We resolve the effect of meteorological variability on the ozone trends by using a multiple linear regression model. The residual of this regression shows increasing ozone trends of 1–3 ppbv a −1 in megacity clusters of eastern China that we attribute to changes in anthropogenic emissions. By contrast, ozone decreased in some areas of southern China. Anthropogenic NO x emissions in China are estimated to have decreased by 21% during 2013–2017, whereas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions changed little. Decreasing NO x would increase ozone under the VOC-limited conditions thought to prevail in urban China while decreasing ozone under rural NO x -limited conditions. However, simulations with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemical Transport Model (GEOS-Chem) indicate that a more important factor for ozone trends in the North China Plain is the ∼40% decrease of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) over the 2013–2017 period, slowing down the aerosol sink of hydroperoxy (HO 2 ) radicals and thus stimulating ozone production. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 311 patients with T1aN0M0 PTMC between January 2013 and September 2018. In all, 168 underwent microwave ablation (MWA), and 143 underwent surgery. MWA was performed using extensive ablation with hydrodissection. The surgery comprised thyroid lobectomy (TL) with unilateral central lymph node dissection (CND). We examined clinical outcomes during mean follow-up periods of 824 ± 452 days for the TL group and 753 ± 520 days for the MWA group. Results: Postprocedural follow-up revealed that, in the MWA group, the tumors had completely disappeared in 34 patients, and the remainder were reduced to necrotic or carbonized tissue. The incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism was significantly lower in the MWA group than in the TL group (p <.001). In addition, during the follow-up, we found no statistically significant differences between the two groups (TL vs MWA) for PTMC recurrence (1 vs 2 cases), lymph node metastasis (5 vs 5 cases), or disease-free survival [2001 days (5.5 years) vs 1702 days (4.7 years)] (p =.659, p =.795, and p =.974, respectively). Conclusions: If low-risk thyroid carcinoma (i.e., T1N0M0 PTMC) is accurately diagnosed early, MWA could be a minimally invasive alternative to surgery based on our short-term follow-up regarding recurrence and the low rates of complications and disease-free survival. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

So what are the current research hotspots in this field and the gaps that still need to be further studied in the future? This paper reviews the research in the field by a bibliometric analysis. The results show that the research in this field first focus on cost analysis, followed by project investment evaluation, project planning (cost curve and pipeline network), and project operation. In particular, fossil fuel power plants, pipeline transportation, and oil fields are the most crucial objects in the three technical links of CCS projects, respectively. Policies, carbon pricing, and uncertainty in cost and benefits are factors that are mainly discussed in this field. The methods used for CCS project planning are cost curve model and optimization model. The real option approach is suitable for the evaluation of investment decision-making. The evaluation of operational decision is mostly based on optimization model. The future research directions can be summarized as five points: (1) continuously and systematically update the calculated costs in the current research to the unified price of the latest year; (2) calculate the cost curve from the perspective of emission sources; (3) expand the planning region of pipeline network to the country, continent, and even the entire world; (4) pay more attention to the investment assessment of the CCS project that may be implemented with low cost and high return; and (5) analyze the optimal operation mode of CCS in the low-load power system. © 2018 by the authors.","Bibliometrics; CCS; Investment and operational decision-making; Project planning; Review","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Curve fitting; Decision making; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Investments; Oil fields; Optimization; Petroleum transportation; Pipelines; Reviews; Bibliometrics; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Future research directions; Investment decision making; Operational decision making; Optimal operation mode; Pipe-line transportations; Project planning; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060101979

However, the interactive effects of increases in temperature and water availability on winter wheat yield and GHG emissions in semi-arid climates are not well-understood. Here, we report on a two-year field experiment that examined the effects of a mean soil temperature increase of ~2 °C (at 5 cm depth) with and without additional irrigation on wheat yield and GHG emissions. Infrared heaters were placed above the crop canopy at a height of 1.8 m to simulate warming. Fluxes of CH 4 , CO 2 and N 2 O were measured using closed static chamber technique once per week during the wheat growing seasons. Warming decreased wheat yield by 28% in the relatively dry year of 2015, while supplemental irrigation nullified the warming effect completely. Warming did not alter the wheat yield significantly in the relatively wet year of 2016, but supplemental irrigation with no warming decreased the wheat yield by 25%. Warming increased CO 2 emissions by 28% and CH 4 uptake by 24% and tended to decrease N 2 O emissions. Supplemental irrigation increased N 2 O emissions but had little effect on CO 2 emissions and CH 4 uptake. Evidently, warming and supplemental irrigation had interactive effects on wheat yield, GHG emissions and GHG emissions intensity. Precision irrigation appears to be a means of simultaneously increasing wheat yield and reducing GHG emissions under warming conditions in semi-arid areas. © 2018","Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas intensity; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Warming; Wheat yield","Arid regions; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Irrigation; Global warming potential; Interactive effect; Precision irrigation; Static chamber technique; Supplemental irrigation; Warming; Wheat yield; Winter wheat yields; Greenhouse gases; methane; crop yield; global warming; greenhouse gas; irrigation system; semiarid region; soil temperature; temperature effect; wheat; Article; canopy; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; field experiment; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; priority journal; semiarid climate; soil respiration; soil temperature; soil water content; winter wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050501018

The exposure to air pollutants, especially PM2.5, is highly correlated to various adverse health impacts. However, few studies focused on the impact of heating emissions on the environment and health in China. This study aims to address the above-mentioned issues in North China by selecting 62 typical cities with different pollution levels and heating energy consumption as study objects. The heating environment index and PM2.5 concentration were used to show the environmental impact of heating emissions. With respect to the health aspect, eight health endpoints, including the all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, lung cancer mortality, chronic bronchitis, cardiovascular diseases, asthma attacks, and acute bronchitis, were evaluated. The results show that the air quality index considering heating emissions is 118.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 111.5 to 125.2], while that without heating emissions is only 74.3 (95% CI: 68.6 to 79.9). The heating environment index is 0.64 (95% CI: 0.60 to 0.68). The proportion of polluted cities (i.e., with an air quality index larger than 100) is 77.42% considering heating emissions, while it is only 17.74% without considering heating emissions. The average PM2.5 concentration during the heating season in the study region is 75.3 μg/m3 (95% CI: 68.2 to 82.5) and 47.7 μg/m3 (95% CI: 42.6 to 52.7) with and without considering heating emissions, respectively. In terms of the health impact, the total number of premature deaths attributable to heating emissions in the studied cities is 51154, accounting for 0.18‰ of the total population. The analysis shows that heating emissions are the major cause of the health endpoints during the heating season in most cities in North China. This study helps to confirm the quantitative environment and health impacts caused by heating emissions to timely reduce the damage to the human health of residents in North China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Environmental impact; Health impact; Heating emission; North China","Air pollution; Air quality; Diseases; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Air quality indices; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiovascular mortality; Health impact; Heating energy consumption; Lung cancer mortality; North China; PM2.5 concentration; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056158697

In this review, we discuss the operating mechanisms of a few widely-used GIs in the aspect of stormwater management. We critically examine policies for promoting GI implementation in some countries, including the sponge city in China and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia, and review the effectiveness of GI on treating stormwater quantity in real world applications. In addition, we also used Bibliometrics to analyze the GI research trends and found GI has been popular in an increasing number of countries and regions, which China has the greatest future growth potential in GIs research. Moreover, many barriers impeding the further development of GI and strategies to overcome these barriers are also summarized.

We evaluated three Plantower PMS A003 sensors when exposed to eight particulate matter (PM) sources (i.e., incense, oleic acid, NaCl, talcum powder, cooking emissions, and monodispersed polystyrene latex spheres under controlled laboratory conditions and also residential air and ambient outdoor air in Baltimore, MD). The PM 2.5 sensors exhibited a high degree of precision and R 2 values greater than 0.86 for all sources, but the accuracy ranged from 13 to &gt;90% compared with reference instruments. The sensors were most accurate for PM with diameters below 1 μm, and they poorly measured PM in the 2.5-5 μm range.

Technologies linking waste-management with renewable energy have been supported within an ecomodernist framework of market incentives for stimulating private-sector investment in new waste treatment technologies. Under pressure of EU targets, the UK's policy measures have had several aims: to reduce landfill disposal, increase resource recycling or reuse, expand waste-based renewable energy and thus reduce GHG emissions. As techno-market-fixes, new facilities were meant to convert waste for more beneficial uses, bring it up the hierarchy and localise its management. Consequent tensions can be illuminated by linking concepts of technology scaling and socio-material metamorphosis with critical perspectives on ecomodernism. Although the ecomodernist framework stimulated some waste-management improvements, other outcomes contradict the policy objectives of localising and converting waste for more beneficial uses. These contrary outcomes are illustrated by two technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) and mechanical and biological treatment (MBT), each with multiple possible spatial scalings and techno-configurations. Financial instruments have most incentivised the easiest socio-material metamorphosis for lucrative returns, especially to produce energy (electricity or gas) for grid systems, suiting large operators. For more environmentally beneficial uses of waste, there have been difficulties in overcoming its recalcitrance for producing commercially viable outputs, e.g. digestate replacing chemical fertilisers, compost improving soil and ‘dirty’ plastics replacing virgin plastics. Techno-configurations and material flows have been scaled towards global goods, distant from the feedstock source. Through the ecomodernist framework, the state's responsibility for such outcomes has been blurred with the private sector and shifted to anonymous markets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion (AD); Ecological modernisation (EM); Mechanical and biological treatment (MBT); Socio-material metamorphosis; Technology scaling; UK waste treatment","European Union; landfill; pollution policy; private sector; targeting; waste management; waste technology; waste treatment; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057853178

Opportunity costs assess the cost of foregone opportunity when preserving the forest instead of investing in an alternative activity or resource use. This paper questions the calculation method of opportunity costs using averaged economic benefits and co-benefits of different land-use transitions. We propose a nested approach to land-use transitions at the interface between landscapes and livelihoods and assessing a wide range of potential socio-ecological costs and benefits. Combining household surveys and focus groups with participatory mapping, we applied the approach in villages of Laos, Vietnam and China positioned along a broad transition trajectory from subsistence shifting cultivation to intensive commercial agriculture. By looking beyond the economics of land use, we highlight important linkages between land-use changes and livelihood differentiation, vulnerability and inequalities.

As such, regulations enacted by the Indonesian Government state a legal obligation for mining companies to carry out reclamation on post coal mining site. Reclamation is an activity carried out to organize, restore and improve of environmental quality after mining operations to enhance the highly disturbed ecosystem of mined land into ecologically usable state. Yet, there is little body of knowledge on how to monitor the effectiveness of reclamation in improving environmental quality of ex-mining land. Aims of this study are to evaluate of the growth of native tree species planted on various types of reclamation sites in a mining concession in East Kalimantan, and to analyze the most influencing factor of their growth. Growth parameters measured in this research were plant height, stem diameter and branch-free stem height of the planted species. Micro-climatic factors and diversity of understorey plants were also measured as environmental parameters. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) analysis was conducted using PAST 4.0. statistical program. The results shows that reclamation area of post coal mining in the study site which is most suitable for local plant species, especially Shorea balangeran, has a sloping terrain. PCA shows that factor having maximum influence on growth of planted species on the reclamation site is pH of soil. The higher is the soil pH (i.e. less acid), the better is the species growth because the soil conditions in the post-coal mining area tend to be acidic. This research suggests that in post coal mining reclamation using native trees two key factors to enhance growth performance of planted species are sloping terrain so as water is not inundated and soil pH so as it is not too acid. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

This methane oxidation metabolism could have been performed using oxidants such as dioxygen, sulfate, nitrite/nitrate, and/or Fe3+- and Mn4+-minerals. Acetogenesis using acetyl-CoA metabolism may produce similar 13C-depletions. We investigated δ13C and S/C values of OM in 2.72 Ga old lacustrine stromatolites of the Tumbiana Formation (Australia) using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), coupled with X-ray spectroscopy. Type-A OM is embedded in quartz and/or chlorite. We show that mixtures of chlorite bias negatively the δ13Corg of associated OM measured by SIMS, likely through recombination of hydrogen from chlorite with carbon from OM during analysis. Type-A OM, associated with quartz or interleaved with chlorites (but remote enough to avoid H-recombination), displays δ13Corg between −56.1 and −50.6‰ VPDB (mean: −53.5‰ SD ± 1.8‰). The intimate association of Type-A OM with Fe-rich chlorite and its main occurrence in pyritic layers coupled with 13C-depletions is most parsimoniously interpreted as anaerobic methanotrophy using Fe3+-minerals and/or oxidized S. Type-B OM comprises &lt;2-µm organic globules embedded in calcite. A mass balance correction using the δ13C values measured on Type-B globules mixed with calcite and those measured on pure calcite yielded corrected δ13C∗org values for the globules ranging between −65.2 and −52.5‰ (mean −58.8‰ SD ± 3.6‰). In a context where Fe and S reduction could outcompete acetogenesis for a fraction of any available H2, these extremely low δ13Corg values are difficult to explain with chemoautotrophic acetogenesis. Atomic S/C ratios in Type-B globules reach up to 0.042, i.e. up to tenfold the values (0.003–0.004) in Type A-OM. These organic S concentrations, combined with the extremely low δ13C∗org values, support anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfur oxidation. Finally, Type-C OM, interpreted as migrated pyrobitumen nodules, displays δ13Corg of −48 to −39.1‰. The most extreme low-δ13Corg values of the Precambrian are thus best interpreted as the result of lacustrine methanotrophy fueled by oxidized S and/or Fe species, which likely derived from oxygenic and/or anoxygenic photosynthesis. Photosynthesis, followed by methanogenesis and methanotrophy may have been important in lakes at a time of supercontinent growth and eruption of large subaerial igneous provinces. In this context, anaerobic methanotrophy could have played a part in regulating atmospheric methane. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon isotopes; Early life; Methanotrophy; Organic matter; SIMS; Stromatolites; Sulfurization; Tumbiana formation","carbon isotope; mass spectrometry; methane; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; organic matter; organic sulfur compound; oxidation; stromatolite; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055913417

An expanded set of urban sustainability goals also includes increasing carbon sequestration, songbird habitat, reducing urban heat island effects, and improvement of landscape aesthetics. GI is conceptualized to improve water and ecosystem quality by reducing storm water runoff at the source, but when properly designed, may also benefit these expanded goals. With the increasing use of GI in urban contexts, there is an emerging need to facilitate participatory design and scenario evaluation to enable better communication between GI designers and groups impacted by these designs. Major barriers to this type of public participation is the complexity of both parameterizing, operating, visualizing and interpreting results of complex ecohydrological models at various watershed scales that are sufficient to address diverse ecosystem service goals. This paper demonstrates a set of workflows to facilitate rapid and repeatable creation of GI landscape designs which are incorporated into complex models using web applications and services.

In contrast, the target for the share of renewable energy sources in electricity consumption-even though increased to 27%-will not be binding anymore for Member States beyond 2020. This is in line with many existing assessments which demonstrate that additional RES policies impair the cost-effectiveness of addressing a single CO 2 externality, and should therefore be abolished. Our analysis explores to what extent this reasoning holds in a second-best setting with multiple externalities related to fossil and nuclear power generation and policy constraints. In this context, an additional RES policy may help to address externalities for which first-best policy responses are not available. In addition, we also argue that an unambiguous, “objective” economic assessment is impossible because (i) policies may have a multiplicity of impacts, (ii) the size of these impacts is subject to uncertainties and (iii) their valuation is contingent on individual preferences.

The numerical weather modeling community has undertaken considerable efforts to accurately forecast these dust emissions. Here, for the first time in the literature, we thoroughly describe and document the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) dust emission scheme for the Georgia Institute of Technology-Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) aerosol model within the Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) and compare it to the other dust emission schemes available in WRF-Chem. The AFWA dust emission scheme addresses some shortcomings experienced by the earlier GOCART-WRF scheme. Improved model physics are designed to better handle emission of fine dust particles by representing saltation bombardment. WRF-Chem model performance with the AFWA scheme is evaluated against observations of dust emission in southwest Asia and compared to emissions predicted by the other schemes built into the WRF-Chem GOCART model. Results highlight the relative strengths of the available schemes, indicate the reasons for disagreement, and demonstrate the need for improved soil source data. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

Experimental treatments represent the variation in green-up and timing of peak grazing intensity that currently exists in the system. Delayed grazing resulted in greater net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP), while early grazing reduced CO2 uptake with the potential of causing net ecosystem carbon (C) loss in late spring and early summer. Conversely, advancing the growing season only influenced ecosystem respiration (ER), resulting in a small increase in ER with no concomitant impact on GPP or NEE. The experimental treatment that represents the most likely future, with green-up advancing more rapidly than arrival of migratory geese, results in NEE changing by 1.2 µmol m−2 s−1 toward a greater CO2 sink in spring and summer. Increased sink strength, however, may be mitigated by early arrival of migratory geese, which would reduce CO2 uptake. Importantly, while the direct effect of climate warming on phenology of green-up has a minimal influence on NEE, the indirect effect of climate warming manifest through changes in the timing of peak grazing can have a significant impact on C balance in northern coastal wetlands. Furthermore, processes influencing the timing of goose migration in the winter range can significantly influence ecosystem function in summer habitats. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Arctic; ecosystem respiration; greenhouse gas emission; herbivory; net ecosystem exchange; Pacific black brant; phenological mismatch; subarctic","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; herbivory; migratory species; net ecosystem exchange; phenology; respiration; waterfowl; Alaska; United States; Anser; Aves; carbon dioxide; Alaska; animal; carbon cycle; climate change; goose; herbivory; metabolism; physiology; population migration; season; Alaska; Animal Migration; Animals; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Geese; Herbivory; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056770609

The target region is the Chungju Basin in Korea, which is characterized by complex geographical features. The analysis focuses on runoff simulations driven by raw outputs and bias-corrected outputs from the HadGEM2-AO and RegCM4, which are used to generate national standard climate change scenarios throughout the Korean Peninsula. Statistical methods, such as linear scaling and quantile mapping, improve the performance in precipitation simulations and effectively correct the systematic biases seen with the climatological means of the HadGEM2-AO and RegCM4. Although there is no relevant difference between the bias-corrected HadGEM2-AO and RegCM4 in terms of long-term averaged climatology, the bias-corrected RegCM4 performs better in capturing the dominant mode of runoff variability and hydrological extremes (e.g., floods measured by 1-day maximum runoff and droughts measured by the standardized runoff index). Because the magnitude of the bias correction factor tends to influence the preservation of future change signals derived from raw and bias-corrected outputs, the HadGEM2-AO, which requires a large bias correction factor to compensate for poor performance, produces future changes in high flows with low coherence between the raw and bias-corrected projections. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","dynamical downscaling; hydrological response to climate change; statistical bias correction","Climate models; Runoff; Climate change scenarios; Dynamical downscaling; Geographical features; Global climate model; Hydrological extremes; Hydrological response; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Statistical bias; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; correction; downscaling; extreme event; global climate; hydrological response; precipitation (climatology); Chungju Lake; North Chungcheong; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052808844

The digital engineering workflow presented in this paper integrates the kinetics &amp; SRM Engine Suite with parameter estimation techniques applicable to the simulation of particle formation and dynamics in gasoline direct injection (GDI) spark ignition (SI) engines. The evolution of the particle population characteristics at engine-out and through the sampling system is investigated. The particle population balance model is extended beyond soot to include sulphates and soluble organic fractions (SOF). This particle model is coupled with the gas phase chemistry precursors and is solved using a sectional method. The combustion chamber is divided into a wall zone and a bulk zone and the fuel impingement on the cylinder wall is simulated. The wall zone is responsible for resolving the distribution of equivalence ratios near the wall, a factor that is essential to account for the formation of soot in GDI SI engines. In this work, a stochastic reactor model (SRM) is calibrated to a single-cylinder test engine operated at 12 steady state load-speed operating points. First, the flame propagation model is calibrated using the experimental in-cylinder pressure profiles. Then, the population balance model parameters are calibrated based on the experimental data for particle size distributions from the same operating conditions. Good agreement was obtained for the in-cylinder pressure profiles and gas phase emissions such as NOx. The MGA also employs a reactor network approach to align with the particle sampling measurements procedure, and the influence of dilution ratios and temperature on the PN measurement is investigated. Lastly, the MGA and the measurements procedure are applied to size-resolved chemical characterisation of the emitted particles. © 2019 SAE International.

Existing estimation methods of road GHG emissions have various limitations, such as low accuracy or the ability to only estimate GHG emissions within a limited area. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a methodology to estimate GHG emissions while considering various geometric designs of roads, including both vertical and horizontal alignment. The developed method is more objective and reliable than existing methodologies that consider only vertical alignment. First, Lamm's theory on travel speed profiles was applied to predict GHG emissions. Then, this study attempted to overcome the limited spatial estimation capacity of existing methods by considering upstream and downstream geometric design parameters simultaneously. Second, this study used the GHG operation mode extracted from the MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), a modeling system that estimates emissions for mobile sources at the national, county, and project levels for criteria air pollutants, GHGs, and air toxicity. The operation mode includes vehicle type, fuel, and other factors, and is designed to estimate GHG emissions at 1-s intervals. Based on the results of the analysis, the effectiveness of the new method was compared to existing methods using an economic analysis (e.g., cost–benefits from the reduced emissions). This study presents a method for performing sensitive estimations of GHG emissions according to the geometric design of roads, which can be used to collect more accurate data on GHG emissions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Acceleration and deceleration profiles; geometric design of roads; greenhouse gas emissions; running speed; speed profile","Economic analysis; Estimation; Gas emissions; Geometry; Highway planning; Roads and streets; Acceleration and deceleration; Criteria air pollutants; Geometric design; Geometric design parameters; Horizontal alignment; Motor vehicle emissions; Running speed; Speed profile; Greenhouse gases; acceleration; carbon emission; design; estimation method; geometry; greenhouse gas; road; velocity profile; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042945723

The current study objective was to estimate CO emission factors from commercially available roasted whole bean and ground coffee measured in loose form, not packaged, and to assess the utility of CO monitoring in nonventilated storage spaces such as within coffee roasting and packaging facilities, transport vessels, and cafés. Determinants affecting CO emissions from coffee were investigated, including form (whole bean vs. ground), roast level (light, medium, medium-dark, dark), and age (time since the package was opened). CO emission factors were estimated for roasted coffee samples from a variety of manufacturers purchased from local grocery stores and online. Emission tests were performed on 36 brands of coffee, some with more than one sample per brand and with various roast levels. Decaying source equations or smoothing functions were fitted to the CO concentration measurements. Maximum observed emission factors at the peak of the predicted concentration curve were adjusted by the time required to reach the maximum CO concentration and reported as emission factors (EFbuildup). Ground coffee had a significantly increased EFbuildup (P &lt; 0.0001) compared with whole bean. Roast level did not significantly affect emissions for whole bean (P = 0.72) but did for ground (P &lt; 0.001) coffee. For ground coffee, medium-dark and dark roasts had significantly higher emissions than medium and light roasts. Worst-case emission factors from commercially available whole bean and ground coffee measured in loose form, not packaged, showed that roasted coffee can rapidly emit CO. CO concentrations should be monitored in storage spaces in service and manufacturing facilities as well as transport vessels to ensure exposures do not exceed occupational exposure limits. Storage spaces may need to be ventilated to control CO concentrations to safe levels. Implications: Emission rates of carbon monoxide (CO) from roasted coffee showed that unventilated or underventilated storage spaces should be monitored and ventilated, if necessary, to control CO concentrations to safe levels. © 2019, © This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

We found that highly bonding social capital, often forged through more familiar relationships, reduces organizational interactions and the potential for efficient knowledge mobilization. Specifically, results show deficiencies in information delivery (inconsistent lexicon) and support systems (knowledge sharing, partnerships, and resources), situations known to hinder climate change action. Despite ambivalence toward changing the current system, experts expressed (a) undertones of displeasure in how the system operates, and (b) a clear desire for more institutionalized action and mandates at various institutional scales. A predominance of bonding social capital can preclude participation from outside actors resulting in the exclusion of innovations needed to advance climate response. Therefore, we propose incremental shifts to existing social capital as a means to achieve transformations, arguing that a synergy of horizontal and vertical networks could increase efficiencies in information processes, strengthen collaborations, and enhance governance to confront climate change in this context. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate models; Bonding social capitals; Climate response; Information delivery; Information process; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational interactions; Social capitals; Support systems; Climate change; civil society; climate change; governance approach; government; knowledge; social capital; National Capital Region; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059596292

An understanding of the impacts of climate change on this resource is crucial for sustainable water management in this region. The objectives of this paper was to summarize the state of knowledge about possible climate change impacts on groundwater dynamics in Eastern Canada, thus providing a clearer understanding of future conditions. Twenty-two studies are reviewed including Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, to identify the impacts on groundwater recharge and river baseflows. The studies disagree in their estimates of changes in future recharge conditions, and no trend from West to East was revealed. This could be due to the use of different modelling approaches (model type, climate change scenario, future horizon). Nonetheless, more inter-annual variability during the summer and earlier snowmelt periods causing seasonal shifts in the recharge cycle are expected. The studies show that base flows could decrease, which could induce critical conditions for water supplies and for ecosystems. This review provided new insights that lead to the following recommendations for future studies: 1) use a variety of climate models and emission scenarios; 2) promote the use of integrated models when possible; 3) study long-term climate change impacts on groundwater resources at different scales; 4) simulate the combined effects of climate change and other pressures; and 5) develop models that cover other regions of Eastern Canada as dictated by stakeholders and water managers. © 2018, © 2018 Canadian Water Resources Association.","climate change; Eastern Canada; Groundwater; model","Climate models; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Models; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Eastern Canada; Ground water recharge; Groundwater dynamics; Interannual variability; Prince edward islands; Sustainable water management; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061291072

There is a history behind it, as urban nature has for long been conceptualised as the ‘background’, on top of which buildings and technical infrastructure (the ‘form’) are located. Urban nature has had its role, though, but mainly through the functional meaning of recreation or the ecological meaning or nature conservation. The more recent concepts of green (or green-blue) infrastructure and ecosystem services attack these traditional dichotomies from two directions: Seeing the urban green as an elemental part of urban infrastructure suggests an equal value compared to the technical infrastructure. On the other hand, the ecosystem services that the green-blue infrastructure produces (such as storm water management, cleaning of the air, regulating micro-climate and – of course – providing opportunities for recreation and thus wellbeing of urban residents) can be seen as parallel to the more traditional services of the welfare state, such as schools or health care. However, there is still a clear gap between the relevant knowledge of the academics and the tacit understanding of planners, who have difficulties in incorporating the new conceptual framework into their daily practice. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Simin Davoudi, Richard Cowell, Iain White and Hilda Blanco.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075315227

The synchronous presence of EN3, a shift to higher 87Sr/86Sr and decrease of Mn and Fe contents and δ15N values together points to a glacial influence whereby oxygenation and remineralization of reduced carbon produced 13C-depleted DIC. Glaciations cause a drop in sea level, which itself leads to increased continental shelf area to be exposed to surface weathering, and ultimately to enhanced delivery of radiogenic 87Sr. The increase of 87Sr/86Sr ratios, sulfate and phosphate are consequences of surface runoff into oceanic environments and such perturbations induce biogeochemical changes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Doushantuo Formation; Ediacaran chemostratigraphy; Ediacaran glaciation; Open marine environment; South China; δ13C-δ18O-87Sr/86Sr-δ15N","carbon isotope; chemostratigraphy; dissolved organic carbon; Ediacaran; glaciation; marine environment; strontium isotope; China; Doushantuo Basin; Guizhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056601067

The Cornell Climate Smart Farming Program, an interdisciplinary program of the Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions (CICSS), has developed a website and suite of climate-based agricultural decision support tools aimed at helping farmers make more informed decisions in the face of increasing climate uncertainty. Specific tools were developed based on the major climate impacts to Northeastern US agriculture and through a collaborative development process with stakeholders, researchers, and the Northeast Regional Climate Center. Through this process, CICSS performed a review of decision tools on a national and international scale, and in this text the role and impact of decision support tools are examined, along with the ability of researchers and tool developers to learn from stakeholders and share information via extension specialists.

In London, the Clean Air Act of 1956 marked a successful milestone in the history of air pollution abatement in the UK. In Beijing, various policies have been introduced but air qualities in China have not been improved substantially. By examining the effectiveness of respective pollution control regulations/policies in a broader socioeconomic context, policy implications on respective jurisdictions are drawn. For effective implementation of air pollution control policies at the local level, it would be good for China to move beyond simply introducing stringent policies and regulations at the central or the provincial level.

This paper combines insights from energy IPE, political geography, new institutionalism and socio-technical transitions to build a conceptual framework for analysing local sustainable energy policymaking in relation to a broad range of influencing factors. It explores the ways in which policy and material aspects of energy systems inter-relate; considers ways in which ideas, contestation and learning are fundamental to change; and understands local governments as actors in their own right rather than ‘takers’ of global or national rules. This approach recognises specific influences of embedded institutions and infrastructures over local policymaking, but also allows us to better comprehend the implications of political and energy re-scalings for their capacity to govern and to influence political debates at national and global levels. It concludes with a plea for IPE to take better account both of sector specifics as well as of the local scale. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Data of childhood hospital admissions for asthma in patients aged 0–18 years and air quality in eight regions for the period 2001–2012 in Taiwan were collected. Poisson generalized linear regression analysis was employed to identify the relative risks of hospitalization due to asthma in children associated with exposure to varying levels of air pollutants with a change in the interquartile range after adjusting for temperature and relative humidity. Particulate matter ≤2.5 µm (PM 2.5 ), particulate matter ≤10 µm (PM 10 ), ozone (O 3 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), were positively associated with childhood asthma hospitalization, while O 3 was negatively associated with childhood asthma hospitalization. SO 2 was identified as the most significant risk factor. The relative risks for asthma hospitalization associated with air pollutants were higher among children aged 0–5 years than aged 6–18 years and were higher among males than females. The effects of air pollution on childhood asthma were greater in the higher-level air pollution regions, while no association was observed in the lower-level air pollution regions. These findings may prove important for policymakers involved in implementing policies to reduce air pollution. © 2019 by the authors.

Since climate-induced impacts such as changes in regional temperature and precipitation will influence crop yields, this study accommodates the estimated yield changes and subsequently develops a two-stage stochastic programming with recourse model to investigate the economic and environmental effects of biofuel production. The results indicate that the utilization of sweet potato, along with its by-products, can result in the maximum amount of ethanol production. At higher levels of gasoline and greenhouse gas (GHG) prices, 441.2 million liters of ethanol can be produced, of which 70 million liters come from utilization of by-products. In general, economic factors such as gasoline and GHG prices have larger impacts on biofuel production than yield changes. However, although biofuel production is relative stable in the face of crop yield change, a shift in cultivars and land-use pattern is likely to occur. We show that the net emission reduction is relatively low compared to Taiwan's total emission and the aggregate value of emission reduction merits more investigation.

These issues can be dealt with through waste-to energy (WTE) technologies, encompassing thermal and nonthermal methods, such as incineration, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, gasification, fermentation, etc., catering to a sustainable future. These approaches to recovery of waste are gaining wide interest among waste management sectors, inhabitants, and authorities because of their dual benefits of energy generation and waste reduction, limiting emissions and avoiding the use of land for landfill with a creation of wealth from waste rather than burying it. Municipal solid waste is generated to no limit from human activities, which poses useful forage for WTE facilities performing a diverse set of processes and accounting for energy security in an affordable and sustainable way. The thermochemical process that extracts both energy and chemical value from waste is pyrolysis, heating and decomposing the waste material in the absence of oxygen at high temperature, resulting in hydrocarbon oils, gases, and char as a fuel source. Anaerobic digestion involves the breakdown of biomass with the aid of microorganisms, devoid of oxygen, yielding biogas, which is later used for domestic purposes or can be combusted to generate electricity and heat. Another thermal method is gasification, resulting in syngas or a product that can be converted into liquid fuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The model predicted that till recently (i.e., year 2018) the hydropower reservoirs found under medium risk (i.e., 109 &lt; CO 2 ≤ 628 and 3 &lt; CH 4 ≤ 45 mg·m −2 ·d −1 ) which will reduce slowly over a period of 100 years. Out of 12 hydropower reservoirs studied, TGR presently under high risk of CH 4 (i.e., 47 mg·m −2 ·d −1 ) and medium CO 2 risk. Therefore, assessment is required to know the magnitude of CH 4 and its effect on regional climate so that mitigation measures could be taken in advance. The carbon emissions as CO 2 eq of the studied reservoirs are found as 134.69 ± 225.23 Gg yr −1 , with a large share from CH 4 emission. The associated life cycle GHG emissions are also estimated as 0.06 ± 0.09 gCO 2 eq·kWh −1 , which is higher than the global estimates (i.e. 0.015 gCO 2 eq·kWh −1 ). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Emission; GRAT; Greenhouse gas; Reservoir; Risk","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Hydroelectric power; Life cycle; Neutron emission; Reservoirs (water); Risk assessment; Risks; Electricity generation; GRAT; Hydro-power development; Hydropower reservoirs; Life-cycle GHG emissions; Long-term prediction; Mitigation measures; Risk assessment tool; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power plant; life cycle analysis; prediction; regional climate; risk assessment; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; China; climate change; gas field; Gas Risk Assessment Tool; greenhouse gas; hydropower; life cycle assessment; prediction; priority journal; risk assessment; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050496948

Exhaust after treatment systems such as Lean NOx Trap and selective catalytic reduction can provide effective reduction of Engine out NOx emissions. From the moment of engine start, these systems require reliable signal input of the NOx sensor. The efficient use of such DeNOx systems demands earliest possible activation of the upstream NOx sensor. However, attainment of the sensor dew point delays reliable measurements. Data collected from the emission test cycles, WLTC and NEDC indicates the unavailability of NOx sensor from the beginning of the test cycle. Hence, requirement of a NOx model is inevitable to estimate NOx emissions till sensor reaches its dew point. The scope of this paper is to elucidate the calibration process through which a robust estimation of the NOx emissions can be made in different engine modes along with varying ambient conditions. The NOx model is capable of estimating the real time NOx emission using a map based approach taking in to account multiple factors such as coolant temperature, ambient air temperature and pressure. Initially, a set of reference maps is generated for the required engine modes by performing mappings at the dynamometer. With state of the art climatic dynamometers, calibration tools and techniques, it is possible to introduce a robust calibration of the model which the De NOx system can rely upon. This paper contains data collected from measurements at emission, non-emission dynamometers, cold and hot temperature test trips, altitude test trips. The validated NOx model presented in this paper is able to predict real time NOx emission with a deviation of less than 5%. © 2019 SAE International.

Considerable transformation of Russian agriculture has led to structural changes in the agricultural land use, including arable farming. About forty million hectares of former arable land have been abandoned and converted into the category of abandoned lands subjected to overgrowing with meadow and woody vegetation. The restoration of natural vegetation in postagrogenic ecosystems is accompanied by changes in the biological productivity and composition of vegetation on agricultural land in general. The reduction of plowlands and their transformation to abandoned lands have changed the carbon budget. In the early 1990s, arable farming was the net source of C-CO2. At present, the total arable land area in Russia is estimated at approximately 80 M ha. This area is a source of about 20 Mt C-CO2/yr. Forty million hectares of former arable land have turned into the sink of C-CO2 of about 40 Mt/yr in size. Thus, the entire agricultural land in Russia functions as the net sink for atmospheric CO2 at the rate of 20 Tg C/yr. This fact can be considered a contribution of Russian agriculture to the goals of the “soil 4 per mille” international program assuming carbon sequestration in agricultural soils. Changes in the agricultural land use patterns together with a sharp decrease in the application of all kinds of fertilizers have led to prevalent biogeochemical flux of nutrients (N, P, K) from arable soils to urbanized areas. The deficient nutrient budget implies that the soil-climatic potential and the potentials of other factors increasing farming productivity (new varieties, plant-protective chemicals, etc.) are not fully realized in agricultural production. In 25 years (1992–2016), the uptake of nutrients by crops from arable land comprised 91, 33, and 90 Mt for N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively. The amount of applied fertilizers in that period was only about 28 Mt for N, 10 Mt for P2O5, and 28 Mt for K2O. The highly deficient budget of phosphorus is of special concern. Under these conditions, it is necessary to significantly restrict the export of apatite concentrate and phosphate fertilizers as strategic (nonrenewable) resources necessary for ensuring the food security of Russia for decades ahead. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","biogeochemical fluxes; carbon; nitrogen; nutritional degradation of soils; phosphorus; potassium budget; sinks and sources of carbon dioxide","abandoned land; arable farming; biogeochemistry; carbon sink; degradation; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; soil nutrient; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065699688

One approach is to proxy willingness to pay by measuring either the added cost to society from increased air pollution, or equivalently the reduced costs associated with air quality improvement."" A second technique infers willing-ness to pay for better air quality from an analysis of the housing market, on the presumption that individuals will pay more for a unit located in an area with good air quality than for an otherwise identical unit located in an area with poor air quality.This paper investigates the methodological problems associated with the housing market approach. While several studies have used this methodology to estimate the demand for air quality improvements, they have paid little attention to the sensitivity of the resultsto the assumptions embedded in the procedures. Using data for the Boston housing market, we generate quantitative estimates of the willingness to pay for air quality improvements and test the sensitivity of these results to alternative specifications of the basic building blocks in the procedure. Our data base is superior to others because it contains a large number of neighborhood variables (necessary to isolate the independent influence of air pollution) and more reliable air pollution data. © Joseph Herriges and Catherine L.

Acidification of mountain waters leads to problems in water quality with impacts to drinking water supply and biodiversity conservation. Effects of the land use policy, air pollution and forest canopy on acidification of headwater catchments in the Jizera Mountains were studied in the period of 1982–2015. The archive of LANDSAT imagery and a field inventory was used to reconstruct changes in the vegetative cover. The atmospheric deposition of acidic substances (sulphate, nitrate, and ammonia) in studied catchments was approximated by a spatial interpolation. The acid atmospheric load culminated in the 1980s. The Helsinki protocol on the reduction of sulphur emissions lead to a reduced open field deposition of sulphur, but, the atmospheric deposition of sulphur and nitrogen is also controlled by the vegetative canopy. A drop in the acid load and a recovery of surface waters from acidification were observed with the harvest of spruce forests. The existing land use policy, institutes of ‘protected headwater area’ and ‘zones of hygienic protection’ (Water Act 138/1973) were ineffective in this situation. In a catchment scale, the proposed scenario of structured forestry zones (respecting riparian buffers, stability of steep slopes, significant fog drip areas, peat spots) can decrease the annual load of sulphur and nitrogen by approx. 30%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acid atmospheric deposition; Forestry practices; Land use policy; Mountain watershed","acid deposition; acidification; catchment; forestry; headwater; land use; Landsat; policy approach; satellite imagery; water quality; Finland; Helsinki; Jizera Mountains; Sudetes; Varsinais-Suomi; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055627143

Similar tests are planned in other regions of the world, such as the upcoming China 6a/6b standards, further tightening emission limits, and also the introduction of RDE tests. Both restrictions pose challenging engineering tasks for upcoming vehicles. RDE certification tests feature significantly more demanding engine operating conditions and thus, emit more pollutants by orders of magnitude compared to known cycles like NEDC. Here, especially the reduction of NOx is a specific technical challenge, as it needs to compromise also with reduction targets on carbon dioxide. The fulfilment of both emission limits requires a widening of the focus from an isolated engine or exhaust aftertreatment view to a system engineering view involving all hardware and software domains of the vehicle. The investigation of RDE by means of simulation enormously increases the complexity of standard vehicle performance and fuel consumption models. The transient nature of real driving specifically requires transient models of the entire powertrain, including engine, cooling and driveline. Additionally, a comprehensive exhaust gas aftertreatment model is key. It needs to comply with the requirements of various types of catalysts and particulate filters (DOC, SCR; DPF, SDPF, LNT, ...) in a highly flexible manner. Transient driving also requires appropriate controls (i.e. air path control, fuel path control, exhaust gas control) that either can be tackled by software models of the xCU or by linking the model to a hardware xCU on a Hardware in the Loop (HiL) bench. The latter approach additionally challenges the numerical solution procedure of the virtual vehicle model as hard real-time constrains need to be fulfilled. This work presents a real-time capable vehicle modelling framework for office and HiL based simulation in the concept phase. Based on a use-case of a diesel engine powered passenger car, all essential modelling areas (engine, combustion, pollutant formation, exhaust gas aftertreatment, ...) are discussed in detail and verification simulations of selected component models are presented. The base parameterization of the model including a simplifying control strategy makes it suitable for the simulation of engine outlet and tailpipe emissions in the concept phase. A variation matrix of key design and operation parameters (catalyst sizing and arrangement, i.e. injection timings, ...) is defined and drive-cycle simulations are performed for a list of randomly assembled, though RDE compliant, driving maneuvers. Key performance indicators such as emissions and fuel consumption are compared in their overall number and also in their distribution over the engine operating map. The HiL compliance of the model is presented by time measurements of an open loop model on an RT node. © 2019 SAE International.

The aim of this study was to perform an air quality comparison between an urban site (Radvanice), which has a nearby metallurgical complex, and a suburban site (Plesná) to estimate air pollution sources and determine their local and/or regional origins. Twenty-four hour PM 1 and PM 10 (particular matter) concentrations, detailed mass size distributions (MSDs) to distinguish the sources of the fine and coarse PM, and their chemical compositions were investigated in parallel at both sites during the winter of 2014. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to the PM 1 and PM 10 chemical compositions to investigate their sources. During the measurement campaign, prevailing northeastern-southwestern (NE-SW) wind directions (WDs) were recorded. Higher average PM 10 concentration was measured in Radvanice than in Plesná, whereas PM 1 concentrations were similar at both sites. A source apportionment analysis revealed six and five sources for PM 10 and PM 1 , respectively. In Radvanice, the amount of PM and the most chemical species were similar under SW and NE WD conditions. The dominant sources were industrial (43% for PM 10 and 27% for PM 1 ), which were caused by a large metallurgical complex located to the SW, and biomass burning (25% for PM 10 and 36% for PM 1 ). In Plesná, the concentrations of PM and all species significantly increased under NE WD conditions. Secondary inorganic aerosols were dominant, with the highest contributions deriving from the NE WD. Therefore, regional pollution transport from the industrial sector in Silesian Province (Poland) was evident. Biomass burning contributed 22% and 24% to PM 10 and PM 1 , respectively. The air quality in Ostrava was influenced by local sources and regional pollution transport. The issue of poor air quality in this region is complex. Therefore, international cooperation from both states (the Czech Republic and Poland) is needed to achieve a reduction in air pollution levels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chemical size distribution; Industrial site; Inter-site comparison; PM 10; PM 1; Positive matrix factorization","aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; concentration (composition); emission; European Union; industrial location; international cooperation; particulate matter; pollutant transport; size distribution; source apportionment; urban pollution; Czech Republic; Kralovehradecky; Moravskoslezsky; Ostrava; Poland [Central Europe]; Radvanice; air pollution; analysis; city; Czech Republic; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; Poland; wind; Air Pollution; Cities; Czech Republic; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Poland; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056847110

Variants with regeneration and different cogeneration systems were considered. In the paper, we propose a new modification of a gas turbine cycle with the combustion chamber at the turbine outlet. A special air by-pass system of the combustor was applied and, in this way, the efficiency of the turbine cycle was increased by a few points. The proposed cycle equipped with a regenerator can provide higher efficiency than a classical gas turbine cycle with a regenerator. The best arrangements of combined air-steam cycles achieved very high values for overall cycle efficiency-that is, higher than 60%. An increase in efficiency to such degree would decrease fuel consumption, contribute to the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions, and strengthen the sustainability of the region served by the power plant. This increase in efficiency might also contribute to the economic resilience of the area. © 2018 by the authors.","Efficiency; Energy systems; Modified cycle concepts; Sustainability; Thermodynamic cycle concepts","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combustion; energy efficiency; power plant; sustainability; thermodynamics; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060282428

The primary objective of this study is to examine the viability of large heat pumps in existing district heating systems. The study uses three types of systems to simulate how increasing the share of heat pump production influences district heating systems when optimized for the lowest production costs. The second objective of this study is to understand the district heating companies’ perspective on increasing amounts of heat pumps in their systems. Based on the simulations, the largest potential for heat pumps is in small district heating systems, where they reduce the use of fossil fuels. In medium and large systems with economical combined heat and power production, the potential of heat pumps is smaller.

The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model in the form of Unrestricted Error Correction Model was computed. The outcomes of preliminary tests proved the presence of low multicollinearity, cross-section dependence, the unit roots in the variables, and the fixed effects in the model. In addition, cointegration was found between the variables, the Dynamic Fixed Effect estimator was appropriate, and the panel was homogeneous. The specification tests pointed to the presence of cross-section dependence, serial correlation in the panel-data model, and the existence of heteroskedasticity. The results of impacts (short run), elasticities (long run) of ARDL model showed that the fiscal/financial incentive policies for renewable energy are not able to reduce CO2 emissions in the short run, while in the long run the policies do reduce emissions. Moreover the economic growth of Latin American countries and the consumption of fossil fuels increases CO2 emissions in the short run and long run, while the consumption of renewable energy reduces them in the short run and long run. The impact of variables in the short run and long run and the Error Correction Model are statistically significant at the 1% and 5% level. Moreover the robustness test proved that the ARDL model is robust even in the presence of shocks. This study confirmed the hypothesis that renewable energy fiscal/financial incentive policies decrease CO2 emissions.

Globalization has increased the economic interconnection of nations, increasing the flow of goods, capital, people, and pollution across international borders. Policies to sustain and improve environmental health in some areas have successfully grown in ambition and scope, but international structures to effectively regulate the negative environmental health consequences of globalization have not yet been developed. Many global-scale environmental health challenges exist, most notably the task of rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions in time to avert the most damaging impacts of climate change, which can be cast as the ultimate globalized environmental health crisis. Some high-emitting nations have refused to provide leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, driven largely by concerns about costs to local economies. By neglecting the costs of long-term environmental health damages and minimizing the planetary scale of the climate change problem, meaningful progress toward a “global commons” sensibility has been delayed. To move toward sustaining human and ecosystem health, societies must include short- and long-term environmental health costs into economic valuations of globalization activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

As EV adoption in the United States continues to rise, the roles that governmental entities, electric utilities, and market actors will play in deploying the EV charging stations necessary to support transportation electrification remains a central question. This question raises a multitude of issues relating to consumer demand for EVs, competitive markets, utility rate design, government mandates and incentives, policies to reduce carbon emission and other air pollutants, and equity concerns. This Article focuses specifically on state public utility commissions, which will review and approve electric utility proposals to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in EV charging infrastructure that would be paid for, in most cases, by utility customers through cost-of-service ratemaking. This Article considers how state approaches on this issue may differ, at least in the short term, depending on varying state environmental policies, politics, geography, and utility regulatory structure. One constant among the states, however, is the range of rulemaking, investigatory, and adjudicative processes available to state utility commissions to consider these proposed utility investments. This Article concludes that public utility commissions in each state should focus on using their investigative and adjudicative authority to create a robust administrative record for EV charging-related decisions-both general rulemaking decisions and individual utility proposal decisions. These investigative and adjudicative proceedings can support decisions today regarding short-term utility pilot programs, as well as form the basis for broader, far-reaching policies to govern development in the long term. Notably, there are good reasons for state utility commissions to be central players in this process. State commissions, acting in their adjudicative capacity, can be more nimble than state legislatures, allowing for experimentation over different utility rate proceedings, serving an information gathering function for subsequent legislative action and commission rulemaking, and facilitating early investment in EV charging, where appropriate. © 2018 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Despite these efforts and other interests in efficient exploitation of natural resources, Lake Victoria is one of the most dangerous waterways in the world. Each year, around 5,000 people lose their lives on the lake due to navigation accidents. The purpose of this study is to analyze the perceptions of the stakeholders about climate change, meteorological services, causes of accidents, and cultural, social, and economic barriers that lead to lack of safety of navigation on Lake Victoria. The study uses anecdotal interviews with a convenience sample of five participants and surveys research with a convenience sample of 316 respondents from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.

Recent developments in emerging technologies, ranging from mechanical energy storage to electrochemical batteries and thermal storage, play an important role for the deployment of low-carbon electricity options, such as solar photovoltaic and wind electricity. This chapter details the types of technological learning models to evaluate the experience rates (ERs) for key grid-scale storage technologies, including lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries, pumped hydro storage, and electrolysis and fuel cells. It updates the state of the literature to determine learning rates of these and other grid-scale storage technologies. We discuss methodological issues in determining ERs for grid-scale storage systems, which often provide multiple applications and services on the grid. In addition, the chapter highlights future outlooks and new areas for research, including topics related to learning-by-doing, learning-by-searching, and manufacturing localization to derive further insights. Rapid cost reductions in lithium-ion batteries have the potential to disrupt electricity and transportation sectors, creating further complementarities and innovation cycles. More rigorous data collection for grid-scale storage systems on cost indicators that incorporate multiple services and applications provided by storage, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from storage options, and materials availability of emerging battery chemistries could inform better policies to enable low-carbon power systems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is limited information on the impact of climate change on local rice production in developing countries, especially at the local level. To this end, we aimed to clarify this impact on the yield of local rice in Indonesia in the next 25 years, using a crop growth model, MATCRO-Rice, in three provinces including North Sumatra, East Java, and Bali. Climate change was predicted to reduce the yield primarily because of increase in air temperature. Furthermore, the simulated yield reductions were different among the districts in each province, indicating the importance of regional adaptation priorities. We discussed several adaptation strategies with local stakeholders in each province from the viewpoints of feasibility and priority. Some strategies, such as change in cultivars to have high tolerance to high air temperature, which was ranked as being highly feasible and high priority, are expected to be future adaptation options. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079092284

Policy mechanisms to reduce emissions are required to reach environmental quality goals. Projecting the drivers (e.g., technical, economic, societal, regulatory) that will impact future emissions is challenging, and assessing regional air quality (AQ) is complicated by the need for detailed modeling tools and data inputs to simulate chemistry and transport of pollutants. This work assesses the contribution of emissions from transportation sources to ground-level concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter via two methods. First, impacts are quantified for three U.S. regions including California using output from an economic optimization model to grow a base year emissions inventory to 2055. Second, impacts are considered for California using state-level projections with an updated emissions inventory and modeling suite in 2035. For both, advanced AQ models are used, showing that the impacts of light duty vehicles are moderate, reflecting shifts to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. In contrast, heavy duty vehicles, ships, and off-road equipment are associated with important ozone and PM2.5 burdens. Emissions from petroleum fuel production and distribution activities also have notable impacts on ozone and PM2.5.

Such aberrations and their adverse effect on agriculture cannot be overruled in the years to come, rather it is expected to increase in future, which necessitates the need to understand their impact on crop productivity so that viable management options can be explored to sustain crop productivity and food security in future. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important staple food for about 150 million people worldwide, especially in east and south Asia, the middle east, Latin America and the West Indies. It is a tropical crop and is thus adapted to warm and humid conditions. Tropical and sub-tropical areas are at, a greater risk as the prevailing temperatures are already on higher side in these areas and the crops are therefore exposed to warmer limits. Thus, in warm areas of the world, future global warming may result in substantial yield decrease because of the sensitivity of flowering and seed set to high temperatures and the possibility of water shortage that may result from increased evapotranspiration. Warming conditions may lead to reduction in crop duration and increase in respiratory losses, thus decreasing net photosynthesis and crop productivity. Although increase in CO 2 levels lead to positive growth response, this effect is nullified due to increase in temperature. Increase in CO 2 concentration can counterbalance the effect of increase in temperature by 1–2 o C but further warming will have negative impact on rice productivity even under elevated CO 2 levels. To overcome the adverse effects of climate change on rice productivity, agronomic management practices like cultivation system, irrigation management and fertilizer management etc. can play a significant role either by leading to reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission or by reduction of climate change impact on rice productivity. In addition to this, various breeding techniques like screening for stress tolerance, conventional breeding techniques as well as molecular and biotechnological strategies need to be incorporated for developing varieties tolerant to various stresses. © 2019 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

To quickly warm up SCR catalysts, considerable efforts have been made in integrating SCR onto a diesel particulate filter, so called SDPF. With the fact that the real driving emission test has taken effect, SDPF coupled with LNT might be one of most viable solutions to meet stringent emission regulations. However, desulfation process for LNT may result in a severe deactivation of SDPF in downstream. Here, we investigated the tolerance of Cu/zeolite SCR catalysts against periodic lean/rich operation condition simulating desulfation over LNT in front of SDPF. The lean/rich aging at 620 °C has led a severe deterioration of NOx conversion over Cu/SSZ-13 hydrothermally aged 800 °C, especially in high-temperature region above 400 °C. The accelerated NH3 oxidation to NO was the primary cause for the poor NOx removal activity, originated from the alteration of Cu state. Cu ions turned out to be converted to CuOx cluster upon their exposure to rich condition, which could partly be re-dispersed as Cu2+ ion after the post-treatment at 700 °C under lean condition. Cu/SSZ-13 with low Cu content revealed better activity maintenance under the high-temperature rich condition compared to higher Cu loading counterpart. Cu/LTA recently developed showed superior tolerance against rich feed due to less reducible nature of Cu+ ion therein compared to that in Cu/SSZ-13 leading to less CuOx formation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cu/LTA; Cu/SSZ-13; Desulfation; LNT; NH3/SCR; SDPF","Ammonia; Catalysts; Copper; Deterioration; Heavy ions; Metabolism; Nitrogen oxides; Urea; Deactivation mechanism; Desulfation; Diesel particulate filters; Emission regulation; NH3/SCR; Operation conditions; SDPF; Selective catalytic reduction of NOx; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055985724

This study aimed to understand the relationship between species richness and range-size distribution in relation to environmental factors. The present study tested the following: (1) altitudinal Rapoport's rule, and a subsequent test on climatic and ambient energy hypotheses, (2) non-directional rescue effect, and a subsequent test on effect of environmental factors associated with the distribution of narrowest to widest-range species. Altitudinal species range-size distribution increased with increasing altitude and showed a negative relationship with climatic variables. These results support the altitudinal Rapoport's rule and climatic hypothesis; however, they do not fully support the ambient energy hypothesis. Results from testing the non-directional rescue effect showed that the inflow intensity of species from both directions (high and low elevations) affected species richness. And we found that the species with intermediate range-size, rather than narrowest or widest range-size were the main cause of a mid-peak of species richness and the non-directional rescue effect. Additionally, the richness of species with intermediate range-size was highly related to minimum temperature, habitat heterogeneity, or primary productivity. Although altitudinal range-size distribution results were similar to the phenomenon of altitudinal Rapoport's rule, the mid-peak pattern of species richness could not be explained by the underlying mechanism of Rapoport's-rescue effect; however, the non-directional rescue effect could explain a mid-peak pattern of species richness along altitudinal gradient.

This study looks at foreign aid as a carrier of global climate policy and examines donor behaviour in the energy sector. By examining donor behaviour when giving energy aid, one can grasp how the donor community helps recipients achieve a sustainable energy transition. A panel of donor–recipient pairs, covering 29 donors and 99 recipients, was constructed for the period between 1996 and 2013, using data from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Creditor Reporting System (OECD CRS), International Energy Agency (IEA) and World Development Indicators (WDI). The pair-year panel data were empirically analysed using a two-part model to test whether energy aid donors respond to recipients’ needs with regard to renewable energy and residential electricity. The findings demonstrate that donors respond to recipients’ sustainable energy needs, both renewable and residential, when selecting recipients. Moreover, donors tend to increase the amount of aid based on renewable energy needs. The findings also highlight the significant role of international climate policy, as donors have changed their energy aid-giving patterns since the start of the Kyoto Protocol. Contrary to the common belief in the aid-giving literature, this study shows that, with regard to energy aid, donor interests are more weakly related to recipient selection than are recipient needs. Key policy insights Donors are influenced by the residential energy needs of recipients when giving energy aid, which aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals.

Herein, we develop multiple-heteroatom-doped carbons (from single- to triple-doped) by pyrolysis of polyimide precursors using a facile in situ approach. This approach can be used to tune heteroatom compositions by controlling the desired polyimide monomer functional groups as well as introducing external doping sources into the polyimide precursor solutions. Various types of multiple-heteroatom-doped carbons such as N; N,S-; N,F-; N,S,B-; and N,F,B-doped carbons are synthesized. Among these synthesized multiple-heteroatom-doped carbons, the specific capacitance of N,F,B triple-doped carbon exhibits 350.3 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor device using the N,F,B-doped carbon with poly(vinyl alcohol)-1 M H 2 SO 4 gel electrolyte demonstrates a volumetric energy density of 0.58 mW h cm -3 .

While projected to experience the largest global urban transition with significant infrastructure investment in the next few decades, the welfare of Indian cities remains poor, which complicates the implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This paper traces, synthesizes and characterizes the emerging literature on Indian urban climate debates. It discusses the arc of urban climate efforts, from an initial emphasis on climate vulnerabilities and risks, broadening over time to include climate mitigation. The paper examines the governance forms and political motivations with which such actions are pursued in cities and finds three overarching characteristics: the use of local development priorities as an entry point to climate mitigation and adaptation; the role of nonstate actors in promoting climate-relevant outcomes; and the proclivity for discrete project-based activities. The paper suggests that while a range of Indian cities are beginning to consider climate concerns, a larger strategic understanding of the interaction between climate and development priorities, across policy and governance levels, is yet to be developed. The future trajectory of urban India's responses to climate change will be shaped by the institutional prioritising, linking and integrating of urgent local development and mitigation and adaptation goals.

Ten years of wind data (speed and direction) are analyzed using the WAsP software to obtain the annual wind characteristics A, k, V and P which take the values, respectively, 6.3 m/s, 1.83, 5.65 m/s and 224Wm 2 . The wind speed at 10m above ground level is mapped to find the windiest areas, and 2MW wind turbines from different technologies are erected to find the one that produces the highest Annual Energy (AEP). Finally, it is proposed, by using the HOMER software, to study the economic impact on the cost of kWh and Net Present Cost (NPC), due to the addition of a wind farm composed of V902MW wind turbines to a system totally dependent on the electrical grid. The environmental impact of harmful gas emissions is also evaluated. The obtained results show that the optimal configuration to satisfy a demand of 431 MWh/d over a 40 MW capacity grid is a farm of 05 wind turbines, with a cost per kWh and an NPC respectively of 0.32 and 643537920 and renewable fraction (RF) of 23%. On another hand, the environmental impact is characterized by a reduction in CO2, SO2 and NOx emissions of 23%. The sensitivity analysis showed that the optimal system depends mainly on the wind speed. © 2018 IEEE.","Economic; environmental; grid; HOMER; WAsP; wind resource","Arsenic compounds; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; environmental; grid; HOMER; WAsP; Wind resources; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062297285

The SI engine must be optimized, and preferentially downsized, to reduce tailpipe CO2 and other emissions. However, drives to increase BMEP (Brake Mean Effective Pressure) and compression ratio/thermal efficiency increase propensities of knocking (auto-ignition of residual unburnt charge before the propagating flame reaches it) in downsized engines. Currently, knock is mitigated by retarding the ignition timing, but this has several limitations. Another option identified in the last decade (following trials of similar technology in aircraft combustion engines) is water injection, which suppresses knocking largely by reducing local in-cylinder mixture temperatures due to its latent heat of vaporization. Addition of adequate water can lead to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio engine operation, and hence both reduction in fuel consumption and full utilization of a three-way catalytic converter (TWC). Further information about effects of various water injection parameters is required. Thus, in this study, a 4-stroke, 1.5 liter, 3-cylinder turbocharged engine with direct fuel injection and port water injection was operated on 91, 95 and 98 RON gasoline fuel to assess effects of water injection on knock mitigation, combustion phasing, required air:fuel ratios and exhaust gas temperature control.

The ‘adaptation’ approach is currently considered the most effective available solution for balancing out these effects. As a result, many researchers are trying to find out how to increase the adaptive capacity of individuals and communities in response to the effects of climate change. The effect of place attachment as a factor which connects human societies to the surrounding environment is undeniable. In this regard, the present study attempts to analyse the role of place attachment in increasing the tolerance of individuals who are in direct contact with the effects of climate change in the conceptual framework of subjective adaptive capacity and migration based on a subjective approach while taking into account the meaningful elements of place. Famenin County in western Iran has experienced severe drought resulting from climate change during the past decade, and farming, which was once the main source of income for the inhabitants, has almost been crippled in the county. Therefore, Famenin was chosen as a suitable case for study. In order to examine the conceptual model of the study, 200 questionnaires were distributed among the inhabitants of the county who have not yet migrated. The model was run using the Amos 23.0 software. The results of data analysis indicate that the inhabitants’ climate change impact perception has occurred through their attachment to the surrounding environment, which has led to a notable increase in their subjective adaptive capacity and has discouraged migration. It can be proposed that a balance exits between subjective adaptive capacity and climate change impact perception in which the place attachment factor can tilt the balance in favour of more adaptation and less migration. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change perception; drought; Iran; migration; place attachment; subjective adaptive capacity","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; community response; drought; fitness; migration; nature-society relations; perception; sense of place; software; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029902366

In the winter of March 2015 unseasonal rainfall and hailstorms damaged standing crops in most of the North Indian states. Based on a survey of over 800 farmers in 12 affected districts of the states of Haryana and Punjab, we study the effectiveness of government compensations, crop insurance, and relaxation in norms of wheat procurement in mitigating the impact of crop loss. We find that compensation for crop loss and crop insurance were of limited help to the farmers. Our strong recommendation is that, for these ex-post measures to work effectively we must address problems in accurate loss assessment. The study also indicates that improved drainage in fields and weather forecasting could also help. In fact, the survey revealed that around 20-30% farmers were able to reduce their losses in at least one plot. Though the role of disaster-relief measures cannot be underestimated in coping with such contingencies, reliance on them can be minimized by making farmers’ fields resilient to sudden weather aberrations. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Climate change; Climate smart; Crop insurance; Disaster management; Vulnerability; Weather forecasting",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085450923

The overall efficiency of photo-reduction of CO2 to fuels can be improved through the development of highly efficient catalyst and suitable photoreactor configuration. Significant efforts have been devoted to the design and developments of photo-catalysts, but very little focus has been given towards photo-reactors development. In this perspective, this review presents state of the art accomplishments in photocatalytic CO2 reduction through engineering approach towards reactor configuration and design aspects. In the main stream, the perspectives of different types of photo-reactors employed for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 has been discussed. Slurry, fixed bed and membrane photo-reactors have been identified as the main categories that are critically discussed based on their operational mode, type of bed, number of phases involved, membrane used and type of light source. Comparative analysis of photo-reactors is also being employed to improve selectivity and photo-conversion rates of these photo-reactors. The influence of the factors such as light position and distribution, material of construction, temperature and pressure on the production of fuels has also been explicated. Moreover, perspective gives an overview of basic principles, thermodynamics and mass transfer involved in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to fuels. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives paves further improvements in the design of photo-reactors to be made to increase the efficiency of CO2 conversion to renewable fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Any entity, be it individual, company, or nation state, is more able to reduce its carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gas) emissions if these can be quantified and attributed and the effects of interventions estimated. The current state of product and supply chain carbon accounting methods does not consistently meet the standards required to tackle this global challenge. This study therefore aims to identify key methodological practices affecting the accuracy of carbon accounting models and in particular to assess the effects of the system boundaries they employ. Models currently available for estimating carbon emissions are either input-output based (using macro-economic analysis), process-based (using specific carbon emissions attributes through the life-cycle of a product, service or event), or a hybrid of the two. Here, a detailed comparison has been made between various input-output and process-based models and the results compared with those from a hybrid model that was taken to represent ‘best practice’ in carbon accounting. Key factors affecting accuracy were found to lie in: the detail of methodological decisions for input-output models, the economic region or regions upon which the model is based, and the quality, disaggregation and, especially for price-volatile products, the temporal alignment of the data. The relative significance of these factors is explored. For copper wire, a system boundary gap analysis was conducted on an industry-leading process-based model (GREET.net) compared with a complete system as described by the best performing input-output model. GREET.net was found to suffer a 60% truncation error. The copper wire example demonstrates the practicality of substituting process-based analysis into input-output based supply chain emissions assessments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon accounting; Embodied carbon; Input-output models; Life cycle analysis; Process-based analysis","Carbon dioxide; Copper; Economic analysis; Error analysis; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Wire; Carbon accounting; Embodied carbons; Input output model; Life cycle analysis; Process-based; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056157481

For example, habitat degradation at renewable energy production sites may affect the persistence of wildlife populations. We assessed the effects of wind farms in the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Area near Palm Springs, California, 2013–2015, on local populations of the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana). The side-blotched lizard is a common and ubiquitous desert reptile that is a major consumer of invertebrates and, in turn, represents a key prey base for many avian, reptilian, and mammalian predators. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to compare a comprehensive set of population-level vital signs (i.e., abundance, population growth rate, survival, recruitment, body condition, age structure, activity area size, movement rates) among populations at 4 wind farms and at 5 reference areas. Although our models indicate that wind facilities have a weak negative effect on side-blotched lizard survival, our overall results suggest that wind farms do not substantially influence the demography or behavior of these small lizards. Population response to general anthropogenic disturbance (quantified as an index of road type and density) was more pronounced, with lower population growth rates, adult-skewed age structure, and reduced body condition at highly disturbed wind farm and reference sites. We therefore conclude that wind-power facilities can support healthy populations of side-blotched lizards, indicating that wind energy development is compatible with a native Mojave Desert species. However, our results show that anthropogenic disturbance, as measured by the type and density of roadways, has a negative effect on lizard populations, and should be carefully planned whether associated with energy development or not. Our study demonstrates a methodological approach that can be applied to other species, including those with lower tolerances to disturbance, to measure their response to renewable energy development. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018","anthropogenic disturbance; recruitment; renewable energy; side-blotched lizard; spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR); survival; Uta stansburiana; wind turbine","alternative energy; anthropogenic effect; body condition; demography; lizard; mark-recapture method; movement; population growth; recruitment (population dynamics); survival; wind farm; wind turbine; California; Mojave Desert; Palm Springs; United States; Aves; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Reptilia; Squamata; Uta; Uta stansburiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053072355

Today, the smart grid concept involves many subjects from the efficient use of electrical energy resources to the planned and programmed consumption of energy, from the integration of distributed renewable energy sources into the system to the domestic productive consumers (prosumers), which are much related to local or regional development. Smart grid concept, which emerges a product of interdisciplinary studies ranging to many fields of engineering such as power systems, control, artificial intelligence and communication, can be briefly viewed as a development process towards the internet of energy. Especially in recent years, the decrease in reserves of fossil-fueled energy sources has led researchers to find out new energy sources, more efficient and ecological production and distribution methods. In these studies, the energy sources, which are renewable, sustainable, and economical have become major priorities due to reducing carbon emissions. However, the scope of smart grid studies has been continuously enriched and it has begun to include the fundamental components of production-centered sustainable development models, which are the providing of low-cost production supplies, continuity of these supplies, efficiency in production and consumption, generation based on renewable or recyclable resources, and applications of ecological generation and consumption methods. In this context, the positive effects of smart grids on the regional development are expected to occur in the following topics: Smart city applications, intelligent transportation, renewable and local energy generation, smart homes and building concepts, energy efficient cities, control of carbon footprint, automated electricity, gas, water and waste networks, loss and leakage control, application of demand side energy management system to reduce power consumption, self-healing electricity distribution, smart energy pricing, smart energy storage are some emergent topics that can contribute to sustainable regional development models. Because, modern grid components developed within the scope of smart grid are expected to support sustainable production models via smart energy management and increasing efficiency, reducing the energy costs, improving energy continuity.

This article evaluates the feasibility of double cropping, which has received relatively little consideration yet holds potential as an adaptation strategy. To assess its feasibility, growing seasons and economic profitability as calculated from crop yield and quality are considered. Accordingly, methods are developed for quantifying the determinants of crop yield and quality grade in a simultaneous equation system that directly expresses the ordered and fractional nature of grade shares. An empirical application to rice and wheat production in Japan reveals that, without any adaptation strategy, climate change will decrease revenues of both crops due to the reduction in yield and quality. Adjusting planting dates helps to avoid such negative impacts for rice but not enough for wheat in southern Japan. However, climate change provides an opportunity for another adaptation strategy-double cropping. Warmer climates enable many regions to shift from a single cropping system to a rice-wheat double cropping system by shortening the length of the wheat growing season and by delaying the optimal timing of rice planting. As a consequence, the area suitable for double cropping is nearly tripled, suggesting a strong potential to offset climate-induced production and profit losses. © The Author(s) 2018.

In rapidly developing countries such as Iran, the occurrence of acid rain has also increased. Acid rain is a driving factor of erosion due to the destructive effects on biota and aggregate stability; however, little is known about its impact on specific rates of erosion at the pedon scale. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of acid rain at pH levels of 5.25, 4.25, and 3.75 for rainfall intensities of 40, 60, and 80 mm h −1 on initial soil erosion processes under dry and saturated soil conditions using rainfall simulations. The results were compared using a two-way ANOVA and Duncan tests and showed that initial soil erosion rates with acidic rain and non-acidic rain under dry soil conditions were significantly different. The highest levels of soil particle loss due to splash effects in all rainfall intensities were observed with the most acidic rain (pH = 3.75), reaching maximum values of 16 g m −2  min −1 . The lowest levels of particle losses were observed in the control plot where non-acidic rain was used, with values ranging from 3.8 to 8.1 g m −2  min −1 . Similarly, under saturated soil conditions, the lowest level of soil particle loss was observed in the control plot, and the highest peaks of soil loss were observed for the most acidic rains (pH = 3.75 and pH = 4.25), reaching maximum average values of 40 g m −2  min −1 . However, for saturated soils with acidic water but with non-acidic rain, the highest soil particle loss was observed for the control plot for all the rainfall intensities. In conclusion, acidic rain has a negative impact on soils, which can be more intense with a concomitant increase in rainfall intensity. Rapid solutions, therefore, need to be found to reduce the emission of pollutants into the air, otherwise, rainfall erosivity may drastically increase. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","acid rain; runoff; soil loss; splash erosion","Acid rain; Developing countries; Erosion; Fossil fuels; pH effects; Pollution; Population statistics; Runoff; Urban growth; Aggregate stability; Airborne pollutants; Destructive effects; Dry soil conditions; Rainfall erosivity; Rainfall simulations; Soil loss; Splash erosion; Soils; acid rain; acidification; erosivity; pH; precipitation intensity; runoff; soil erosion; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057542417

Among all the prepared Ag-loaded metal oxides, Ga2O3, ZrO2, Y2O3, MgO, and La2O3 showed activities for CO and H2 productions under ultraviolet light irradiation. Thus, metal oxides involving metal cations with closed shell electronic structures such as d0, d10, and s0 had the potential for CO2 reduction with water. In situ Fourier transform infrared measurement revealed that the photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO production are controlled by the amount and chemical states of CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface and by the surface basicity, as summarized as follows: Ag/ZrO2 enhanced H2 production rather than CO production due to very little CO2 adsorption. Ag/Ga2O3 exhibited the highest activity for CO production, because adsorbed monodentate bicarbonate was effectively converted to bidentate formate being the reaction intermediates for CO production owing to its weak surface basicity. Ag/La2O3, Ag/Y2O3, and Ag/MgO having both weak and strong basic sites adsorbed larger amount of carbonate species including their ions and suppressed H2 production.

Our aim was to deepen the understanding of N 2 O fluxes from agricultural soils, including region specific soil and climate properties into the estimation of emission to find targeted mitigation measures for the reduction of nitrogen losses and GHG emissions. Within this project, N 2 O emissions and nitrate (NO 3 − ) leaching were modelled under spatially distinct environmental conditions in two agricultural regions in Austria taking into account region specific soil and climatic properties, management practices and crop rotations. The LandscapeDNDC ecosystem model was used to calculate N 2 O emissions and NO 3 − leaching reflecting different types of vegetation, management operations and crop rotations. In addition, N input and N fluxes were assessed and N 2 O emissions were calculated. This approach allowed identifying hot spots of N 2 O emissions. Results show that certain combinations of soil type, weather conditions, crop and management can lead to high emissions. Mean values ranged from 0.15 to 1.29 kg N 2 O–N ha −1  year −1 (Marchfeld) and 0.26 to 0.52 kg N 2 O–N ha −1  year −1 (Grieskirchen). Nitrate leaching, which strongly dominated N-losses, often reacted opposite to N 2 O emissions.

This paper presents two multi-objective models for the design of Distributed Energy Systems (DES) for satisfying local needs in heating, cooling and electricity. DES can be used to promote energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions which is crucial to tackle climate change. A multi-objective MILP framework is presented, comparing two main methodologies of designing DES using Total Annual Cost (TAC) and carbon emissions as objective functions. The first one, namely “Method A”, which performs a simultaneous sizing and the second one, namely “Method B”, in which technologies and their respective capacity are predefined. Furthermore, three scenarios regarding the available technologies are developed to assess DES for both methods and a case study is carried out. Results show that in both methods Scenario 3 (a DES coupled with district heating network, microgrid and storage technologies) has the best performance. In terms of comparison between the two methods, “Method A” provides better solutions in terms of cost and emissions as it has more degrees of freedom. Structure, design and operational results are presented and discussed analytically, as well as the possibility of comparing the two methods for a more detailed design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy systems; District heating network; MILP; Multi-objective optimization; Renewables; Storage","Carbon; Climate change; Cooling systems; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Design; District heating; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Heating equipment; Integer programming; Distributed energy systems; District heating networks; MILP; Multiobjective models; Objective functions; Renewables; Storage technology; Urban energy systems; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056449505

To achieve this goal, elucidation of the elements governing fine particulate matter concentrations should be considered as one of the priorities. In this paper, we proposed a statistical model based on physical understanding of the diffusion of air pollutants by wind to investigate the sensitivity of fine particulate matter and its precursor gases concentrations to wind speed and direction. By using our method, it is possible to determine the major wind directions that have large impact on air quality for a particular area. Our results showed that the influence of wind on the concentration of particulate matter and its precursor gases varies spatially over Beijing. Our method suggested that both local emission sources of fine particulate matter and its precursor gas (NO2) and transported SO2 from regional industries should be reduced for the remediation of severe air pollution scenarios, especially in the Beijing urban area. Our approach serves as a good complement for commonly used approaches for source apportionment analysis without exploiting complicated methods. The method shows its feasibility in identifying air pollutant emission sources based on wind patterns and can be used in other regions as an aid in air pollution controlling programs. © 2019","Air pollution; Ground level concentration; Particle transport; Statistical model; Tropospheric aerosol",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048593580

We find that although REDD+ intends to align local communities to benefit financially for contributions to carbon forestry, its uptake in the Ghanaian context has created entry points for the displacement of smallholder farmers through unregulated profit-driven and restrictive plantation-style carbon forest activities. This yields landless smallholder farmers whose labour is craftily integrated into a capitalist carbon forestry regime as tree planters, with many others striving to reproduce themselves through exploitative sharecropping arrangements and corrupt ‘backdoor’ land deals. We emphasize that, ‘more than carbon’ accumulation engendered by REDD+ is fast moving beyond land grabs to a more complex dimension in which the labour and financial resources of marginalized groups are further appropriated by forest investors, and their relatively powerful counterparts in what we term intimate exploitation. Given the ongoing plight of smallholder farmers, particularly the multitude of ‘hungry’ migrant farmers who seek ‘salvation’ in the High Forest Zone, it is obvious that REDD+ is pushed at the expense of ensuring food security. To sustainably address current land-related agricultural production bottlenecks and empower local communities to directly benefit from REDD+, we recommend that rather than centralizing both carbon rights and land rights in the hands of the state and a few private investors, community forestlands should be returned to local people under community-led forest management approaches. Local control of both land and carbon stocks will promote sustainable coexistence of smallholder agriculture and carbon forestry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Displacement; Ghana; Intimate exploitation; More than carbon accumulation; REDD+; Sub-Saharan Africa","agrarian change; agricultural production; capitalism; carbon sequestration; community resource management; deforestation; environmental degradation; livelihood; local participation; political economy; sustainability; tenure system; Ghana; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053149256

Few empirical studies have been conducted to determine the influence of urban form characteristics on air quality in Korea. Thus, the purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between urban form and air pollution, focusing on ozone pollution in Korea. The characteristics of urban form include density, concentration, clustering, and land use mix. In this study, those characteristics were measured by population density, the Theil index, Moran’s I index, G-statistic values, and an entropy index using statistical methods and a geographic information system. We employed a spatial regression model to consider the spatial effects of ozone concentrations. We found that the degree of urban land use mix, clustering, and concentration of development are significantly associated with better air quality by using a spatial lag model, which was found to be the best fit for the data used in this study. However, an increase in population density was found to be associated with exacerbated ozone concentrations. Communities with higher daily temperatures, a large number of cars, and polluting facilities exhibited poor air quality, while those with a larger percentage of residential land use tended to have lower ozone pollution. These findings suggest that, to properly address concerns over air quality, mixed-land use and compact urban form need to be more seriously considered in sustainable urban planning. © The Author(s) 2017.","Compact urban form; Korea; mixed land use; ozone pollution; spatial regression model","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); land use; ozone depletion; regression analysis; spatial analysis; urban planning; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059911159

Density was measured using a ""bare-bone"" vibrating U-tube driven and scanned in the frequency domain with a lock-in amplifier where the resonance peak is acquired in complex form and density is determined with an expanded uncertainty of U(ρ) = 0.003ρ. Viscosity was measured with a custom-made capillary viscometer made of a stainless steel 1/8 in. tube with a length of about 3 m and an internal diameter of about 0.4 mm, where the pressure drop is measured while the fluid mixture is swept through at a constant flow rate. Bubble pressures were determined from the discontinuity of p-V plots recorded during a series of isothermal constant composition expansion processes (CCE) in a variable volume pressure cell. The data reported in previous literature were modeled using Tait-like equations for each single composition, but in this work, equations of state and the Expanded Fluid Theory were used to model density and viscosity, respectively, over the whole surface of pTx reported in the literature. For density, Redlich-Kwong-Soave EOS gives best predictions with an average absolute deviation of 1.1%, where the deviations are high near the bubble points but also increase in a systematic manner with increasing CO2 mole fraction. Best predictions for bubble pressures were given by Peng-Robinson EOS. The excess molar volume is also calculated as a function of pressure and temperature.

To address this situation, India is moving from BS-IV to BS-VI for on-road applications with 90% reduction in NOx and 50% in PM with limit on particulate number. Also moving to Trem-IV and Trem-V for off-road applications subsequently. It needs higher efficiency after-treatment systems like SCR and DPF to achieve such lower emission levels. Addition of these complex after-treatment system, severely increase the cost of diesel power plant with heavy penalty on fuel economy. Hence, it is challenge to auto industry to reduce the complexity and cost, so that it requires an alternate solution to reduce NOx and PM emissions at source to reduce cost and system complexity. Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) is a potential concept to reduce the NOx and PM emissions simultaneously. LTC concept was experimentally demonstrated on engines of passenger car and light commercial segments, but not much work carried out for heavy duty engines. The current research work focused on development of LTC concept to reduce both NOx and PM emissions to a required low levels with fuel efficiency improvement so that aftertreatment system cost and complexity will be reduced to a great extent for BS-VI norms. Extensive simulation work carried out in this research for selecting the combustion system including fuel injection system (nozzle configuration, injection pressures and multiple injection), air handling system (air-fuel ratio, EGR%, and swirl) and piston bowl (combustion bowl geometry, compression ratio) suitable to run the engine on both LTC and conventional modes. Engine was built with all modified features and experiments were performed as per BS-VI cycles (WHSC and WHTC). Experiments carried out over entire engine operating zone with smooth transition between LTC modes in part loads and conventional combustion mode in high load zone. Cycle engine out emissions reduced up to 2.1 g/kWh NOx and ~0.03 g/kWh PM with ~5% overall cycle BSFC improvement in steady state WHSC cycle. Encouraging results have been achieved on transient WHTC cycle also. The lowest BSFC noticed during experiments was close to 191 g/kWh at optimized engine out NOx levels. Utmost important is reduced engine out emissions and improved fuel economy which reduces after-treatment system cost & complexity, operating, maintenance cost and improved field performance with increased regeneration intervals. This result in lower urea and fuel consumption. In summary, LTC is a cost effective solution for BS-VI. © 2019 SAE International.

These land use changes are impacting jurisdictional streams, and thus require compensatory stream mitigation via environmental restoration. In this article, we first characterize current demand and supply for stream mitigation for the entire state of Colorado. Second, we assess future demand by forecasting and mapping the lengths of streams that will likely be impacted by specific development and land use changes. Third, based on our interviews with experts, stakeholders, resource managers, and regulators, we provide insight on how regulatory climate, challenges, and water resource developments may influence demand for stream mitigation. From geospatial analyses of permit data, we found that there is currently demand for compensatory stream mitigation in 13 of the 89 HUC-8 watersheds across Colorado. Permanent riverine impacts from 2012- 2017 requiring compensatory mitigation totaled 38,292 linear feet (LF). The supply of stream mitigation credits falls well short of this demand. There has only been one approved stream mitigation bank in Colorado, supplying only 2539 LF credits. Based on our analyses of future growth and development in Colorado, there will be relatively high demand for stream mitigation credits in the next 5-10 years. While most of these impacts will be around the Denver metropolitan area, we identified some new areas of the state that will experience high demand for stream mitigation. Given regulatory agencies' stated preference for mitigation banks, the high demand for stream mitigation credits, and the short supply of stream credits, there should be an active market for stream mitigation banks in Colorado.

Here we demonstrate that selectivity does not only depend on catalyst surface composition, but is strongly affected by the electrode morphology. At current densities above 10 mA·cm-2, we find that morphology can control the CO2 reduction pathways to CO and other products, including the competing H2 evolution, on the Cu-Sn surface. An electrode design with dendritic morphological features yields the highest CO partial current density of 11.5 mA·cm-2 at -1.1 V vs RHE, avoiding the significant loss of CO selectivity observed for an electrode with less sharp, rounder morphological features. Efficient CO2 mass transport to the catalyst surface and a high local CO2 concentration, promoted by the dendritic structure, stabilize the Cu-SnO overlayer, suppress the competing H2 evolution reaction, and maintain CO selectivity above 85% over a wide potential range. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","CO production; CO2 mass transport; Cu-SnO overlayer; Electrochemical CO2 reduction; Morphology; Surface composition","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Gold compounds; Morphology; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Surface structure; Co-production; CO2 concentration; CO2 reduction; Composition design; Dendritic structures; Electrode morphology; Morphological features; Selective reduction; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062011627

Visitors, staff, and management of the Park have raised concerns about the volcanic emissions and their possible effects on their health. As part of the responsibility of The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) to provide volcanic surveillance through its geothermal monitoring programme, a monitoring network was established for quantifying the ambient SO2 concentrations at the Park to assess the potential risk of unsafe exposure. This required the development of a participatory citizen science effort with researchers training local personnel in field sampling and basic analytical techniques to measure SO2 concentrations. The operation of a citizen science network required engagement and collaboration with local stakeholders in Saint Lucia to ensure that the research addressed the needs of all partners. This participatory approach was an effective option for scientists to engage local stakeholders and the wider community as partners in geoscience hazards education. Ambient SO2 concentrations obtained with handmade active air samplers (titrimetric hydrogen peroxide traps) showed that when the atmospheric concentrations of SO2 was lower, the data from the diffusion tubes and the handmade samplers followed a similar pattern. The ambient concentrations measured using the handmade samplers cannot be used as absolute values due to uncertainties related to the input parameters needed for the calculation of SO2 concentrations. However, the data may be useful in identifying areas exposed to elevated SO2 concentrations of potential concern to public health. The samplers proved useful as a tool to promote volcanic hazard awareness and education among the local stakeholders and citizen scientists. Important lessons learned by the research team from participant surveys were that time constraints and personal motivation of volunteers are key factors in the success of the operations of this monitoring network. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Citizen science; Geoscience hazards outreach; Methodological reflection; Saint Lucia; Stakeholder engagement; Volcanic emissions","Geology; Geothermal springs; Human resource management; Personnel training; Risk assessment; Sulfur; Surveys; Volcanoes; Citizen science; Geosciences; Saint lucia; Stakeholder engagement; Volcanic emission; Hazards; concentration (composition); hydrothermal system; monitoring; natural hazard; stakeholder; sulfur emission; volcanism; Saint Lucia; Windward Islands [Lesser Antilles]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057125801

In spite of the considerable number of observational, modeling, and laboratory efforts, understanding the physics leading to the observed morphology of Europa’s near-surface O 2 atmosphere has been problematic. This is the case as the observed emissions depend on the local incident plasma ion flux, the local temperature and composition of the regolith, as well as on the near-surface electron temperature and density. Here we rely heavily on earlier reviews briefly summarizing the observational, laboratory and simulation efforts. Although it is agreed that radiolysis of the surface ice by the incident Jovian plasma is the ultimate source of observed O 2 , a recent, simple model of thermal desorption from a regolith permeated with O 2 has changed the usual paradigm. In that model, the observed orbital dependence of the local source of the near-surface O 2 atmosphere is suggested to be due to the release of O 2 likely trapped on the ice grains at dangling bonds by the solar flux with a smaller contribution due to direct sputtering. This assumes that Europa’s icy regolith is permeated with trapped O 2 , which could also affect our understanding of the suggestion that the radiolytic products in Europa’s regolith might be a source of oxidants for its underground ocean. © 2019, The Author(s).","Atmospheric evolution; Europa; Exospheres; Ices; O 2","Dangling bonds; Electron temperature; Orbits; Radiation chemistry; Radiolysis; Atmospheric evolution; Direct sputtering; Early prediction; Europa; Exospheres; Local temperature; Orbital dependence; Radiolytic products; Ice",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061421781

With high concentrations of many bioactive compounds, it has long been treated as a health beneficial ingredient for human diet and even some medicine. In order to gain comprehensive understandings of current resources of Glechoma longituba, samples from seventeen geographical origins in fifteen Chinese provinces were collected to reveal the connections between different influence factors and certain bioactive compounds. Firstly, high variations in the contents of ethanol-soluble extracts, total flavonoid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were proved among different Glechoma longituba populations. Totally four parameters of soil physical properties, twelve parameters of soil chemical properties, thirty years’ climate records and genetic diversity among different Glechoma longituba populations were thoroughly investigated. As a result, soil chemical property and climate condition with significant correlation between each other were both indicated to have the strongest positive correlations with bioactive compounds of Glechoma longituba, among which soil phosphorus, soil iron, temperature and moisture were showed to act as key factors. Neither the genetic variation nor the soil physical property was significantly related to the concentrations of bioactive compounds. These results laid the first theoretical foundation for further study of how to improve the quality of Glechoma longituba resources, as well as provided guidance for breeders to focus more on choosing planting areas with ideal climate conditions and modulating the optimum soil chemical properties for better Glechoma longituba cultivation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate factor; Genetic diversity; Glechoma longituba; Multi-component variation; Soil property","bioactivity; biochemical composition; climate effect; concentration (composition); cultivation; environmental factor; genetic variation; herb; phytochemistry; soil property; China; Glechoma longituba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054008919

However, our understanding of the long-term interactions between aged biochar, soil organic C (SOC), and fresh low molecular weight C compounds (LMW-C) is still limited. In addition to the changes in the chemical properties of biochar and the SOC after aging, biochar stability and C sequestration potentials might be affected by the LMW-C availability. After 3.5 years of incubation, aged soils and aged soil-biochar mixtures (4 atom‰ 13C enriched grass-derived biochar, 10% addition rate) of two different soil types were used in this study, with or without the addition of LMW-C. The 13C natural abundance of the LMW-C was manipulated by mixing cane sucrose (C4) and beet sugar (C3) to make it different from or equal to the native SOC isotopic signature of the two soil types, which allowed the partitioning of the LMW-C and biochar C from the SOC in non-biochar and biochar addition treatments, respectively. We traced the 13C in the cumulative CO2, microbial biomass C (MBC), and dissolved organic C (DOC) at the beginning and the end of the 28 days of incubation. Results indicated that this aged biochar was not as effective for SOC protection as it was when fresh. Aged biochar caused significant increases in the native SOC-derived CO2 compared to non-biochar treatment during the 3.5 years of aging. Within the 28 days of incubation, aged biochar not only promoted the total CO2 emission but also did not limit the priming effect of LMW-C on native SOC mineralization. SOC-derived DOC in the aged soil-biochar mixture was significantly higher than that in the aged soil, which further increased the SOC loss. A decline in the SOC stability with aged biochar might be associated with the attenuated sorption of SOC on aged biochar, the decline in bulk density with the high biochar addition rate, and a modified microbial community.

Although this combination technique can quantify more effects than LMDI alone, its decomposition result has residual value. We propose a new approach that can achieve non-residual decomposition by calculating the actual values of three key parameters. To test the proposed approach, we decomposed the carbon emissions in the United States to six driving factors: the labor input effect, the investment effect, the carbon coefficient effect, the energy structure effect, the energy intensity effect, and the technology state effect. The results illustrate that the sum of these factors is equivalent to the CO2 emissions changes from t to t-1, thereby proving non-residual decomposition. Given that the proposed approach can achieve perfect decomposition, the proposed approach can be used more widely to investigate the effects of labor input, investment, and technology state on changes in energy and emission. © 2019 by the authors.","Combined decomposition technique; Fixed asset investment; Labor input; Perfect decomposition","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition; energy intensity; index method; investment; labor; technology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059783950

Previous studies have mostly focused on the impact of economic performance of sectors on carbon emissions, however, there is a lack of information about the influence of the structural roles on the full industrial chain. This article first built global embodied carbon emission transfer networks from 2000 to 2015, combining multi-regional input-output analysis and complex network theory, to explore the structural characteristics and recognize the structural roles of sectors. Then, panel regression analysis was applied to quantify the contributions of the structural roles of sectors to their carbon emissions. The results first showed that there were significant scale-free network characteristics in the global embodied carbon emissions transfer networks. The majority of global carbon emission transfers was concentrated on a limited number of sectors over time. Moreover, the network analysis revealed that sectors played different roles with different levels of importance in the global embodied carbon emission transfer networks. The results also suggested that the carbon emissions of sectors related to economic activity were significantly determined by some structural roles in the global embodied carbon emission transfer networks. Degree-in, strength-out and closeness-out and betweenness had significant positive influences, while degree-out, strength-in and closeness-in had significant negative impacts. These results indicated that carbon emissions mainly were increased by the domestic markets rather than international trades. Thus, adjusting the domestic consumption structures can be helpful for global carbon emission reduction. It also indicated that carbon emissions were not only driven by direct production demand from downstream sectors, but also were significantly influenced by indirect production demand in the industrial chain. Therefore, reducing carbon emissions should be established in both the direct and the indirect relationships in the production process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Complex network; Global; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Structural roles","Carbon dioxide; Chains; Climate change; Economic analysis; Emission control; International trade; Regression analysis; Structural analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Global; Global carbon emission; Global climate changes; Input output analysis; Structural characteristics; Structural roles; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056153842

However, due to the insufficient availability of images with moderate to high spatial resolution, caused by frequent cloud cover and coarse temporal resolution, high-resolution maps of rice cropping systems at a large scale are relatively limited, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. This study combined the difference of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) method and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold method to monitor changes in rice cropping systems of Southern China using Landsat images, based on the phenological differences between different rice cropping systems. From 1990-2015, the sown area of double cropping rice (DCR) in Southern China decreased by 61054.5 km 2 , the sown area of single cropping rice (SCR) increased by 20,110.7 km 2 , the index of multiple cropping decreased from 148.3% to 129.3%, and the proportion of DCR decreased by 20%. The rice cropping systems in Southern China showed a ""double rice shrinking and single rice expanding"" change pattern from north to south, and the most dramatic changes occurred in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain. This study provided an efficient strategy that can be applied to moderate to high resolution images with deficient data availability, and the resulting maps can be used as data support to adjust agricultural structures, formulate food security strategies, and compile a greenhouse gas emission inventory. © 2019 by the authors.","Difference of NDVI (dNDVI); Landsat; Rice cropping intensity; Southern China","Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Tropics; Vegetation; Water conservation; Water management; Difference of NDVI (dNDVI); Greenhouse gas emission inventories; High spatial resolution; LANDSAT; Normalized difference vegetation index; Rice cropping intensity; Southern China; Sustainable water management; Image processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059966443

Here, we use mineralogical, petrographic and geochemical data of a paleoweathering profile developed on basement granodioritic rocks of northern Qaidam basin, northern Tibet, to reconstruct early Eocene weathering conditions and to discuss how paleoclimates and tectonics dominated the weathering process. The results indicate that neoformed mineral phases in weathering products are dominated by smectite, and the profile has overwhelmingly low chemical index of alteration values (ca. 51–59) and significantly decreasing micropetrographic index values (from 25.0 to 0.2) from bottom to top. These findings suggest that the basement rocks experienced mild chemical weathering but relatively intensive physical weathering. We favor that non-steady-state weathering, in which mechanical erosion rates compare favorably with rates of chemical weathering, prevailed in northern Tibet during the early Eocene. The weathering conditions were likely an integrated response to active tectonism and dry climates at that time. Furthermore, chemical element mobility evaluation demonstrates that most of large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements (LREEs) of granodioritic rocks are quite active during weathering and can be easily leached even under mild chemical weathering conditions. Significant mass loss of Al and LREEs in upper weathered samples probably reflects acidic weathering conditions, which were likely due to extremely high atmospheric CO2 level during the early Eocene. This study, from the unique perspective of weathering process, suggests that intensive deformation and rapid tectonic erosion occurred in northern Tibet during the early Eocene, as a far-field response to the India-Eurasia collision. It also agrees with warm and relatively dry climates, which were likely attributed to the global greenhouse climates and the Paleogene planetary-wind-dominant climate system in Asia, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical weathering; Climate; Element mobility; Sediment provenance; Tectonics","carbon dioxide; chemical element; chemical weathering; element mobility; Eocene; geochemistry; granodiorite; mineralogy; paleoclimate; Paleogene; petrography; provenance; tectonics; weathering profile; Asia; China; Eurasia; India; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051679134

Few studies of the effects of greenness have focused on Asia, and, to the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the effect on vulnerable oldest-old populations. We assessed the association between residential greenness and mortality in an older cohort in China. Methods: We used five waves (February, 2000–October, 2014) of the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), a prospective cohort representative of the general older population in China. We assessed exposure to greenness through satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in the 250 m and 1250 m radius around the residential address for each individual included in the study. We calculated contemporaneous NDVI values, cumulative NDVI values, and changes in NDVI from the start of the study over time. The health outcome of the study was all-cause mortality, excluding accidental deaths. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, geographical region, childhood and adult socioeconomic status, social and leisure activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Findings: Among 23 754 individuals (mean age at baseline 93 years [SD 7·5]) totaling 80 001 person-years, we observed 18 948 deaths during 14 years of follow-up, between June, 2000, and December, 2014. Individuals in the highest quartile of contemporaneous NDVI values had 27% lower mortality than those in the lowest quartile for the 250 m radius (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73, 95% CI 0·70–0·76), and 30% lower mortality for the 1250 m radius (0·70, 0·67–0·74). No clear association was observed for cumulative NDVI measurements and mortality. We did not detect an association between area-level changes in NDVI and mortality. Interpretation: Our research suggests that proximity to more green space is associated with increased longevity, which has policy implications for the national blueprint of ecological civilisation and preparation for an ageing society in China.

To assess their vulnerability to climate change, this study investigates the general views and perceptions of respondents towards climate change, climatic hazard events, and the factors contributing to vulnerability. The assessment is based on a cross sectional survey that was conducted with a random sample of 280 smallholder farmers distributed in six counties of Iran's Hamadan province which is predicted to be affected by climate change. In this study 7, 12, and 23 indicators were applied for measuring three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The analysis combines two sets of climatic data which were obtained from Iran Meteorological Organization (IMO) and socio-demographics data collected by a questionnaire. According to the results the majority of respondents believed that climate change is real, and about one third of them acclaimed this phenomenon to be caused by human activity. The vulnerability assessment indicates that the majority of smallholder farmers were relatively vulnerable to climate change. Also, 13 factors highly contributed to vulnerability, including education, income, access to infrastructure, credit and land size. According to the results there is a need for the responsible governmental organizations of the Hamadan province to generate measures in order to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate change, and the government should reform environmental, institutional, and economic conditions to promote particular adaptation methods. © 2018","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Exposure; Sensitivity; Smallholder farmer; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052108438

Interpretation of the archived isotopic and elemental signatures is, however, not straightforward because of mixing between the signals of fluids and ambient seawater, limited understanding of subseafloor fluid circulation, and effects of diagenetic alteration. The Nd isotope system is among the most widely used tracers of circulation patterns in modern and past oceans, but to date Nd isotopes have been rarely used in investigations of fluid migration pathways at hydrocarbon seeps. To test the sensitivity of Nd isotope signals of seep carbonates to record past interactions between the seeping fluids and 143Nd-enriched, volcanic-derived mineral components, we performed Nd, Sr and stable isotope analyses of the Lower Cretaceous (Barremian) seep carbonates found in Baška (Czech Carpathians). These seep deposits are directly underlain by a complex of mafic igneous rocks, which the methane-charged fluids must have passed through on their way to the seafloor. The εNd(t) values measured in the seep carbonates are significantly more radiogenic than the inferred signal of contemporaneous local seawater, and shifted towards the composition typical of the underlying basaltoids. This is in agreement with the 87Sr/86Sr ratios, which are markedly lower that the coeval seawater signature. Consistent co-variance trends are observed among the measured εNd(t), 87Sr/86Sr and δ13C values, attesting increasing role of the volcanic-derived fluid component with increasing contribution of methane-derived carbon. The results of the present approach reveal the potential of Nd isotopes to fingerprint exotic fluid end-members present in plumbing systems of both fossil and modern methane discharges. The method can be of particular use in studies of seeps associated with plate margins, where 143Nd-enriched igneous materials are commonly encountered in the basement or in the sediment column. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fluid-rock interactions; Methane seeps; Neodymium isotopes; Plumbing systems; Seep and vent carbonates; Strontium isotopes","Carbonates; Igneous rocks; Methane; Plumbing; Seawater effects; Volcanoes; Water piping systems; Fluid-rock interaction; Methane seep; Neodymium isotopes; Plumbing Systems; Strontium isotopes; Isotopes; carbonate; hydrocarbon migration; hydrocarbon seep; isotopic composition; methane; mixing; neodymium isotope; seafloor; strontium isotope; tectonic plate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056725487

Improved understanding about the interactions between climate and food security is needed before we can determine whether migration is a truly adaptive response in poorer countries. Without this understanding, it is difficult to design effective strategies that ensure climate resilient development. We present an analysis of climate, food security, migration, and its consequences from 218 households in three locations in North-western Cambodia, the most climate vulnerable nation in SE Asia. Results show that migration occurs in up to 45% of households, over half of which is climate-related. Migration causes labour shortages and welfare issues, but does not necessarily improve food security. This and climate trends lead us to argue that migration may be maladaptive over the long term, resulting in a climate-induced poverty trap. Instead, livelihood adaptations are needed that address (i) changing community demographics resulting from young male migrants, (ii) migration seasonality, associated labour shortages and gender role implications, and (iii) the burden of food insecurity.

Continuing climate risks require adaptation at all levels of society. The densely populated and resource-rich coastal zone of Bangladesh is at risk to the impacts of climate change. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on secondary sources (gray and published literature) of information on climate change impacts on the coastal zone of Bangladesh. The sources include research reports, online publications, governmental reports, scientific journals, international reports, books, journal articles and other academic resources on SEA, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and DRR. In addition to examining SEA in Bangladesh, this paper investigates SEA cases in different countries to obtain insights from the successful application of SEA for CCA. Findings: The paper draws on several cases from different countries demonstrating that SEA has a significant potential to coordinate CCA objectives. The findings reveal that the appropriate use of SEA can enable DRR through CCA. Originality/value: This study argues that SEA has a potential role in supporting CCA. © 2019, Md.

Different mechanisms of climate change have tremendous effects on agriculture and its productivity. But phenomenon present between climate change and associated interaction with crops is much complex that we can rely on modeling for further prediction interlinked with agriculture on a local, regional, and global scale, while some projects like Agriculture Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) have been started. However, some studies showed contrasting results as, by increasing CO2 level, crop production should be high to 13%, but with this level, ozone layer might be damaged and reduce yield by 5% or maybe more. High level of CO2 reduces usage of water which reduces rate of opening of stomata, while on other hand, high temperature increased transpiration rate which will lower water by evaporation. Future effects of climate on crop suitability and productivity have been developed by researchers; by those movements in Northern Europe, production has increased while it decreased in Southern Europe. However, it is already predicted that extreme events will be there like heat waves due to increase in temperature in 2003 and 2010, but again these shifts can occur. Therefore, there is a dire need to agricultural scientists (agronomists, breeders, soil scientists, entomologist, plant pathologists, and horticulturist) so that they should produce such agriculture products which can perform better even in high temperature and would bear all expected changes due to climate variability. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Climate shift; Climate variability; Crop productivity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083164539

Photoautotrophy is crucial in linking all other living organisms to the Sun through the ability to absorb, trap, and transform this light energy into useable forms of electrochemical potential energy to reduce CO2 to complex carbohydrates. However, this requires the integration of processes that differ in their rates by more than 10 orders of magnitude. This creates a potential for an imbalance in cellular energy budget. The solution to this apparent paradox is part of the magic of photosynthesis and is a result of photoacclimation, the dynamic capacity of photoautotrophs to tailor the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus to an ever-changing environment in order to maintain an energy balance. Such a balanced state is called photostasis. This is attained through molecular and biochemical mechanisms that are temporally and spatially integrated at various levels-genetic, biochemical, organellar, cellular, organ, and whole organism. Not only is the chloroplast a primary cellular energy transformer, but this organelle also acts as a global energy sensor whose impact extends to plant and cell form and function by governing nuclear gene expression through retrograde regulation. Consequently, photoacclimation to attain photostasis is reflected in the remarkable phenotypic plasticity that photoautotrophs exhibit in response to environmental change. Elucidation of the molecular basis by which photosynthesis and photoacclimation are coupled to phenotypic plasticity will be essential in addressing the challenge of at least maintaining or perhaps enhancing crop productivity under the suboptimal growth conditions associated with climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly, entry of new drivers via induced demand can negate the benefits of increased carpooling. Using 10 years of traffic data from Los Angeles we estimate time and route-specific marginal external costs. Because costs vary substantially across routes, hours, and days, current policies to promote carpooling will often increase social costs.

This paper provides a comprehensive approach, combining index decomposition analysis (IDA), production-theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA) and attribution analysis (AA), to decompose the changes in transport CO2 intensity into nine factors and identify the contributions of different regions to the individual factors. Energy-related and transport-related factors are considered simultaneously and some new factors are created to provide additional insights for exploring changes in transport CO2 intensity. An empirical study of the transport sector across 30 Chinese PARs (provincial administrative regions) resulted in three key findings. First, the effect of potential transport energy intensity and the effect of the economic output technology were the major drivers for the reduction in transport CO2 intensity, while the effect of potential transport intensity and the effect of energy utilization technology were the major factors that increased the transport CO2 intensity. Second, due to the diverse transport sector characteristics of the 30 PARs, their contributions to the four driving factors for the transport CO2 intensity mitigation varied. Third, specific policy implications in terms of energy conservation and transport management policy were proposed for the 30 PARs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attribution analysis; CO2 intensity; Index decomposition analysis; Production-theoretical decomposition analysis; Transport sector","Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Public policy; Attribution analysis; CO2 intensity; Decomposition analysis; Index decomposition analysis; Transport sectors; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; energy conservation; theoretical study; traffic emission; transportation planning; transportation policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058183966

Agriculture aggravates climate change by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and in response, climate change reduces agricultural productivity. Consequently, the modern agricultural development mode has progressively transformed into a kind of sustainable development mode. This study aimed to determine the environmental impact and carbon footprint of Dongshan tea from Yilan County. Environmental impact was assessed with use of SimaPro version 8.0.2 and IMPACT2002+. Results showed that climate change has the largest impact upon it in general, followed by human health, natural resources, and ecosystem quality. Furthermore, with use of the IPCC 2007 100a method for carbon footprint of products (CFP), conventional tea was found to have a CFP of 7.035 kgCO 2 -e, and its main contributors are the raw material (35.15%) and consumer use (45.58%) phases. From this case study, we found that the hotspots of the life cycle of environmental impact of Taiwanese tea mainly come from fertilizer input during the raw material phase, electricity use during manufacturing, and electricity use during water boiling in the consumer use phase (which contributes the largest impact). We propose the ways for consumers to use of highly efficient boiling water facilities and heating preservation, and the government must market the use of organic fertilizers in the national policy subsidies, and farmers have to prudent use of fertilizers and promote the use of local raw fertilizers, and engagement in direct sales for reducing the environmental impacts and costs of agricultural products and thus advancing sustainable agriculture development. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Environmental impact; Sustainable agriculture; Tea","Agricultural products; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Productivity; Sustainable development; Agricultural development; Agricultural productivity; Boiling water; Electricity use; Environmental threats; National policies; Organic fertilizers; Sustainable agriculture; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060009436

Using a quadratic directional distance function, we evaluate the production inefficiency and shadow prices of CO2 reduction for the seven major maize-producing provinces in China for 1996–2014. In general, the efficiency improves over time. Shandong province ranked as the top one with full efficiency considering both economic and environmental impacts as of 2014. The mean shadow price for the CO2 emission was 0.45 yuan/kg (US$75/t), whereas the province-specific shadow prices varied within the interval bounded by 0 and 0.913 yuan/ha (US$152/t). The marginal abatement cost curve was downward-sloped and indicated the need for curbing CO2 emission in areas exhibiting the highest pollution rates. Given the marginal abatement cost patterns, the transaction costs associated with implementation of the conservation practices (tillage) should not exceed 335 yuan/ha in order to ensure the welfare gains. This government-provided payment would compensate farmers for yield reductions in favor of implementing conservation practices that would substantially reduce CO2 emissions. © 2018","Carbon dioxide (CO2); China; Conservation practices; Environmental efficiency; Food Security; Maize straw; Marginal abatement cost; Shadow price","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Food supply; Public policy; China; Conservation practices; Environmental efficiency; Food security; Maize straw; Marginal abatement costs; Shadow price; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054923457

Nevertheless natural gas is a fossil energy carrier and various countries have started the stepwise transition froma fossil resource base towards a renewable energy-based energy system due to concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions, energy security and conservation of finite resources. A biogenic substitute for natural gas is biomethane, defined as methane produced from biomass with properties similar to natural gas. It is a promising fuel to support the transition fromfossil fuels to renewables and to support the greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of the different European Union member states.Biomethane can be produced by upgrading biogas (biochemical conversion) or as so-called bio-SNG (biogenic synthetic natural gas) by thermo-chemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass or other forms of lignin-rich biomass. Biomethane production via biochemical conversion is a widely applied technology. Bio-SNG via thermochemical conversion is currently barely applied in the respective market. At present, there is hardly any cross-border trade in biomethane in the EU. During the phase of implementation of the biogas and biogas upgrading industry, eachmember state started to develop its own regulations, standardisations and certifications. For a working European-wide biomethane trade, unified framework conditions like standardisations and certifications have to be established.This chapter gives a brief introduction to biomethane followed by an overview of biomethane use in several European countries.Afterwards, certification, which is a precondition for biomethane trade, is introduced and possible schemes enabling biomethane trade are presented, followed by an outlook. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064368240

A techno-environmental event, desertification has been much discussed since the sudano-sahelian drought of 1968-1974. Desertification has been attributed by many to the abuse, through overgrazing and overcultivation, of nutrient-poor soils in an unfavorable hot and arid climate. A purely environmental approach to understanding and solving the problem of desertification is inherently inadequate because the causes of “mismanagement” are social, economic, and above all political. The social factors leading to resource abuse in the northern Sudan are largely of the origin. In the Sudan, as in other parts of the developing world, there are often gross discrepancies between formal and effective land tenure systems in rural areas. Access to most grazing land and rainfed agricultural land is regulated by local principles of tenure. © 1987 by the Institute for Development Anthropology.

However, few studies have examined the effects of mode shift from automobile to LRT. This paper investigates to what extent mode shift from car to LRT can reduce personal exposure to PM2.5, BC, and UFP. Simultaneous measurements on LRT and automobile were conducted under four plausible commuting scenarios in Los Angeles, California from October to November in 2014. As a robustness check, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test the effects of confounding factors. Under the closed ventilation and low traffic condition, personal exposure measurements inside LRT were significantly higher than in automobile for BC (+40%, p &lt; 0.01) and UFP (+27%, p &lt; 0.01). However, under the open ventilation and high traffic condition, personal exposure was significantly lower in LRT than in automobile for PM2.5 (−38%, p &lt; 0.01); BC (−68%, p &lt; 0.01); and UFP (−141%, p &lt; 0.01). Results of the Monte Carlo simulations suggest that other factors, such as vehicle fan strength, vehicle speed, and vehicle age, appear to have marginal effects on personal exposure. These results demonstrate that the effect of mode shift from car to LRT can be significantly altered by ventilation settings and travel route choices. Results inform future research and policy about the importance of incorporating ventilation and traffic microenvironments for assessing the health effects of a mode switch from car to LRT. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Microenvironment; Mode shift; Monte Carlo simulation; Personal exposure; Simultaneous measurement; Ventilation","Automobiles; Exposure controls; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Ventilation; Controlled experiment; Light rail transit (LRT); Microenvironments; Mode shifts; Personal exposures; Simultaneous measurement; Traffic conditions; Travel route choices; Light rail transit; automobile; commuting; experimental study; indoor air; light rail system; measurement method; Monte Carlo analysis; particulate matter; pollution exposure; ventilation; article; California; car; controlled study; microenvironment; Monte Carlo method; travel; velocity; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054840270

Despite the cruise sector’s enormous investment in ships and supporting infrastructure, at least until fairly recently, efforts by the cruise lines to either reduce their own carbon footprint or to find ways to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change have been relatively modest and piecemeal. As impacts of climate change are becoming more evident, today the major cruise lines, as well as industry associations, all report that cruise corporations are investing a lot in new technologies and practices to ensure the sector’s sustainability. These technologies are detailed. The chapter concludes with recommendations for destinations to craft sustainability standards and mitigation/adaptation strategies for climate change that successfully integrate the cruise sector.

Using theoretical and empirical models, we show how RPSs induce out-of-state emissions reductions through interstate trade of credits used for RPS compliance. When one state passes an RPS, it increases demand for credits sold by firms in other (potentially non-RPS) states. We find that increasing a state’s RPS decreases coal generation and increases wind generation in outside states through this tradable credit channel. We perform a welfare simulation to evaluate the aggregate avoided damage from RPS-induced reductions in local coal-fired pollutants. Our estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in a state’s RPS results in up to $100 million in avoided damages over the United States from reduced pollution. We also find substantial heterogeneity in aggregate avoided damages caused by increases in different states’ RPSs. © 2018 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.","Cobenefits; Damages; Energy; Pollution; Renewable portfolio standards; Tradable credits",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065916288

The dilution injection creates nonuniformities in temperature, velocity, and turbulence, and an understanding of the vane film cooling performance is complicated by competing influences. In this study, dilution port temperature profiles have been measured in the absence of vane film cooling and compared to film effectiveness measurements in the presence of both films and dilution, illustrating the effects of the dilution port turbulence on film cooling performance. It is found that dilution port injection can create significant effectiveness benefits at the difficult-to-cool vane stagnation region due to the more turbulent hot mainstream enhancing the mixing of film coolant jets that have left the airfoil surface. Also explored are the implications of endwall film cooling for infrared (IR) vane surface temperature measurements. The reduced endwall temperatures reduce the thermal emissions from this surface, so reducing the amount of extraneous radiation reflected from the vane surface where measurements are being made.

In order to ease this task, countries may use the experiences with the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) program. In this paper, lessons with TNAs since 2001 are described, and it is analyzed how countries, with a focus on developing countries, may use these lessons in strengthening and implementing their successive NDCs. While some developing countries have already used the results of their TNA process in their NDC development, countries could benefit from following the TNA process, its stakeholder involvement, and the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology, to strengthen their NDCs. Countries face challenges in their NDC with regard to the embedding of the contribution into the national development strategy, getting from plans to implementation, and the mobilization of finance. Through the positive and negative experiences with TNAs, countries can overcome these challenges. It is argued that all countries can use the TNA or parts thereof in their NDC process. For developing countries (mainly Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States) the TNA is useful for capacity building, strategy development, and the preparation of projects for investment with international support. Emerging markets and newly-industrialized countries can use the TNA as a participatory approach for strategy development. Developed countries generally do not need the entire TNA process, but the participatory approaches and MCDA can be used to fine-tune modeled strategies.

Our main result derives an optimal climate policy consisting of an emissions tax and a transfer policy. The optimal tax can be determined explicitly in our framework and is independent of any weights attached to the interests of different countries. Such weights only determine optimal transfers which distribute tax revenues across countries. We infer that the real political issue is not the tax policy required to reduce global warming but rather how the burden of climate change should be shared via transfer payments between different countries. We propose a simple transfer policy which induces a Pareto improvement relative to the Laissez faire solution.

Global and regional efforts by policymakers and donors to reduce deforestation need science-driven information on where forest loss is happening, and where it may happen in the future. We used spatially-explicit globally-consistent variables and global historical tree cover and loss to analyze how global- and regional-scale variables contributed to historical tree cover loss and to model future risks of tree cover loss, based on a business-as-usual scenario. Our results show that (1) some biomes have higher risk of tree cover loss than others; (2) variables related to tree cover loss at the global scale differ from those at the regional scale; and (3) variables related to tree cover loss vary by continent. By mapping both tree cover loss risk and potential future tree cover loss, we aim to provide decision makers and donors with multiple outputs to improve targeting of forest conservation investments. By making the outputs readily accessible, we anticipate they will be used in other modeling analyses, conservation planning exercises, and prioritization activities aimed at conserving forests to meet national and global climate mitigation targets and biodiversity goals. © 2019 by the authors.","Land change modeling; REDD+; Sustainable Development Goals; Tree cover loss; Tree cover loss projections",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060485663

A method to link precipitation with synoptic-scale fronts on sub-daily timescales is developed based on ERA-Interim data (1979–2016). A case study, a climatology and a trend analysis are presented and discussed. Spatially, an optimal attribution radius is identified based on a random sampling technique. The method is demonstrated using a past weather event that occurred over western Europe. Annual and seasonal cycles are presented and confirm, in agreement with previous studies, that frontal precipitation accounts for a large fraction of all precipitation (up to 80%) in the mid-latitudes, especially during autumn and winter. Finally, a negative trend in frontal precipitation is identified, mostly affecting the Gulf Stream region. Cold fronts drive most of the observed trends in this region and the trend pattern suggests a polewards displacement of the zone of enhanced precipitation. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","frontal climatology; frontal precipitation; fronts; mid-latitudes; North Atlantic storm track","Digital storage; Ocean currents; Precipitation (meteorology); Weather information services; Frontal precipitation; fronts; Fundamental features; Gulf Stream region; Midlatitudes; Storm track; Synoptic-scale fronts; Weather variability; Climatology; cold front; midlatitude environment; precipitation (climatology); storm track; synoptic meteorology; trend analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Europe; Gulf Stream",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052627484

However, recent field studies suggest that some coastal wetlands could also act as methane sinks, but the mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we investigated methane oxidation with different electron acceptors (i.e., oxygen, nitrate/nitrite, sulfate, Fe(III) and Mn(IV)) in four coastal wetlands in China using a combination of molecular biology methods and isotopic tracing technologies. The geochemical profiles and in situ Gibbs free energies suggest that there was significant nitrite-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (nitrite-AOM) in the sub-surface sediments; this was subsequently experimentally verified by both the microbial abundance and activity. Remarkably, the methanotrophic communities seemed to exist in the sediments as layered structures, and the surface aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria were able to take up atmospheric methane at a rate of 0.10–0.18 nmol CH4 day−1 cm−2, while most, if not all, sedimentary methane was being completely consumed by anaerobic methanotrophs (23–58% by methane oxidizers in phylum NC10). These results suggest that coastal methane sinks might be governed by diverse microbial communities where NC10 methane oxidizers contributed significantly. This finding helps to better understand and predict the coastal methane cycle and reduce uncertainties in the estimations of the global methane flux. A structured gradient of microbial methane oxidizers was discovered in coastal sediments, and sub-surface NC10 methane oxidizers were the dominant methane sink. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal ecosystem; Ecological niche; Methane cycle; Methanotrophic community; Nitrite-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (nitrite-AOM)","Aerobic bacteria; Anoxic sediments; Atmospheric chemistry; Ecosystems; Gibbs free energy; Iron compounds; Manganese compounds; Molecular biology; Molecular oxygen; Oxidation; Sulfur compounds; Wetlands; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Atmospheric methanes; Coastal ecosystems; Ecological niche; Geochemical profiles; Methane oxidizing bacterium; Methanotrophic community; Microbial communities; Methane; dissolved oxygen; ferric ion; manganese; methane; nitrate; nitrite; oxygen; sulfate; methane; nitric acid derivative; coastal sediment; coastal wetland; Gibbs free energy; methane; microbial activity; microbiology; niche; nitrite; oxidation; sediment chemistry; anaerobic metabolism; Article; chemical sink; China; coastal waters; controlled study; East China Sea; geochemistry; methanotroph; molecular biology; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; sediment; South China Sea; surface property; wetland; anaerobic growth; chemistry; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; China; Anaerobiosis; China; Ferric Compounds; Geologic Sediments; Manganese; Methane; Nitrates; Nitrites; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; Sulfates; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054918332

First, we discuss the motivation for zoning or layering catalysts and pioneering work on three-way catalyst (TWC) design for reducing gasoline engine emissions; then, we focus on the catalytic systems used for diesel exhaust aftertreatment. The configuration of the aftertreatment systems for diesel engines generally consist of an oxidation catalyst for hydrocarbon (HC), CO, and NO oxidation (over the DOC), a NOX reduction catalyst (over one or combined SCR/LNT/ASC catalysts), and a particulate matter (PM) filter (using a DPF).

The scientific data on temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, sea-level rise and global warming forms the evidence base for global climate agreements. Global scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and the global policies’ emphasis on Open Data to meet climate goals have motivated the world to implement Open Data policies. However, the existing Open Data initiatives for climate action largely focus on continental regions and nation states rather than urban areas. A new paradigm of city-level Open Data initiatives is needed to ensure that societies can develop place-based actions to moderate climate change. This is because global climate change has drastic consequences for cities. In this chapter, we review the relevance of Open Data in urban vulnerability management and empowering cities as ‘centres of action’.

Increasing the amount of organic matter addition to soils may not only mitigate GHG emissions, but also benefit agricultural productivity through improvements in soil health and environmental quality. One potential method for increasing the amount of C held in agricultural soil is through conversion of conventional tillage practices to conservation tillage practices that reduce tillage and retain crop residues. Vertisols in India occupy 8.1% of the total geographical area of the country and are generally low in organic carbon content, but these soils have great potential to increase the soil organic carbon (SOC) level. Improvement in SOC content in these soils through traditional/conventional soil management practices is very difficult, as it has already attained the equilibrium level. One of the most attainable pathways to improve and sequester SOC content in this soil is through either regular addition of organic manures such as farmyard manure, compost or crop residues or by switching traditional tillage practices to no-tillage or other forms of conservation tillage. Several long- and short-term field studies on Vertisols reported that management strategies, such as no-tillage (NT) and reduced tillage (RT) with residue retention, played a significant role in increasing SOC concentration and favouring aggregate stability. Adoption of conservation tillage practices resulted in an improvement of surface soil aggregation and an increase in the proportion of macroaggregates compared to conventional tillage. Conservation tillage increases the percentage of carbon-rich macroaggregates in the soil particularly in the surface layers, resulting in sequestration of more carbon into soil stabilized through physical protection. More aggregate-C in large and small macroaggregates favoured better aggregation under conservation tillage than that under conventional tillage, which suggested that macroaggregates are sensitive to changes in the soil microbial community associated with short-term conservation management practices. Conservation tillage also resulted in stratification of SOC and available nutrient levels in soil. Conservation tillage in tropical Vertisols could be a useful technology to partially mitigate the deleterious effect of climate change through sequestration of carbon into the soil and reduction of greenhouse gas emission from agricultural activities to atmosphere. It also improves soil health, its resilience to extraneous stresses and the sustainability of agricultural production system. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Carbon sequestration; Conservation tillage; Soil aggregate; Tropical vertisols",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084910053

Increasingly there is a need to address: inconsistencies in cost attribute selection; adjusting for uncertainties and costs; clarifying system boundaries; data sources; functional units and regional or temporal applicability of life-cycle frameworks. The current study focuses on a critical literature review of life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) research published in the last decade (post 2008) towards identification of research gaps. Accurately analysing all life-cycle stages, feedback loops, future cash and resource flows, and interlinking performance with overall sustainability can aid the decision-making process towards sustainable alternatives for constructing new, or rehabilitating existing roads. This review finds that the use of recycled materials, base/sub-base stabilisers and asphalt binder replacement has the potential of energy saving (≥34% or 3.1 TJ), mitigating landfill disposal issues, and greenhouse gas load reduction (≥34.5% CDE). Lack of real world LCCA-LCA application and stakeholder prejudice against recycled material usage are addressable by better stakeholder (decision-makers and road users) engagement via a social component.

Carbon dioxide emissions’ (CO2) unequal distribution globally is one of the many issues preventing climate justice. Efforts to reduce global CO2 impacts are vital for environmental justice efforts and a future free from climate change issues. Researchers have long been interested in how the rise of global governance initiatives, such as multilateral treaties, impact environmental outcomes across the world. However, little is known about how global governance concerning energy usage and technologies impacts CO2 emissions across the world. Using two-way fixed effects regression analysis from 1996 to 2011, we test how 24 multilateral environmental treaties with an energy focus impact CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 emissions as a percentage of gross domestic product, and total CO2 emissions for 162 nations. The multilateral energy treaties were collected from Ecolex. This analysis assesses how the legitimacy of global contracts may impact actual decreases in CO2 emissions, resulting in climate justice outcomes. Additionally, this analysis considers how factors of institutional state governance, including control of corruption, rule of law, political stability, government effectiveness, and regulatory quality moderate the impact of multilateral energy environmental treaties and CO2 emissions. We find that stocks of environmental treaty ratification are associated with decreases in all three types of CO2 emissions. Renewable energy consumption, GDP per capita, and urban and total population are associated with increased CO2 emissions. We also find some support for the idea that treaties are associated with larger decreases in emissions in nations with higher levels of state governance. Understanding how state accountability, transparency, and legitimacy factor into the effectiveness of multilateral environmental treaties on reducing CO2 emissions is essential to combating climate change issues. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon dioxide; Climate justice; Global governance; International treaties; Quantitative methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089831238

While untreated, residues emit greenhouse gases during the decomposition process. On the other hand, if efficiently utilized, these residues could be used to produce value-added products. This study investigates opportunities for harnessing the full potential of palm oil residues (i.e., empty fruit bunches, kernel shells, fiber, and mill effluent). As far as we are aware, the study is the first attempt to model the palm oil supply chain in a geographically explicit way while considering regional infrastructures in Sumatra Island, Indonesia. The BeWhere model, a mixed integer linear programming model for energy system optimization, was used to assess the costs and benefits of optimizing the regional palm oil supply chain. Different scenarios were investigated, considering current policies and new practices leading to improved yields in small-scale plantations and power grid connectivity. The study shows that a more efficient palm oil supply chain can pave the way for the country to meet up to 50% of its national bioenergy targets by 2025, and emission reductions of up to 40 MtCO 2 eq/year. As much as 50% of the electricity demand in Sumatra could be met if residues are efficiently used and grid connections are available. We recommend that system improvements be done in stages. In the short to medium term, improving the smallholder plantation yield is the most optimal way to maximize regional economic gains from the palm oil industry. In the medium to long term, improving electricity grid connection to palm oil mills could bring higher economic value as excess electricity is commercialized. © 2019 by the authors.","Oil palm; Palm oil mills; Palm oil residues; Spatial analysis; Supply chains optimization; Techno-economic analysis; Value-added products","Biomass; Economic analysis; Effluents; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Regional planning; Supply chains; Oil palm; Oil residues; Palm oil mills; Spatial analysis; Techno-Economic analysis; Value added products; Palm oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060947078

A common methodology is to calculate carbon emissions and conduct scenario simulations for the future. However, most Chinese cities have not implemented the methods for monitoring carbon emissions proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), especially Shenzhen, which is one of the fastest-growing cities in China. This study first calculated the carbon emissions for a typical year in Shenzhen under the guidance of the IPCC. Second, nighttime light data were used to spatialize the gross domestic product to obtain the economic benefit coefficients of the various land types. Finally, a multi-objective linear programming model was used to optimize the land-use structure under different scenarios for 2020 and 2025. The results show that (i) energy consumption contributed the most to local carbon emissions in 2016, at 94.75%; (ii) carbon emissions from paddy fields, animals, and humans were the second most dominant source; (iii) the intensity of carbon emissions from different land types in 2016 was variable; and (iv) compared with the natural scenario, an optimized land-use structure could reduce carbon emissions by 5.97% by 2020 and 12.61% by 2025.

In addition to the MRE, geological activity in the region has the potential to introduce massive quantities of radioactive ‘dead’ carbon into the freshwater system, resulting in a very large freshwater reservoir effect (FRE) that can offset radiocarbon ages on the order of a few thousand years. The radiocarbon dates of organisms that derive an unknown proportion of their carbon from both marine and freshwater reservoirs are extremely difficult to ‘correct’, or, more appropriately, model. The research not only highlights the complexities of dealing with multiple reservoirs, but also how important it is to develop models that are temporally and geographically relevant to the site under study.

A second technique infers willing-ness to pay for better air quality from an analysis of the housing market, on the presumption that individuals will pay more for a unit located in an area with good air quality than for an otherwise identical unit located in an area with poor air quality.This paper investigates the methodological problems associated with the housing market approach. While several studies have used this methodology to estimate the demand for air quality improvements, they have paid little attention to the sensitivity of the resultsto the assumptions embedded in the procedures. Using data for the Boston housing market, we generate quantitative estimates of the willingness to pay for air quality improvements and test the sensitivity of these results to alternative specifications of the basic building blocks in the procedure. Our data base is superior to others because it contains a large number of neighborhood variables (necessary to isolate the independent influence of air pollution) and more reliable air pollution data.. © Joseph Herriges and Catherine L.

Recognising the necessary cost of renewable and energy efficient infrastructures, and the ever-present constraints on public funds, this paper argues that finance is a critical node through which local governments advance decarbonisation in urban localities. While local decarbonisation strategies have been viewed cautiously for their potential to overburden individuals at the expense of more systematic and organisational change, this paper reveals a more complex picture. Drawing on decarbonisation initiatives in two Melbourne municipalities—Moreland and Darebin—it identifies four ways in which local governments are using public finance to achieve their sustainability objectives. Local governments are brokering bulk product purchases for residents; lending upfront capital for solar PV via local property taxes; purchasing energy efficient products and funding innovative technology pilots; and procuring renewable energy supply through multi-stakeholder power purchase agreements. By targeting lower income households and pooling resources with other organisations, the paper shows that local governments can address socio-economic inequality and facilitate extra-local change towards a low-carbon city. However, these incremental achievements emphasise the need for co-ordination and state engagement to realise decarbonisation at a meaningful scale. © 2018, © 2018 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.","cities; decarbonisation; Finance; governance; local government; Melbourne; urban political ecology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040995380

Focusing on members of the lichen genus Solenopsora, which are strongly linked to a Mediterranean-type climate, we aimed to depict their environmental niches in the Apennine Peninsula. This area represents their ecological optima, as well as the biogeographical centre of distribution. On the basis of occurrences of Solenopsora congeners, we identified the key ecological factors that shape their environmental niches. Applying an ensemble approach, which merges the results of Random Forest, GLM and MaxEnt algorithms, suitability maps were developed. These are mainly influenced by geological substratum, temperature and precipitation. Occurrence of Solenopsora taxa seems to be mainly governed by low variability in diurnal temperature and tolerance to dryness, with precipitation in the range of 0-20 mm in the driest month and a minimum temperature of >5 °C in the coldest month. The sensitivity to diurnal temperature, an important indicator for climate change, suggests that the taxa confined to Mediterranean bioclimatic types (i.e. Solenopsora grisea, S. marina, S. olivacea subsp. olbiensis and S. olivacea subsp. olivacea) might be good indicators of climatic stability. The geological substratum was a strong limiting factor and separated the taxa into three groups: those growing on calcareous, siliceous and ultramafic substrata. Limited co-occurrence of species confined to one of the three categories suggests that the level of niche differentiation is on a microhabitat level. Accounting for ecological requirements, the taxa differ in their tolerance to sub-optimal conditions. The ecological niches of a sister subspecies pair with different reproduction strategies, fertile S. olivacea subsp. olivacea and sorediate S. olivacea subsp. olbiensis, overlap strongly. However, habitat suitability for S. olivacea subsp. olbiensis is greater in areas with higher precipitation in the driest month, whereas S. olivacea subsp. olivacea is more restricted to warmer and drier areas. We also report new regional records for Italy and the first records of S. cesatii in Serbia and Ukraine, and of S. liparina in Serbia. © 2019 British Lichen Society.","climate change; climate envelope; distribution modelling; ecological biogeography; ensemble climatic modelling; symbiotic organisms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061779585

It is marked worldwide by a negative isotopic excursion of δ13C. The biotic changes associated with the PETM in marine realm include bloom of the dinoflagellate Apectodinium, turnover of larger foraminiferids, diversification of planktic foraminiferids, and carbonate dissolution of calcareous test shells, etc. while the geochemical changes include decrease in carbonates and increase in abundance of silicates and phyllosilicates, etc. Conspicuously, there has been no attempt to identify the PETM in the Himalaya even though some Himalayan sections are known to have Paleocene–Eocene transition beds. To fill this lacuna, we investigated the basal part of the late Paleocene–middle Eocene Subathu Group exposed at the village Kurla near Subathu in Himachal Pradesh (NW sub-Himalaya) for biotic, mineralogical, and geochemical signatures of this abrupt warming event. The significant results of this study include carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of 3.4‰, occurrence of index dinoflagellate genus Apectodinium, and carbonate dissolution of the larger benthic foraminiferids. The mineralogical changes noted across the Paleocene − Eocene transition include increase in quartz and phyllosilicates and decrease in carbonates. The geochemical changes include (i) increase in SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, and Fe2O3, (ii) decrease in CaCO3, (iii) decreasing trend of Si/Al, Fe/Al, and Mg/Al ratios, (iv) increasing trend of K/Al, Ti/Al, and Zr/Al ratios, (v) changes in trace element abundance, (vi) maximum chemical index of alteration (CIA) of 85–89%, and (vii) increase in abundance of rare earth elements. The aforementioned dataset is clearly very close to the PETM and even reflects its probable onset and peak phases, however, it is insufficient to definitively identify the PETM in the studied section.

However, carbon sequestered in agroforestry system depends on various factors like type of tree species, tree density, system age, soil and climate. One of the most important factors for enhancing carbon sequestration per unit land is tree density. Hardwickia binata Roxb. has been reported as suitable agroforestry tree species with multiple benefits in arid and semi-arid region, however, the role and impact of tree density in carbon sequestration is poorly reported. This study estimated impact of tree density (D1 = 333 tree ha-1 and D2 = 666 tree ha-1) on carbon sequestration potential of 30-year-old H. binata Roxb. + Cenchrus setigerus silvipasture system in hot semiarid region of Rajasthan. The carbon sequestered in tree biomass was estimated by reported allometric equations, whereas in soil it was determined by Walkley and Black method. Results showed significant impact of tree density on carbon sequestration per unit tree and per hectare land. The average biomass carbon sequestered by a tree was significantly more (44.5%) in low density (D1) compared to high density (D2) system. However, total biomass carbon sequestered per hectare land was significantly more (40.8%) in high density system (31.6 ± 12.6 Mg C ha-1). Carbon sequestered in soil organic matter was higher in both D1 and D2 systems compared to control (sole Cenchrus setigerus field).

It is a key issue and a difficult problem for government to design the pattern of involving individuals into PCT scheme. Based on the rank-dependent expected utility theory, game model and numerical simulation were employed to analyse the influences of the heterogeneous emotions of government and individuals on their equilibrium strategies about the pattern of implementing PCT scheme. The findings show that the emotions of government and individuals cannot influence the equilibrium of pure strategies, but do affect the equilibrium of the mixed strategy. Further analysis shows that the strategy of government can be influenced by individuals’ emotions, and government will move towards the “mandatory pattern” strategy when individuals are optimistic and towards the “voluntary pattern” strategy when individuals are pessimistic. Additionally, the strategy of individuals can be affected by government’s emotions, and individuals will move towards “rejection” strategy when government is optimistic and towards the “participation” strategy when government is pessimistic. Therefore, the most expected emotional state for government is to remain pessimistic and to keep individuals optimistic. This study demonstrated the effects of the heterogeneous emotions of government and individuals on the equilibrium strategies about the pattern of implementing PCT scheme, provided policy suggestions for the pattern of implementing PCT scheme, and contributed to the successful implementation of future PCT scheme as well as the achievement of global carbon emissions targets. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Game model; Mandatory pattern; Personal carbon trading; Rank-dependent expected utility; Voluntary pattern","carbon emission; computer simulation; emissions trading; game theory; governance approach; heterogeneity; numerical model; participatory approach; policy implementation; social behavior; state role; targeting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054307353

Our analysis of USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data shows that nearly 40% of the forestland in northern New England, USA, (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) is in an understocked condition when species desirability and tree form are considered. This understocked area does not contain sufficient stand-level density of current or potential future sawlog trees, of preferred or secondary commercial species, to be able to fully utilize the growing space of the site following 10 years’ growth (i.e., they are below the “C-line” in a stand stocking guide when desirable trees are considered). Although forests in the region show a slight trend of increased stocking, nearly all this increase comes from shade-tolerant hardwoods (e.g. Fagus grandifolia), trees with poor form (e.g. Acer rubrum), and from Abies balsamea which is subject to episodic eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) outbreaks. This degraded condition is likely the result of past management activities that have not considered long-term silvicultural objectives and may entail reduced resilience to many climate-related risks for forests and the ecosystem services they provide.

Eucalyptus globulus (EG) at 0% and 25% wood moisture was burning using a new controlled combustion chamber for emissions (3CE) to determine the emission factors of PM2.5, micrometer-sized particle numbers (0.265 μm to 34.00 μm) and 16 EPA-PAHs plus retene adsorbed on PM2.5 quartz filters. A method using accelerated solvent extraction, concentration, clean-up and GC–MS is proposed for determining emission factors for 16 EPA-PAHs for the concentration from biomass combustion. Chromatographic conditions and analytical steps were optimized in terms of linearity, selectivity, limits of detection and quantification, precision and accuracy. The recovery obtained from urban dust SRM 1649A (NIST reference material) analyses was between 63% (benzo[b]fluoranthene) and 102% (benzo[k]fluoranthene). In this investigation, it was shown that increasing the wood moisture in combustion tests decreased combustion efficiency (93% to 49%) and increased the emission factors of total PAHs (5215.47 ng g−1 to 7644.48 ng g−1), the gravimetric PM2.5 (2.01 g kg−1 to 22.90 g kg−1) and the total number of measured micrometer-sized particles (3.15 × 1012 particles kg−1 to 1.33 × 1013 particles kg−1) due to incomplete combustion. The PM2.5 emission rates (ERs) were estimated using EG at 0% WM (2.39 g −1 to 3.15 gh−1) and 25% WM (27.32 g h−1 to 35.77 g h−1) for three regions of Chile. In almost all regions, the Chilean emission regulations were exceeded for PM2.5 from wood combustion in the heater (stove with thermal power ≤8 kW and emission limit of 2.5 g h−1). Finally, when using wet wood for residential combustion, the amount of PAHs on the PM2.5 increased, presenting a potential hazard to population health. Therefore, improvements are necessary in the current regulation of PM emissions. © 2018","Combustion chamber; Emission factors; Emission rates PM2.5; Eucalyptus wood combustion; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Wood humidity","Air pollution; Combustion; Combustion chambers; Housing; Hydrocarbons; Micrometers; Mineral oils; Moisture; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Solvent extraction; Wood; Accelerated solvent extraction; Chromatographic conditions; Combustion efficiencies; Emission factors; Emission rates; Eucalyptus wood; Micrometer sized particles; Residential wood combustions; Particulate emissions; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; combustion; evergreen tree; humidity; moisture content; nanoparticle; PAH; particulate matter; wood; accuracy; analytic method; Article; biomass production; Chile; combustion; concentration (parameters); dust; Eucalyptus globulus; gravimetry; health hazard; limit of detection; mass fragmentography; measurement repeatability; moisture; particulate matter; priority journal; process optimization; reproducibility; solvent extraction; urban area; wood moisture; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Eucalyptus; humidity; particle size; particulate matter; wood; Chile; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus globulus; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Eucalyptus; Humidity; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051627210

However, policies to foster energy efficiency improvements have led to rising protests and conflicts because investments made into retrofitting became a means of speculation and displacement of low-income residents. Conflict theory emphasises the role of conflicts as drivers of social change; they open a window into how and by whom the legitimacy of existing rules and government is challenged. The paper uses social conflict theory to interpret the conflicting interests and issues at stake here. It concludes that what seemed to be a conflict between social and ecological goals, turns out to be a distributional conflict around affordable housing and against unjust distributions of cost burdens of energy transitions. The manifest conflicts between tenants and the housing industries were caused – or enabled – through the specific policy context. The state had imposed new norms for energy standards of buildings and left their economic consequences to be solved in the conflicts between housing companies and tenants. The legitimacy of these policies was challenged, especially the actual ecological effects – and thus the intention to reach the climate mitigation goals of the German government – are disputed. The conflicts described here stimulated the formation of interest groups, contributed to social movements and raised awareness to the social impacts of energy efficiency policies. Thus, the paper shows how much a clearer engagement of sustainability transition literature with conflicts and conflict theory is needed to better address justice issues in energy transitions. © 2019 The Authors","Energy efficiency; Energy poverty; Energy transition; Housing; Retrofitting; Social conflicts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085841010

This paper tests whether the 1970 Clean Air Act and its subsequent amendments caused this decline. The centerpiece of this legislation is the annual assignment of all counties to S02 nonattainment or attainment categories. Polluters face stricter regulations in nonattainment counties. There are two primary findings. First, regulators pay little attention to the statutory selection rule in their assignment of the S02 nonattainment designations. Second, S02 nonattainment status is associated with modest reductions in S02 air pollution, but a null hypothesis of zero effect generally cannot be rejected. This finding holds whether the estimated effect is obtained with linear adjustment or propensity score matching. Overall, the evidence suggests that the nonattainment designation played a minor role in the dramatic reduction of S02 concentrations over the last 30 years. © Jacqueline Geoghegan and Wayne Gray 2005.","Air pollution; Benefits of environmental regulation; Clean Air Act; Sulfur Dioxide",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092885655

Understanding the factors that limit or drive land carbon storage is therefore important for improving climate predictions. One potential limiting factor for land carbon uptake is soil moisture, which can reduce gross primary production through ecosystem water stress3,4, cause vegetation mortality5 and further exacerbate climate extremes due to land–atmosphere feedbacks6. Previous work has explored the impact of soil-moisture availability on past carbon-flux variability3,7,8. However, the influence of soil-moisture variability and trends on the long-term carbon sink and the mechanisms responsible for associated carbon losses remain uncertain. Here we use the data output from four Earth system models9 from a series of experiments to analyse the responses of terrestrial net biome productivity to soil-moisture changes, and find that soil-moisture variability and trends induce large CO2 fluxes (about two to three gigatons of carbon per year; comparable with the land carbon sink itself1) throughout the twenty-first century. Subseasonal and interannual soil-moisture variability generate CO2 as a result of the nonlinear response of photosynthesis and net ecosystem exchange to soil-water availability and of the increased temperature and vapour pressure deficit caused by land–atmosphere interactions. Soil-moisture variability reduces the present land carbon sink, and its increase and drying trends in several regions are expected to reduce it further. Our results emphasize that the capacity of continents to act as a future carbon sink critically depends on the nonlinear response of carbon fluxes to soil moisture and on land–atmosphere interactions. This suggests that the increasing trend in carbon uptake rate may not be sustained past the middle of the century and could result in accelerated atmospheric CO2 growth. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; water; carbon dioxide transport; carbon footprint; carbon metabolism; carbon sink; concentration (parameter); evapotranspiration; land use; Letter; photosynthesis; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; vapor pressure; vegetation; water availability; water stress; atmosphere; autotrophy; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; cell respiration; chemistry; ecosystem; geographic mapping; humidity; metabolism; plant; season; soil; Atmosphere; Autotrophic Processes; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Cell Respiration; Ecosystem; Geographic Mapping; Humidity; Photosynthesis; Plants; Seasons; Soil; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060381925

One approach is to proxy willingness to pay by measuring either the added cost to society from increased air pollution, or equivalently the reduced costs associated with air quality improvement."" A second technique infers willing-ness to pay for better air quality from an analysis of the housing market, on the presumption that individuals will pay more for a unit located in an area with good air quality than for an otherwise identical unit located in an area with poor air quality.This paper investigates the methodological problems associated with the housing market approach. While several studies have used this methodology to estimate the demand for air quality improvements, they have paid little attention to the sensitivity of the resultsto the assumptions embedded in the procedures. Using data for the Boston housing market, we generate quantitative estimates of the willingness to pay for air quality improvements and test the sensitivity of these results to alternative specifications of the basic building blocks in the procedure.

Mean annual TOC concentrations in the Narew River basin were higher than 10–11 mg C L −1 which is similar to nemoral or Baltic rivers. The maximal monthly TOC concentrations occurred in May with a one-month delay from the spring maximum of water outflow. High TOC concentrations were accompanied by naturally increased organic nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations resulting in decreased water quality class despite the anthropogenic pressure is low. Mean annual export of TOC from the Narew River catchment amounted to 2.15 g C m −2 , which is nearly 25% higher than for the Vistula River, the recipient. TOC export form the analysed river basin in dry years was 30% lower and 50% higher in wet years than the multiannual average. The primary cause of high TOC concentrations in the Narew River catchment and high TOC export is the occurrence of biogeochemically active wetlands, functioning not only thanks to spring flooding of the valleys, but also based on permanent intensive groundwaters supply from surrounding plateaus. This emphasises the importance of basin hydrology in the regulation of carbon cycling in the temperate lowland catchments. Our results also indicate that in environmental zonation of Europe Narew River catchment should be classified as belonging to the Baltic Province (Nemoral environmental zone) rather then to Continental zone. This is because it is characterized with high riverine TOC concentrations and natural water oxygen depletion in summers.

However, in order to maximize outcomes, both scholars and practitioners are increasingly calling for more integrated and synergetic approaches. Unfortunately, related research remains scarce and fragmented, and there is a lack of systematic investigation into the necessary institutional conditions and processes. Against this background, this paper develops a framework to assess and support the joint institutionalization of climate adaptation and mitigation—here called adaptigation—in city administrations. This pioneering framework draws upon four key features of bureaucracies: organizational structure, visions and goals, actors, and technology and tools. Illustrated by pilot applications to the cities of Würzburg (Germany) and Mwanza (Tanzania), the framework provides a robust basis for future research, policy recommendations, and the development of context-specific guidelines for national and local decision-makers and officials. It highlights the importance of (i) clearly defined procedures for the implementation of adaptigation into urban planning processes (e.g., with the active involvement of stakeholders in the form of working groups or roundtable discussions), (ii) locally relevant goals and visions, established in collaboration with stakeholders, and (iii) the creation of mitigation and adaptation structures that are supported by the appropriate level of human resources, both within and outside city administrations. In this context, global, supranational, and national institutions play an important role in supporting institutionalization by providing targeted funding and promoting adaptigation, which requires the development of integrated goals, visions, and legislation. © 2018, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate policy integration; Institutionalization; Mainstreaming; Mitigation; Municipal planning; Urban planning","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; environmental policy; human resource; integrated approach; policy implementation; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban area; urban planning; Germany; Mwanza [Tanzania]; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059554587

The model is based on the implementation of calculations on the thermal conversion of biomass in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) environment to solve the gas phase. The mass, energy and species balances and reactions that take place in the biomass packed bed are introduced in a porous region inside the computational domain of the boiler. The biomass thermal conversion is combined with other submodels, such as radiation transport, gas transport and chemical reactions, to solve the complex combustion phenomena with relatively little computational effort. The model is tested by comparing two different simulations with their respective experimental tests. Parameters relative to the boiler thermal performance and contaminant emissions are compared with reasonably good results. The potential of the model to analyze different operation conditions of a boiler is applied to the theoretical study of the effect of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the boiler performance and the gas contaminant emissions. For this study, several simulations of a boiler fed with pure oxygen are performed by changing the EGR fraction and the oxygen excess. The results of the study show that the EGR effect can increase the boiler thermal performance, especially for low oxygen excess values. This effect also reduces the NOx emissions for low oxygen excess values. EGR does not seem to have any significant effect on CO emissions. © 2018","Biomass combustion; CFD modeling; EGR; Thermal performance","Biomass; Boilers; Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Oxygen; Packed beds; Biomass combustion; Biomass thermal conversion; CFD modeling; Combustion phenomena; Computational domains; Contaminant emissions; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Thermal Performance; Exhaust gas recirculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055323226

This analysis of the literature, using a new methodological framework, highlights priority focus areas for a sub-national government response to health and climate change, using the Western Cape (WC) province of South Africa as a case study. Methods: A methodological framework was created to conduct a review of priority focus areas relevant for sub-national governments. The framework encompassed the establishment of a Project Steering Group consisting of relevant, sub-national stakeholders (e.g. provincial officials, public and environmental health specialists and academics); an analysis of local climatic projections as well as an analysis of global, national and sub-national health risk factors and impacts. Results: Globally, the discussion of health and climate change adaptation strategies in sub-national, or provincial government is often limited. For the case study presented, multiple health risk factors were identified. WC climatic projections include a warmer and potentially drier future with an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. WC government priority focus areas requiring further research on health risk factors include: population migration and environmental refugees, land use change, violence and human conflict and vulnerable groups. WC government priority focus areas for further research on health impacts include: mental ill-health, non-communicable diseases, injuries, poisonings (e.g. pesticides), food and nutrition insecurity-related diseases, water- and food-borne diseases and reproductive health. These areas are currently under-addressed, or not addressed at all, in the current provincial climate change strategy. Conclusions: Sub-national government adaptation strategies often display limited discussion on the health and climate change intersect. The methodological framework presented in this case study can be globally utilized by other sub-national governments for decision-making and development of climate change and health adaptation strategies. Additionally, due to the broad range of sectoral issues identified, a primary recommendation from this study is that sub-national governments internationally should consider a “health and climate change in all policies” approach when developing adaptation and mitigation strategies to address climate change. © 2018 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate health impacts; Environmental health; Low- and middle-income countries; Sub-national","Chemical contamination; Decision making; Health; Health risks; Land use; Population dynamics; Risk assessment; Adaptation; Environmental health; Health impact; Low and middle income countries; Sub-national; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; health impact; health risk; risk factor; stakeholder; state role; case study; climate change; environmental decision making; environmental health; environmental impact; food insecurity; food poisoning; government; human; injury; intoxication; land use; low income country; mental disease; middle income country; non communicable disease; priority journal; refugee; reproductive health; risk factor; South African; water borne disease; environmental monitoring; public health; South Africa; South Africa; Western Cape; Climate Change; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Public Health; South Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058502273

In this case the growth in the global vehicle number and environmental issues requires to reducing the exhaust emissions. The main problem is exhaust emission of vehicles in the city centres but not only, also in extra - urban conditions. Therefore, the focus is on reducing the number of vehicles with significant exhaust emissions and introducing vehicles using alternative fuels. The aim of the article is to present differences in emissions of exhaust gas pollutants using CNG and conventional fuels, from heavy and light vehicles in real traffic conditions. CNG is considered as an alternative fuel. In Poland is during operation relatively large fleet of vehicles with CNG engines, including buses and passenger cars. An in-depth knowledge of the emissivity of such vehicles is a very important issue. The paper presents too, tests under real traffic conditions two city buses that meet the Euro VI emission standards. Diesel engine of the first bus, was fuelled by diesel oil. Spark ignition engine, of the second bus, was fuelled CNG. Tests buses were conducted in real traffic conditions using PEMS devices. The article presents the comparative results of exhaust emission of passenger car with engine fuelled petrol or CNG, during tests D1 and D2 on the chassis dynamometer, tests registered earlier in real traffic conditions.

The Clean Air Act and associated rules have led to decreases in emissions and deposition of oxidized N, especially in eastern U.S., representing a research challenge and opportunity for ecosystem ecologists and biogeochemists. The purpose of this paper is to predict changes in the structure and function of North American forest ecosystems in a future of decreased N deposition. Hysteresis is a property of a system wherein output is not a strict function of corresponding input, incorporating lag, delay, or history dependence, particularly when the response to decreasing input is different from the response to increasing input. We suggest a conceptual hysteretic model predicting varying lag times in recovery of soil acidification, plant biodiversity, soil microbial communities, forest carbon (C) and N cycling, and surface water chemistry toward pre-N impact conditions. Nearly all of these can potentially respond strongly to reductions in N deposition. Most responses are expected to show some degree of hysteresis, with the greatest delays in response occurring in processes most tightly linked to “slow pools” of N in wood and soil organic matter. Because experimental studies of declines in N loads in forests of North America are lacking and because of the expected hysteresis, it is difficult to generalize from experimental results to patterns expected from declining N deposition. These will likely be long-term phenomena, difficult to distinguish from other, concurrent environmental changes, including elevated atmospheric CO2, climate change, reductions in acidity, invasions of new species, and long-term vegetation responses to past disturbance. Nitrogen (N)-impacted forest ecosystems are predicted to exhibit a time lag of varying duration toward recovery initiated by current declines in atmospheric N deposition. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clean Air Act; Decreased nitrogen deposition; Eastern deciduous forest; Forest ecosystems; Nitrogen biogeochemistry","Air quality standards; Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric chemistry; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Hysteresis; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Soils; Surface waters; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Clean air act; Deciduous forest; Forest ecosystem; Nitrogen deposition; Soil microbial community; Surface-water chemistry; Forestry; carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; organic matter; surface water; carbon; nitrogen; water; atmospheric deposition; biogeochemistry; deciduous forest; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; forest ecosystem; hysteresis; nitrogen; pollution control; atmospheric deposition; biodiversity; carbon cycling; climate change; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; forest; hysteresis; microbial community; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen deposition; North America; plant biodiversity; prediction; Review; soil acidification; soil microflora; species invasion; vegetation; analysis; atmosphere; carbon cycle; chemistry; climate change; forest; metabolism; nitrogen cycle; physiology; plant; plant physiology; soil; theoretical model; tree; United States; United States; Atmosphere; Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Forests; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; Soil; Trees; United States; Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055975326

The challenging part is on achieving the stringent emission norms without compromising the engine fuel economy, performance and NVH factors. Selection of hardware and attaining an optimal behaviour is therefore vital. This article focuses on the evaluation of three different configuration of turbochargers for the same engine to meet the BS6 emission norms and performance. The turbocharger samples used measure the same compressor diameter with varying trim ratios. Simulation and testing of turbochargers ensured positive results for confirmation of the system. Parameters like low speed torque, smoke and compressor efficiency were evaluated and analysed for all configurations. The safe limits of surge and choke regions of all the compressors were also studied and verified. Influence of varying compressor trim on the performance and emissions were examined thoroughly in this work. Full throttle performance and 14 mode test for emissions concluded that the performance and emission parameters were satisfactory with all the turbochargers.

Most agricultural soils in temperate regions have now lost as much as 60% of their SOC, and as much as 75% in tropical regions, due to conversion from natural ecosystems to agricultural uses and mainly due to continuous soil degradation. Sequestering C can help to offset C emissions from fossil fuel combustion and other C-emitting activities, while also enhancing soil quality and long-term agronomic productivity. However, developing effective policies for creating terrestrial C sinks is a serious challenge in tropical and subtropical soils, due to the high average annual temperatures in these regions. It can be accomplished by implementing improved land management practices that add substantial amounts of biomass to soil, cause minimal soil disturbance, conserve soil and water, improve soil structure, and enhance soil fauna activity. Continuous no-till crop production is arguably the best example. These soils need technically sound and economically feasible strategies to sustainably enhance their SOC pools. Hence, this book provides comprehensive information on SOC and its management in different land-use systems, with a focus on preserving soils and their ecosystem services.

Soil organic carbon (SOC), a key component of the global C pool, plays an important role in C cycling, regulating climate, water supplies, and biodiversity, and therefore in providing the ecosystem services that are essential to human being. The global soil carbon (C) pool amounts to 2500 Gt, whereas the biotic pool is only 560 Gt. Most agricultural soils in temperate regions have lost as much as 60% of SOC and as much as 75% in tropical regions, mainly due to conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural uses. On a global scale, C loss from soils is mainly associated with soil degradation, including accelerated erosion and mineralization, and land-use change and has amounted to 78 ± 12 Gt since 1850. Review of work revealed that carbon sequestration is the highest in the short-rotation young forest of fast-growing hardwood tree species with regular leaf shedding pattern in humid condition. Enhancing carbon sequestration in terrestrial pool could have direct environmental, economic, and social benefits for people thereby mitigating the effect of global climate change. Mechanisms of protection and dynamics of SOC in mixed forest soil, factors affecting carbon storage in mixed forest plantation, potential of carbon storage in different forest types, determination of carbon storage in different trees, and a case study of subtropical mixed forest have been focused in this chapter. Mixed forest management practices that sequester carbon and increase productivity has also been discussed, besides new areas of research to mitigate the impact on changing climate and global environment. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Carbon sequestration; Management practices; Mixed forest; Protection mechanism",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084864376

The purpose of this study is to predict the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge in an arid environment in Ilam Province, west of Iran. Design/methodology/approach: A three-dimensional transient groundwater flow model (modular finite difference groundwater FLOW model: MODFLOW) was used to simulate the impacts of three climate scenarios (i.e. an average of a long-term rainfall, predicted rainfall in 2015-2030 and three years moving average rainfall) on groundwater recharge and groundwater levels. Various climate scenarios in Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator were applied to predict weather data. Findings: HadCM3 climatic model and A2 emission scenario were selected as the best methods for weather data generation. Based on the results of these models, annual precipitation will decrease by 3 per cent during 2015-2030. For three emission scenarios, i.e. an average of a long-term rainfall, predicted rainfall in 2015-2030 and three years moving average rainfall, precipitation in 2030 is estimated to be 265, 257 and 247 mm, respectively. For the studied aquifer, predicted recharge will decrease compared to recharge calculated based on the average of long-term rainfall. Originality/value: The decline of groundwater level in the study area was 11.45 m during the past 24 years or 0.48 m/year. Annual groundwater depletion should increase to 0.75 m in the coming 16 years via climate change. Climate change adaptation policies in the basin should include changing the crop type, as well as water productivity and irrigation efficiency enhancement at the farm and regional scales. © 2019, Reza Ghazavi and Haidar Ebrahimi.","Arid environment; Climate change; Groundwater recharge; LARS; MODFLOW","arid environment; climate change; climate effect; finite difference method; flow modeling; groundwater; groundwater flow; modeling; prediction; rainfall; recharge; water level; England; Ilam; Iran; Long Ashton; North Somerset; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045038261

Vacant lands are common in the urban landscape, particularly in sprawling cities. In this paper, we hypothesized that by increasing the attractivity of urban vacant land through urban green space development, residential development will intensify within the city boundaries, enhancing the concept of a compact city as opposed to urban sprawl and simultaneously negating urban densification. Planning new urban green spaces increases the efficiency of the urban green infrastructure and provides ecosystem services. We used analytical hierarchy processes to determine criteria to be deemed necessary when planning new urban green spaces. We also determined the suitability of 27 types of green spaces being part of an urban green infrastructure and assessed green areas recommendations for five urban zones. Finally, we identified available vacant land for potential future urban green spaces in Ploieşti, Romania. Our results have demonstrated that criteria such as biodiversity conservation, climate change regulation, and air quality improvement are to be adopted when planning new urban green spaces. Natural features are to be included, thus urban forests, transitional ecosystem, or local natural reserves are suitable in providing the desired ecosystem services in urban areas. Land availability assessments disclosed the locations and areas of presently available tracks.

However, their establishment in subtropical areas frequently involves the replacement of a species-rich forest by a tree monoculture with exotic species, which may be functionally different from native species. The impact of this change on ecosystem processes is still widely unknown. In Argentina, large portions of the Semideciduous Atlantic Forest were replaced by non-native Pinus taeda monocultures. The P. taeda litter has lower quality and a slower decomposition rate than native plant litter. Therefore, this replacement would change the characteristic of the litter that reaches the ground. Litter quality is one of the major drivers of decomposition. In the transitional area between two different environments, the edge effect influences populations and communities and could affect ecosystem processes due to changes in its drivers. We wonder how ecosystem processes, as litter decomposition and litterfall production, will respond from the forest edge into the exotic pine monocultures. In five P. taeda plantations and five sites in native forest, we established litter traps to estimate litterfall and litterbags to estimate pine litter decay rate. Litter layer thickness and necromass were also estimated. The change of these variables along a distance gradient from the forest edge into the pine plantation was studied in 10 points at different distances from the edge (0–300 m). Comparisons of these variables between P. taeda plantations and native forest were also done. Native forest replacement by P. taeda monocultures changed the litter identity that reached the ground and decreased the pine litter decomposition rate. The litter layer necromass increased towards the interior of P. taeda plantations, consistently with the increase in pine litterfall. Within the pine plantation, the distance to the native forest edge had no effect on the litterfall neither on pine litter decomposition rates. However, the increase in litter layer necromass towards the interior of plantations suggests that the presence of native forest contiguous to pine plantations in the Semideciduous Atlantic Forest favors litter layer decomposition.

The investigation refers to the city of Rome and considers an environmental-friendly crowdshipping based on the use of the mass transit network of the city, where customers/crowdshippers pick-up/drop-off goods in automated parcel lockers located either inside the transit stations or in their surroundings. Crowdshippers are passengers that would use the transit network anyhow for other activities (e.g., home-to-work), thus avoiding additional trips. The study requires firstly, estimating the willingness to buy a crowdshipping service like the one proposed here, in order to quantify the potential demand. The estimation is realized adopting an extensive stated preference survey and discrete choice modeling. Then, several scenarios with different features of the service are proposed and evaluated up to 2025 in terms of both externalities (local and global pollutant emissions, noise emissions and accidents reductions) and revenues. The results are useful to understand and quantify the potential of this strategy for last mile B2C deliveries. Moreover, it provides local policy-makers and freight companies with a good knowledge base for the future development of a platform for public transport-based crowdshipping and for estimating the likely impact the system could have both from an economic and environmental point of view. © 2018 by the authors.","COPERT; Crowdshipping; Discrete choice model; E-commerce; On demand; Transport externalities; Urban freight","attitudinal survey; discrete choice analysis; economic impact; electronic commerce; environmental impact; estimation method; future prospect; logistics; public transport; shipping; strategic approach; sustainability; urban area; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059345583

Soil-air total gaseous mercury (TGM) fluxes from four-sewage and one-fresh water irrigated farmlands were determined simultaneously. During maize-wheat rotation, soil-air TGM fluxes showed patterns of both emission and deposition during different growth stages. It enhanced one-order of magnitude emission with increased Hg contamination from historical sewage irrigation. A linear response relationship of TGM fluxes with soil Hg concentration was found, which showed greater TGM emission potential comparing with those from forest and urban soils. However, the ratio of soil-air TGM flux in daytime to nighttime were 3.94 in maize-season and 3.41 in wheat-season, respectively, which were little related to the change in soil Hg concentration. Furthermore, soil temperature and moisture, ambient-air TGM concentration all effected TGM evasion from sewage-irrigated soils. The data presented here suggest that evasion of TGM from historical sewage irrigation farmlands with high Hg concentrations may be potential hotspots for Hg emission in atmosphere, and it was likely to underestimate Hg emissions from farmlands in existing emissions inventory. Additional regional-investigations and process-level researches are needed to better understand role of sewage irrigation farmlands in local-global Hg-biogeochemical-cycles. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

These plans affected society at all levels and have now reached a zenith in terms of ecological, environmental, energy, and economic outcomes.Anew power law was enacted to govern the Chinese Electricity sector. The central government intent is to decentralize energy generation, transmission, and storage through the formulation of policies which affect energy generation through tighter supervisory controls, through innovation and economic rebates and aid. These new provisions are targeted to slow down the rate of energy consumption and enable the transition of China to an electricity generator based on renewables including hydroelectric, biomass natural gas, and nuclear with a lesser reliance on coal-fired electricity generation. The policies are derived from earlier noticed in area of electricity generation, transmission, and environmental protection. The formulated policies using southernChina as a test casemigrated fromgeneral pronouncements to specific policy outcomes; the acceptance of which is based on the level of gain, fairness, and transparency. Heavy electricity users can buy directly from the power generator competitive rates; however, the social justice principle ensures that users who do not choose to participate in the electricity market are quoted prices that are not at far higher levels than high volume users. Also, there needs to be tighter integration between the supply and return of investment or rebates either at the government or province-level to ensure transparency and fairness to supply. To meet the ambitious targets of decarbonization and environmental goal’s, the policymakers have allowed the local municipalities meet the projected targets using local knowledge, expertise, and resources; however, more research and development (R & D), technical assistance, and workforce training are required tomeet the new policies scenario by 2040. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084865364

This article examines Henan Province, which features agricultural production and biogas projects typical of China. The aim was to identify the problems associated with the use of current agricultural waste in biogas production and provide suggestions for future biogas developments via comparisons of the potential of agricultural wastes with biogas project construction. Straw and manure volumes were analyzed by using crop yields and livestock production to calculate the biogas potential and the status quo was reflected through biogas project data. Subsequently, biogas potential and projects were analyzed from quantitative and spatial perspectives and a benefit evaluation was conducted. The results indicate that Henan Province has abundant straw and manure resources with large biogas potential, and that making good use of these wastes would have a good emission reduction effect and economic advantages, but there are presently large differences between the actual production and biogas potential. This paper analyzes the possible causes of this discrepancy, including resource utilization and biogas project operations. Lastly, countermeasures were proposed, such as developing matching technologies, improving relevant policies, and improving ecological-economic benefits to enhance future biogas project development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture waste; Biogas potential; China; Countermeasures; Resource utilization","Agriculture; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Manures; Radar countermeasures; Agricultural productions; Agriculture wastes; China; Ecological economics; Economic advantages; Livestock production; Matching technology; Resource utilizations; Biogas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055055763

This paper investigates the impact of changes in environmental regulation stringency on industrial-level carbon productivity growth in China. Through utilizing the information entropy method, a new index of environmental regulation stringency is established by taking into account the effects of both pollution reduction consequences and pollution reduction measures. In addition, based on the data envelopment analysis method, a Malmquist carbon productivity index is proposed to estimate the industrial carbon productivity growth of 21 major industrial sectors in China’s 30 provinces over 2004–2014. Finally, an econometric regression model is applied to test the synergistic effects of environmental regulations on carbon productivity in China’s major industrial sectors. The results show that (1) a stringent environmental regulation is associated with an increase in overall industrial carbon productivity growth in China; (2) there exist significant pass-through effects in China’s major industrial sectors that technology can transmit effectively from leader to follower; (3) there also exist obvious follow-up effects in China’s major industrial sectors, i.e., the industrial sectors that have larger technological gaps with the leaders catch up faster than others; and (4) the environmental regulations have different effects on industrial sectors with different polluting levels, i.e., there is a positive linear relationship between environmental regulation stringency and industrial-level carbon productivity growth in low-polluting industrial sectors, a parabolic nonlinear relationship between them in high-polluting industrial sectors, and an inverted U-shaped relationship between them in moderate-polluting industrial sectors. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","China’s industrial sector; Environmental regulation; Industrial heterogeneity; Pollution intensity; Total factor carbon productivity","carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; industrial emission; regulatory framework; total factor productivity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052106078

The technical characteristics of residential buildings related to their energy performance (insulation, type of openings, system for space heating and cooling, etc.), the actual energy use (kWh.m−2.year−1) and the environmental factors (kgCO₂.m−2.year−1) related to energy consumption, are some of the parameters of this survey. The average annual specific energy consumption of residential buildings in Greece was 112 kWh·m−2·year−1 in 2014, the 6th lower consumption among the 28 European member states (EU-28) in which the average residential building energy consumption is of about 158.8 kWh·m−2·year−1. The potential of space heating energy conservation for Greek residential buildings was estimated, based on (i) the 2011 heating energy consumption data and (ii) the percentages of space heating energy conservation, calculated by analysing 144 different types of residential buildings, having various geometric and technical characteristics, such as the A/V ratio (envelope area to volume of building), the heating degree hours (HDHs) and various occupancy profiles. The resulting average actual energy consumption is much lower than that calculated using Heating Degree Hours (HDHs) or the method of Hellenic Building Energy Performance Regulation (REPB). Almost 45% of these buildings were built before 1980, without any thermal insulation or double glazing. The compliance of these buildings to the minimum requirements of the REPB (related to thermal insulation and the efficiency of their electromechanical systems), could result to about 24.4 TWh of savings in space heating energy annually, i.e. to about 32–175 kWh·m−2·year−1, depending on the climate zone that corresponds to 8.5–46.2 kgCO₂·m−2·year−1 reduction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Buildings’ elements characteristics; CO₂ emissions; Energy conservation; Energy performance; Energy use in European and Hellenic residential building stock; GHG","Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Historic preservation; Housing; Space heating; Thermal insulation; Building energy performance; Electromechanical systems; Energy performance; Environmental characteristic; Heating energy consumption; Residential building energies; Residential building stocks; Specific energy consumption; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056213317

It is of interest to many practitioners including meteorologists, city planners and climatologists. QF estimates at fine temporal and spatial resolution can be derived from models that use varying amounts of empirical data. This study compares simple and detailed models in a European megacity (London) at 500 m spatial resolution. The simple model (LQF) uses spatially resolved population data and national energy statistics. The detailed model (GQF) additionally uses local energy, road network and workday population data. The Fractions Skill Score (FSS) and bias are used to rate the skill with which the simple model reproduces the spatial patterns and magnitudes of QF, and its sub-components, from the detailed model. LQF skill was consistently good across 90% of the city, away from the centre and major roads. The remaining 10% contained elevated emissions and “hot spots” representing 30–40% of the total city-wide energy. This structure was lost because it requires workday population, spatially resolved building energy consumption and/or road network data. Daily total building and traffic energy consumption estimates from national data were within ± 40% of local values. Progressively coarser spatial resolutions to 5 km improved skill for total QF, but important features (hot spots, transport network) were lost at all resolutions when residential population controlled spatial variations. The results demonstrate that simple QF models should be applied with conservative spatial resolution in cities that, like London, exhibit time-varying energy use patterns. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; data set; energy use; heat flux; megacity; model; population density; spatial resolution; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041534640

The empirical part of the exegesis traces the experiential learning amongst 12 European citizen diplomats who have engaged China in the activity fields of disability; psychoanalysis; non-governmental organisation twinning; human rights; climate change mitigation; welfare of orphans, abandoned disabled children and young people; youth dialogue; public participation; animal welfare; and inclusive performing arts. The final part makes use of the newly developed hexagon of intercultural communication and collaboration competence to reveal how the European citizen diplomats have managed to navigate the sometimes-treacherous political-administrative landscape in mainland China. European citizen diplomats have made manifold and often surprising contributions to China’s multifaceted development. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063953816

However, the work hours elasticity of carbon emissions remains uncertain despite a growing number of empirical analyses. This paper estimates the impact of work hours on emissions using household data from the United States. We calculate the carbon intensity of goods using input-output tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which we combine with spending data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate carbon footprints for a representative sample of U.S. households. There is strong evidence that households with longer work hours emit more CO2, but our household-level estimate of the work hours elasticity of carbon emissions is lower than most country-level estimates. Our results suggest that differences in work hours account for a small fraction of differences in per capita carbon footprints across high-income countries. Highlights Households with longer work hours have significantly larger carbon footprints. Our estimated household-level work hours elasticity is smaller than most country-level estimates. Work hour reduction policies likely generate modest reductions in carbon emissions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; degrowth; Greenhouse gas emissions; sustainability; work hours",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068064439

The results show that the livestock sector will be vital to achieve emission reductions consistent with the 1.5 °C target mainly through emission-reducing technologies or structural changes. Agriculture may contribute emission reductions of 0.8–1.4 Gt of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) yr−1 at just US$20 per tCO2e in 2050. Combined with dietary changes, emission reductions can be increased to 1.7–1.8 GtCO2e yr−1.

It focuses on current practices related to promoting the use of sustainable construction materials and on barriers to environmental requirements in construction, in particular environmental performance requirements based on LCA procedures. Municipalities were surveyed about the existence of municipal policies dealing with environmental issues in construction, the knowledge level about these issues, and the measures and requirements used to promote materials with low climate change impact. The survey was followed by semi-structured interviews about current practices and barriers to environmental requirements in construction. Results show that large municipalities are more likely to have dedicated policies and implement more measures than their smaller counterparts. However, willingness to implement future measures and knowledge of sustainable construction do not vary significantly with municipality population. Efforts are often limited to procurement, municipal construction projects and discussions with stakeholders. When requirements are set, they are almost always based on prescribing a technical solution (e.g. use of timber) rather than assessing environmental performance (e.g. calculating greenhouse gases emissions with a LCA tool). Measures that municipalities can take as public authorities are restricted by the law, which remains ambiguous as to the legality of environmental performance requirements. Legal issues, limited knowledge and resources appear to be the main barriers to environmental performance requirements in construction. A strategy is proposed to overcome these issues. After setting appropriate targets and securing resources, the municipality should establish dialogue with developers and constructors. It should then require them to provide inventory data for new construction projects. The municipality should make sure appropriate guidance and standardised methods are available. Information requirements should be strengthened over time, and practitioners should progressively become familiar with data collection and LCA methods. When data and knowledge gaps are filled, the municipality can set environmental performance requirements for new buildings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change impact; Construction; Environmental requirement; LCA; Municipality; Policy","Building materials; Construction; Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Public policy; Surveys; Sustainable development; Climate change impact; Environmental performance; Environmental requirement; Greenhouse gases emissions; Information requirement; Municipality; Semi structured interviews; Sustainable construction; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056186787

(2018). This alternative approach captures past relationships between climate data indices (CDIs), such as cumulative rainfall, and hydrological data indices (HDIs), such as 7-day low flows, and applies these relationships to assess future trends. Future climates were built for two emission scenarios, RCP-4.5 and − 8.5, and the uncertainty of climate change was addressed through the use of 16 climate models. Overall, both methodological frameworks predicted similar low flow trends for the reference and future horizons (2016–2045 and 2046–2075). The future pressure on the surface water supply of Québec City should raise concerns. Indeed, for RCP-8.5, results indicated a decrease in the PI 1 values (ratio of 2-year low flow to water abstraction rate) of around 20% (2016–2045) and 35% (2046–2075) with a fairly high confidence (around 90% of models agreeing on the direction of change); leading to values less than 1; indicating an insufficient water supply with respect to available water during 2-year low flows. These results demonstrate the capacity of the method to provide a screening assessment of future drought-prone-watersheds. Furthermore, the application of the alternative approach, given climate simulations, would help early implementation of good management practices even for municipalities that do not have the capacities to conduct the more conventional approach. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","7-day low flow; Drinking water supply; HYDROTEL; Pressure on water resources; Statistical framework","Climate change; Climate models; Potable water; Water supply; Conventional approach; Cumulative rainfall; HYDROTEL; Low flow; Management practices; Methodological frameworks; Screening assessment; Statistical framework; Surface waters; assessment method; climate change; drinking water; sensitivity analysis; surface water; water management; water resource; water supply; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Quebec [Quebec (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054152921

Among these, an international comparison realised by two Australians has shown that car use in large cities is more important if the density is low. Since density is partly responsible for the car ownership, it is interesting to measure the recent trends of the spatial distribution of population, for the 1300 zones of the Paris Region. The increase of car ownership per person thus is six to seven times more rapid in low density than in high density zones. The separation of the functions in the urban region is additionally responsible for the increasing importance of the car as the mode of transport. Urban densification can reduce total emissions, but it increases the reasons why the people dislike high density areas and leave to the suburbs.

However, to date, few studies have analyzed the underlying spatial and temporal variability in farmers' individual water use decisions at a landscape scale. We compare estimates of irrigation water requirements derived using state-of-the-art remote sensing models with metered abstraction records for 1400 fields over a 13 year period in the US state of Nebraska, one of the world's most intensively irrigated agricultural regions. We show that farmers' observed water use decisions often diverge significantly from biophysical estimates of crop irrigation requirements. In particular, our findings are consistent with widespread use of water conservation practices by farmers in drought years as an adaptive response to rising irrigation costs and regulatory water supply constraints in these years. We also demonstrate that, in any individual year, farmers observed water use exhibits large field-to-field variability, which cannot be explained fully by differences in weather, soil type, crop choice, or technology. Our results highlight the value of using both in situ monitoring and remote sensing to evaluate farmers' individual water use behavior and understand likely responses to future changes in climate or water policy. Moreover, our findings also demonstrate potential challenges for current efforts in developed and developing countries to apply model-based approaches for field-level water use accounting and enforcement of irrigation water rights. © 2019 The Author(s).

CBIs can also be integrated into the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) agenda. The paper explores the extent to which CBIs promote the mainstreaming of CCA into DRR. Primary data were obtained from interviews with representatives of CBIs and supporting organisations in three local governments of the Hunter Valley (New South Wales, Australia). Findings show that CBIs recognise the potential contribution of climate change in modifying the local hazard profile. CBIs mainstream CCA into DRR by following four approaches: environmental and social justice; sustainability and transition; ecosystem-based approach; and adaptive planning. Partnerships were identified both among CBIs and between CBIs and City Councils; however, conflicts between CBIs, City Councils and business actors emerged, and a lack of commitment by multi-level governments in responding to climate change was revealed. The findings show that CBIs consider CCA and DRR within a broad everyday context related to vulnerability and local development. But we argue that assigning responsibility for climate change issues to CBIs is not a panacea and should not be the only local climate change response. Instead, CBIs need to be included in a larger and long-term commitment by actors that possess access to resources, such as higher levels of government. The paper provides a local Australian perspective on the effectiveness of mainstreaming CCA into DRR and furthers the conversation for the benefit of other communities facing similar challenges. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change adaptation; community-based initiatives; disaster risk reduction; environmental justice; sustainability","adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; environmental justice; local participation; risk assessment; sustainability; Australia; Hunter Valley; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057287438

We revised the architecture, construction management and energy performance of five CESFAM centers to determine possible instances of overall improvement. Staff was interviewed, and state documents reviewed, which allowed the conceptualization of the architectonic and energy structure of the centers, as well as the process of implementation. At the same time, energy simulations were done for each one of the centers, controlling for different climates, construction solutions and orientations. Our study revealed that strategies employed by the primary healthcare centers in Chile have aided a progressive implementation of establishments with elevated costs and materialization times, as well as neglect for climatic conditions. These energy evaluations show relevant and consistent impacts of the architectural form and material conditions, especially in southern zones, demonstrating the need to work with shared knowledge resources such as BIM.

This study aims to estimate GHG emissions of several economic traits of sheep and goats and investigate sustainable mitigation strategies. It advances beyond previous studies by calculating the GHG emissions of traits of economic importance rather than reporting average animal emission and can thus provide insights for creating better-targeted mitigation strategies. In dairy sheep in Tajikistan, the emission intensity (EI) decreased from 62.4 to 56.7 kg CO 2 -eq kg −1 of protein as the production of milk increased by 20%. In meat goats raised in Turkmenistan, the EI decreased by 2.6 kg CO 2 -eq kg −1 of protein when simulating an increase in meat production of + 20%. Improving female fertility by 10% scaled down the EI of meat sheep in Uzbekistan by 36 kg CO 2 -eq kg −1 of protein.

The sea-surface record offers the best opportunity for delineating the dynamical behaviour of the global system over the last century — and it is a remarkably good record. The quantities recorded include sea-surface temperature, wind direction and speed, atmospheric pressure and temperature, sea state and cloudiness. The Pacific is the least covered, with especially large gaps in the data for early decades. By contrast, the record is excellent in the belt of westerlies in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. The pressure field must relate to the wind field, and in regions of strong sea-surface temperature gradients the wind field relates to sea-surface temperature anomalies. © 1987 by Taylor & Francis.

To satisfy the exhaust gas emissions rules and regulations and reducing fuel consumption, it is very significant and critical to determine and understand the gasoline fuel quality impact on fuel consumption, air-fuel ratio (AFR), lambda (λ) and exhaust emissions of gasoline-fueled vehicles. Therefore, studying the impact of gasoline fuel quality on fuel consumption, the air-fuel ratio (AFR), lambda (λ) and exhaust emissions of gasoline-fueled vehicles is very important and necessary. A sensitive and detailed analysis conducted to analyze and determine the impact of gasoline fuel quality on fuel consumption, air-fuel ratio (AFR), lambda (λ) and exhaust emissions of gasoline-fueled vehicles. The study results indicated a direct impact of gasoline fuel quality on fuel consumption, the air-fuel ratio (AFR), lambda (λ) and some vehicle exhaust gases emission including carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Also, the results indicated the indirect impact of gasoline fuel quality on hydrocarbons (CxHy) vehicle exhaust emission. The results of this study can help in reducing fuel consumption, improving the quality of fuel combustion and reducing vehicle exhaust emissions. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, the current evidence base has two main shortcomings. First, most studies fail to provide evidence beyond case studies, thus not considering dynamic effects and heterogeneity across firms, sectors, and countries. Second, they do not adequately take the endogeneity of changes in material productivity into account. In this paper, we investigate data from the Community Innovation Survey comprising over 52,000 firms across 23 sectors and 12 EU member states. Moreover, we take an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity. Our findings provide evidence for a positive and causal effect of material productivity improvements on microeconomic competitiveness for those firms that received targeted public financial support to realise eco-innovations. The effect tends to be limited to firms in certain material-intensive sectors and countries. We further show that such increases in material productivity reduce the firms’ carbon dioxide footprint, thus achieving both economic and environmental objectives. Therefore, our findings provide the important policy insight that tailoring the availability of public financial supports to sector and country specific circumstances and those eco-innovations that increase material productivity is most promising in reconciling competitiveness and climate change mitigation objectives. © 2018, The Author(s).","Competitiveness; Eco-innovations; Instrument; LATE; Material productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049571461

Study design: Retrospective Cohort Study. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) dual stage hearing screening protocol, including automated otoacoustic emissions (AOAE) and automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) testing. Results: 57 newborns received therapeutic hypothermia for HIE. Twelve babies (21%) died. Audiology data was incomplete in 3 babies. Complete data was available for 42 babies (male n = 24), 4 (9.5%) of whom had hearing impairment. The development of hearing loss was associated with abnormal blood glucose levels (p = 0.006), low Apgar score at 1 min (p = 0.0219) and evidence of multi organ dysfunction [high creatinine (p = 0.0172 and 0.0198) and raised liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) p = 0.0012, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) p = 0.0037)]. An association with gentamicin was not found. Conclusion: This study confirms that hearing impairment is common in term infants who have undergone therapeutic hypothermia for moderate/severe HIE. Blood glucose should be monitored carefully in these infants and developmental surveillance should include formal audiology. Further larger studies are needed to clarify the role, if any, of hypothermia per se in causation of hearing loss and to fully identify risk factors for hearing impairment in this population. What is new: The current study confirms that hearing impairment is common in term infants who have undergone therapeutic hypothermia for moderate/severe HIE. No association between gentamicin use and the development of hearing impairment was found however initial blood glucose outside the normal range was of significance. Other factors associated with hearing impairment were low Apgar scores, greater need for resuscitation and evidence of multi organ dysfunction (renal and liver failure). © 2018 European Paediatric Neurology Society","Hearing impairment; Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy; Therapeutic hypothermia","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatinine; gentamicin; Apgar score; Article; audiology; female; glucose blood level; hearing impairment; human; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; incidence; induced hypothermia; male; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; priority journal; retrospective study; complication; hearing impairment; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; induced hypothermia; newborn disease; procedures; risk factor; Female; Hearing Loss; Humans; Hypothermia, Induced; Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain; Incidence; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055133577

They differ in their chemical behavior, emission sources, time of permanence in the atmosphere and ability to diffuse in long or short distances and have adverse effects both on human health and on the environment. Air pollutants, especially those more persistent, travel over long distances and cross national boundaries drawing the attention of policy-makers on a environmental issue that requires a coordinated action at global scale.

Portland's populace, political leadership, and business sectors are motivated by environmental and social values, resulting in a collective sense of responsibility for fixing global problems like climate change. The city's pioneering land-use policies, green infrastructure, and multimodal transportation systems solidify its place at the climate action forefront. In contrast, libertarian Phoenix prioritizes real estate, efficient government, tourism, and protection of individual rights—the antithesis of Portland's altruism. However, because Phoenix's economic success depends on reliable supplies of water, power, and clean air, it has become an ‘accidental’ expert in dealing with many of the worst effects of climate change: drought, heat island, and air pollution. Portland and Phoenix show that cities’ reputations as environmental leaders or laggards may not reflect their ability to teach or learn. Rather, opportunities for urban climate governance learning depend on affinities between cities’ political-ecological profiles. These examples illustrate how urban lesson-learning and policy mobility, originally developed for cases where cities compete, can accelerate around issues like climate change, where cities seek to cooperate. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; governance learning; political ecology; urban planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049568914

We sampled fine roots (diameter ≤2 mm; trees and field layer vegetation combined) twice per growing season in 2015 and 2016 from ten sites spaced one degree of latitude between 60°N (near St. Petersburg) and 69°N (near Murmansk, Russia).

Among-site variation in the total FRB and carbon and nitrogen concentrations were not explained by latitude or by climatic, plant community or soil characteristics. However, fine root density in the organic layer increased towards the north. The more superficial root system in the north than in the south may indicate a poleward increase in the vulnerability of boreal forests to abiotic risks (forest fires, drought).

In spite of this, to date, few studies have examined the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the adaptation strategies of vulnerable farmers from emerging semi-arid regions with dualist agriculture, in which subsistence farms coexist with commercial farms. This study aims to assess the micro-level impact of climate change and the farm household adaptation strategies in a semi-arid region in Central Chile. To this end, we develop a modelling framework that allows for (1) the assessment of farm-household responses to both climate change effects and adaptation policy scenarios and (2) the identification of local capacities and adaptation strategies. Aggregated results indicate that climate change has a substantial economic impact on regional agricultural income, while the micro-level analysis shows that small-scale farm households are the most vulnerable group. We observe that household characteristics determine to a large extent the adaptation capacity, while an unexpected result indicates that off-farm labour emerges as a powerful option for adapting to climate change. As such, our approach is well suited for ex ante micro-level adaptation analysis and can thereby provide useful insights to guide smart climate policy-making. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Climate change; Dualistic agriculture; Farm household heterogeneity; Semi-arid regions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050595382

Observed data from five local environmental monitoring stations in the downtown Hangzhou are selected to evaluate the performance of simulation. The indicator factors confirm the accuracy of the WRF/CMAQ modeling system. Results show the local emission sources account for 15.8%, 68.6%, 48.3% and 59.2% of the overall SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in 2017, respectively. And the research on the separate local sectors indicates traffic donates 71.6% of local NO2 emission while industry contributes 73.8%, 53.2% and 56.7% of the total local emission of SO2, PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The more severe pollution during the wintertime was mainly due to low wet deposition, low temperature, low wind speed, prevailing wind direction, the condition of local deciduous plants and urban heat island. If the local traffic and industry are cut down by 6% and 10%, respectively, the air pollution control targets on SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 in 2020 can be hit. © 2019","Emission inventory; Model validation; Regional pollutants transport; Sector-joint air pollution control strategy; WRF/CMAQ",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050879452

Within a framework of Pressure-State-Response (PSR), this paper focuses on the emission reduction pressure, carbon emission status, and responses of stakeholders in China’s tourism industry. Findings include: 1) The central government’s strategy and rapid growth of the industry scale exert rising pressure on China’s tourism to reduce carbon emissions. 2) Carbon emissions of China's tourism account for 13%–14.6% of global tourism, and about 3% of China’s emissions overall. Chinese tourists’ per capita carbon emission is lower than half of the global level. 3) The Chinese government attaches great importance to energy-saving and carbon emission reduction. In the tourism industry, documents, standards and other regulative measures have been issued to ensure that business practitioners set up green operational and managerial systems. In the field of tourism transportation, China's high-speed rail, new energy vehicles, and urban shared bicycles, have developed very rapidly in recent years, and they have effectively reduced the carbon emissions in traveling. Furthermore, this paper finds that Chinese tourists already have awareness and willingness for low-carbon tourism. © 2019, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

Concentrations of the components varied, respectively, from <0.01 to 1.81 µg/g d.s. (average 0.21 µg/g d.s.) and from 0.002 to 0.384 mg/g d.s. (average 0.027 mg/g d.s.). Comparison of the distribution of methane and sulfide sulfur concentrations testifies to active sulfate reduction at the same stations, where methane concentrations are highest, precisely in the northern area of the lake marked by the inflow of the Verkhnyaya Angara and Kichera rivers, as well as at some stations of the profile deployed along the estuarine zone of the Selenga River and stations located in the sublacustrine wastewater discharge zone of the town of Baikal’sk and the Baikal’sk Pulp and Paper Mill (BPPM), which was closed in 2013. Depending on the study area and sampling point depth, the share of the sand fraction (0.05–2.0 mm) in bottom sediments varies from 23 to 99% (average 57%); the silt fraction (0.05–0.005 mm), from 1 to 73% (average 39%), and the pelite fraction (<0.005 mm), from 0.0 to 8.7% (average 4%). Increase of the concentration of reduced gases in sediments correlates tightly with increase of the share of the fine-grained (silt and pelite) fractions. It is concluded that high or low concentrations of methane and sulfide sulfur at the studied upper intervals of sediments in Lake Baikal are caused not only by differences in the thickness of sediments subjected to the anthropogenic impact, but also by variations in depositional conditions that govern the grain size composition and, consequently, the content of organic matter and intensity of methane genesis and sulfate reduction. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063937780

Sites are categorized into dust, biomass burning, and mixed aerosol conditions. MISR and MODIS AOD agree during high-dust seasons but MODIS tends to underestimate AOD during low-dust seasons. Over dust-dominated sites, MODIS/Terra AODs indicate a negative trend over time, while MODIS/Aqua, MISR, and AERONET depict a positive trend. A deviation between MODIS/Aqua and MODIS/Terra was observed regardless of the geographic location and data sampling. The performance of MODIS is similar over the entire region with ∼ 64 % of AOD within the AT = ±0.05±0.15TAERO confidence range. MISR AOD retrievals fall within 84% of the same confidence range for all sites examined here.

However, as a municipal district, energy and CO 2 emission data and other statistics are difficult to obtain in Tongzhou and CO 2 emissions accounting for a district at this level is rare. This study applies the accounting method of city carbon emissions to the district level. Firstly, we account for the CO 2 emissions in the Tongzhou District from 2008 to 2015 according to data availability. Secondly, by using the logarithmic mean Divisa index decomposition approach, the Tongzhou CO 2 emissions are decomposed into six main driving factors, including population, per capita GDP, industrial structure, energy intensity, energy consumption structure, and energy-related CO 2 emission factors. The result shows that (1) from 2008 to 2015, the CO 2 emissions in the Tongzhou District first increased and then decreased and peaked in 2011. (2) Population and per capita GDP both contributed to the change in CO 2 emissions in the Tongzhou District during the study period and resulted in 407,200 tons and 346,200 tons increase, respectively. The industrial structure, energy consumption intensity, and energy structure exerted inhibiting effects, offsetting 29,300 tons, 571,500 tons, and 29,300 tons, respectively, and the energy consumption intensity was the most important factor. (3) On this basis, we discuss the annual effects of the driving factors.

Based on the PEF Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology, the authors aim to provide a useful instrument for technicians and researchers in the evaluation of the environmental load of dairy products, allowing the process-hotspots identification through 16 different impact categories. The tool requires a modest amount of data that can be easily collected at the farms and at the dairies. In order to test the tool's performance, the environmental impact of 10 g dry matter of Grana Padano PDO cheese was evaluated starting from the data of three different dairy farms used as “reference farming systems” and one dairy factory. A scenario and a sensitive analysis were also included in the study. The main contribution to most of the environmental impact categories was related to the raw milk production while the dairy factory process affected significantly only a few impact categories. The scenario analysis suggested that the anaerobic digestion could have a strong potential in the mitigation of the GHG emissions while the sensitive analysis confirmed that the choice of the allocation method at the dairy factory level is a key point in the methodological choices. Despite the test of the tool was done only on three farms and one dairy factory, the results were consistent with those of recent studies. Even if some improvements in the tool functionalities are needed, we believe that in the future it could be easily applied on a wider sample of farms and dairies, and used to guide the stakeholders through a responsible environmental strategy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dairy products; Grana Padano PDO; Life cycle assessment; Product Environmental Footprint; Tool","Anaerobic digestion; Dairies; Dairy products; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Tools; Development and testing; Distribution centers; Environmental footprints; Environmental loads; Environmental strategy; Grana Padano PDO; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Protected designation of origins; Environmental impact; dairy farming; environmental impact; identification method; life cycle analysis; milk; milk production; product development; resource allocation; stakeholder; agricultural land; anaerobic digestion; article; cheese; environmental impact; farming system; human; Italy; life cycle assessment; milk production; scientist; analysis; animal; carbon footprint; cheese; chemistry; dairying; environmental monitoring; milk; procedures; Italy; Lombardy; Po Valley; Animals; Carbon Footprint; Cheese; Dairying; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Milk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052447614

The capacity of social-ecological systems to deal with shocks, adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e.g., regulate the Earth's climate, support biomass production, and supply water resources for human societies. However, massive, inter-connected, human interference involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam constructions, and land-use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social-ecological systems. In many cases, changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback. Examples of such transgressions, where water has played a critical role, are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation, and tropical forest dieback associated with self-amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks. Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally, and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non-linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory. Based on the literature review, we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts, and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social-ecological resilience, and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact, cascade, or amplify through the complex, globally hyper-connected networks of the Anthropocene. © 2018 The Authors","Earth resilience; Global water system; Green-Blue water; Regime shift; Water conflict; Water sustainability","Aquatic ecosystems; Earth (planet); Forestry; Land use; Sustainable development; Water quality; Water resources; Blue water; Regime shift; Water conflict; Water sustainability; Water system; Climate change; Anthropocene; climate forcing; desertification; dieback; environmental degradation; freshwater environment; land use change; sustainability; sustainable development; tropical forest; water quality; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064385202

The aforementioned processes constitute imminent risks and human rights crises, and in the case of climate change these are most pronounced for coastal peoples around the globe. The novelty lies in the invocation of climate change to legitimize resettlement. Resettlements are politically charged environments involving complex negotiations between stakeholders and rights-holders, including institutions and multiple local actors with unequal access to both scarce material resources and political power. The challenge inherent in climate and disaster-related displacement and resettlement is to identify means by which the indeterminate spaces can provide certain apertures for the development of human rights and livelihoods. Climate relocations can seem to be an inevitable choice rooted in ecological shifts and anthropogenic climate change.

Actions related to energy efficiency, fuel switching, new engine technologies and modal change were considered. The analyzed measures have the potential to reduce the cumulative emissions by 8% and 18% under the BAU scenario through 2030 and 2050, respectively. Mitigation costs are high and imply annual capital costs that range from 0.5% to 4% of the national GDP.

The objects of investigations are the most common in boreal zone spruce forests with dwarf shrubs + green mosses and pine forests with dwarf shrubs + lichens. The results show a significant intra- (below the crowns and between the crowns) and interbiogeocenotic (spruce and pine forests) variation in the composition of atmospheric deposition and soil waters in forests under pollution. The atmospheric deposition of pollutants and leaching of their compounds from all soil genetic horizons are tens (sulfates) and hundreds (copper and nickel) times higher than in reference sites and their fluxes below the crowns are usually more intense than between the crowns. Long-term dynamics (from 1993 to 2012) demonstrate reliable trends in the reduction of concentrations and leaching of sulfates and heavy metals from the soil. The molar ratio of basic cations to aluminum (BC/Al) in soil waters from all soil horizons does not drop to the level of critical, whereas for mineral nitrogen the lowest critical level (0.2 mg/L) was exceeded in waters from all horizons at all stages of digression. It was shown that, for the early detection of exceedances of the critical level for mineral nitrogen in soil waters, an evaluation of their composition is necessary not only between the crowns, but also below them. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","atmospheric deposition; chemical indicators; coniferous forests; heavy metals; industrial air pollution; many-year dynamics; pollution-induced digression; soil waters; spatial variation; sulfates","assessment method; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; boreal forest; coniferous forest; heavy metal; industrial emission; leaching; long-term change; plant community; soil water; spatial variation; sulfate; Murmansk [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; Bryophyta; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065044939

In regions with no ecological networks across large landscapes, ecoregion concept offers opportunities for characterizing the landscape under changing climate. Objectives: Aim is to develop contemporary and future quantitative ecoregions for Turkey based on climate model outputs, to identify climate change-sensitive areas of biodiversity and conservation significance, and to provide a framework for a comprehensive ecological observatory network design. Methods: Using Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering and climate data contemporary and projected future distributions of Turkey’s ecoregions are delineated at several division levels. Results: Turkey’s contemporary ecoregions generally show a northward shift by the end of this century and the lengthening of the growing season across the country, especially eastward and northward. The increase in growing season length, along with the shift in precipitation seasonality and increasing growing season precipitation, shape future conditions within the climate change-sensitive areas. Apart from transboundary ecological and socioeconomic significance, these potentially vulnerable ecosystems also constitute the majority of Turkey’s biodiversity hotspots. Conclusions: Our study marks the first ‘ecoregionalization’ study for Turkey based on both contemporary and future climate scenarios. For countries like Turkey, where large-scale ecological networks have not been established, using such quantitative methodology for delineation of optimal ecoclimatic regions, and for mapping environments at risk from climate change provides an invaluable perspective for conservation planning strategies, and a framework for a comprehensive ecological observatory network design. © 2018, The Author(s).","Biodiversity conservation; Climate change; Ecological observatory network; Ecoregions; Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering; Regional climate modelling","biodiversity; climate change; climate modeling; conservation planning; ecoregion; growing season; multivariate analysis; observatory; quantitative analysis; regional climate; spatiotemporal analysis; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059347038

India is following the same trend, with Government of India (GOI) declaring the nationwide implementation of BS 6 legislation by April 2020 and Real Driving Emission (RDE) Cycle relevant legislation by 2023. Additionally GOI is focusing on reduction of CO2 emissions by introduction of stringent fleet CO2 targets through CAFE regulation, making it mandatory for vehicle manufacturers to simultaneously work on gaseous emissions and CO2 emissions. Simultaneous NOx emission reduction and CO2 reduction measures are divergent in nature, but with a 48 V Diesel hybrid, this goal can be achieved. The study presented here involves arriving at the right future hybrid-powertrain layout for a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) in the Indian scenario to meet the future BS 6 and CAFÉ legislations. Diesel engines dominate the current LCV and SUV segments in India and the same trend can be expected to continue in future. An existing SUV from the Indian market has been selected as a target base vehicle for this study. The base SUV vehicle meets the BS 6 legislative requirements with MIDC cycle. The focus is on 48 V P0 and P2 hybrid layout evaluation and optimization through simulation techniques using Matlab/Simulink models. This RDE cycle (Pune RDE), has been developed out of actual vehicle measurement in and around Pune city, capturing real transient vehicle behavior and start-stop / energy recuperation potential availability. The study also includes the effect of these hybridized powertrain architecture on the reduction/optimization of the needed Exhaust After Treatment System (EATS) size as well as fluid consumption, due to reduced engine out NOx emission. Existing vehicle platform is on a 12 V system and migration to a 48 V system will call for additional system and development cost. © 2019 SAE International.

The metro and urban cities are worst hit by the gaseous and particulate emissions produced by internal combustion engine powered vehicles. Following the trend from other developed countries, Government of India (GOI) has decided to migrate from existing BS IV legislation directly to BS VI legislation from April 2020 all across India. This migration in emission legislation took almost 10 years to be implemented in European Union (EU) countries. However, for India, the targeted implementation time is just 3 years, making it an uphill challenge for all the vehicle manufacturers. City bus is one such applications, which run mostly within the city and currently are powered by conventional Diesel engines. The vehicle manufacturers should focus on finding an optimized solution for meeting the future emission legislation in true sense. This calls for meeting the emission limits with not only the legislative engine dynamometer cycles but also considering the real world driving cycle (RDE) in their solution. The study presented here involves finding the optimized solution for engine and exhaust after-treatment system (EATS) for the city bus application to meet future BS VI emission regulations. The focus was to not only meet the emission specific drive cycles like WHTC & WHSC, but also evaluate and optimize the solution for real world driving emission cycle (RDE). Although it should be noted, that there is no direct regulation for heavy-duty commercial vehicle with RDE cycles as compared to the light duty Diesel segment, but the vehicle manufacturers have to ensure that the system performance with respect to emission in worst-case real life scenario is always protected and achieve a reasonable Conformity Factor (CF). For this study, a RDE cycle specifically for city bus application has been developed in Mumbai city, capturing the real driving scenario in typical metro Indian cities, with many start stops and low vehicle velocity operations. With such a vehicle duty cycle, typical Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) based solution for these heavy-duty application will be impacted with delayed light-off and lower conversion efficiencies. Different heating strategies like late post injections, variable valve timing, intake throttling, hydro carbon dozer, electric heated catalysts etc. has been also analyzed in the presented study. Different EATS layouts involving DOC, DPF, SCR etc. have been simulated and optimized with respect to system performance and total fluid consumption (Fuel and AdBlue) to arrive at the best solution for this segment. FEV has an internally developed mean value based simulation platform to optimize the complete powertrain along with the EATS. This simulation tool has been used to simulate the different engine dynamometer based emission cycles and the selected RDE cycle with different EATS layouts and heating strategies. In addition, as part of this study to achieve in-cylinder emission reduction, the engine level modifications needed for the current BS IV engines has also be detailed and analyzed. This will also provide an insight into any new engine developments for this segment by the manufactures. This study provide the Indian manufacturers a direction to meet the future stringent emission legislation for the city bus application (heavy commercial segment) not only for meeting the mandated emission specific cycles on engine dynamometer but also with the real life driving cycle (RDE). The study achieves system optimization in terms of real life emission, system cost and fluid consumption reduction, which will be very critical and deciding factor for improving the manufacturer's presence into the Indian market in future. © 2019 SAE International.

While life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models are increasingly used to assess the potential eco- and human-toxicological effects of chemical emissions, few studies have looked into the issue of modeling pharmaceutical emissions specifically and their toxicity-related effects in an LCA context. This paper reviews the state of the art to inventory and characterize API emissions in LCA with the goal to identify relevant gaps and challenges. A search for 208 environmentally relevant APIs in 2 life cycle inventory (LCI) databases revealed a meager representation of this group of chemicals. Similarly, the LCIA model USEtox was found to include characterization factors (CFs) for less than 60 APIs. First approaches to model API emissions in LCA were identified on the basis of an examination of 40 LCA case studies in the pharmaceutical sector and in the field of wastewater treatment. Moreover, CFs for 79 additional APIs, expressing their ecotoxicity and/or human toxicity potential, were gathered from literature. An analysis of the variability of API-CFs in different LCIA models showed a variation of about 2–3 orders of magnitude. Based on the review results, 3 main gaps in the modeling and characterization of API emissions in an LCA context were identified: (1) incomplete modeling of API flows and API emissions along the life cycle of human pharmaceuticals, especially during their use and end-of-life phase, (2) limited API coverage in existing LCIA toxicity models, and (3) missing pharma-specific impact pathways (e.g., endocrine disruption and antibiotic resistance) in existing LCIA models. Recommendations to tackle these gaps are provided, and priority action steps are discussed.

Field studies denoted that the shales were black to dark grey in color, sub-tabular to tabular in occurrence, with some (n = 20) reacting vigorously with dilute HCl, while others did not (n = 5). Due to the carbonate content of the samples both whole rock dissolution and partial dissolution, using dilute acetic acid to target the carbonate fraction in the samples, were employed. The seven shale-rich units investigated have average whole rock Ni/Co, V/Cr, U/Th and Th/U ratios of 1.68–2.0, 1.13–2.95, 0.24–0.51 and > 2, respectively. PAAS normalized rare earth elements in the whole rock samples display an enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs) over heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), middle rare earth elements (MREEs) over HREEs, positive Gd, Eu anomalies, no Ce anomalies, and an average Y/Ho ratio of 29.7 ppm. The carbonate fraction of the samples displays two different REE pattern types. Sites 1 and 6 have typical hat-shaped patterns with extensive MREE enrichment. The other locations are slightly HREE depleted and have weak MREE enrichment with negative Y anomalies. The trace element ratios and the REE patterns of the whole rock and carbonate fractions indicate that the sediments deposited in the Mamfe basin accumulated in non-marine environments. Furthermore, their coloration, MREE enrichment and lack of Ce anomalies in the carbonate fractions infers that the depositional area was in a vegetated, low-land lacustrine setting with limited oxygenation of the sediment, whereas the negative Ce anomalies in the whole rock shale samples is probably due to particulate scavenging of REEs from the fluid during transport. This would require the water to be deficient in Ce and, thus reflect oxidizing conditions in the source area and along the transport system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Lacustrine; Mamfe basin; Rare earth element; Shales; Trace elements","accumulation; depositional environment; lacustrine deposit; oxic conditions; rare earth element; shale; trace element; Cameroon; Mamfe Basin; South West Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051057047

Improvement of the environmental situation can have a significant impact on the pace and structure of economic development. For environmental component, it is important to analyze the current state and predict greenhouse gas emissions. The development of methodological approaches in this area will allow for more detailed forecasting of the situation. In order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, European countries have set targets for efficiency of energy consumption and widespread use of renewable energy sources, which they have achieved and become world leaders in using them. By 2020, the goal is set for energy consumption to be at least 20% from renewable sources. According to the forecast on average, in 2040 the share of oil products in the structure of fuel consumption in road transport in Europe will be reduced to 80%. Nevertheless, in the countries of Europe, various trends in the field of greenhouse gas emissions are expected.

Effective policy action requires ongoing assessment, intervention, monitoring, and adjustment, not a one-time assessment of risks and likely effective responses.

Current public health interventions need to be augmented or deployed in new regions to prevent additional climate change-related morbidity and mortality. Monitoring and surveillance systems need to be modified to ensure programs remain effective under changing environmental conditions. Moreover, public health strategies must extend beyond conventional or proximal health determinants, including policies from the fields of energy, transportation, agriculture, and others, on which public health depends. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, consumer choices and built form also impact another, equally important natural resource: water. In this paper, I use legislative analysis, a survey, and in-depth interviews to assess how local planners are engaging in planning for water quality and availability. In the United States, states have the legal authority to allocate and mandate planning for water supply, while water quality is controlled through federal legislation, the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Yet land use choices that affect both water availability and quality are made at the local level. Because city and regional planning offers opportunities to better manage water use and improve water quality efficiently, urban planners are beginning to address the role of water in the urban development process. In this chapter, I examine how state legislation is fostering comprehensive water planning in 26 states. I evaluate the legislation’s relative social-ecological resilience and its enumeration of planning roles in state and substate comprehensive water planning to assess the extent to which the legislation’s mandates and incentives encourage, enable, and/or force local planners to address growing water needs. I also examine watershed level and local level planning efforts to reduce non-point source contamination in surface water bodies and water conservation responsibilities in planning departments in exemplary case study areas. Together, the results reveal the importance of urban planning to achieve better water quality and to influence the allocation of the increasingly scarce water supply. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We developed the Forest Bioenergy Carbon Accounting Model (ForBioCAM 1.0) to analyze factors that influence the carbon intensity of wood pellet-based electricity, using a common set of assumptions and the same system boundary. We show that widely differing assessments of the carbon intensity of wood pellet-based electricity depend on the choice of forest management perspectives (landscape or stand), baselines (no harvest, or harvesting for the manufacture of traditional finished wood products), feedstocks (whole trees, pulpwood, or logging residues), forest management practices (change in rotation age), and the duration of the analysis itself. Unlike with a stand perspective, we demonstrate conditions under which a landscape perspective results in carbon savings net of avoided emissions from coal-based electricity. Our results also suggest that the two perspectives of forest management converge in their assessment of the positive carbon effects of various feedstock types used to manufacture wood pellets relative to a no-harvest baseline, and that the use of whole trees for wood pellets results in net carbon savings after a break-even period of about three years relative to a no-harvest scenario.

The Climate Convention was no exception and the issues involved were of much wider scope than climate change itself. The scientific community has been an extremely important actor in environment and climate change polices. Multilateral institutions have relied heavily on scientific contribution and have provided an adequate forum in which they can exercise international influence. Multilateral institutions fulfill this role, although in a manner different from that which would characterize a World Government. The power differences among developed nations are also relevant to the question of bilateral versus multilateral aid.

An important tool for meeting objectives of these global initiatives is reforestation, achieved by natural processes or by tree planting. Worldwide, organizations are challenged to most efficiently and effectively direct resources to the most critical reforestation needs. Currently in the United States, the reforestation efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, are challenged by changes in policy, funding, climate change, and mega-fires, to name a few, and identifying strategies for timely successful reforestation at scale is needed. A 2016 conference brought together reforestation experts from across North America to discuss potential benefits of reforestation activities in the face of mounting challenges from invasive species, wildfires, diseases, and climate change. As a result of that effort, here we provide background on the challenges confronting successful reforestation on lands managed by the Forest Service, and describe the six manuscripts in this special issue and their foci: barriers to natural regeneration, when to actively plant trees or not to ensure a heterogeneous landscape, ecological and economic concerns when reforestation is delayed, employing traditional and novel silvicultural techniques in support of reforestation, leveraging reforestation to improve resilience of species affected by introduced pests, and the potential carbon sequestration benefits of a robust reforestation program. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Diversity; Natural regeneration; Tree planting; Wildfire","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Conservation; Fires; Plants (botany); Carbon sequestration; Diversity; Ecological and economic; Heterogeneous landscapes; Natural regeneration; Silvicultural technique; Tree plantings; Wildfire; Reforestation; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; invasive species; public space; reforestation; regeneration; silviculture; tree planting; wildfire; Computer Programs; Conservation; Fires; Natural Reforestation; North America; Planting; Trees; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060538148

The Changzhi coalbed methane block, south-central Qinshui Basin, is a new resource target zone for coalbed methane exploration and exploitation in China. However, the gas content distribution of this block and its influential factors have not yet studied. Based on the recent coalbed methane exploration and exploitation activities, the gas content distribution of coal reservoir in this block was studied. The results show that the gas content hold by the coal reservoir is 7.0 − 21.7 m 3 /t, which was determined by a combining control effect from geologic structure and hydrogeology. The Changzhi coalbed methane block has experienced multiple-stages geologic structure evolution, especially a tectonic-thermal event during the middle Yanshanian Orogeny improved the coal to the current R o,max 1.9 − 2.7% and meanwhile the coalbed methane was greatly generated. Subsequently, the widespreadly developed normal fault structures during the Himalayan Orogeny accelerated the coalbed methane escape through the “gas escape windows”, particularly where the location within the distance of about 1300 m to the “gas escape window” the gas content decreases significantly. Moreover, due to the action of the later Himalayan Orogeny, the slope areas of most Yanshanian fold structures were structurally cross-cut by the Himalayan normal faults, and thus an “open” syncline folds were formed. The coal reservoir was depressurized surrounding this “open” syncline structure and consequently the hydrodynamic losing effect has resulted in a comparatively lower gas content therein. By the control of geologic structure and hydrogeology, this block can be generally, compartmentalized into three hydrodynamic systems including the western groundwater stagnation region, the middle runoff region, and the north-eastern recharge region, where the hydrodynamic sealing effect at the groundwater stagnation region has made a comparatively higher gas content for the coal reservoir, but the hydrodynamic losing effect at the recharge region and runoff region has made a comparatively lower gas content of the coal reservoir. © The Author(s) 2018.","Changzhi block; gas content; geologic structure; hydrogeology; South-central Qinshui Basin","Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Fault slips; Firedamp; Groundwater; Hydrodynamics; Hydrogeology; Petroleum prospecting; Runoff; Underground reservoirs; Changzhi block; Exploration and exploitation; Gas content; Geologic structures; Hydrodynamic systems; Influential factors; Qinshui basin; Tectonic thermal events; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059896373

In this study, long-term measurements of PM2.5-bound trace elements were conducted from January 2014 to January 2015 in the urban city of Jinan, east China. A positive matrix factorization model (PMF) and health risk assessment were used to evaluate the sources and health risks of these elements, respectively. Compared with most Chinese megacities, there were higher levels of arsenic, manganese, lead, chromium, and zinc in this city. Coal combustion, the smelting industry, vehicle emission, and soil dust were identified as the primary sources of all the measured elements. Heating activities during the heating period led to a factor of 1.3–2.8 higher concentrations for PM2.5 and all measured elements than those during the non-heating period. Cumulative non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of the toxic elements exceeded the safety levels by 8–15 and 10–18 times, respectively. Arsenic was the critical element having the greatest health risk. Coal combustion caused the highest risk among the four sources.

The enhancement of N deposition has aroused increasing concerns about its effects on ecosystem health and function. Forest covers more than one fifth of the national land area in China and provides fundamental ecosystem services. There have been emerging experimental, observational and modelling efforts to assess the impacts of N deposition on forest ecosystems since the 2000s. Here we summarized these research progresses with a focus on the effects of N deposition on soil chemistry and N transformation, soil microorganisms and enzymes, plant physiology, biodiversity and ecosystem carbon (C) balance. Experimental results and modelling estimates generally indicate a fertilization effect of N deposition on forest growth and consequent C sequestration. However, high-level N deposition has been increasingly evidenced to cause N leaching, soil acidification, nutrient imbalance, increased N2O emissions and decreased soil CH4 uptake, which likely offset the positive effect on ecosystem C storage over time. Meanwhile, N deposition has changed both species composition and richness of plant and soil microbial communities, consequently altering C and nutrient cycling. Moreover, the effects of N deposition are likely non-linear with N doses, and thus the assessment on the threshold values for N deposition would have important implications for N emission regulation and forest management options. We conclude that elevated N deposition is altering ecosystem structure and function of China’s forests, especially in the eastern and southern regions. In addition, we highlight research efforts to jointly consider multiple abiotic factors (e.g. climate warming, CO2 enrichment, drought and increase in surface ozone) and biotic factors (e.g. insect outbreaks and invasive species), when evaluating ecological impacts of N deposition in the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084483833

DNA sequenced from human remains found at this site has revealed the presence of a hitherto unknown hominin group, the Denisovans1,2, and high-coverage genomes from both Neanderthal and Denisovan fossils provide evidence for admixture between these two populations3. Determining the age of these fossils is important if we are to understand the nature of hominin interaction, and aspects of their cultural and subsistence adaptations. Here we present 50 radiocarbon determinations from the late Middle and Upper Palaeolithic layers of the site. We also report three direct dates for hominin fragments and obtain a mitochondrial DNA sequence for one of them. We apply a Bayesian age modelling approach that combines chronometric (radiocarbon, uranium series and optical ages), stratigraphic and genetic data to calculate probabilistically the age of the human fossils at the site. Our modelled estimate for the age of the oldest Denisovan fossil suggests that this group was present at the site as early as 195,000 years ago (at 95.4% probability). All Neanderthal fossils—as well as Denisova 11, the daughter of a Neanderthal and a Denisovan4—date to between 80,000 and 140,000 years ago. The youngest Denisovan dates to 52,000–76,000 years ago. Direct radiocarbon dating of Upper Palaeolithic tooth pendants and bone points yielded the earliest evidence for the production of these artefacts in northern Eurasia, between 43,000 and 49,000 calibrated years before present (taken as ad 1950). On the basis of current archaeological evidence, it may be assumed that these artefacts are associated with the Denisovan population. It is not currently possible to determine whether anatomically modern humans were involved in their production, as modern-human fossil and genetic evidence of such antiquity has not yet been identified in the Altai region. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon 14; mitochondrial DNA; uranium; mitochondrial DNA; oxygen; age; artifact; Bayes theorem; cave; DNA sequence; fossil hominin; human; Letter; Paleolithic; priority journal; Russian Federation; stratigraphy; animal; cave; chemistry; deer; femur; fossil; genetics; history; hominid; Homo neanderthalensis; radiometric dating; sediment; time factor; tooth; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Caves; Deer; DNA, Mitochondrial; Femur; Fossils; Geologic Sediments; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Neanderthals; Oxygen Isotopes; Radiometric Dating; Siberia; Time Factors; Tooth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060912363

Looking at past land use systems and their socio-economic background extends our understanding of the slow processes and low frequency events that appear to be the key in deciding whether land use systems lead to sustainability or to collapse. As an example, the paper focuses on so-called Anthropogenic Dark Earths (ADE). These highly fertile soils were managed or actively created by ancient cultures in different regions of the world. Since they are rich in humic matter and carbon, and are highly stable to biochemical oxidation, they appear very relevant both as a model for sustainable soil and land management systems and as a tool for climate change mitigation on different scales - local as well as global. The paper argues in favor of a historical perspective to learn about risks and possibilities of land use strategies. We propose a co-adaptive transdisciplinary problem-solving approach (“Archaeonics”), which includes the study of the past as well as respective technical and social implications for the future. © 2018","ADE; Applied archaeology; Land management strategy; Sustainability","anthropogenic source; archaeology; future prospect; land management; soil management; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053858549

Findings indicate that the greatest need across the facilities relate to access to medical doctors and pharmacists. None of the facilities factored climate associations with health into their clinical care strategies. The necessity to train healthcare facility staff on aspects related to climate change, health, and sustainability is highlighted. Environmental health practitioners should also be incorporated in grassroots community climate adaptation strategies. Outcomes further indicate the need for the advancement of integrated healthcare and climate adaptation strategies that focus on strengthening healthcare systems, which may include novel technological approaches such as telemedicine.

Accordingly, the objective of this study was to simulate the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants from the Borborema S.A thermal power plant, using the Aermod View program as a tool to evaluate the concentrations resulting from the simulation and to make comparisons with allowable levels according to current law. Thus, the emission sources of chimney air pollutants of a thermal power plant in 2016 were evaluated using the Aermod View, Aermet View, and WRPLOT View software. Regarding the pollutants generated, NO x values at 1 h showed NO 2 concentration over the primary and secondary standards allowed by law, with a maximum concentration of 1680 μg/m 3 , about five times higher than the primary standard and eight times the secondary. The simulation indices for the concentrations of PM, SO x , NO x , and CO, even though they are appeared very low, except NO 2 at 1 h, it was observed that these pollutants can affect the health of the local population, fauna and flora, in view of the process of bioaccumulation, which is inherent to organisms, which directly or indirectly absorb substances or chemical compounds. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Environmental degradation; Environmental health; Human health; Pollution","atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; bioaccumulation; comparative study; concentration (composition); dispersion; environmental degradation; pollutant source; pollutant transport; public health; software; Borborema; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055948255

The wastewater from ink factory showed high levels of colorants, vehicles, solvents, and additives that affected to high total dissolved solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) that are approximately 6,426, 987, 258, and 156 mg L -1 , respectively. Phytoremediation of wastewater by C. alternifolius is an effective method to remove pigments, organic carbon and nitrogen compounds. Plant absorption, soil adsorption, including microbial activities played important roles for cleanup of wastewater as final step for removing TDS, COD, BOD, ammonium, nitrate, and colors. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique and then sequencing of partial 16S rDNA revealed that the microbial community was aerobic and facultative-anaerobic groups. The major group affiliated with Proteobacteria was Pseudomonas, Diaphorobacter, Sulfurospirillum, and especially Azospirillum, as a dominant group. The result confirmed that the efficient process of plant and microbe cooperation for the treatment of wastewater was a suitable and sustainable technology.

I identify the early phase ending with the governor’s decision to update the state’s environmental review guidelines for permitting in 2008 as a critical juncture. In retrospect this was a near miss for the oil and gas industry. The decision changed the rules of the game to one where the opposition to hydraulic fracturing defended status quo and gave grassroot organisations time to mobilize. The case illustrates that political feasibility of restrictive supply-side climate policies, such as banning fossil fuel production, is not something we can defined with a predefined set of variables. Instead political feasibility is created through the political process. Furthermore, I note an increasing use of supply-side policy measures since the ban. This suggests that the decision to ban hydraulic fracturing also marks an acceleration of the state’s transition towards a low-carbon energy economy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Critical junctures; Energy transition; Hydraulic fracturing; New York State; Path dependency; Restrictive supply side climate policy; Social movements",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086211001

The study showed that sugarcane bagasse has a calorific value of around 17.7 MJ/kg and can be densified in the form of briquettes, which is found to be an appropriate feedstock for gasification in a downdraft gasifier generating an average of 2.05 N m 3 of produced gas per kilogram of bagasse with a calorific value between 3.30 and 4.56 MJ/N m 3 .

As it is known they need electrical energy, generally provided by diesel generators. Because of the far and remote distance, the refuelling process is very expensive. So, sustainable development needs hybridization with a local renewable energy (solar energy in this case). Accordingly, the PV panels produce sometimes an excess of power and in other times a lack of power. To overcome this uncontrolled power production, storage device is mandatory. In this work a pump storage hydroelectric system is preferred for its ecological aspect and the subject context. The energy management of this hybridization type requires a specific control. The proposed energy management takes into account the temporal solar energy availability and link it to the online diesel fuel consumption optimization and the pumping constraints. The proposal proves the effectiveness of pump storage hydroelectric double effect system in the irrigation and electrical power restitution, in addition to fuel saving and reduction of CO2 emission. This study proves that the new accurate formulation of online fuel consumption per kWh compared to that of the literature is successfully tested in the proposed energy management and can be used in other future analogous studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel generator unit; Energy management control; Hybrid microgrid energy system; Photovoltaic array; Power storage hydroelectric system","Energy management; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Fuels; Hydroelectric generators; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Solar energy; Virtual storage; Diesel generators; Energy management controls; Energy systems; Hydroelectric systems; Photovoltaic arrays; Storage management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054195261

Our detailed material footprint and climate policy assessment indicates that a global agreement on a policy mix will allow a clear turnaround towards climate protection and a sustainable use of natural resources without deteriorating economic performance. If the EU decides unilaterally to lead the way, then this turnaround could also be achieved for the EU while the EU would also benefit economically from this pioneering role.

This paper provides a summary of the opportunities for industrial CCS and market-based revenue streams, like those associated with enhanced crude oil recovery (EOR). The use of EOR changes the nature of carbon from being a pollutant to a valuable commercial input, which requires a judicious understanding of the technical industrial sequestration process, historic oil and gas operations, and the specific location and types of industrial carbon sources that can facilitate this type of carbon emissions mitigation strategy.

This sustained decline is measured by blood and environmental lead levels and achieved through control of lead sources, emission reductions, federal regulations, and applied public health efforts. Objective: Explore regulatory factors that contributed to the decrease in exposure to lead among the US population since 1970. Design/Setting: We present historical information about the control of lead sources and the reduction of emissions through regulatory and selected applied public health efforts, which have contributed to decreases in lead exposure in the United States. Sources of lead exposure, exposure pathways, blood lead measurements, and special populations at risk are described. Results: From 1976-1980 to 2015-2016, the geometric mean blood lead level (BLL) of the US population aged 1 to 74 years dropped from 12.8 to 0.82 μg/dL, a decline of 93.6%. Yet, an estimated 500 000 children aged 1 to 5 years have BLLs at or above the blood lead reference value of 5 μg/dL established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Low levels of exposure can lead to adverse health effects. There is no safe level of lead exposure, and child BLLs less than 10 μg/dL are known to adversely affect IQ and behavior. When the exposure source is known, approximately 95% of BLLs of 25 μg/dL or higher are work-related among US adults. Despite much progress in reducing exposure to lead in the United States, there are challenges to eliminating exposure. Conclusions: There are future challenges, particularly from the inequitable distribution of lead hazards among some communities. Maintaining federal, state, and local capacity to identify and respond to populations at high risk can help eliminate lead exposure as a public health problem. The results of this review show that the use of strong evidence-based programs and practices, as well as regulatory authority, can help control or eliminate lead hazards before children and adults are exposed. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The paper identifies major barriers to cross-level communication and collaboration between national and sub-national levels. These are due to power imbalances across governance levels that reflect broader institutional differences between federal and decentralized systems of government. In addition, powerful communities operating predominantly at the national level hamper cross-level interactions. The analysis also reveals that engagement of national level actors is more extensive in the mitigation and that of local actors in the adaptation policy domain, and specialisation in one of the climate change responses at the national level hampers effective climate policy integration in the land use sector. © 2018 The Authors","Brazil; Climate change; Indonesia; Land use; Multi-level governance; Policy networks","climate change; communication; environmental policy; federal system; governance approach; land use; policy approach; power relations; Brazil; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057350954

But increased concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere have created an imbalance and have enhanced the greenhouse effect causing warming of the globe. Global warming will adversely affect hundreds of millions of people and will pose serious threats to the global food system and to rural livelihoods. Global warming is mainly the result of rising CO2 levels in the Earth’s atmosphere. CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is increasing at greater pace from decade to decade. To assure food security, adaptation, and mitigation to climate change is unavoidable. Many organizations worldwide are working for lowering CO2 concentration through various strategies like reduction in energy use, developing low- or no-carbon fuel, and CO2 sequestration by forestry/agroforestry and engineering techniques. Agroforestry has been recognized as a means to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance carbon sinks. Agroforestry systems (AFS) offer important opportunities of creating synergies between both adaptation and mitigation actions. Recent studies under various AFS in diverse ecological conditions showed that these systems increase and conserve aboveground and soil carbon stocks and also have an important role in increasing livelihood security and reducing vulnerability to climate change. The potential of agroforestry systems to accumulate C is estimated to 0.29-15.21 Mg ha-1 year-1. The carbon sequestration potential of AFS can be enhanced by stabilizing soil organic carbon through possible mechanisms including biochemical recalcitrance and physical protection and also reducing C losses. Furthermore, effectiveness of AFS to carbon sequestration depends on structure and functions of different component, environmental, and socio-economic factors. Carbon sequestration can be quantified by destructive or nondestructive methods. Implementing agroforestry on farmers’ fields for carbon sequestration will have major challenges which deserve to be addressed in an effective manner. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Agroforestry; Carbon sequestration; Management practices; Tropical region",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084032366

The association of low energy use with deprivation has been an obstacle to promoting more aggressive goals for reduction of residential use. However, there is little research on the composition of the low user population. We investigated the demographics, behavior, and satisfaction of the lowest 10% of electricity consumers in Sacramento, CA, to see what attributes best correlated with low use. California, like many other regions, has GHG emissions goals requiring drastic reductions in residential consumption. Households in Sacramento’s lowest decile of electricity consumption already live at electricity consumption levels consistent with the goals for 2050. Our investigation of 700 of these households found that diversity of low users with regard to age, income, education, appliance ownership, and dwelling characteristics is similar to that of the general population. Low-use households tend to be smaller, but not enough to explain the entirety of low usage. Surveys and interviews revealed that those in the lowest 10% typically pursued low consumption deliberately and enthusiastically and were aware of their status as low users. Conversations about energy conserving strategies were embedded in their social lives. They employed diverse and creative strategies to maintain thermal comfort without excess energy use, often exceeding expert recommendations. Finally, the distribution of self-reported quality of life was no different from that of the general population living at much higher consumption levels. Overall, the key determinants of low use were a positive engagement with improvisation and experimentation, and the salience of energy in personal or social life. The population of low users should be treated as a valuable source of peer advice and lifestyle modeling. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Energy behavior; Energy poverty; Household energy consumption; Peer communication; Residential energy demand","Consumer behavior; Electric power utilization; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Surveys; Electricity consumers; Electricity-consumption; Energy behavior; Energy poverties; Expert recommendations; Household energy consumption; Residential consumption; Residential energy demand; Energy utilization; communication; demand analysis; electricity supply; emission control; energy conservation; energy use; household energy; lifestyle; poverty; residential energy; California; Sacramento; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050583459

The intersection of climate change and gender policy is more concerned with gender differences and gender mainstreaming. Though men and women are negatively influenced by the impacts of climate change, women quite often experience more burden and are indeed more vulnerable than men, due to the factors like “social status”, working conditions and hardships. Indeed, the vulnerability of women owes to prevailing socio-economic conditions and social fabric. Many women in developing countries depend on the natural environment for subsistence and income. They even played a central role in agriculture and natural resource management, but due to lack of economic opportunities, women have very limited or no access in decision-making processes. Therefore, it is important that the consequences of climate change should not lead already marginalized sections of communities into further deprivation. The threats posed by climate change have failed to impress on policy-makers the importance of placing women at the heart for ensuring a sustainable future by combining development and climate change issues. Skewed participation of women in the processes involving “decision-making”, “planning”, “policy-making” and “implementation” results in increasing their vulnerability to climate change impacts. Gender mainstreaming is the need of the hour as it can engender viable and pragmatic solution to climate change. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Decision-making; Gender policy; Natural resource; Participation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085820873

Aerobic methanotrophs in coastal marsh soils are important methane consumers, but their activity and populations are poorly characterized. DNA stable-isotope probing followed by sequencing was used to determine how active methanotrophic populations differed in the main habitats of a Chinese coastal marsh. These habitats included mudflat, native plant-dominated, and alien plant-dominated habitats. Methylococcaceae was the most active methanotroph family across four habitats. Abundant methylotroph sequences, including methanotrophs and non-methane-oxidizing methylotrophs (Methylotenera and Methylophaga), constituted 50–70% of the 16S rRNA genes detected in the labeled native plant-dominated and mudflat soils. Methylotrophs were less abundant (~ 20%) in labeled alien plant-dominated soil, suggesting less methane assimilation into the target community or a different extent of carbon cross-feeding. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated a significant correlation between the active bacterial communities and soil properties (salinity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and available phosphorus). Importantly, these results highlight how changing vegetation or soil features in coastal marshes may change their resident active methanotrophic populations, which will further influence methane cycling. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","DNA-SIP; Methane; Methanotrophs; Methylococcaceae; Spartina alterniflora; Tidal marsh","bacterium; canonical analysis; carbon sink; grass; intertidal environment; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; microbial community; oxic conditions; saltmarsh; soil microorganism; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methylococcaceae; Methylophaga; Methylotenera; Spartina alterniflora; bacterial DNA; carbon; methane; nitrogen; RNA 16S; bacterium; carbon sequestration; chemistry; classification; ecosystem; genetics; Methylococcaceae; microbiology; phylogeny; physiology; plant; soil; wetland; Bacteria; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; DNA, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Nitrogen; Phylogeny; Plants; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056332313

One of the first terrestrial ecosystem models developed in the 1970s was the ELM (Ecosystem Level Model) grassland model. Extensive field observations from the International Biological Program were used to represent almost all processes including species level plant growth, soil C and N cycling, insect and mammal predation, etc. Unfortunately, the ELM model was too complex to use for practical management questions. However, the soil temperature, water and nutrient cycling submodels were used in later, simpler, ecosystem models, including CENTURY. During the 1980s CENTURY was used for site-level simulations, while regional application was limited due to lack of climate, soils, and plant production data. Funding for model development in the 1990s led to model improvement and allowed for coarse-resolution regional simulations and the first large-scale ecosystem model comparisons using standard weather, soils, and land use datasets. As interest in climate change and greenhouse gas emissions grew in the late1990s and 2000s, the DAYCENT model was developed to simulate fluxes of the full suite of biogenic GHGs (CO2, N2O, CH4, NOx). DAYCENT was, and continues, to be applied to estimate soil GHG fluxes for the U.S. National GHG Inventory, to compare the impacts of conventional vs. improved land management strategies for decision support tools (e.g., COMET-FARM) and perform life cycle assessments. Availability of multi-site, standardized data sets with comprehensive model driver and testing data (e.g., ARS GRACEnet) has facilitated model evaluation and improvement. Current research needs include software to generate model input files and mechanisms to conduct comprehensive model comparisons. © by American Society of Agronomy, Inc., Soil Science Society of America, Inc., Crop Science Society of America, Inc.","CENTURY model; Climate change; Colorado State University; Contemporary eological isues; Ecosystem models; Land management; Net greenhouse gas accounting; Soil organic carbon",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102232874

Alpine herbs are specifically sensitive to these changes. Biomass accumulation and reproductive effort are often negatively affected by elevated temperatures and earlier snowmelt. Here, we assess the use of herb-chronology, the study of annual growth rings in the woody underground organs, to retroactively monitor effects of monthly to seasonal climate on growth of the alpine forb species Penstemon whippleanus. We explored methods for building the strongest growth chronology possible by comparing the mean interseries correlations (MICs) of the whole population to that of groupings by cohorts, spatial locations, and random groupings using a permutation procedure. MIC for the whole population was low (0.034). Our permutation grouping performed best, producing a maximum MIC of 0.263. Using the permutation-derived chronology (2008–2015), we found significant decrease in growth with increased maximum temperatures in July, decreased May rainfall, increased drought between April and August, and lower minimum temperatures in September. Herb-chronology proved useful for understanding growth dynamics with climate in this alpine system; expanding this practice to similar systems could elucidate unknown effects of shifting climate on annual growth of alpine herbaceous species. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Ethanol production and livestock feed integration as practiced in the United States (USA) is one model for ethanol production combined with animal feed production. Brazil, the second largest ethanol and beef cattle producer in the world, can adapt the USA model of corn ethanol and cattle integration considering its local characteristics. This paper evaluates the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of sugarcane ethanol and cattle integration, thereby avoiding pasture displacement into forests or other sensitive lands. Cattle can be fattened in feedlots using some sugarcane ethanol byproducts. Intensification of cattle production by integration with sugarcane production releases pasture area to produce more biofuels, without needing more land for cattle production. The release of pasture land to produce more sugarcane results in what we call “avoided ILUC” the resultant reduced GHG emissions compared to conventional sugarcane ethanol, because no additional land is needed to accommodate an additional sugarcane ethanol production. Simulations were performed using the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB) model developed by the Brazilian Bioethanol Science and Technology Laboratory (CTBE). We calculated as economic parameters the internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and payback time. Climate impacts were assessed via Life Cycle Assessment. Sugarcane and cattle integration decreases overall climate impacts compared to non-integrated systems. Techno-economic feasibility is achieved by additional land rental revenues for released pasture area and by carbon credits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ILUC; Life cycle assessment; Pasture intensification; Sugarcane ethanol; Sugarcane-cattle integration; Sustainability","Agriculture; Earnings; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Environmental feasibility; Greenhouse gases (GHG); ILUC; Internal rate of return; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pasture intensification; Science and Technology; Techno-economic feasibility; Bioethanol; agricultural intensification; alternative energy; biofuel; carbon emission; cattle; climate effect; emission; ethanol; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; pasture; sugar cane; sustainability; Brazil; United States; Animalia; Bos; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058216494

Seeds were germinated at constant temperatures between 10 to 40 °C, osmotic potentials from 0 to -0.8 MPa (in polyethylene glycol 6000 solutions), and from 0 to -0.5 MPa (in NaCl solutions). The experiment was conducted according to a completely randomized design, with three replicates of 50 seeds, in a factorial scheme (harvest year x stress intensity) for each environmental stress. Germination data were then analysed using thermal, hydro and halo time models, and future germination responses projected according to climate change scenarios. The germination thermal thresholds ranged from 7.4 to 53.3 oC. The germination base osmotic threshold (using polyethylene glycol) was -0.6 MPa and the base osmotic threshold in NaCl was -0.43MPa. Seeds from different harvest years showed distinct tolerance to environmental stresses. The thermal, hydro and halo-time models were efficient to describe the germinative response of seeds, and the climate models allowed to identify the germination responses of M. urundeuva in future climate. According to the models for future climate (RCP 8.5), the reduction of rainfall by 2100 will directly affect seed germination and seedling recruitment of M. urundeuva. © 2019, Associacao Brasileira de Tecnologia de Sementes.

It draws on an ethnographic study of two Sustainable Community Movement Organizations (SCMOs) in Manchester (UK). Both organisations aim to advance climate justice through practical projects relating to food and energy. Given the escalating climate change crisis, a relevant question for both organisations is whether focus should be on the continued mitigation of climate change through the promotion of low-carbon lifestyles, or on adapting to the consequences of climate change. Traditionally, focus has been on the former which, given limited resources. has driven the mobilisation of ‘low-hanging fruit’: Individuals with higher socio-economic status who have the greatest responsibility, opportunity and ability to reduce their carbon footprint, and who likely share environmental concerns. Adaptation is only contemplated implicitly, as a by-product of mitigation efforts. It does not prompt a shift in recruitment strategies. Consequently, it is the same advantaged constituencies whose resilience is advanced, whereas climate justice would demand a focus on adaptation of vulnerable communities. Yet the pathways of both organisations are clearly distinct, showing (partial) solutions to resulting mismatches between their justice goals and recruitment strategies. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Sabrina Zajak and Sebastian Haunss; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105196422

Here, we demonstrate that a noncoding small RNA, SdhX, is produced by RNase E-dependent processing from the 3′UTR of the sdhCDAB-sucABCD operon, encoding enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In Escherichia coli, SdhX negatively regulates ackA, which encodes an enzyme critical for degradation of the signaling molecule acetyl phosphate, while the downstream pta gene, encoding the enzyme critical for acetyl phosphate synthesis, is not significantly affected. This discoordinate regulation of pta and ackA increases the accumulation of acetyl phosphate when SdhX is expressed. Mutations in sdhX that abolish regulation of ackA lead to more acetate in the medium (more overflow metabolism), as well as a strong growth defect in the presence of acetate as sole carbon source, when the AckA-Pta pathway runs in reverse. SdhX overproduction confers resistance to hydroxyurea, via regulation of ackA. SdhX abundance is tightly coupled to the transcription signals of TCA cycle genes but escapes all known posttranscriptional regulation. Therefore, SdhX expression directly correlates with transcriptional input to the TCA cycle, providing an effective mechanism for the cell to link the TCA cycle with acetate metabolism pathways. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Few studies have investigated the association of intraspecific variation in serotiny with geographical variation in fire and other environmental factors, especially climatic ones, and none has done so in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa. Yet the relationship between environmental gradients and intraspecific variation in reproductive traits may help us understand if those gradients partly shaped the evolution of the rich diversity or proteas in the CFR, and predict the resilience of fire-adapted Protea species to climate and fire regime changes in the CFR. We examined the association of the variability in serotiny in Protea repens (L.) L, the Common Sugarbush, with gradients in fire regime and climatic factors, and with plant age, cone age, and age of oldest closed cone across its 700 km-long longitudinal range in the CFR.

The indicators used for the vulnerability assessment are: terrain elevation, wave exposure, power and angle of wave incidence and wave run-up. Regarding the wave climate of the region, the most frequent waves are those of the southern, eastern and southeastern quadrants. Significant wave heights are more frequent in the range of 1.0–1.5 m, and the most frequent wave periods are between 8 and 10 s. Perequê Enseada, Asturias and Pernambuco beaches present low vulnerability and the Pitangueiras and Mar Casado beaches present moderate vulnerability. The study provides an interesting perspective for the management of coastal resources in the Guarujá region and similar coastal areas. In addition, although the analyzed beaches presented low and moderate vulnerability, processes such as climate change or inadequate interventions on adjacent beaches may negatively influence the studied region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beaches; Coastal zone; Indicators; Vulnerability; Wave climate","beach erosion; coastal zone management; environmental indicator; vulnerability; wave climate; wave height; Brazil; Guaruja; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057521737

Permeability reduction due to asphaltene deposition has been mainly attributed to pore volume shrinkage (porosity reduction). However, asphaltene particles can also block pore throats which will lead to severe permeability reduction even when a large fraction of total pore volume still remains intact. Thus, there is a need for permeability models that are explicitly function of pore/hydraulic connectivity. This paper provides a review of the existing models and examines a permeability model that explain permeability impairment due to asphaltene deposition. In this study, we propose a new permeability model based on Critical Path Analysis (CPA) which is a function of average coordination number (average number of available/connected neighbor pores). Furthermore, experimental data in the literature related to limestone, sandstone and carbonate (dolomite) samples are utilized to understand combined effects of surface deposition and interconnectivity loss due to pore blockage on permeability reduction. We observed that surface deposition is the dominant mechanism in the limestone samples studied here owing to large pore throat size compared to the particle size. In the sandstone samples, both the surface deposition and pore throat plugging mechanisms contribute fairly the same in the observed permeability reduction. For the carbonate (dolomite) samples, the pore blockage is the dominant mechanism, which results in rapid sharp decrease of the permeability. It is expected that the outcome of this work improves prediction of the asphaltene deposition in the near wellbore region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Asphaltene deposition; Permeability reduction; Pore plugging; Surface deposition","Asphaltenes; Boreholes; Critical path analysis; Deposition; Lime; Limestone; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Porous materials; Regression analysis; Sandstone; Asphaltene deposition; Average coordination number; Complicated structures; Near-wellbore region; Permeability impairments; Permeability reduction; Pore plugging; Surface deposition; Mechanical permeability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050676582

Studies have estimated sector-specific premature mortality from ambient PM2.5 exposure in India and shown residential energy use is the dominant contributing sector. In this study, we estimate the contribution of PM2.5 and premature mortality from six regions of India in 2012 using the global chemical-transport model. We calculate how premature mortality in India is determined by the transport of pollution from different regions. Of the estimated 1.1 million annual premature deaths from PM2.5 in India, about ~60% was from anthropogenic pollutants emitted from within the region in which premature mortality occurred, ~19% was from transport of anthropogenic pollutants between different regions within India, ~16% was due to anthropogenic pollutants emitted outside of India, and ~4% was associated with natural PM2.5 sources. The emissions from Indo Gangetic Plain contributed to ~46% of total premature mortality over India, followed by Southern India (13%).

More than 50% of the premature mortality in Northern, Eastern, Western, and Central India was due to transport of PM2.5 from regions outside of these individual regions. Our results indicate that reduction in anthropogenic emissions over India, as well as its neighboring regions, will be required to reduce the health impact of ambient PM2.5 in India. ©2018.

In this study, the total emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and particulate matter (PM) from coal-fired power plants in Anhui were investigated to assess the impact of control measures on the atmospheric emissions based upon continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). The total NO x , SO 2 and PM emissions significantly decreased from 2013 to 2017 and they were estimated at 24.5 kt, 14.8 kt and 3.0 kt in 2017, respectively. The emission reductions of approximately 79.0%, 70.1% and 81.2% were achieved in 2017 compared with a 2013 baseline, respectively, due to the application of high-efficiency emission control measures, including the desulfurization, denitration and dust-removing devices and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The NO x , SO 2 and PM emission intensities were 0.125 g kWh -1 , 0.076 g kWh -1 and 0.015 g kWh -1 in 2017, respectively, which were lower than the average of national coal-fired units. The coal-fired units with ≥ 600 MW generated 80.6% of the total electricity amount while they were estimated to account for 70.5% of total NO x , 70.1% of total SO 2 and 71.9% of total PM. Their seasonal emissions showed a significant correlation to the power generation with the maximum correlation found in summer (July and August) and winter (January and December). The major regional contributors are the cities along the Huai River Basin and Yangtze River Basin, such as Huainan, Huaibei, Tongling, Maanshan and Wuhu, and the highest emission occurred in Huainan, accounting for approximately 26-40% of total emission from all the power plants. Our results indicated that the application of desulfurization, denitration and dust-removing devices has played an important role in controlling air pollutant emissions from coal-fired power plants. © 2019 by the authors.","Atmospheric pollutants; CEMS; Coal-fired power plants; Emission intensity; Spatial and temporal variation","Air pollution; Coal; Coal dust; Coal fueled furnaces; Desulfurization; Emission control; Mining; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Particulate emissions; Selective catalytic reduction; Sulfur dioxide; Watersheds; Atmospheric pollutants; CEMS; Coal-fired power plant; Emission intensity; Spatial and temporal variation; Fossil fuel power plants; atmospheric pollution; chemical pollutant; coal-fired power plant; emission control; monitoring system; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; spatial variation; sulfur dioxide; temporal variation; Anhui; China; Huaibei; Huainan; Maanshan; Tongling; Wuhu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060034917

Through extensive multivariate sensitivity analysis, this study estimates the robustness of future cost-optimal heat production systems under changing electricity prices, fuel cost and investment cost. Optimal production capacities are installed choosing from a range of well-established production and storage technologies including boilers, combined heat and power (CHP) units, power-to-heat technologies and heat storages. The optimal heat production system is characterized in three different electricity pricing scenarios: Historical, wind power dominated and demand dominated. Coal CHP, large heat pumps and heat storages dominate the optimal system if fossil fuels are allowed. Heat pumps and storages take over if fossil fuels are excluded. The capacity allocation between CHP and heat pumps is highly dependent on cost assumptions in the fossil fuel scenario, but the optimal capacities become much more robust if fossil fuels are not included. System cost becomes less robust in a fossil free scenario. If the electricity pricing is dominated by wind power generation or by the electricity demand, heat pumps become more favorable compared to cogeneration units. The need for heat storage more than doubles, if fossil fuels are not included, as the heating system becomes more closely coupled to the electricity system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost sensitivity; District heating; Energy production; Fossil free; Optimization","Cogeneration plants; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; District heating; Economics; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Investments; Multivariant analysis; Optimization; Power markets; Pumps; Sensitivity analysis; Wind power; Zoning; Capacity allocation; Combined heat and power units; Electricity demands; Electricity pricing; Electricity system; Energy productions; Fossil free; Storage technology; Electric power system planning; cogeneration; combined heat and power; cost analysis; demand analysis; electricity; electricity industry; energy storage; fossil fuel; heat production; heating; optimization; power generation; price determination; wind power; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055669922

Immission of pollutants is the amount of particulate or gaseous pollutants that is received by the environment. Natural precipitation, i.e. rainwater, is polluted during the contact with air. As a result of atmospheric precipitation groundwater and soil become polluted. The pollutants also penetrate surface water, causing further contamination. In rainwater that goes to the sewage system, there are pollutants such as hydrocarbons, heavy metals, slurries, plant protection products and many more. This is largely dependent on the type of management of the catchment, its sanitary condition, and the time and intensity of precipitation. Another important factor is the composition of pollutants emitted into the atmospheric air in each area. The work shows changes in the pollution of rainwater in Lodz Voivodship in the years 2010-2016 and presents analysis of the data collected by the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection.

Yet it is not known whether such localised temperature variation equates to intracanopy variation in leaf-level physiological thermal tolerance. Here, we studied whether microclimate variation across the canopy of a dominant desert tree equated to localised variation in leaf thermal thresholds (T 50 ) among four canopy positions: upper south, upper north, lower south, lower north. Principal component analysis was used to generate a composite climatic stress variable (C STRESS ) from canopy temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and relative humidity. We also determined the average number of days that maximum temperatures exceeded the air temperature equating to this species’ critical threshold of 49 °C (AT 49 ). To estimate how closely leaf temperatures track ambient temperature, we predicted the thermal time constant (τ) for leaves at each canopy position. We found that C STRESS and AT 49 were significantly greater in lower and north-facing positions in the canopy. Differences in wind speed with height resulted in significantly longer predicted τ for leaves positioned at lower, north-facing positions. Variation in these drivers was correlated with significantly higher T 50 for leaves in these more environmentally stressful canopy positions. Our findings suggest that this species may optimise resources to protect against thermal damage at a whole-plant level. They also indicate that, particularly in desert environments with steep intracanopy microclimatic gradients, whole-plant carbon models could substantially under- or overestimate productivity under heat stress, depending on where in the canopy T 50 is measured. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Canopy microclimate; Desert plants; Heat stress; Leaf plasticity; Thermotolerance","air temperature; canopy gap; desert; leaf; microclimate; plasticity; principal component analysis; relative humidity; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; vapor pressure; Acacia papyrocarpa; Acacia; microclimate; plant leaf; temperature; tree; Acacia; Microclimate; Plant Leaves; Temperature; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056136197

However, common mitigation strategies like expensive high-quality feeds are not economically feasible for these pre-production animals. Given its direct role in CH4 production, altering the rumen microbiota is another potential avenue for reducing CH4 production by ruminants. However, to identify effective microbial targets, a better understanding of the rumen microbiota and its relationship to CH4 production across heifer development is needed. RESULTS: Here, we investigate the relationship between rumen bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities as well as CH4 emissions and a number of production traits in prepubertal (PP), pubertal (PB), and pregnant heifers (PG). Overall, PG heifers emitted the most CH4, followed by PB and PP heifers. The bacterial genus Acetobacter and the archaeal genus Methanobrevibacter were positively associated, while Eubacterium and Methanosphaera were negatively associated with raw CH4 production by heifers. When corrected for dietary intake, both Eubacterium and Methanosphaera remained negatively associated with CH4 production. CONCLUSION: We suggest that Eubacterium and Methanosphaera represent likely targets for CH4 mitigation efforts in heifers as they were negatively associated with CH4 production and not significantly associated with production traits. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","16S rRNA; greenhouse gases; methane; microbiota; next generation sequencing; rumen microbiology","methane; animal; bacterium; biodiversity; bovine; classification; female; fungus; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; intestine flora; isolation and purification; male; metabolism; microbiology; rumen; Animals; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Cattle; Female; Fungi; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Tract; Male; Methane; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050499889

Through an integrated experimental and theoretical approach, it was possible to delineate the optoelectronic properties of cis-1. In detail, (a) a series of absorption maxima in the range 300-400 nm was assigned to metal-to-ligand charge transfer and weak and broad absorption maxima at longer wavelengths (400-500 nm) were ascribable to spin-forbidden transitions with a mixed character; (b) there was an intense red phosphorescence with emission set in the range 580-710 nm; and (c) a highest occupied molecular orbital was mainly localized on the metal and the 2-phenylpiridine ligand and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital was localized on the NandN ligand, with a ΔH-L set at 2.20 eV. This investigation allowed the design of light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEEC) devices endowed with good performance. The poor literature reporting on the use of cis-iridium(III) complexes in LEECs prompted us to investigate the role played by the selected cathode and the thickness of the emitting layer, as well as the doping effect exerted by ionic liquids on the performance of the devices. All the devices exhibited a deep red emission, in some cases, quite near the pure color (devices #1, #4, and #8), expanding the panorama of the iridium-based red-to-near-infrared LEEC devices. The characteristics of the devices, such as the brightness reaching values of 162 cd/m2 for device #7, suggested that the performances of cis-1 are comparable to those of trans isomers, opening new perspective toward designing a new set of luminescent materials for optoelectronic devices. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060617009

Considering the human-landscape system associated with energy policy, these changes can affect landscape and natural resources over a range of temporal and special scales. Thus, the aim of study was on how human-landscape interactions have influenced the geomorphological dynamics in a São Paulo region that contains sugar cane crops associated with soils derived from sandstones and mudstones. The use of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) in three different scenarios from land use changes allowed verifying how they have affected soil loss: natural conditions (savannah), current land use and with the expansion of sugar cane crops. In addition, the total sediment transported, the sediment delivery ratio and the rate of soil removal were measured, considering the current land use. The land use scenarios pointed out that the land use change is directly related to increasing rates of soil loss, i.e. 0.03, 3.5 and 12.6 t ha−1 yr−1 for the natural conditions, current land use and with the expansion of sugar cane crops, respectively. These rates in the current land use and with continuous expansion of sugar cane crops are higher than the tolerable erosion limits in 17 and 57% of the study area, respectively. The suspended sediment concentration increases with increasing Cachoeirinha Stream discharge, with a specific daily flux of 88 kg km−2 day−1. The mean monthly flux in 2014 was 32 t month−1, with varying from 3.1 (August) to 144 (January) t month−1. The wet period was responsible for ca. 90% (436 t) of the total solids transported in 2014. The sediment delivery ratio was 9% of the total soil loss. The current rate of soil removal of 25.8 m Myr−1 is almost 3-fold higher than the long-term denudation rates suggested for the Peripheral Depression (9 m Myr−1). With the continuous expansion of sugar cane crops, the rate of soil removal probably will be higher than that obtained in the current scenario and, consequently, the current denudation rates should increase further. Thus, this study reinforce that the human-landscape systems in São Paulo State associated with energy policy are complex and increase the natural processes of soil removal and, consequently, affect the landscape evolution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Energy policy; Human-landscape system; Landscape evolution","anthropogenic effect; concentration (composition); crop plant; energy policy; land cover; land use change; landscape; landscape evolution; natural resource; savanna; sediment transport; sedimentary basin; spatiotemporal analysis; sugar cane; watershed; Brazil; Cachoeirinha; Embu [Sao Paulo]; Parana Basin; Rio Grande do Sul; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053013978

However, the translation of low carbon policy strategy into specific infrastructure projects, such as wind farms, nuclear power stations or overhead transmission lines, is often fraught with political contestation at the level of local development planning. This chapter reviews European policy shifts to low carbon electricity generation and the different ways in which this has been interpreted in national law by European Member States. It then considers how the political desire for rapid technological transition influences the scalar politics of energy planning. Specifically, the chapter discussed how changes in the nature of state regulation and planning systems for major infrastructure projects creates potential democratic deficits within planning systems, reduces opportunities for public participation in decision making and ultimately leads to social opposition from locally affected communities and elevated contestation of planning applications. It therefore behoves policy makers to alleviate democratic deficits in local planning for energy infrastructure in order to meet climate goals as rapidly as possible. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Simin Davoudi, Richard Cowell, Iain White and Hilda Blanco.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075275323

Yet the diversity, complexity, and novelty of the adaptation concept itself leads to interpretive flexibility, differing public understanding of (and engagement with) adaptation strategies, and hence differentiated policy responses. The boundary work of communicative practices and public understanding of the adaptation concept therefore requires empirical analysis in different cases and contexts. This study employs Q-methodology (a combined quantitative–qualitative social research method) to reveal the typologies of perspectives that emerge around the adaptation concept among a diverse group of citizen-stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Four such typologies are identified under the labels 1) top-down climate action, 2) collective action on climate change, 3) optimistic, values-focused adaptation, and 4) adaptation skepticism. The division between these perspectives reveals a perceived ‘‘responsibility gap’’ between the governmental–institutional and/or individual–community levels. Across the emergent discourses we find a consensual call for a multisector, multiscalar, and multistakeholder-led approach that posits adaptation as a contemporary, intragenerational problem, with a strong emphasis upon managing extreme weather events, and not as an abstract future problem. By attending to these public discourses in climate policy, this presents a potential means to lessen such a responsibility gap. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.",,"adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; extreme event; mapping method; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061593390

On one hand we are facing growing demand for energy driven by the growth of the world population, the global economic development, the emergent countries and markets and the growing needs of a technological society embarking on new cycles of development with the digitalization of the economy and the ‘Internet of the Things’, all of which will impact the global pattern of energy demand. On the other hand we are confronted, as a civilization, with the climatic threat induced by rising CO2 emissions, derived from the consumption of fossil fuels, the bad use of land and the pollution from other industries like cement, chemical and steel industries. Furthermore, the world increased exponentially its consumption of resources that are being depleted at a rate never before seen in history. The dominant paradigm for civilization today is based on the transformation of resources into waste with unparalleled speed in history and this needs to be reversed with the real and not the rhetorical adoption of the principles of ‘Circular Economy’, fighting waste and developing new models of access and distribution of resources. The change of the energy mix and the development of a new model of sustainability in the access and production of resources is a key challenge for the 21st century.

By the official rural credit of the ABC program, the federal government aims the sustainability of beef cattle by production practices with potential mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG). The Santa Catarina state program subsidizes federal program interest. In order to evaluate the impact of these public policies, it was evaluated 170 beef cattle farms in Santa Catarina. The evaluation consisted of visits and application of quantitative and qualitative forms. The farms were distributed in the regions of North plateau, Itajaí Valley, Mountain range, Midwest and West Santa Catarina. The evaluation period was from January 2012 to December 2016, covering the origin of the application of the resources, zootechnical indexes and economic analysis. It was found that 45% of ABC resources were used in pasture establishment and recovery, 18% in paddock subdivisions, 32% in adaptations of management centers and the remainder resources in animal genetic improvement and technical assistance. The evolution of the herd showed 21% increase in the number of animals (P = 0.0016), 44% increase in the number of females (P < 0.001), and a slaughter age reduction in 12 months (P = 0.0022). The relationship between the value of the projects and the value applied in pastures was positive linear (P < 0.001). There was improvement in knowledge on pasture management and on zootechnical indexes by the farmers after the five years of the programs implementation (P < 0.001). Farmers who joined the program reported unanimity regarding improvements in technical knowledge and management of the activity. It is concluded that public policies have had a positive impact in beef cattle production. Furthermore, the investment on production practices such pasture implantation and recovery, suitable pasture management, reduction on animals slaughter age presents potential to GHG mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gases mitigation; Pasture; Rural credit; Zootechnical indexes","carbon emission; cattle; credit provision; greenhouse gas; livestock farming; rural area; social policy; subsidy system; Brazil; Santa Catarina; Animalia; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054856363

Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 ± 78, 830 ± 109, and 723 ± 100 Mg C ha-1, respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha-1) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 ± 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation. © 2019 Conrad, Brown, Alvarez, Bates, Ibrahim, Reid, Monteiro, Silva, Mamo, Bowtell, Lin, Tolentino and Sanders.","Australia; Estuaries; Mangrove; Saltmarsh; Seagrass; Soil carbon stocks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060190385

A total of 120 plots of 0.25 ha (30 ha) were installed in transitional ecosystems or ecotones (LOt) between the forested shade-loving campinarana (Ld) and dense-canopy rainforest, submontane (Ds), in the National Forest (Flona) of Anauá, southern Roraima. Measuring the diameters at breast height (DBH ≥ 10 cm) and the heights of 171 dead trees (fallen naturally, illegally exploited, and affected by forest fires), enabled the estimation of carbon content from the application of a biomass equation developed at Manaus, and the calculation of a correction factor, using the average height of the largest trees. From 2015-2017, we mapped the real extent of illegal selective logging and forest fires across the region with CLASlite and INPE/Queimadas. From measurements of 14,730 live and dead trees across 30 hectares (491 ± 15 trees·ha -1 ), the illegal selective logging and associated forest fires, and aggravation by severe El Niño droughts resulted in an 8.2% mortality of trees (40 ± 9 dead trees·ha -1 ) and a 3.5% reduction in forest carbon stock (6 ± 3 Mg·ha -1 ) in the short-term. The surface area or influence of forest fires of very high density were estimated in the south-central region of Roraima (8374 km 2 ) and the eastern region of the Flona Anauá (37 km 2 ). Illegal selective logging and forest fires in forest areas totaled 357 km 2 in the mosaic area, and 6 km 2 within Flona Anaua.

Beyond the IPCC, others have undertaken global assessments to understand the vulnerability of coastal areas to climate change. Eight global vulnerability assessments are compared to understand similarities and differences in their results and the metrics used to construct a vulnerability index. Variations in objectives, conceptualizations of vulnerability, operationalization of the concepts, scope and depth of data drawn upon lead to contradictory rankings of priority areas for climate action between assessments. The increased complexity and scope of indicators make it difficult to untangle the root causes of such differences in rankings. It is also difficult to identify the degree to which climate change influences vulnerability rankings compared to other factors such as local environmental conditions and the capacity of populations to deal with environmental change. The way to undertake global assessments needs to be reshaped to better inform planning of international development along different objectives. Global level assessments need to be simplified and harmonized to better isolate the impact of climate change specific drivers. Decision-makers would make better use of such global assessments as scoping studies rather than expect comprehensive and robust priorities for investment. Such scoping studies can help target locations where supplementary, in-depth local analyses need to be conducted. At the local level, the possibility to collect context-specific information, particularly on adaptive capacity, allows the robust assessment of vulnerability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Conceptual frameworks; Global assessments; Marine and coastal areas; Prioritizing investments; Vulnerability","anthropogenic effect; climate change; coastal zone; conceptual framework; decision making; environmental assessment; globalization; investment; nature-society relations; risk assessment; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056626901

Prescribed burning and timber harvesting are two common, co-occurring, forest management practices that may alter forest carbon pools. Prescribed burning for forest management, such as wildfire risk reduction, may shorten inter-fire intervals and potentially reduce carbon stocks. Timber harvesting may further increase the susceptibility of forest carbon to losses in response to frequent burning regimes by redistributing carbon stocks from the live pools into the dead pools, causing mechanical damage to retained trees and shifting the demography of tree communities. We used a 27-yr experiment in a temperate eucalypt forest to examine the effect of prescribed burning frequency and timber harvesting on aboveground carbon (AGC). Total AGC was reduced by ~23% on harvested plots when fire frequency increased from zero to seven fires, but was not affected by fire frequency on unharvested plots. The reduction in total AGC associated with increasing fire frequency on harvested plots was driven by declines in large coarse woody debris (≥10 cm diameter) and large trees (≥20 cm diameter). Small tree (<20 cm DBH) AGC increased with fire frequency on harvested plots, but decreased on unharvested plots. Carbon in dead standing trees decreased with increasing fire frequency on unharvested plots, but was unaffected on harvested plots. Small coarse woody debris (<10 cm diameter) was largely unaffected by fire frequency and harvesting. Total AGC on harvested plots was between 67% and 82% of that on unharvested plots, depending on burning treatment. Our results suggest that AGC in historically harvested forests may be susceptible to declines in response to increases in prescribed burning frequency. Consideration of historic harvesting will be important in understanding the effect of prescribed burning programs on forest carbon budgets. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","aboveground carbon; eucalypt forest; fire regime; forest management; logging; prescribed burning; temperate forest; timber harvesting","aboveground biomass; carbon; carbon sequestration; climate change; coarse woody debris; evergreen forest; fire; forest ecosystem; forest management; global climate; logging (timber); prescribed burning; temperate forest; timber harvesting; carbon; ecosystem; fire; forest; tree; Carbon; Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059354522

Previously, waste diversion existed in Ontario under the Waste Diversion Act (“WDA”) (SO 2002, c 6), a government-managed scheme that was meant to oversee the diversion of target waste streams away from landfills. The WDA tasked Waste Diversion Ontario (“WDO”) to be the industry regulator, and the province designated industry-funded organizations (“IFOs”) as service providers to coordinate waste management activities for their respective industries. The fatal systemic flaw of this framework, however, was that these two bodies were placed between the “Producers” (namely the manufacturers, first importers, and brand owners) and the end-of-life supply chain. The RRCEA will allow the province to more effectively preserve and recover resources, divert materials from landfills, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from waste, with the overall aim of implementing a “circular economy.” Under the RRCEA, the Producers will be the primary resource recovery party, solely responsible for complying with the Ministry’s mandated obligations for resource recovery, with non-transferable liabilities. By naming the Producer as the operator of the product’s end-of-life (or “reverse”) supply chain, their decisions as to a product’s composition, content, and deconstruction attributes are now relevant to the waste management process-giving rise to an integrated circular economy market. Canada’s treatment of plastics gives interesting insight into how a circular economy might be implemented. Additionally, to address these requirements and liability issues, Producers are looking to Producer Responsibility Organizations (“PROs”) as waste management third parties to help address the new and often daunting obligations, as examined in this paper’s case study on the used tire industry in Ontario. To help implement RRCEA, Ontario has identified no less than 15 actions to help facilitate the smooth transition to a circular economy, with the express interest of creating scalable solutions which can then be mass-produced across North America. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085453517

However, before taking this novel imaging agent into clinical trials, safety and toxicological studies need to be performed with the nonradioactive precursor compound DOTA-Siglec-9. This extended single-dose toxicity study was designed to provide information on the major toxic effects of DOTA-Siglec-9 and to indicate possible target organs after a single intravenous (iv) injection in rats. The study was performed using 60 adult Hsd: Sprague Dawley rats and included a control group and a treatment group to investigate the toxicity of DOTA-Siglec-9 solution at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL after a single iv injection of 582 µg/kg. The maximum dose tested was 1,000-fold the clinical dose on a mg/kg basis as indicated in European Medicines Agency International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guideline M3(R2). The planned human clinical dose is approximately 0.582 µg of DOTA-Siglec-9 per kg of body mass.

The study is located in Gwanda a dry southern region of Zimbabwe. This study unearths and assesses the livelihood resilience strategies households employ to fight food insecurity in the face of harsh climatic conditions. Thus enhances understanding on how households in the area manage drought and also assist in guiding targeted interventions on areas in similar contexts. The researcher adopted a mixed methods approach were Qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques were used. Data were collected using questionnaires, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and observations. Probability random sampling was used to select 284 respondents. The study revealed that increased frequency and periodicity of drought has created a crisis of food insecurity. To fight this, households engage in several on-farm strategies. These strategies are effective and efficient in reducing households’ vulnerability to food insecurity. Challenges such as the increased frequency and periodicity of drought, environmental degradation, water scarcity, inadequate knowledge and skills and shortage of financial capital reduce the effectiveness of the strategies employed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Though the world is dependent on coal as the main source for electricity generation, it increases the ecological burden [greenhouse gases (GHGs)] along with the continual depletion problem. Hence, the biofuel economy is attracting global attention mainly due to improved domestic energy security, reduced GHG emissions, employment generation at local/regional/rural levels, and society uplift. Although biofuels are generally considered as a threat to food security, with a properly established biofuel economy management system, productivity in both the agriculture and fuel sectors can be improved. Overall, it is concluded that social and economic concerns play a vital role in the sustainability of biofuel/coal-based energy for various sectors. A systematic methodology needs to be followed for social and economic assessment of biomass/coal-based fuels. © 2019 Angelo Basile and Francesco Dalena Published by Elsevier Inc.

In Taiwan, PM 2.5 concentration data mostly come from the limited static stations, and their locations are far from streets where people walk or drive by. This might cause the underestimation of PM 2.5 concentration. In this paper, an on-board monitoring system is established to record the PM 2.5 concentration in the surrounding areas where people live. The recorded PM 2.5 concentration data are more accurate than the data from the static stations. In order to get the future PM 2.5 concentration trend, the prediction model is established in this study. A long short-term memory (LSTM) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) are used as the core of the prediction model due to their ability to analyze time series data such as the PM 2.5 concentration data. And the research results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the prediction model using LSTM and GRU is 3.57 and 3.67 in the testing set. The prediction results can provide important air pollutant information to the public and can be used to make better air pollution control policies. © 2018 IEEE.","gated recurrent unit; long short-term memory; on-board monitoring system; PM 2.5; prediction","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Brain; Digital storage; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; gated recurrent unit; On-board monitoring systems; Particulate Matter; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Prediction model; Root mean square errors; Time-series data; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061486686

Mattioli 25, Torino, I-10125, Italy","Modifications in cell wall composition, which can be accompanied by changes in its structure, were already reported during plant interactions with other organisms, such as the mycorrhizal fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are among the most widespread soil organisms that colonize the roots of land plants, where they facilitate mineral nutrient uptake from the soil in exchange for plant-assimilated carbon. In AM symbiosis, the host plasma membrane invaginates and proliferates around all the developing intracellular fungal structures, and cell wall material is laid down between this membrane and the fungal cell surface. In addition, to improve host nutrition and tolerance/resistance to environmental stresses, AM symbiosis was shown to modulate fruit features. In this study, Comprehensive Microarray Polymer Profiling (CoMMP) technique was used to verify the impact of the AM symbiosis on the tomato cell wall composition both at local (root) and systemic level (fruit). Multivariate data analyses were performed on the obtained datasets looking for the effects of fertilization, inoculation with AM fungi, and the fruit ripening stage. Results allowed for the discernment of cell wall component modifications that were correlated with mycorrhizal colonization, showing a different tomato response to AM colonization and high fertilization, both at the root and the systemic level. © 2019 by the authors.

In this paper, the Thousand Pillars Dwelling (TPD) is taken as a research objective to explore its climate adaptation strategies and effectiveness for the local climate in the view of passive elements (PEs) and passive spaces (PSs). By the methodologies of literature reviews, field investigations and software simulations, the buffer effect (BE) created by PEs (composed of doors, windows, walls etc.) and PSs (composed of patios, corridors etc.) contributing to the improvement of indoor comfort level (ICL) is researched qualitatively. An additional study on in-situ measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and illuminance in diverse parts of TPD was carried out to research their effectiveness of climate adaptation quantitatively. This study shows that BEs are effective at mitigating the impact of outdoor climate on internal spaces, which is helpful for the extension of indoor comfort time (EICT) by 3472 h per year. The research results of passive strategies are summarized from the study case of TPD and its effectiveness of climate adaptation can provide some methods and implications to create more comfortable indoor environments for rural residences. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate adaptation; Indoor comfort time (ICT); Passive element (PE); Passive spaces (PS); Thousand pillars dwelling (TPD)","Air; Climate adaptation; Indoor comforts; Passive elements; Passive spaces (PS); Thousand pillars dwelling (TPD); Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056192653

The LV and ALV (L is the oleic phase, V is the vapor phase, and A is the aqueous phase) phase equilibria of the aforementioned systems are calculated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) with modified alpha functions and binary interaction parameters (BIPs). The six widely used mixing rules for predicting viscosity of solvents-heavy oil/bitumen systems pertaining to vapor-liquid equilibria are compared and evaluated, while the linear mixing rule is used for hydrocarbons-water mixtures. Plus, effective density is for the first time successfully introduced into the volume-based mixing rules. The volume-based power law, weight-based power law, and weight-based Cragoe's mixing rules are found to well reproduce the viscosity for the aforementioned systems with AARDs of 15.5%, 19.0%, and 32.6%, respectively. Effective density rather than real density of dissolved gas(es) should be used for all of the volume-based mixing rules, while the adjustable parameter in the power law mixing rule has a potential to achieve high generalization if adequate measurements are made available. Although water has a lower diluting ability than other solvents in the same amount of dissolution, it can outperform methane and CO 2 in diluting heavy oil/bitumen at high temperatures due to its high solubility. Addition of water can reduce or increase the viscosity of a solvents-heavy oil/bitumen mixture, depending on the ability of solvents and water to dilute heavy oil/bitumen and effects of water on the solvent dissolution. Water molar fraction in feed can exert an effect on the mixture viscosity in LV equilibria through affecting the solvent dissolution but cannot impose an impact on the mixture viscosity at ALV equilibria. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Density of gases; Dissolution; Equations of state; Methane; Mixing; Mixtures; Paraffins; Phase equilibria; Solvents; Viscosity; Adjustable parameters; Binary interaction parameter; Effective density; Elevated temperature; Function of pressure; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Presence of water; Temperature range; Heavy oil production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059736443

However, except for such heavily polluted regions as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, regional integration of air quality management in other parts of China has rarely been discussed, due to limited research on the spatio-temporal aggregation of PM2.5 concentrations. To fill this gap, we employed a repeated-bisection method, which supports high dimensional datasets and bootstrap clustering, for spatio-temporal clustering of city-level PM2.5 concentrations in China using time-series PM2.5 data and the test of geographical detector proved the reliability of the clustering. Since no weighted geographical information was employed during the clustering process, this research suggested that PM2.5 concentrations in China were of strong spatial self-aggregation effects, which proved the necessity for regional integration of air quality management. Based on the spatio-temporal clustering of PM2.5 concentrations, we further proposed six divisions of PM2.5 concentrations across China, within which PM2.5 concentrations display similar variation patterns and specific emission-reduction measures can be implemented accordingly.

Here, we conducted a synthesis of eddy covariance fluxes measurement across China's typical forests to examine the magnitude, pattern and controls of forest carbon fluxes and carbon use efficiency. The results showed that China's forests had strong carbon sink capacity and high carbon use efficiency. The average annual gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem production (NEP) of forests was 1541 ± 92, 1155 ± 91 and 382 ± 37 g C m−2 a−1, and the average NEP:GPP, RE:GPP and NEP:RE was 0.25 ± 0.02, 0.74 ± 0.02 and 0.36 ± 0.04, respectively. Both carbon fluxes and use efficiency significantly varied with biomes, presenting higher values in subtropical and temperate forests than tropical and boreal forests. GPP and RE geographically decreased linearly with latitude increasing, while the NEP and its ratios to GPP and RE peaked at the mid-latitude. Large variances of carbon fluxes and use efficiency were mainly attributable to the regulation of mean annual temperature (MAT). MAT explained 40–54% of the variation in carbon fluxes, and 21–47% of variation in carbon use efficiency. Our result also indicated that carbon use efficiency was affected by stand age that presented an apparent decreasing trend from young to old-growth forests. The results advance our understanding about the variances and controls of carbon exchange and use efficiency and are valuable for regional carbon budget assessment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon flux; Carbon use efficiency; Climate regulation; Forest age; Spatial variation","Budget control; Carbon; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Tropics; Carbon fluxes; Carbon use efficiencies; Climate regulation; Forest age; Spatial variations; Forestry; age structure; biogeochemistry; carbon balance; carbon budget; carbon flux; climate change; forest ecosystem; net ecosystem production; net primary production; nutrient use efficiency; respiration; spatial variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057146278

In this paper, the embodied carbon emissions in trade are estimated by using an input–output model in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and then a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) model is further applied to conduct decomposition analysis on factors of embodied carbon changes. Our primary findings show the following: (1) Production-based CO 2 emissions from Hubei and Hunan are higher than consumption-based CO 2 emissions. There are situations in Jiangxi and Anhui where production-based CO 2 emissions are both higher and lower than consumption-based CO 2 emissions. However, inter-regional trade implied carbon is dominated by net inflows. Moreover, the inter-regional embodied carbon emissions in trade mainly flow out to relatively developed regions, such as Jiangsu and Shanghai. The inflow of embodied carbon in trade comes mainly from relatively backward economic development areas, such as Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia. (2) From the perspective of industry, industries in Jiangxi and Anhui are dominated by net inflow, whereas industries in Hunan and Hubei are dominated by net outflow. Meanwhile, industry in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River displays a high carbon-locked phenomenon. Specifically, the high carbon-locked outflow industries are mainly concentrated in the transportation and warehousing industry, agriculture, and the chemical industry, and the outflow provinces flow out mainly to Jiangsu, Guangdong, and other economically developed regions; high carbon-locked inflows are concentrated in metal smelting and rolling processing, food manufacturing and tobacco processing, and construction, and the provinces are mainly Hebei, Henan, and Inner Mongolia, where economic development is lacking. (3) Furthermore, the results of SDA decomposition indicate that scale effect is generally the most important factor leading to embodied carbon outflow. Meanwhile, the energy carbon emission effect, the energy intensity effect, and the structural effect are important factors—the inter-industry association effect mainly promotes the embodied carbon outflow. Consequently, based on the distinction between production and consumer responsibility, and from the perspective of scale effect and structural effect, the related policy suggests that consumers should be held responsible. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Embodied carbon emissions in trade; Input–output model; Responsibility for reducing emission; SDA model","carbon emission; civilization; decomposition analysis; economic development; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental modeling; input-output analysis; trade-environment relations; urbanization; Anhui; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Henan; Hubei; Hunan; Jiangsu; Jiangxi; Nei Monggol; Yangtze River; Nicotiana tabacum; carbon; air pollutant; analysis; China; commercial phenomena; environmental monitoring; industry; procedures; river; trends; urbanization; Air Pollutants; Carbon; China; Commerce; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Rivers; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056296315

However, it remains unclear about the relative roles of abiotic and biotic properties in controlling the abundance and activity of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying microorganisms in permafrost-affected soils. Methods: We analysed the potential ammonia oxidation and denitrification rates (PAO and PDR), the abundance of archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nirK, nirS and nosZ genes, soil characteristics, climatic and plant properties across two vegetation types in Tibetan permafrost-affected soils. The relative importance of abiotic and biotic properties in driving functional N gene abundance, PAO and PDR were assessed using variation partition analysis (VPA) and random forest (RF) model. Results: The functional N gene abundance and PDR were lower in alpine steppe than in alpine meadow. Variations in the PAO and PDR and functional N gene abundance were mainly explained by abiotic variables such as organic carbon and total N, then by plant properties such as plant N concentration, plant species richness and productivity based on the VPA. The RF model showed that abiotic properties (e.g., precipitation) and plant properties (e.g., plant N concentration or plant productivity) predicted the PDR and the abundance of functional N genes. Both VPA and RF model showed that the PAO and PDR could be determined by the abundance of functional N genes such as archaeal amoA gene and nosZ gene, respectively. Conclusions: Our study highlights that abiotic and plant properties are important predictors of the abundance and activity of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying communities in permafrost-affected regions, implying that plant properties, which were previously overlooked, should be incorporated into ecosystem models for improved prediction of belowground N process rates in a changing environment. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ammonia oxidation; Ammonia-oxidizing microorganism; Biogeography; denitrification; Denitrifiers; Permafrost","abiotic factor; abundance; biogeography; denitrification; microbial activity; microbial community; microorganism; nutrient cycling; oxidation; permafrost; China; Xizang; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056160841

Further, we conduct the Tobit regression and demonstrate that local environmental enforcement has an inverted U-shaped effect on green investment efficiency of polluting firms. Notably, this effect is only statistically significant in Non-SOEs and small-scale enterprises. Moreover, we document a U-shaped relationship between local environmental enforcement and excessive green investments, and this relationship is also only pronounced in Non-SOEs and small-scale firms.

The tests were performed using a six-cylinder, heavy-duty direct injection diesel engine.

Exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) were analyzed according to European Steady-state Cycle (ESC). Besides, lubricant oil samples were extracted from the crankcase in the equipment of MSF and CPF individually. Then the kinematic viscosity, colloids and metal content of oil samples were determined. The results showed that MSF effectively reduced wear metal accumulation and insoluble colloids in lubricating oil, and thus retarded deterioration of oil viscosity. Compared with CPF, an increase of 2.7 kW in maximum output power and decrease of 1.66–2.85% in BSFC were observed for MSF. In addition, the using of MSF significantly reduced HC (60.9%) and PM (12.5%) emission while increased CO and NOx emission slightly.

Research on the spatiotemporal patterns of C storage and density in forest ecosystems is essential to understand the role of forest ecosystems in the C sink and is helpful to select the efficient forest management practice to maximize the C sequestration potential. We quantified the C storage in forest ecosystems in Hunan Province in southern China over two decades by combining forest inventory data with field survey. The C storage in forest ecosystems in Hunan Province increased from 820.2 Tg to 1277.8 Tg over the two decades, with 457.6 Tg (134.4 Tg in vegetation and 323.2 Tg in soil) of C sequestration in the forest ecosystems. Forest C storage increased sharply from 1996 to 2007, but slowly from 2007 to 2015. The mean annual C sequestration was 25.8 Tg yr−1, with 19.0 Tg yr−1 in soil and 6.8 Tg yr−1 in vegetation. The C density in forest ecosystems increased from 110.3 Mg ha−1 in 1996 to 130.8 Mg ha−1 in 2013. C densities varied in forest types, with the highest value in evergreen broadleaved forest ecosystems. The uneven spatial distributions of forest C storage, density, and sequestration in Hunan Province exhibited similar pattern with the highest in the western Hunan and the lowest in the central Hunan. The forest ecosystems in Hunan Province present a significant C sequestration potential (1321.5 Tg, including 1029.2 Tg in biomass C and 292.3 Tg in soil C), given the proportion of the area of young and middle-aged forests (71.3%). To maximize the C sequestration potential of forest ecosystems in Hunan Province, future forest management should focus on the conversion of forest type, the selection of tree species in reforestation, and the prevention of adverse human disturbances in young and middle-aged forests. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon density; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Forest ecosystem; Spatiotemporal pattern","Carbon capture; Climate change; Digital storage; Reforestation; Soils; Vegetation; Carbon density; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Forest ecosystem; Spatiotemporal patterns; Ecosystems; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; density; evergreen forest; field survey; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; forest management; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; Chelation; Density; Ecosystems; Forest Management; Patterns; Plants; Reforestation; Storage; China; Hunan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054437203

Methods: From 08/2014 to 03/2018, 31 consecutive patients with sum of the longest diameters of primary tumor and hilar lymph node < 5 cm, N0-1, M0 NSCLC treated with PT were retrospectively analyzed. Gating/active breathing control techniques were used to control tumor motion in 20 and 7 patients. PBS-based proton radiotherapy (PRT) or carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) plans were designed via Syngo® planning system. PRT, PRT + CIRT boost, and CIRT were used in 6, 6 and 19 patients, respectively.

Grade 2 acute toxicities included hematological toxicities (5 cases), RILI (2), plural pain (1) and dermatitis (1). Grade 2 late toxicities included RILI (3) and asymptomatic rib fracture (1). Three patients had progressed disease at 4.0~10.6 months after the initiation of PT. One experienced local failure with simultaneous distant failure and died of brain metastasis at 10.8 months; one developed regional and distant failure and died of lung infection at 8.7 months; the other experienced isolated distant failure only and his disease was well controlled after salvage systemic therapy. The estimated rates of progression-free survival, local control, cause-specific survival and overall survival at 1, 2 years were 85.5% and 85.5%, 95.2% and 95.2%, 95.0% and 95.0%, 90.7% and 90.7%, respectively. Conclusions: PBS-based PT appears safe and effective for early stage NSCLC. Further follow-up and investigation is warranted. Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN78973763.

The climate changes observed under the warming scenarios, especially those induced by increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs), are also conducive to the increase in air pollution. However, how the air pollution changes in response to the GHG warming has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. We investigate this change using the century-long large ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model 1 (CESM1) with the fixed anthropogenic emissions at the year 2005. Our results show that although the aerosol emission is assumed to be a constant throughout the experiment, anthropogenic air pollution presents positive responses to the GHG-induced warming. The anthropogenic PM2.5 concentration is estimated to increase averaged over eastern China at the end of this century, but varying from regions, with an increase over northwestern part of eastern China and a decrease over southeastern part. Similar changes can be observed for the light air pollution days. However, the severe air pollution days are reported to increase across eastern China at the end of this century, particularly around the Jing-Jin-Ji region. Further research indicates that the increased stagnation days and the decreased light precipitation days are the possible causes of the increase in PM2.5 concentration, as well as the anthropogenic air pollution days. Estimation shows that the effect of climate change induced by the GHG warming can account for 11%-28% of the changes in anthropogenic air pollution days over eastern China. Therefore, in the future, more stringent regulations on regional air pollution emissions are needed to balance the effect from climate change. © Author(s) 2019.All Rights Reserved.",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; climate change; concentration (composition); greenhouse gas; particulate matter; twenty first century; warming; China; Jingjinji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059696962

A periodic Filippov system describing the state-dependent control strategy for air pollution, described by air quality index (AQI), is proposed. We theoretically analyze the non-autonomous Filippov subsystem for variation of AQI by converting into an autonomous Filippov system via increasing dimension of the system. We obtain that there is a unique periodic solution which is globally asymptotically stable. In particular, it shows that AQI stabilizes at either one of the periodic solutions of the free and control systems or a new periodic solution induced by the on-off control strategies, depending on the threshold levels. Then, a periodic system for respiratory infection with AQI-embedded transmission probability is formulated to examine the influence of air pollution on respiratory infection. We further obtain the control reproduction number (basic reproduction number with control strategies) of this periodic respiratory infection model. It is shown that the respiratory infection will go extinct if the control reproduction number is less than unity, while uniformly persists for larger than unity. The case study showed that the estimated threshold level coincides with the actual threshold which launches the traffic limitation measure in Xi'an, indicating the untimely density-dependent traffic limitation measure was ineffective in improving air quality. Numerically studies indicate that increasing the threshold level leads to an increase in the maximum value of the unique periodic solution for AQI and the control reproduction number for the AQI embedded SEIS model. These findings emphasize the importance of suitable threshold level to trigger interventions and suggest that untimely implementing control strategy may not effectively control air population. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Filippov system; Respiratory infection; Threshold dynamics","air quality; atmospheric pollution; health impact; policy approach; pollutant source; pollution control; public health; quantitative analysis; respiratory disease; threshold; air pollution; air quality; air quality control; air quality index; Article; China; control system; controlled study; disease free equilibrium; disease model; dynamics; Filippov system; least square analysis; limit of quantitation; mathematical analysis; priority journal; probability; respiratory tract infection; adverse event; air pollution; basic reproduction number; human; public health; respiratory tract infection; theoretical model; Air Pollution; Basic Reproduction Number; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Public Health; Respiratory Tract Infections",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055053381

Present article focuses on assessment of testing and calibration using virtual approach. To prove and validate this approach, a six-cylinder heavy duty diesel engine is selected and configured in HiL environment. The engine plant model is built offline and validated with base engine data at steady state and transient operations and RT model is integrated with ECU hardware. Data for plant model corrections is generated with short measurement campaign. Refined real time plant model is prepared for evaluating different calibration strategies on virtual test bed environment. It is observed that, performance and emission predictions portray an accuracy of the order of 90%. This approach has benefited to a great extent in reduction of calibration efforts, ease of calibration for nonstandard ambient conditions, screening of various hardware options, fast calibration of engine derivatives for various applications and without any change in the calibration toolchain platform.

Diverse managements have been considered as effective ways to restore degraded grassland, but it remains unclear how semi-arid grasslands respond to long-term grazing exclusion and fenced mowing. Here, a study was conducted under open grazing, grazing exclusion and fenced mowing in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau. We measured plant species composition and diversity, plant production, surface litter and soil water and carbon content. Shifts in grassland management led to significant divergence in plant community composition. Long-term grazing exclusion (35 years) significantly increased plant biomass, surface litter, soil water and carbon storage, but suppressed plant diversity compared to open grazing. Conversely, fenced mowing significantly increased plant diversity accompanying with a weak effect on soil carbon. Moreover, mowing significantly reduced surface litter and soil moisture, which have strong implications for nutrient depletion and soil drying. Our results suggest that introducing disturbances are necessary to safeguard biodiversity, and continuous mowing (5 years) belongs to over exploitation of the long-term protected grassland. Therefore, it is essential to optimize management with dual objectives of biodiversity and soil carbon sequestration in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Long-term grazing exclusion; Mowing; Plant composition; Soil carbon","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; conservation management; divergence; environmental restoration; grassland soil; grazing; land degradation; long-term change; mowing; optimization; plant community; recovery plan; restoration ecology; semiarid region; soil carbon; species diversity; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054039558

Eight BDE congeners (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, -183, and -209) in mangrove sediments and leaves were determined. The highest level of BDE-209 in SJM was proximate to areas of point-source discharges of Dongbao River in Pearl River Estuary, China. Total organic carbon (TOC) was influential in BDE-209 accumulations in SJM, XXM, and FTM.

Ecological risk of BDE-209 was high in SJM, with medium/negligible risk in the other urban mangroves. The transfers of BDE-209 from sediment to leaf were weak (BGM and FTM), improved (XXM), and restricted (SJM), respectively.

Meanwhile, emerging global agendas are providing unprecedented incentives for large-scale restoration within human-impacted tropical forest landscapes. Whilst logged forests have high conservation value, their adoption within these agendas remains controversial. We review the value of restoring logged tropical forests for boosting economic and environmental resilience. Targeted interventions can recover depleted timber stocks, increase saleable carbon stores, and deliver employment and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to local communities. Restoration has mixed outcomes for biodiversity but if it improves relogging practices and protects forests from conversion to agricultural plantations may have major positive impacts. We also examine socio-economic and political pathways for upscaling logged forest restoration and their incorporation into sustainable forestry, given political and commercial malaise on post-logging interventions. Spurring these transitions will require strong institutions, executed by policies that enable long-term concession licences and community land tenure, that leverage commercial involvement and payments for ecosystem services, and that optimise existing interventions. Research frontiers include: (a) validating the economic and technical feasibility of different interventions; (b) understanding how these interventions impact on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services, NTFPs, and biodiversity; and (c) identifying when to restore a logged forest. This requires establishing long-term experimental trials that jointly track environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. Synthesis and applications. Post-logging interventions can deliver various timber, carbon, socioeconomic and potentially biodiversity benefits but are underemployed and undervalued pantropically. Opportunities exist to optimise interventions by tailoring incentives, policies, and management to ecological and social circumstances. Governments, conservation bodies and the private sector must underscore restoration of production forests as a major future objective, including via greater adoption in global initiatives, including forest and landscape restoration under the Bonn Challenge and the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) agenda. © 2018 The Authors.

Common hurdles are met in all CA countries, such as that a multitude of entities are in charge of water resources management; implementation of water reforms is challenging in all CA countries; water resources management issues require continuous attention; local water management is a priority, but achievements are mixed as of today. While integrated water resources management (IWRM) is the main approach to undertake water reforms in each CA country, other objectives like the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the introduction of the green growth concept, the integration of climate change policies, and the adoption of the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus concept are also driving toward water reforms on national level. Various initiatives have been taken for reforming the water sector in CA, like the gradual establishment of river basin management approaches in all CA countries, the WEF assessment of the Syr Darya River, the development of the green growth project in Kazakhstan for efficient water use, the creation of a national water information system in Kyrgyzstan, the engagement of development partners in each newly designed basin in Tajikistan, and the creation of a Multi-Partner Human Security Trust-Fund for the Aral Sea region (MPHSTF) in Uzbekistan. However, reforming the water sector goes well beyond adopting new policies and initiatives, updating the legislative framework, and building new institutions. The key challenges are the continuous and strong high-level political engagement of all CA countries to better coordinate water management at national and transboundary level, active participation of stakeholders on Basin level, and technical and financial support of the relevant authorities and organizations that are implementing the water reforms. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, UNU-INWEH; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076973151

In this work, a trend analysis of pollutants involved in NO2 processes was done for the period 2003–2014 in traffic sites from three Spanish cities (Barcelona, Madrid and Granada) that still exceed the European NO2 air quality standard limits. We also estimated the contributions of primary NO2 emissions and photo-chemically formed NO2 to the observed ambient NO2 concentrations in order to explore their possible role in the observed NO2 concentration trends. The NOx and NO concentrations at these traffic sites showed significant decreasing trends during the period 2003–2014, especially at Barcelona (BARTR) and Madrid (MADTR) traffic stations. The NO2 concentrations showed statistically significant downward trends at BARTR and MADTR and remained unchanged at Granada traffic station (GRATR) during the study period. Despite the significant decrease in NO2 concentrations in BCNTR and MADTR during the analysed period, the NO2 concentrations observed over these sites still above the annual NO2 standard limit of 40 μg m−3 and, therefore, more efficient measures are still needed. Primary NO2 emissions significantly influence NO2 concentrations at the three analysed sites. However, as no drastic changes are expected in the after-exhaust treatment technology that can reduce primary NO2 emissions to zero in the near future, only a substantial reduction in NOx emissions will help to comply with the NO2 European air quality standards. Reduction of 78%, 56% and 16% on NOx emissions in Barcelona, Madrid and Granada were estimated to be necessary to comply with the NO2 annual limit of 40 μg m−3. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; EU limit values; NO and O3 concentrations; NO2; NOx; Primary NO2 fraction (f-NO2)","Air pollution; Air quality; Air quality standards; Quality control; Reduction; Urban growth; Ambient nitrogen dioxide; Concentration trends; Limit values; NO concentration; Primary NO2 fraction (f-NO2); Substantial reduction; Treatment technologies; Trend analysis; Nitrogen oxides; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; European Union; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; urban area; air pollution; air quality standard; Article; concentration (parameters); priority journal; quantitative analysis; Spain; trend study; urban area; Andalucia; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Granada [Andalucia]; Granada [Granada (PRV)]; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050728781

Although Table 1 features “rough” or “back-of-the-envelope” estimations of travel-related carbon emissions for eighteen participants of a workshop, we believe some of our methodological choices and their implications were not sufficiently dealt with in the article. We estimated travel-related carbon emissions based on the workshop's registration list and based on the cities complying with the participants' affiliations. These choices have at least three shortcomings which were not explicitly mentioned as such in the article: (i) the workshop's registration list might differ from the attendance list; (ii) the city of affiliation might be different from that of the actual origin city; and (iii) some participants might have combined multiple events at the destination, causing the attribution of all emissions to this single workshop to be not that straightforward. In fact, we now know (i) there was one participant who had to return earlier and eventually did not make it to the workshop, (ii) there was at least one case where the city of affiliation was different from the actual origin city, and (iii) one of the participants combined several meetings in Europe by train, of which the actual workshop was only one. Although we framed our calculations as “rough” estimations and much debate is possible about how emissions should be calculated and attributed (see also footnote 1–3 of the article), it is clear that we could and should have verified these personal travel data more thoroughly and explicitly in order to arrive at a more precise emission assessment. The reader of the article should therefore bear in mind that the approach described above has resulted in inaccuracies, hence in approximations of the actual emissions at best. In this specific case, the reported emissions are likely overestimations for some of the participants. Besides these points, we want to echo the methodological concern raised in footnote 2 of the article. Although one might argue that it is the actual trips taken which cause environmental damage, we believe that an analysis of emissions should ideally start from the perspective of the individual academic (or research group), and that it should include all individual considerations made in order to decide to attend the event or not. After all, as argued by one of the reviewers of the article, it is entirely possible that the workshop was the one event per year that some of the participants allowed themselves to fly to. A quantitative assessment based on travel distances does not reveal these aspects. We regret any concern or offence we may have caused by not making clear these limitations of our data and methodology, and hope that this corrigendum now puts the record straight. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,Erratum,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058700651

Diesel vehicles and their use of emission control technologies such as Diesel Oxidation Catalysts, have dominated the emission of NO2 from road vehicles. In this work, we summarise findings from recent vehicle emission remote sensing measurements in the UK that provide detailed information on the emissions of NO2 and total NOx(NO2 + NO). We show that while new diesel cars and light commercial vehicles are associated with high (typically 30%) proportions of NO2/NOx, the amount of absolute NOx and NO2 emitted by most Euro 6 vehicles has decreased substantially and that absolute emissions of NO2 have been reducing since around 2007. Additionally, we find that the amount of NO2 decreases as the vehicle mileage increases. Taken together, these factors have led to substantial reductions in emissions of NO2 in recent years from light duty diesel vehicles, which has contributed to reduced roadside NO2 concentrations. There is a need however for commonly used emission factor models to account for these changes in emissions of NO2. © 2018 The Author(s)","Euro standards; Remote sensing; Urban air pollution; Vehicle emissions","Air quality; Commercial vehicles; Diesel locomotives; Emission control; Light weight vehicles; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Ambient concentrations; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Emission control technologies; Emission factor model; Light commercial vehicles; Substantial reduction; Urban air pollution; Vehicle emission; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; emission control; exhaust emission; nitrogen dioxide; remote sensing; road traffic; standard (reference); traffic emission; urban pollution; Article; deterioration; exhaust gas; priority journal; remote sensing; United Kingdom; Europe; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059746126

In a country highly urbanised and dependent on fossil fuels as its primary energy source, one key avenue for meeting these commitments is energy transition in the built environment. Australia has emerged as a leader in the design and construction of high-performance buildings in the premium commercial office sector. In this paper, we address a significant gap in understanding the diverse mechanisms through which building energy transition is being constituted in this sector, focusing on Sydney and Melbourne. In the absence of substantive publicly available data, we draw on mixed methods comprising a database developed around high-performing CBD office buildings and qualitative interviews with a range of sectoral stakeholders. We characterise the building stock in each city, and document five trends constituting energy transitions. We demonstrate that building energy transitions are not only shaped purposefully by dominant governance regimes but also by opportunistic responses to specific material and commercial conditions and legacies in each city. Thus the urban built environment affords significant opportunity for energy transitions, but pathways towards such transitions are necessarily multiple and ultimately shaped by material as well as institutional geographies. © 2019, © 2019 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.","Australia; built environment; commercial office buildings; Urban energy transitions","building; energy efficiency; governance approach; institutional framework; qualitative analysis; stakeholder; Australia; Melbourne; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060596399

This marks one of the latest forms of transnational business governance, whereby state actors share the regulation of environmental and social externalities with private authority. This paper responds to the call for more contextual research into the complex policy ecosystems in which zero deforestation commitments are implemented and how transnational private authority is interacting with, and possibly being reconfigured by, domestic governance and territory. Combining policy analysis, field work on cocoa farms, focus groups, and over 45 interviews, this paper provides empirical evidence to explain how business commitments to zero deforestation cocoa interact with domestic political processes to reduce deforestation in key cocoa-producing countries. The focus is on three top cocoa producer countries in West Africa, where smallholder cocoa farming causes environmental degradation due to deforestation, and socioeconomic progress for smallholders is difficult to achieve. In these countries, the private sector's commitment to reduce deforestation is situated in government-led programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The findings show that a codependent relationship is evolving between corporate and state-led efforts to reduce deforestation, where the success of zero deforestation cocoa relies on synergistic public–private interaction. Cocoa intensification without expansion, supply chain traceability, and jurisdictional commodity sourcing are the three main areas of future collaboration identified. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","private governance; REDD+; transnational business governance; zero deforestation supply chains","cocoa; deforestation; environmental degradation; governance approach; political process; public-private partnership; West Africa; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060785522

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ambient temperature and psychiatric emergency visits in an urban region in a temperate climate. The daily number of visits to a psychiatric emergency room (PEVs) at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden and the daily mean temperature were extracted for the study period 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2017. Case-crossover analysis with distributed lag non-linear models was used to analyse the data by season. The warm season was defined as May to August and the cold season as November to February. Shorter lags periods were used for the warm season than the cold season. In the analysis, temperatures at the 95th percentile was associated with 14% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2%, 28%) increase in PEVs at lag 0–3 and 22% (95%CI: 6%, 40%) for lags 0–14 during the warm season, relative to the seasonal minimum effect temperature (MET). During the cold season temperatures at the 5th percentile were associated with 25% (95% CI: −8%, 13%) and 18% (95% CI: −30%, 98%) increase in PEVs at lags 0–14 and 0–21 respectively. We observed an increased number of PEVs at high and low temperatures; however, not to a statistically significant extent for low temperatures. Our findings are similar to what has been found for somatic diseases and in studies of other mental health outcomes in regions with more extreme climates. This merits the inclusion of individuals with psychiatric disorders in awareness planning for climate warning systems. © 2019 by the authors.

In the wake of this debate, the international community continues to press forward with negotiations for a post-2012 legal instrument to address climate change. Neither the existing legal infrastructure-embodied by the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol-nor currently envisioned post-2012 approaches address links between climate change, human health, and human rights. This article explores the links between climate change, human health, and human rights-focusing on the human right to health. The article examines the current state of the international debate surrounding the human right to health and the proposed, yet elusive human right to a healthy environment. The fundamental dilemma is whether the existing system of human rights can continue to function effectively if it fails to account for the intrinsic links between climate change, environmental quality, and human health. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cellulose raw materials are the most abundant feedstocks on the Earth, but sugar-based feedstocks appear to contribute more effectively to ethanol production in the world. Also, sugar-based feedstocks present a lower production cost, mainly ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil, where the feedstock contributes with 60-70% of the production cost. Biofuel production aims to replace fossil fuels used in transport systems, reducing the CO2 emissions and its concentration in the atmosphere. Biotechnology has potential to offer species and yeast strains to increase yields. Land availability scenarios, energy balance, greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement potential, and regulatory issues should determine the best choice for each country or region, considering the local agriculture development stage, agricultural practices, and experiences. The processing of these feedstocks is quite similar except for the sugar extraction stage. The energy balance and GHG emission reduction potential are very much positively influenced by the availability of residues that are used as fuel for the processing plant, such as the cases of sugarcane and sweet sorghum, and by the high agricultural yields, as are the cases of sugarcane and sugar beets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To date, one of the most promising solutions for the mitigation of this important GHG consists of the bioconversion of CH4 into bioproducts with a high profit margin. In this context, methanotrophs have been already proven as cell-factories of some of the most expensive products synthesized by microorganisms. In the case of ectoine (1000 $ kg−1), already described methanotrophic genera such as Methylomicrobium can accumulate up to 20% (ectoine wt−1) using methane as the only carbon source. Moreover, α-methanotrophs, such as Methylosynus and Methylocystis, are able to store bioplastic concentrations up to 50–60% of their total cell content. More than that, methanotrophs are one of the greatest potential producers of methanol and exopolysaccharides. Although this methanotrophic factory could be enhanced throughout metabolic engineering, the valorization of CH4 into valuable metabolites has been already consistently demonstrated under continuous and discontinuous mode, producing more than one compound in the same bioprocess, and using both, single strains and specific consortia.

Studies concerning the monitoring and accounting for GHG emissions from WRRFs are of increasing interest. In this study, the floating hood technique for gas collection was coupled with the off-gas method to monitor and apportion nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from both aerated and non-aerated tanks in a municipal water resource recovery facility, in order to investigate its carbon footprint (CFP). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the chamber technique was applied to evaluate gas fluxes from the settler, where an emission factor (EF) of 4.71 ∗ 10−5 kgCO2,eq kgbCOD −1 was found. Interesting results were found in the disinfection unit, which was the major contributor to direct N2O emissions (with a specific emission factor of 0.008 kgCO2,eq kgbCOD −1), due to the chemical interaction between hydroxylamine and the disinfectant agent (hypochlorite). The specific emission factor of the biological aerated tank was 0.00112 kgCO2,eq kgbCOD −1. The average direct CO2 emission was equal to 0.068 kgCO2 kgbCOD −1 from the activated sludge tank and to 0.00017 kgCO2 kgbCOD −1 from the secondary clarifier. Therefore, taking into account the contribution of both direct N2O and CO2 emissions, values of 0.069 kgCO2,eq kgbCOD −1, 0.008 kgCO2,eq kgbCOD −1 and 0.00022 kgCO2,eq kgbCOD −1 were found for the net CFP of the aerated compartment, the disinfection unit and the clarifier, respectively. The plant energy Footprint (eFP) was also evaluated, confirming that the aeration system is the major contributor to energy consumption, as well as to indirect CO2 emission, with a specific eFP of 1.49 kWh kgbCOD −1. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Emission; Greenhouse gas; Nitrous oxide; Wastewater treatment","Activated sludge process; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Clarifiers; Climate change; Disinfection; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Neutron emission; Nitrogen oxides; Recovery; Tanks (containers); Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water resources; Biological treatment; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon footprints (CFP); Chemical interactions; Nitrous oxide; Potential sources; Receiving water bodies; Secondary clarifier; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; hydroxylamine; hypochlorite; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; disinfection; emission; greenhouse gas; nitrogen oxides; wastewater treatment; water resource; activated sludge; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; chemical interaction; chemical oxygen demand; chlorination; concentration (parameters); disinfection; effluent; energy consumption; gas transport; greenhouse gas; pollution monitoring; priority journal; waste water treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052095288

A 2016 survey was conducted of beef cattle industry professionals in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Respondent beliefs were assessed using two questions. When asked, “is climate changing?” 57% provided affirmative responses. The majority also believed human activity was at least partially responsible (8% mostly human caused, 54% human and natural causes, 27% natural causes). Those attributing climate change to human action expressed the most concern, with respondents expressing decreasing levels of concern in proportion to their belief in human contribution. Regulations were less concerning for those who attributed climate change to human activities than all other causal groups. Attitudes toward both adaptation and mitigation were significantly associated with causal beliefs and concern level about general and specific climate change impacts and age. However, a majority of producers expressed support for adaptation efforts regardless of their causal beliefs. Attitudes toward mitigation were less favorable overall with those who believed human activities were the primary cause of climate change placing a higher priority on mitigation efforts than those who attributed climate change at least partially to natural causes and those who did not acknowledge the reality of climate change. Given generally favorable attitudes toward adaptation, focusing on adaptation messaging may be a way to engage those who would otherwise be disinclined to participate in climate change programming and still achieve increased resilience to projected climate change impacts. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Beef; Beef cattle; Climate change impact; Human actions; Human activities; Oklahoma; Southern great plains; Climate change; age; attitudinal survey; cattle; climate change; human activity; meat; mitigation; perception; Great Plains; Kansas; Oklahoma [United States]; Texas; United States; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058444703

Here, we report structural dynamics and carbon storage gains from mangrove sites that have undergone rehabilitation to ascertain whether reforestation can complement conservation activities and warrant project investment. Replicated sites at two locations with contrasting geomorphic conditions were selected, Tiwoho and Tanakeke on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. These locations are representative of high (Tiwoho, deep muds and silty substrates) and low (Tanakeke, shallow, coralline sands) productivity mangrove ecosystems. They share a similar management history of clearing and conversion for aquaculture before restorative activities were undertaken using the practice of Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (EMR). Species diversity and mean biomass carbon storage gains after 10 yr of regrowth from the high productivity sites of Tiwoho (49.2 ± 9.1 Mg C·ha −1 ·yr −1 ) are already almost of one-third of mean biomass stocks exhibited by mature forests (167.8 ± 30.3 Mg C·ha −1 ·yr −1 ). Tiwoho's EMR sites, on average, will have offset all biomass C that was initially lost through conversion within the next 11 yr, a finding in marked contrast to the minimal carbon gains observed on the low productivity, low diversity, coral atoll EMR sites of Tanakeke (1.1 ± 0.4 Mg C·ha −1 ·yr −1 ). These findings highlight the importance of geomorphic and biophysical site selection if the primary purpose of EMR is intended to maximize carbon sequestration gains. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","aquaculture ponds; carbon sequestration; geomorphology; land use and land cover change; mangroves; rehabilitation","aquaculture; biomass; carbon emission; community dynamics; community structure; conservation management; deforestation; emission control; environmental economics; geomorphology; investment; land cover; land use change; mangrove; mitigation; pond; restoration ecology; species diversity; Greater Sunda Islands; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Anthozoa; Rhizophoraceae; carbon; biomass; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; Indonesia; wetland; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Indonesia; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059343584

For this reason, the Cooperation Mechanisms of the RES Directive 2009/28/EC were originally designed to encourage the collaboration of countries and contribute to the achievement of the 2020 EU RES target in a cost-effective manner while providing Member States (MS) with flexibility to meet their national RES objectives. These mechanisms will allow MS to achieve their national RES target in cooperation with other MS and include statistical transfers, joint projects and joint support schemes. However, their use has been limited, leading to skepticism about their future use. The aim of this article is to identify the factors that influence MS decision to use the Cooperation Mechanisms and to rank their importance. The empirical analysis is based on a comprehensive, in-depth literature review and a dedicated survey to MS. Our results show that, indeed, a wide array of drivers and barriers have influenced and will influence the future use of the Cooperation Mechanisms. The main drivers and barriers in the past significantly differ to those influencing the future use. Furthermore, the perception of the relevance of the drivers and barriers by the MS differs depending on whether the countries have already met or are having difficulties to meet their 2020 RES target domestically and on whether they have actually used the Cooperation Mechanisms or not. Some policy implications on how to overcome the existing barriers to the use of those mechanisms are derived from the analysis. © 2019 MDPI AG.

However, in order to develop rural tourism in a certain region, it is necessary to create supply elements to meet this demand. The task of producing and introducing touristic goods and services in rural destinations falls to local entrepreneurs. However, it would not be a realistic approach to expect local people to become entrepreneurs in the tourism sector, which is a sector they have no experience with. Therefore, it is imperative to prepare a suitable climate in order to encourage locals to become tourism entrepreneurs. The fact that the West Marmara region, which includes the research area Igneada region, is among the regions with the lowest intention of entrepreneurship (Karadeniz, 2014) also supports the fact that it is not realistic to expect the local people to intend to invest in tourism in their own self. Therefore, the establishment of a supportive and encouraging entrepreneurial climate in increasing the local people’s intention to become an entrepreneur in the field of tourism is even more important for the Igneada region. Considering the regional differences in entrepreneurial intentions, it is thought that a positive entrepreneurship climate in Kirklareli-Igneada region will contribute to the emergence of local tourism entrepreneurs. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2019 All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091756845

Although there have been some improvements in solid waste management practices in Colombia, current levels of recycling and materials recovery are still poor as only about 10% of the waste produced is recovered, so it is expected that, as for most developing countries, final disposal in landfills will continue to be the main form of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the coming decades. The optimization of waste degradation and stabilization processes is an essential key aspect for the environmental performance and economic sustainability of waste management systems in developing countries like Colombia. However, assessing the feasibility of biogas production in landfills requires a reasonable level of accuracy for the generation of methane, a sufficient understanding of the underlying generation processes and their relation with the physicochemical characteristics of the waste and landfill disposal conditions. Source segregation of MSW is either poor or non-existing in Colombia, as in most developing countries, which makes difficult to predict landfill gas generation even with the aid of current landfill emissions models. Only a few studies have been conducted to characterize biogas and methane production potential of mixed MSW landfilled in Latin-American countries, with few studies reported in Brazil and in Colombia. In this study, we show the results of biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests with 4–5 years old samples of municipal solid waste (MSW) excavated from a landfill site located in Colombia. Collected samples were characterized and the easy and medium biodegradable fractions used in the experiments. The results show an average total production of 34.8 − 37.9 L CH4 kg-1 DM added which is comparable with similar studies using excavated landfilled waste of similar characteristics. These results suggest that considering the potential of methane production from landfilled waste in developing countries, it is an alternative that could be considered to enhance the environmental performance of landfill sites by reduction of the emissions of uncontrolled CH4 and promote the use of non-conventional energy sources. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Using the EDGAR database and prefecture boundary data, CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission management performances at the prefecture level in China were investigated using statistical analysis. The results demonstrate that the spatial pattern of China’s CO2 emissions was mainly concentrated in certain key prefectures. The top ten prefectures in terms of per capita emissions are all concentrated along the coal mining belt in north China. Half of the prefectures (46%) in China have contributed more than 80% of total emissions, and roughly one third of the population lives in prefectures where annual per capita emissions are above the national average emissions level (5.7 ton CO2). Clustering analysis show that prefectures in China can be categorized into 6 groups, and half of the prefectures were in the low emission and low economy group. It is urgent for the prefectures in this group to make a low carbon transition so as to avoid the fate of high emission development. The implication of these findings for policymakers is that prefectures should be the focus of future strategies for low carbon development rather than provinces, and the selection of low carbon pilots need be based on the type of development, emissions intensity and their representativeness of certain category of prefectures. © 2019, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

However, accurate and robust CO2 emission data for 2005 remain limited, particularly for city-level emissions. To address these gaps, we established a uniform city-level CO2 emission inventory for all the 287 prefecture-level cities in China for 2005, combining the High-Resolution Emission Gridded Database (CHRED) 2.0, statistical data and onsite survey. The results showed that Shanghai, Tangshan, Beijing, Tianjin, Jining, Handan, Chongqing, Suzhou, Shijiazhuang and Wuhan were the ten cities with greatest CO2 emissions in 2005, with total CO2 emissions of 205, 184, 145, 126, 116, 103, 96, 93, 90 and 81 Mt, respectively. These cities were either megacities or those dominated by coal, iron or steel production. However, the three cities with the highest CO2 emissions per GDP and CO2 emissions per capita were Jiayuguan, Wuhai and Shizuishan, which were dominated by industry, small- or medium-sized, and exhibited a high demand for heat and cooling. Cluster analysis revealed that industrial energy consumption was the dominant emission source for most cities, except Haikou and Lhasa, for which indirect CO2 emissions were dominant.

Climatic hazards in Kampala include prolonged dry spells and seasonal floods; which destroy infrastructure, contaminate air and lead to unprecedented spread of cholera and malaria. Both conventional and emancipatory gender ideologies are characteristic of how the gender-climate nexus shapes adaptation at neighborhood scale. Women, as custodians of domestic hygiene, navigate the health risks of flooding through tradeoffs among competing uses of their time and labour, as men comply with the masculinity code of family safety to repair flooded homes and drainages. Emancipatory gender ideologies on the other hand are manifested by women's and men's agency to adopt alternative energy sources and urban greening that have potential for sustainability.

Although these systems can benefit from official designation as heritage, they are infrequently given this benefit, as thewater andwastewater management community that is responsible for them often remains disconnected from the heritage management community. I argue for the establishment of best practice guidelines on the stewardship of historic waterworks infrastructure. Further, I examine the need to evaluate historic significance and identify character-defining features as well as to promote rehabilitation, redundancy, and sustainability of active elements. This discussion is illustrated by the cases of the Aqua Virgo and the Cloaca Maxima of Ancient Rome, the karez of China’s Turpan Province, the Jerome Park Reservoir and Water Tunnel No. 3 in New York City, and the mamanteo canals of Peru. In addition, I recommend strongly that water and wastewater managers and preservationists consider adaptive use of historic waterworks infrastructure after they are decommissioned from active use. Vibrant examples of repurposing are included from around the world, including subgrade sewers, cisterns, and weirs, as well as above-grade gatehouses, wastewater treatment plants, and pumping stations. The heroic civil engineering achievements of the past were often realized amidst the need for social change. In particular, water infrastructure systems, such as gravity-fed aqueducts, delivered reliable sources of potable water to communities while also consistently reducing outbreaks of disease and fire. Preservation of this heritage poses multiple challenges, owing, in part, to the inaudibility and invisibility of these systems, the general public’s limited awareness of this heritage’s civil engineering significance, underrepresentation in World Heritage listings, and limited funding from government agencies that often privilege utility over aesthetics. Although it is inextricably linked to cultural, agrarian, industrial, and maritime landscapes in urban and rural communities worldwide, this infrastructural heritage can suffer unsympathetic alteration, encroachment, obsolescence, demolition, and abandonment. Nonetheless, some waterworks heritage has been preserved within active systems, and some decommissioned sites have successfully been repurposed. All merit closer study by modern planners, engineers, and policymakers as they work to meet water delivery and wastewater removal needs today. In regulatory and political climates where heritage is increasingly threatened, there is a need for management guidelines for historic waterworks infrastructure, in order to consistently apply best practices to analysis, decision making, and modes of treatment. Conservation must be balanced with the demand for new construction and upgrades, in a process that (1) acknowledges significance and identifies characterdefining features; (2) evaluates the choice between rehabilitation and replacement for prudence and feasibility; (3) views preservation as a pragmatic and cost-effective means to extend purpose-built service life; (4) replaces sacrificial elements; and (5) repurposes decommissioned elements. © The Author(s) 2020.","Adaptive use; Heritage management; Historic water and wastewater infrastructure; Rehabilitation; Stewardship guidelines; Sustainability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085829592

These goals are: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, an increase of renewable energy to 20%, and an improvement in energy efficiency by 20% by reducing energy consumption. The goals are aimed at protecting the climate, but also take into account the specificity of economies of different countries, which is why in the case of Poland they are lower and depending on the goal they range from 14% to 15.48%.

Infrastructural ecology is a planning paradigm that emulates the closed-loop, sharing logic of natural ecosystems. It suggests that features of our power, water, sanitation, transport, and food systems may be strategically combined, collocated, or otherwise linked for mutual benefit. Such interconnected systems then can cascade (pass along) waste energy or water and nutrients for another’s reuse, arrangements that can reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, while lowering demand for new resource inputs.

The present paper extends (Brock and Xepapadeas in Eur Econ Rev 94:263–282, 2017) to a non-cooperative framework with polar amplification, where regions decide emissions by maximizing own welfare. This can be regarded as a case of regional non-cooperation regarding climate change. Open loop and feedback solutions are derived and compared, in terms of temperature paths and welfare, with the cooperative solution.

In most cases, national policy sets planning frameworks and goals, while actions are carried out at the regional and local level on a more or less voluntary basis. Current approaches to integrated planning are reviewed and an overview is given of how the regional planning context in these countries differs from the United States. In general, planning is more often centralized in the European context and is increasingly driven by environmental concerns, while planning in the United States is highly devolved to the local level and remains principally driven by fiscal considerations. In all contexts, barriers to implementation of integrated transportation and land use planning at the local level include funding shortages, lack of analytical capabilities, institutional complexities preventing collaboration, and uncertain public acceptance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

There are particular types of air pollution that range from the smog of London and Los Angeles through the forest fire smoke and dust episodes that trouble Asia. There are indoor air pollution problems that have an episodic nature and expose our most vulnerable populations to air pollutants that have leaked indoors or have been generated by indoor materials or activities.

Methods: A population-based prevalence survey of hearing impairment was undertaken in 2014. Fifty-one clusters of 80 people aged 6 months and older were selected using probability-proportionate-to-size sampling. A two-stage hearing screening was conducted using otoacoustic emissions on all participants followed by pure-tone audiometry on those aged 4 years and older who failed otoacoustic emissions. Cases of hearing impairment were defined using the World Health Organization definition of disabling hearing impairment: a pure-tone average of thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz of ≥41 dB HL for adults and ≥31 dB HL for children based on the better ear. Possible causes of hearing impairment were ascertained by a certified audiologist. Reported hearing difficulties were also measured in this survey and compared with audiometry results. Results: Three thousand five hundred seventy-three people were examined (response rate 87%), of whom 52% were female. The prevalence of disabling hearing impairment was 4.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.8 to 5.3). Disabling hearing impairment prevalence increased with age from 0.4% in those aged 4 to 17 years (95% CI = 0.2 to 1.1) to 34.7% (95% CI = 28.7 to 41.1) in those aged older than 65 years. No difference in prevalence was seen by sex. Ear examination suggested that the possible cause of disabling hearing impairment was chronic suppurative otitis media for 6.9% of cases and dry perforation for 5.6% cases. For the vast majority of people with disabling hearing impairment, a possible cause could not be established. The overall prevalence of reported or proxy reported hearing impairment was 2.6% (95% CI = 2.0 to 3.4), and this ranged from 0.6% (95% CI = 0.08 to 4.4) in those aged 0 to 3 years to 14.4% (95% CI = 9.8 to 20.7) in those aged older than 65 years. Conclusions: Disabling hearing impairment in Telangana State is common, affecting approximately 1 in 23 people overall and a third of people aged older than 65 years. These findings suggest that there are a substantial number of individuals with hearing impairment who could potentially benefit from improved access to low-cost interventions.

Marine transportation systems are needed to move these resources out of the Arctic by sea to global markets, and the most visible increases in marine operations and shipping are occurring along Russia’s Northern Sea Route. Arctic marine access is also changing in unprecedented ways with the profound retreat of Arctic sea ice in all seasons. In response to these extraordinary changes in the maritime Arctic, the Arctic states and maritime community at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) negotiated and approved a new Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (the Polar Code), a set of mandatory and uniform regulations to enhance marine safety and environmental protection that came fully into force in July 2018. The Arctic states have also signed two binding agreements or treaties that address Arctic search and rescue (SAR), and Arctic oil pollution. In the Arctic Council a major study, the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment (AMSA), was conducted 2004-2009 providing a policy document for the Arctic states that focused on the protection of Arctic people and the marine environment. AMSA continues to be a valuable baseline assessment of Arctic marine use, a strategic guide to a host stakeholder, and a policy framework for the Arctic Council since the recommendations were negotiated by the Arctic states. Future Arctic marine policies and actions will be needed to address heavy fuel oil in Arctic waters, implementation and enforcement of the Polar Code, an Arctic Ocean emissions control zone, ship monitoring and surveillance systems, and a host of marine infrastructure challenges. The environmental security challenges of future Arctic navigation will require unprecedented cooperation in maritime affairs among the Arctic states, flag states, the people who live in the Arctic, and the global maritime enterprise. © The Author(s) 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086969213

To improve understanding of this process and management, we compare the invasion ecology of and management response to three cereal aphids: Sugarcane aphid, Russian wheat aphid, and greenbug. The region exploited is determined primarily by climate and host plant availability. Once an area is permanently or annually colonized, outbreak intensity is also affected by natural enemies and managed inputs, such as aphid-resistant cultivars and insecticides. Over time, increases in natural enemy abundance and diversity, improved compatibility among management tactics, and limited threshold-based insecticide use have likely increased resilience of aphid regulation. Application of pest management foundational practices followed by a focus on compatible strategies are relevant worldwide.

This enables new mobility concepts, especially for inner-city transport of people. An example for such autonomous vehicles are so-called people-movers: small electrically powered busses carrying up to 15 passengers from individual departure points to individual destinations. Next to the research regarding autonomous driving and alternative types of drives, it is also necessary to study and research how future users are willing to use new types of inner-city transport. Such transport needs specific information platforms organizing the trips and routing the people mover. Those platforms do not yet exist. As part of our research, we developed an exemplary people-mover platform architecture. We were using methods from agile software development to gather customer requirements, as well as an information logistics concept as a validated link between user requirements and the architecture. We designed the architecture using microservices to enable growth and adaptability at the same time. As the research is still going on, these characteristics are necessary in order to keep building a customer-focused platform for the inner-city mobility of the future. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Information Logistics; Microservices; People-Mover; Platforms; Public transportation","E-learning; People movers; Software design; Agile software development; Customer requirements; Information logistics; Microservices; Platform architecture; Platforms; Public transportation; Specific information; Autonomous vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065766495

Desertification and climate change reduce suitable conservation areas. Physiological stress is an inevitable part of the capture and translocation process of wild animals. Globally, capture myopathy - a malignant outcome of stress during capture operations - accounts for the highest number of deaths associated with wildlife translocation. These deaths may not only have considerable impacts on conservation efforts but also have direct and indirect financial implications. Such deaths usually are indicative of how well animal welfare was considered and addressed during a translocation exercise. Importantly, devastating consequences on the continued existence of threatened and endangered species succumbing to this known risk during capture and movement may result. Since first recorded in 1964 in Kenya, many cases of capture myopathy have been described, but the exact causes, pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment for this condition remain to be adequately studied and fully elucidated. Capture myopathy is a condition with marked morbidity and mortality that occur predominantly in wild animals around the globe. It arises from inflicted stress and physical exertion that would typically occur with prolonged or short intense pursuit, capture, restraint or transportation of wild animals. The condition carries a grave prognosis, and despite intensive extended and largely non-specific supportive treatment, the success rate is poor. Although not as common as in wildlife, domestic animals and humans are also affected by conditions with similar pathophysiology. This review aims to highlight the current state of knowledge related to the clinical and pathophysiological presentation, potential treatments, preventative measures and, importantly, the hypothetical causes and proposed pathomechanisms by comparing conditions found in domestic animals and humans. Future comparative strategies and research directions are proposed to help better understand the pathophysiology of capture myopathy. © 2019 The Author(s).

The study results show that online news writers predominantly use the news report genre to cover research findings for 48 hours, after which they predominantly use the news editorial genre to engage these findings. Analysis suggests that the news report genre uses the press release and the article abstract as intermediary genres, but the news editorial uses only the abstract.

Significant advances in agriculture remain at the forefront to increase crop production and quality to satisfy the global food demand in a changing climate all while reducing the environmental impacts of the world's food production. Sorghum, a resilient C 4 grain and grass important for food and energy production, is being extensively dissected genetically and phenomically to help connect the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. Unlike genetically modified crops such as corn or soybean, sorghum improvement has relied heavily on public research; thus, many of the genetic resources serve a dual purpose for both academic and commercial pursuits. Genetic and genomic resources not only provide the foundation to identify and understand the genes underlying variation, but also serve as novel sources of genetic and phenotypic diversity in plant breeding programs. To better disseminate the collective information of this community, we discuss: (i) the genomic resources of sorghum that are at the disposal of the research community; (ii) the suite of sorghum traits as potential targets for increasing productivity in contrasting environments; and (iii) the prospective approaches and technologies that will help to dissect the genotype–phenotype relationship as well as those that will apply foundational knowledge for sorghum improvement. © 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","association mapping; genomic selection; high-throughput phenotyping; multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross; nested association mapping","Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Mapping; Plants (botany); Throughput; Association mapping; Genetically modified crops; genomic selection; High-throughput phenotyping; multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross; Phenotypic diversity; Phenotypic variations; Plant breeding programs; Genes; Cultivation; Energy Production; Farm Crops; Genes; Mapping; Resources; Sorghum; Throughput; agriculture; crop; environment; genetic association study; genetics; genomics; genotype; phenotype; plant breeding; plant genome; sorghum; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Genetic Association Studies; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Genotype; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Sorghum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059288187

One approach is to proxy willingness to pay by measuring either the added cost to society from increased air pollution, or equivalently the reduced costs associated with air quality improvement."" A second technique infers willing-ness to pay for better air quality from an analysis of the housing market, on the presumption that individuals will pay more for a unit located in an area with good air quality than for an otherwise identical unit located in an area with poor air quality.This paper investigates the methodological problems associated with the housing market approach. While several studies have used this methodology to estimate the demand for air quality improvements, they have paid little attention to the sensitivity of the resultsto the assumptions embedded in the procedures. Using data for the Boston housing market, we generate quantitative estimates of the willingness to pay for air quality improvements and test the sensitivity of these results to alternative specifications of the basic building blocks in the procedure.

By emphasising environmental threats against the French nation, such as climate change, pollution, energy policies and resource depletion, Marine Le Pen illustrated her vision for a ‘patriotic ecology’ that would be based on the protection of public health and security as well as French territory, heritage and national identity. This chapter examines how the National Front adopted green politics; while at the same time was linked to populist and nationalist values through a systematic analysis of the party’s environmental discourses. By summarising the Discourse Historical Approach (DHA) to Critical Discourse Studies and drawing upon its argumentation strategies, this chapter intends to illustrate the discursive resurgence of the French nation and nation-state imaginaries through an analysis of the anti-Europeanisation and populist anti-elitism that dominate the French presidential candidate’s rhetoric and is linked to the far right green tradition by analysing Marine Le Pen’s s speech on ‘France durable’ and focusing on the party’s ‘new ecology movement’ website. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Bernhard Forchtner.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085830779

Like most territories of the SWIO basin, La Réunion island is highly vulnerable to cyclone-induced hazards and the potential impact of nearby storms is closely related to their track and intensity evolution. Although storm track and intensity forecasts have been steadily improving in the last decades, a great amount of uncertainty remains. Operational centres have therefore developed probabilistic products such as uncertainty cones for the prediction of storm track and intensity over the different cyclone basins. Unfortunately, the cone approach does not fully match the end-user needs for efficient decision-making. This article provides a method to generate alternate probabilistic scenarios of tropical system track and intensity forecasts around an official forecast. The method has been calibrated and evaluated to answer the needs of the Système de Prévision des Inondations en contexte Cyclonique (SPICy) project that aimed to explore new probabilistic forecast products for tropical system induced hazards such as coastal inundations. A hybrid method has been developed to benefit from both climatological and dynamical existing approaches. A first set of climatology-built scenarios is generated using the statistical distribution of RSMC La Réunion forecast errors. This initial set is then modulated using real-time information provided by the ensemble prediction system of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The final product is a set of about 20 scenarios that are built around the official deterministic forecast with some associated probabilities. Performance scores demonstrate the efficiency of the method against other evaluated systems especially in the first 2 days of the forecast. The reasonable number of defined scenarios is cost efficient and makes it possible to perform further impact-oriented applications such as wave and storm surge simulations. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","ensemble prediction; probabilistic forecasts; southwest Indian Ocean; tropical cyclones","Decision making; Floods; Hazards; Hurricanes; Lanthanum; Oceanography; Storms; Tropics; Ensemble prediction; Ensemble prediction systems; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Indian ocean; Probabilistic forecasts; Statistical distribution; Tropical cyclone; Tropical cyclone activity; Weather forecasting; ensemble forecasting; probability; storm track; tropical cyclone; weather forecasting; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Southwest); Mascarene Islands; Reunion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061041209

This study presents results from a 4-week experiment investigating the influence of two powdered AC materials (bituminous coal-based and coconut shell-derived) and one control material (clay) on biogeochemical processes and meiofauna in contaminated sediments. Capping with AC induced a 62–63% decrease in denitrification and a 66–87% decrease in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Sediment porewater pH increased from 7.1 to 9.0 and 9.7 after addition of bituminous AC and biomass-derived AC, respectively. High pH (>8) persisted for at least two weeks in the bituminous AC and for at least 24 days in the coconut based AC, while capping with clay had no effect on pH. We observed a strong impact (nitrate fluxes being halved in presence of AC) on nitrification activity as nitrifiers are sensitive to high pH. This partly explains the significant decrease in nitrate reduction rates since denitrification was almost entirely coupled to nitrification. Total benthic metabolism estimated by sediment oxygen uptake was reduced by 30 and 43% in presence of bituminous coal-based AC and coconut shell-derived AC, respectively. Meiofauna abundances decreased by 60–62% in the AC treatments. Taken together, these observations suggest that AC amendments deplete natural organic carbon, intended as food, to heterotrophic benthic communities. Phosphate efflux was 91% lower in presence of bituminous AC compared to untreated sediment probably due to its content of aluminum (Al) oxides, which have high affinity for phosphate. This study demonstrates that capping with powdered AC produces significant effects on benthic biogeochemical fluxes, microbial processes and meiofauna abundances, which are likely due to an increase in porewater pH and to the sequestration of natural, sedimentary organic matter by AC particles. © 2018 The Authors","Microbial activity; Nitrogen; pH; Phosphorus; Restoration; Sediment remediation","Activated carbon; Aluminum oxide; Biogeochemistry; Bituminous coal; Denitrification; Ecosystems; Image reconstruction; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; pH; pH effects; Phosphorus; Pollution; Biogeochemical fluxes; Biogeochemical process; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction; Meiofauna communities; Microbial activities; Nitrification activity; Sediment remediation; Sedimentary organic matter; Sediments; activated carbon; aluminum oxide; ammonia; nitrate; nitrite; organic carbon; oxygen; phosphate; silicon dioxide; charcoal; nitric acid derivative; abundance; activated carbon; benthos; denitrification; flux measurement; meiofauna; metabolism; microbial activity; nitrification; nitrogen; organic matter; pH; phosphorus; porewater; sediment pollution; Article; biomass; coconut; copepod; denitrification; foraminifer; geochemistry; meiofauna; nauplius (larva); nematode; nitrification; nutrient; Oligochaeta; ostracod; oxygen concentration; oxygen consumption; pH; priority journal; Rotifera; sediment; Turbellaria; water content; sediment; Charcoal; Denitrification; Geologic Sediments; Nitrates; Nutrients",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055969944

The long-term goal with this technology is to reduce the CO2 emissions and energy consumption compared to existing technologies. The production rate of this process is dependent on the stirring, which was investigated in the pilot plant process by measuring the mixing time in the slag bath. Moreover, slag investigations were done both based on light optical microscope studies as well as by Thermo-Calc calculations in order to determine the phases of the slag during operation. This was done because the viscosity (which is another important parameter) is dependent on the liquid and solid fractions of the slag. The overall results show that it was possible to determine the mixing time by means of the addition of a tracer (MnO2 powder) to the slag. The mixing time for the trials showed that the slag was homogenized after seconds. For two of the trials, homogenization had already been reached in the second sample after tracer addition, which means ≤8 s. The phase analysis from the slag indicated that the slag is in a liquid state during the operation of the process. © 2019 by the authors.

Lagos mega city is presently experiencing developmental projects associated with carbon emission potentials, which are yet to be quantified; hence, this study identified and quantified the sources of carbon emission in the Lagos mega city and also determined the quantity of energy consumption capacity for domestic, transportation and industries. Using fuel consumption rate and activity duration, the emissions factors approach were used to determine the quantity of Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the household, vehicular operation and electric power generators in the zones. The total CO2 emission from the three major sectors was then used to establish the carbon footprint and annual global warming potential of the mega city. This study reported a CO2 (g) emission of 9.59 × 1013 tons CO2-e per annum for industrial area and 2.41 × 1016 tons CO2-e per annum for non-industrial area. The overall carbon dioxide emission for Lagos Mega City in 2015 was 2.42 × 1016 tons CO2-e per annum which is higher than the value of 1.6 × 1016 tons CO2-e per annum predicted for Lagos BRT CO2 emission, which stands at 66.1% increase from 2014 to 2015 as the reporting periods. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In the last few years, a broad social campaign was launched in Poland, followed by a legislative action to significantly reduce the problem of low-stack emissions and, in consequence, smog. These measures are based mainly on the CAFE Directive [2], the Environmental Protection Act [3] and the National Air Protection Program [4]. As a result, there are now so-called mass-produced in Poland: anti-smog resolutions and Low-Stack Emission Reduction Programs (PONE). In this article, author presented the results of simulating the impact of these decisions on environmental (level of reduction of suspended particulate matter and benzo(a)pyrene), but also social aspects (decrease in employment in mining and related industries) and their economic consequences (related general economic).

However, concrete results – significant emissions reductions, expected from cities committed to mitigating climate change, are currently conspicuously absent. While there are several good practice guides available for large/mega cities there are little available for small and medium-sized ones (SMCs). In this paper the main research questions are, “When exploring local climate mitigation action among multiple small- and medium-sized cities, what actions are perceived as good practices?” and “Are there any demonstrable effects linking them to achieving climate mitigation targets, and is this monitored?” A multiple case study research approach, using quali-quantitative mixed methods with multiple types of data sources, was used to analyze thirteen SMCs in the Netherlands. Results revealed twenty six good practices, with the majority exhibiting the characteristics of governing by enabling. However, no evidence was found that these good practices had been embedded in indicators or protocols, nor that they led to actual GHG emission reduction. In addition, action plans were found to be incomplete, in particular regarding implementation, and municipalities were found to work in isolation, with little inter-municipal collaboration. Moreover, whereas a monitor of local climate mitigation performance exists – using output and outcome indicators - it was found to be hardly known nor used among local policy makers. The results reveal a need to learn from good practices, to develop indicators that mirror these practices, and integrate them into local climate mitigation performance measurement tools. Currently, this is not the case, making it difficult to monitor local climate mitigation performance and progress vis-à-vis commitments made regarding the Paris Agreement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate action; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Good practice; Governing by enabling; Local government","Carbon; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Climate action; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Good practices; Governing by enabling; Local government; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055547366

For this reason, governments are promoting energy efficiency programmes, carbon capture technologies, and renewable energies as a way to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Hydrogen is a clean alternative to fossil fuels in automotive applications. In this context, the objective of this project is to find the best design of a hydrogen refuelling station in terms of the number of banks and their size, having as a final aim the most cost-efficient design. This study suggests that, from an economic point of view, a state of charge for the vehicle of 100% is not adequate, since it requires very large high-pressure banks at the station, which increases significantly its setup costs. The study finds that high-pressure banks have to be bigger in volume than the low-pressure banks to minimise the total cost of the station, including setup and operational costs along its timespan. Finally, the project shows that the optimal number of banks is 4 or a maximum of 5. As a side conclusion, these results have practical implications for firms, as they might reduce the time spent in the design process of a hydrogen refuelling station. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Cost-efficiency; Economic analysis; Energy costs; Hydrogen refuelling station; Setup costs","Climate change; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Alternative to fossil fuels; Automotive applications; Cost efficiency; Cost-efficient design; Energy cost; Hydrogen fuelling stations; Hydrogen refuelling stations; Setup costs; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057423609

Marine fisheries mainly target 41 species which account for 80% of the seafood production in Europe. The remaining 20% comes from marine and freshwater aquaculture, which harvest mainly 5 and 11 species, respectively. European seafood production volume (2004–2014) recorded by FAO was combined with indices of temperature sensitivity and biological sensitivity (BS) based on the life histories of the main exploited species. We found that the marine sectors are more vulnerable to global warming than the freshwater sector. The vulnerability to warming of a country's production is defined by the temperature sensitivity and the BS of the main exploited seafood species, weighted by their production volume. Production vulnerability in the marine sector increases with latitude due to the temperature sensitivity of the harvested species and their high production volume. No such gradient is found in the freshwater sector because most of the production is based on two species with opposite temperature sensitivity. To ensure a sustainable European seafood production, national climate strategies and action plans should include both fisheries and aquaculture and be integrated at a regional level. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aquaculture; Europe; Fishery; Seafood; Vulnerability; Warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055054239

Using soft-linked capacity planning and unit commitment models, this research examines the economic value of this flexibility and variation across different regions, generation asset types, and market environments (e.g., level of renewable deployment). Model results suggest that lower minimum loads are most valuable for mid-merit units with intermediate capacity factors, policy conditions that rearrange the merit order (e.g., carbon pricing), regions and scenarios without seasonal layup of assets, and units that are more flexible than generators with otherwise similar characteristics. Lower minimum loads can increase operating hours, increase net revenues, and decrease startups and long-run maintenance costs. The scenarios in this analysis show that plant flexibility affects operations more than annual profitability, which may have a higher system value for integrating renewables than a private value for the flexible unit. For many plants, the modest changes in net revenues with lower minimums mean that the focus will likely be on making operational modifications to increase flexibility rather than on capital investments. Additionally, this analysis quantifies how revenues from ancillary services markets can boost the value of lower minimum loads, especially for efficient natural gas units, but total market size and depth are uncertain. © 2018 IEEE.","economic dispatch; Flexible operations; minimum load; renewable integration; resource planning","Analytical models; Biological systems; Commerce; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric load dispatching; Gas generators; Gas plants; Natural gas; Numerical models; Power generation; Power markets; Profitability; Scheduling; Biological system modeling; Economic Dispatch; Flexible operation; Load modeling; Minimum load; Renewable integration; Resource planning; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050223713

Because climate change and phenological responses vary in space and time, we need long-term observations collected at a broad spatial scale. While data collection by volunteers is a promising approach to achieve this goal, one major concern with citizen science programs is the quality and reliability of data. Using a citizen science program (Phenoclim) carried out in the western European Alps, the goals of this study were to analyze (1) factors influencing participant retention rates, (2) the efficacy of a citizen science program for detecting temporal changes in the phenology of mountain trees, (3) differences in budburst date trends among different observer categories, and (4) the precision of trends quantified by different categories of participants. We used 12 years of annual tree phenology measurements recorded by volunteers (schools and private individuals) and professionals within the Phenoclim program. We found decadal-scale shifts in budburst date consistent with the results from other studies, including significant advances in budburst date for the common birch and European ash (− 4.0 and − 6.5 days per decade respectively). In addition, for three of six species, volunteers and professionals detected consistent directional trends. Finally, we show how differences in precision among the categories of participants are determined by the number of years of participation in the program, the number of sites surveyed, and the variability in trends among sites. Overall, our results suggest that participants with a wide range of backgrounds are capable of collecting data that can significantly contribute to the study of the impacts of climate change on mountain plant phenology. © 2018, ISB.","Accuracy; Citizen science; Climate change; European Alps; Mountain; Volunteer retention","climate change; community participation; growth, development and aging; human; information processing; procedures; reproducibility; season; tree; volunteer; Climate Change; Community Participation; Data Collection; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Seasons; Trees; Volunteers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055981146

However, barriers such as end-user awareness and participation in policy and business model design prohibit the pace of rural electrification. A case of Rwanda is analyzed, pointing to the potential of the imihigo (performance contracts) framework. Given the adoption of household-level performance contracts, which can include energy access, it is proposed they could drive local participation among off-grid communities. Results of a survey with 218 users of Solar Home Systems in North-Western Rwanda and from five focus groups show that village-level energy targets impact on the prioritization of energy target setting among households. Including off-grid energy options in the imihigo booklets distributed to households could influence awareness raising and allow private sector providers to act in a more targeted way, prioritizing areas with most prevalent energy targets. Additionally, community meetings (umuganda) tied to imihigo offer participatory spaces for information and feedback sharing. These will assist in the design of energy planning and business models, which best fit local needs and respond to the challenges faced by the energy poor.

This need is especially critical in the hyper-arid region around the Arabian Gulf where per-person carbon emissions are among the highest in the world. Using geometrically sensitive simulation models for a household's building energy, water, and automobile use, this paper uses Emirati neighborhoods in Abu Dhabi, UAE as a case study to estimate emissions for a baseline and set of future possible scenarios towards transitioning single-family households in the region to low, and eventually near-zero operational carbon emissions. An analysis of the combined impact of energy efficiency gains through (1) technology adoption and better design, (2) carbon intensity reduction from renewable energy transitions, and (3) carbon sequestration from parcel scale tree planting is presented. From a baseline CO2 emissions of 64.3 tons per household per year for new construction, the study finds future emissions potential reductions of 33.7%–49.0% from improved house design, 98.1% from electrification and solar energy sourcing, and 99.4% from combined design and technology improvements. This study also finds that if the water-energy nexus in Abu Dhabi transitioned to solar-powered, reverse-osmosis desalination, trees would become net carbon sinks (0.6–1.9 kg CO2/m2/yr). As a result, in the future, low-density neighborhoods with dense areas of tree planting may become a sustainable housing typology when measured by net operational emissions. This fact would upend multiple current assumptions by Western planners about sustainable transitions for arid regions. © 2018 The Authors","Afforestation; Arid region; Energy modelling; Household metabolism; Low-carbon transition; Single-family housing","Arid regions; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Desalination; Energy efficiency; Housing; Planning; Reforestation; Solar energy; Afforestation; Carbon intensity reductions; Carbon sequestration; Energy modelling; Household metabolism; Low-carbon transitions; Reverse osmosis desalination; Suburban development; Zero energy buildings; afforestation; arid region; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; emission control; energy efficiency; household energy; neighborhood; technology adoption; Abu Dhabi [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054653428

West coast behaved differently than that of East coast in respect of carbon stocks and carbon dynamics in forest and mangrove systems. Scientific manipulation of coastal land-use could provide a potential solution to climate change mitigation and GHG emission. Conversion from plow to no till, incorporation of cover crop and forage crops in rotation, judicious use of crop residues, mulching, and climate-resilient practices are some of these kinds.

The onset phase is characterized with several transition phases of atmosphere. Therefore, to study the thermal response or the effect of different sea surface temperature (SST), namely ERA interim (ERSST) and weekly optimal interpolation (OI_WK SST) on Indian summer monsoon, the role of two different types of SST has been used to investigate the simulated onset date. In addition, spatial atmospheric circulation pattern during onset phase were analyzed using reanalyze dataset of ERA Interim (EIN15) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), respectively, for wind and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) pattern.

We sampled a set of tropical lakes from the middle Rio Doce lacustrine system (Minas Gerais, Brazil) for two consecutive summers. Besides Zmix, we analyzed the visible light attenuation (KdPAR), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS), and fetch. We also analyze the quality of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) through colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), spectral slope (S), DOC-specific absorbance (SUVA) and the ratio between the absorbance at 250 nm and 365 nm (E250:365). Our results showed quite different results during the two years studied. In the summer of 2012, when there was higher rainfall, variations in Zmix were correlated to the optical factors associated with DOM quality, while in the drier summer of 2013 Chl-a, TSS and fetch were the variables that more explained Zmix. It suggests that DOM regulates the Zmix in the rainy periods in the studied tropical lakes and that control is determined by the balance between the DOM input (runoff) and output (such as photodegradation) of the aquatic systems. In reduced rain conditions (summer 2013), the factors responsible by chemistry photodegradation of DOM were predominant, and the organic matter was no longer controlling Zmix, which was driven by internal mixing, productivity, and the wind (Chl-a, TSS and fetch). In this study we showed how changes in precipitation might cause shifts in the factors that regulate the epilimnion thickness in tropical lakes. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","CDOM; Chlorophyll-a; Epilimnion thickness; Precipitation; Tropical lakes","chlorophyll a; dissolved organic matter; environmental factor; epilimnion; lake water; photodegradation; precipitation (climatology); summer; tropical region; Brazil; Minas Gerais",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057495554

The control and aramid interleaved CF/EP composite laminates were manufactured by VARTM in a [0]4 configuration. Tensile, three-point bending, compression, interlaminar shear, Charpy impact and Mode-I (DCB) fracture toughness values were determined to evaluate the effects of aramid nonwoven fabrics on the mechanical performance of the CF/EP composites. Thermomechanical behavior of the specimens was investigated by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). The results showed that the propagation Mode-I fracture toughness values of CF/EP composites can be significantly improved (by about 72%) using aramid nonwoven fabrics. It was found that the main extrinsic toughening mechanism is aramid microfiber bridging acting behind the crack-tip. The incorporation of these nonwovens also increased interlaminar shear and Charpy impact strength by 10 and 16.5%, respectively. Moreover, it was revealed that the damping ability of the composites increased with the incorporation of aramid nonwoven fabrics in the interlaminar region of composites. On the other hand, they caused a reduction in in-plane mechanical properties due to the reduced carbon fiber volume fraction, increased thickness and void formation in the composites.

Understanding the Global Solar Radiation (GSR) pattern is highly significant for determining the solar energy in any particular environment. The current study develops a new mathematical model based on the concept of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to predict daily-scale GSR in the Burkina Faso region of West Africa. Eight meteorological stations are adopted to examine the proposed predictive model. The modeling procedure of the regression FDA is performed using two different internal parameter tuning approaches including Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) and Generalized Bayesian Information Criteria (GBIC). The modeling procedure is established based on a cross-station paradigm wherein the climatological variables of six stations are used to predict GSR at two targeted meteorological stations. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the panel data regression model. Based on various statistical metrics, the applied FDA model attained convincing absolute error measures and best goodness of fit compared with the observed measured GSR. In quantitative evaluation, the predictions of GSR at the Ouahigouya and Dori stations attained correlation coefficients of R = 0.84 and 0.90 using the FDA model, respectively. All in all, the FDA model introduced a reliable alternative modeling strategy for global solar radiation prediction over the Burkina Faso region with accurate line fit predictions. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The inherent volatility and limited predictability of renewable power generation pose various challenges for an efficient system integration of these capacities. One approach to manage these challenges is the deployment of small-scale dispatchable power generation and storage units on a local level. In this context, gas turbine cogeneration units, which are primarily tasked with the provision of power and heat for industrial consumers, can play a significant role, if they are equipped with a sufficient energy storage capacity allowing for a more flexible operation. The present study investigates a system configuration, which incorporates a heat-driven industrial gas turbine interacting with a wind farm providing volatile renewable power generation. The required energy storage capacity is represented by an electrolyzer and a pressure vessel for intermediate hydrogen storage. The generated hydrogen can be reconverted to electricity and process heat by the gas turbine. The corresponding operational strategy for the overall system aims at an optimal integration of the volatile wind farm power generation on a local level. The study quantifies the impact of selected system design parameters on the quality of local wind power system integration, that can be achieved with a specific set of parameters. In addition, the impact of these parameters on the reduction of CO2 emissions due to the use of hydrogen as gas turbine fuel is quantified. In order to conduct these investigations, detailed steady-state models of all required system components were developed. These models enable accurate simulations of the operation of each component in the complete load range. The calculation of the optimal operational strategy is based on an application of the dynamic programming algorithm. Based on this model setup, the operation of the overall system configuration is simulated for each investigated set of design parameters for a one-year period. The simulation results show that the investigated system configuration has the ability to significantly increase the level of local wind power integration. The parameter variation reveals distinct correlations between the main design parameters of the storage system and the achievable level of local wind power integration. Regarding the installed electrolyzer power consumption capacity, smaller additional benefits of capacity increases can be identified at higher levels of power consumption capacity. Regarding the geometrical volume of the hydrogen storage, it can be determined that the storage volume loses its limiting character on the operation of the electrolyzer at a characteristic level. The additional investigation of the CO2 emission reduction reveals a direct correlation between the level of local wind power integration and the achievable level of CO2 emission reduction.

To accompany this change agricultural actors and researchers require new tools.

That could have serious impacts on the vegetation and its carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange with potentially increasing CO2 emissions accelerating climate warming. Understanding how the CO2 fluxes in this area respond to environmental variables, in particular rain events, is essential, but available data are scarce. In this study, we monitored net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, rainfall and other environmental parameters during four years at three savannas. Savannas were characterized by different vegetation due to different land use: i) woody and nearly pristine, ii) mixture of cropland and grassland and iii) intensive grazing. The impact of rain events on CO2 exchange for these contrasting ecosystems were analyzed for single rain events (short-term) and on a yearly time scale (long-term) using three eddy covariance towers. We found that the woody pristine savanna site was a prominent sink of CO2 (−864 to −1299 g CO2 m−2 y−1) while the degraded sites were net CO2 sources (118 to 605 g CO2 m−2 y−1) with a complicated relation with annual rainfall amounts. The NEE responses to single rain events revealed that daytime rain systematically decreased the sink strengths at all sites, which might be associated with decreased light availability. At the degraded sites, additional factors increasing CO2 losses were rain duration and dry spell length. The observed patterns of immediate CO2 flux responses to rainfall at differently used savannas indicate strong internal feedbacks between vegetation and land use changes and raise the question whether the CO2 sink strengths might be overestimated with possible implications for global CO2 budgets. Sustainable adaptation strategies need to be developed for West Africa. © 2018","Cropland; Dry spells; Grazing; Net ecosystem exchange of CO2; Precipitation; Sudan savanna","Budget control; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Vegetation; Cropland; Dry spells; Grazing; Net ecosystem exchange; Sudan savanna; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; rain; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; grazing; land use change; net ecosystem exchange; precipitation (climatology); savanna; semiarid region; Article; budget; carbon footprint; carbon sink; cropland; drought; dry season; ecosystem monitoring; Eddy covariance; environmental impact; environmental parameters; gas exchange; geological time; global climate; grassland; grazing; greenhouse effect; human; land use; light; net ecosystem exchange; nonhuman; priority journal; pristine; rainy season; savanna; season; vegetation; West African; woody plant; Sudan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051280136

The developed intelligent traffic management (ITM) techniques, which are based on a spatiotemporal reservation scheme, ensure that vehicles proceed through the intersection without colliding with other vehicles while at the same time reducing the intersection delay and environmental impacts. Specifically, the spatiotemporal reservation scheme provides each vehicle a collision-free path that is decomposed into a speed profile along with navigational instructions. The integration of the developed microscopic traffic simulator with instantaneous emission model, provides improved assessments of the environmental impact of traffic control strategies at intersections. The simulator architecture integrates several ITM algorithms, vehicle sensors, V2V/V2I communications, and emission and fuel consumption models. Each vehicle is modeled by an agent and each agent provides information depending on the specific vehicle sensors.

Performance gap issues in gas boiler systems have been reported, with previous studies unable to isolate or quantify root causes for performance issues, hampered by indirect and coarse measurement methods. Utilising high-frequency data, through state-of-the-art boiler diagnostics from 221 UK combination boilers, assumptions in efficiency standards are challenged. Total heating energy consumption and number of hot water tappings are in line with national expectations but the observed cycling behaviour of boilers gives cause for concern due to links with lower performance and higher emissions. Most combi-boilers appear oversized for space heating and despite available modulation are unable to prevent rapid on–off cycling. Per day, half of combi boilers studied average more than 50 starts and 70% of starts average less than 10 min during space heating operation. Cycling contradicts assumptions in efficiency testing standards, which assume steady state operation, weighted by full and part power measurements. Addressing oversizing and excessive boiler cycling provides an opportunity to quickly and significantly reduce emissions associated with heating, at low cost through the ongoing replacement of millions of boilers. Practical application: Lessons learned from this research regarding the detrimental performance issues seen in gas combi boilers are directly applicable to the topics of boiler specification for building service engineers and installers, such as guidelines in CIBSE Guide A,1 CE54 Whole house boiler sizing method2 and legislation set out in BoilerPlus from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Plant size ratio, radiator hydraulic layout and controls can all contribute to the rapid cycling seen in the data and can all be influenced by building service professionals. Boiler modulation range is also crucial and manufacturers need to be aware of the benefits of extending modulation in new products. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2018.","Building energy systems; building thermal performance; domestic buildings; HVAC systems; monitoring; space heating","Buildings; Climate control; Energy utilization; Heating; Industrial research; Modulation; Monitoring; Space heating; Building energy systems; Building service engineers; Building thermal performance; Domestic buildings; Heating energy consumption; HVAC system; Industrial strategies; Steady-state operation; Boilers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053302320

To date, there have been few reflexive inquiries into how urban governance actors and processes are learning to innovate as a result of participating in TMNs. In response, this paper draws on theories of institutional learning and urban governance to offer a conceptual distinction between innovations in governance and the governance of innovations in the context of climate resilience and adaptation. We apply these concepts to evaluate the case studies of Rotterdam and Berkeley, where we highlight the actors, networks, and resources required to motivate and sustain actions against concurrent sectoral interests. Experiences from the two cities show that learning pathways are constructed and reified through processes of communication and negotiation, which can result in the grounding of TMN resources.

To prepare input parameters for TOXCHEM, wastewater samples were collected from the inlet of treatment units. Subsequently, the resultant emission rates were applied in AERMOD to study the dispersion patterns of the target volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Based on the TOXCHEM results, the overall emission of benzene, toluene, and styrene was 123,935 g/day, of which 73.4, 13.3, and 13.4% were benzene, toluene, and styrene, respectively. The results indicated that up to 99.5% of the target VOCs were removed from wastewater by volatilization and biodegradation mechanisms. Also, more than 85% of the VOCs emission occurred from the primary treatment units (American Petroleum Institute oil separator, equalization basin, and dissolved air flotation system). In some cases, the concentration distribution profiles resulting from AERMOD showed higher values than EPA reference concentrations (RfC) around the study area. The most affected area was near the WWTP with maximum 1-h concentrations of 8166, 1267, and 1228 μg/m 3 of benzene, toluene, and styrene, respectively. Based on the modeling results, the most applicable and available methods for separating and ultimately disposing of VOCs were investigated and compared with the aim of reducing emission rates to meet ambient air quality standards. The results revealed that steam stripping is the most efficient and cost-effective VOCs control strategy in the studied plant.

These stem, in part, from a disconnect between the information that is produced and the information needs of local resource managers. A disproportionate focus on the natural and physical sciences in climate vulnerability and adaptation assessment obscure understandings of complex social systems and the interactions and feedbacks in social-ecological systems. We use a qualitative case study of bison management on Department of the Interior-managed and tribal lands to explore how a social-science driven Determinants and Analogue Vulnerability Assessment (DAVA) can inform ecological response models, specifically simulation models that account for multiple drivers of change. First, we illustrate how a DAVA approach can help to: 1) identify key processes, entities, and interactions across scales; 2) document local impacts, indicators, and monitoring efforts of drought and climate; and 3) identify major tradeoffs and uncertainties. We then demonstrate how qualitative narratives can inform simulation models by: 1) prioritizing model components included in modeling efforts; 2) framing joint management and climate scenarios; and 3) parameterizing and evaluating model performance. We do this by presenting a conceptual joint agent-based/state-and-transition simulation modeling framework. Simulation models can represent multiple interacting variables and can identify surprising, emergent outcomes that might not be evident from qualitative analysis alone, and we argue that qualitative case studies can ground simulation models in local contexts and help make them more structurally realistic and useful. Together, these can provide a step toward developing actionable climate change adaptation strategies. © 2018 The Authors","Actionable science; Adaptation; Ecological drought; Social science; Social-ecological systems; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054437829

The GWD and MWD were obtained for 24 locations across Brazil, considering the period between 1980 and 2010. These data were used to estimate soybean yield with DSSAT-CROPGRO-Soybean model. The comparison of MWD with GWD resulted in a good agreement between climate variables, except for solar radiation. The crop simulations with GWD and MWD resulted in a good agreement for vegetative and reproductive phases. Soybean potential yield (Yp) simulated with AgMERRA and XAVIER had a high correlation (r &gt; 0.88) when compared to the estimates with MWD, with the RMSE of about 400 kg ha −1 . For attainable yield (Ya), estimates with XAVIER resulted in a RMSE of 700 kg ha −1 against 864 kg ha −1 from AgMERRA, both compared to the simulations using MWD.

These include, inter alia, planning’s role in promoting policies and discourses of international competitiveness, the privatisation of public space, support for pro-market urban regeneration and a view of planning as facilitating market-based economic growth. It then proceeds to discuss some features of ‘post-growth’ and ‘post-carbon’ planning.

In response to this complex policy landscape, many Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) - federally-mandated regional transportation planning agencies - have taken on a broader scope of activities, engaging, to varying degrees, in sustainability planning, defined here as planning that links regional transportation investments with land use and environmental strategies, guided by concerns about the regional economy, social equity, and natural environment (the “three E’s”). From the literature, seven attributes of sustainable regional transportation planning are identified and operationalized into measures applied to a review of planning documents for the largest 48 MPOs in the United States. The review indicates that while most MPOs exhibited some attributes of sustainability planning as of 2016, none exhibited all of them. A deeper investigation is presented of California cases, where a state law adopted in 2008 mandates coordinated transportation and land use planning at the regional scale in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The investigation indicates that California’s largest MPOs have advanced sustainable land use and transport somewhat more aggressively since the law’s passage, especially regarding travel mode share and compact housing. Innovative planning strategies have included asking local governments to designate priority development areas for compact development, and providing financial incentives for local actions to support the regional plans.

Furthermore, considering the important role of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) on the photochemical reactivity of the atmosphere, their species-specific emission was also assessed together with the derived ozone forming potential (OFP). Our results suggested that the potential mitigation capacity based on the investigated traits of the shrubs and herbaceous species was species-specific. The very low potential of all the tested species to form ozone indicated their suitability for urban planning programs. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Carbon assimilation; Foliar micromorphology; Green roof vegetation; Urban pollution","atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; dicotyledon; ecophysiology; emission; micromorphology; ozone; pollutant removal; public health; roof; urban area; urban planning; urban pollution; vegetation type; volatile organic compound; Achillea millefolium; Campanula persicifolia; Erigeron karvinskianus; Filipendula purpurea; Filipendula vulgaris; Gaura lindheimeri; Hylotelephium spectabile; Hypericum x moserianum; Lonicera; Origanum vulgare; Rudbeckia fulgida sullivantii; Salvia nemorosa; Satureja; Solidago; Veronica longifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043490758

The total carbon stock in the selected PF was approximately 4500 Mg. The results showed that species such as Prosopis juliflora (52.0%), Acacia nilotica (48.5%), Tectona grandis (46.4%) and Eucalyptus sp. (45.4%) are the more carbon sequestration potential tree species comparative to 10 dominant tree species in the PF. According to the results of a survey, fuel wood consumption varies significantly from season to season. Daily fuel wood consumption from the forest ranged from a minimum 170 kg d −1 in summer to a maximum 450 kg/day in winter, giving an average annual consumption rate of 62.1 to 164.3 tonnes. The higher consumption of fuel wood is a possible reason for deforestation and emission of greenhouse gases. Based on calorific value, P. juliflora, Terminalia arjuna, Eucalyptus sp. and T. grandis are some of the most promising tree species in the region, that can be recommended for energy plantation. Therefore, findings of paper could be the basis for selection of suitable tree species for future energy plantation in this region and provide clues for adoptation and management of such high productive ecosystem in the wake of changing climate in the future. for future energy plantation, to control the environmental damage caused by excessive use of fire wood in the region. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon sequestration; fuel wood; plantation forest; tree species","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Magnesium compounds; Annual consumption; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Environmental damage; Fuel wood; Plantation forests; Prosopis juliflora; Tree species; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043700118

Sequestration of the atmospheric CO2 in soil can serve as one of the potential strategies in mitigation of global warming and improvement in soil health. Soil aggregates enhance C sequestration by physically protecting it from the microbial oxidation. Adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) on agricultural soils can enhance carbon sequestration and reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 and have positive impacts on soil health, food security and water and environment quality. The global potential of SOC sequestration through these practices is 0.9 ± 0.3 pg C/year, which may offset one-fourth to one-third of atmospheric CO2 increase annually estimated at 3.3 pg C/year. Conservation agriculture involving minimum soil disturbance, residue retention and crop diversification is one of the important RMPs that can improve carbon sequestration. However, there are several constraints for soil carbon sequestration in the tropics and subtropics, which must be taken into consideration in designing carbon sequestration strategies. Site-specific and cost-effective technologies should be developed and disseminated among the farming community for improving carbon sequestration and enhancing input use efficiency for sustainable agricultural production under the changing climatic scenarios. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Conservation tillage; Management practices; Soil aggregation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084912385

The WMO along with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did establish the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 with a mandate to provide scientific information to governments on the risks associated with climate change and its impacts on natural and human systems. No doubt climate change is one of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century having a profound impact on the needs of the global population, poverty alleviation, sustenance of natural ecosystems and food security. Climate change is no longer considered to be just an environmental concern but also a development problem affecting both the developing and developed countries. One of the central policy issues in the context of climate change is how countries of the world should allocate resources. After a few years of intense engagement and international negotiation processes, the world community has signed the historic Paris climate agreement in 2015, which calls for substantive domestic and international climate actions to tackle climate issues. Individual countries are making efforts to strengthen their “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs) by streamlining their mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Some of the areas where investments have been made to reshape policies and actions include (i) renewable energy, (ii) building of rural and urban resilience capacity, (iii) poverty alleviation and (iv) sectoral priorities. The environmental governance focus is also shifting from National to the sub-National and local level. Internationally, there have been considerable efforts in synchronising the INDC commitments with the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). One of the key policy agreement that Parties entered under the Paris agreement is to stabilise rising temperature below 2 °C preferably to limit to 1.5 °C. At the local level, policy actions should focus on assessing the vulnerability of both physical and social systems to climate change, development of best bet technology to reduce the impacts of climate change and measures to enhance the adaptive capacities of local communities and enhance overall climate risk management capacity of the region. Transformative changes could be achieved by developing and executing proactive environmental and climate risk management policies, promoting effective implementation strategies and linking responsive institutions across scales for achieving activities effectively. Though developed countries are fundamentally responsible for global warming, the major impacts are borne by poor and marginalised countries. Hence, the international climate regime needs innovative climate policies and institutional structures that would help promote international cooperation. It is also imperative to design and implement appropriate national climate policies that would contribute to individual countries’ green growth and promote climate-sensitive development. This chapter focuses on the elements that go into the making of climate policy and their relevance to the emerging global and national scenarios. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Climate policy; Climate policy-making; COP negotiations; Copenhagen agreement; Kyoto protocol; Paris agreement; Per capita CO2 emissions; UNFCCC",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085829802

To inform action at subnational levels in India, we estimated the exposure to air pollution and its impact on deaths, disease burden, and life expectancy in every state of India in 2017. Methods: We estimated exposure to air pollution, including ambient particulate matter pollution, defined as the annual average gridded concentration of PM2.5, and household air pollution, defined as percentage of households using solid cooking fuels and the corresponding exposure to PM2.5, across the states of India using accessible data from multiple sources as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. The states were categorised into three Socio-demographic Index (SDI) levels as calculated by GBD 2017 on the basis of lag-distributed per-capita income, mean education in people aged 15 years or older, and total fertility rate in people younger than 25 years. We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to air pollution exposure, on the basis of exposure–response relationships from the published literature, as assessed in GBD 2017; the proportion of total global air pollution DALYs in India; and what the life expectancy would have been in each state of India if air pollution levels had been less than the minimum level causing health loss. Findings: The annual population-weighted mean exposure to ambient particulate matter PM2·5 in India was 89·9 μg/m3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 67·0–112·0) in 2017. Most states, and 76·8% of the population of India, were exposed to annual population-weighted mean PM2·5 greater than 40 μg/m3, which is the limit recommended by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in India. Delhi had the highest annual population-weighted mean PM2·5 in 2017, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Haryana in north India, all with mean values greater than 125 μg/m3. The proportion of population using solid fuels in India was 55·5% (54·8–56·2) in 2017, which exceeded 75% in the low SDI states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha. 1·24 million (1·09–1·39) deaths in India in 2017, which were 12·5% of the total deaths, were attributable to air pollution, including 0·67 million (0·55–0·79) from ambient particulate matter pollution and 0·48 million (0·39–0·58) from household air pollution. Of these deaths attributable to air pollution, 51·4% were in people younger than 70 years. India contributed 18·1% of the global population but had 26·2% of the global air pollution DALYs in 2017. The ambient particulate matter pollution DALY rate was highest in the north Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan, spread across the three SDI state groups, and the household air pollution DALY rate was highest in the low SDI states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam in north and northeast India. We estimated that if the air pollution level in India were less than the minimum causing health loss, the average life expectancy in 2017 would have been higher by 1·7 years (1·6–1·9), with this increase exceeding 2 years in the north Indian states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana. Interpretation: India has disproportionately high mortality and disease burden due to air pollution. This burden is generally highest in the low SDI states of north India. Reducing the substantial avoidable deaths and disease burden from this major environmental risk is dependent on rapid deployment of effective multisectoral policies throughout India that are commensurate with the magnitude of air pollution in each state.

In many cases these regions contain habitats and landscapes of international importance; they have also often escaped some of the environmental damage caused by industrialization. But, as the papers' reveal, attempts by the EU to safeguard these environmental benefits are often contradicted by the EU’s own development policies, bringing air pollution from new roads, contamination from new industries, and leading to habitat destruction from modern agricultural practices and increases in tourism. As the Union pushes for the deepening of the integration process, including completing the internal market, the pressures on the periphery's environment are increasing. Furthermore, the efforts of the periphery to catch-up economically with the developed core can often heighten the tension between economic considerations on the one hand and the need for environmental protection on the other. The studies in this book examine the ambivalent responses to EU environmental policy among policy-makers and environmentalists in the periphery. Both the willingness as well as the capacity of the periphery to protect its environmental heritage are explored. In particular, the administrative capacity, institutional arrangements, political culture as well as economic development needs are taken into account in an examination of the nature of the periphery’s response to and implementation of Union environmental policy. The book will appeal to policy-makers and academics in the countries of the European periphery and to analysts of European policy-making everywhere, especially those concerned with environmental policy and politics. © 1994 Frank Cass & Co.

Minimal legacy effects were observed 1 yr after the termination of a previous long-Term experiment; however, those observations were based on 1 yr of data and only focused on fine root growth, herbivory, and arthropod diversity. We examined above-and belowground biomass inside the footprints of chambers from a former long-Term elevated CO2 experiment in a scrub-oak community 7 yr after CO2 enrichment ceased and 2 yr after fire. Aboveground biomass was 40.6% higher in the previously elevated plots compared with ambient plots, suggesting that there are legacy effects in the form of more rapid aboveground recovery from fire on previously elevated CO2 plots. Belowground biomass exhibited minimal change since the historic CO2 enrichment, suggesting that differences were a result of the original treatment. After disturbance, regrowth occurs via sprouting from large belowground structures; thus changes in aboveground recovery are likely due to changes to belowground biomass caused by altered atmospheric CO2.

Infrastructure consumes significant amounts of construction materials. The production, packaging, transportation and use of these materials require energy and, therefore, are a source of carbon emissions. In order to make the construction of infrastructure satisfy people's life demands and economic development, and at the same time conform to low carbon ideas, it is necessary to understand the spatial and temporal variations of embodied carbon emissions and its regional disparity. This study classifies and sorts the calculation parameters of infrastructure material stock and embodied carbon emissions. It estimates the trends and magnitude of 31 provinces over a period of 20 years (1997-2016) and analyzes the spatial-temporal characteristics. Our results indicate that: (1) The overall infrastructure embodied carbon emissions amount to 32.04 billion tons; (2) the embodied carbon emissions from buildings are far greater than that of transportation infrastructure, however, the annual growth rate is contrary to this; (3) the spatial and temporal variations show regional inequality, with the eastern coastal area being higher than the central and western inland areas and the economically developed areas being higher than the less developed areas. © 2019 by the authors.","Embodied carbon emissions; Infrastructure; Material flow analysis (MFA); Material stock; Spatial-temporal characteristics","building; carbon emission; economic development; growth rate; infrastructure; material flow analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; transportation; trend analysis; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060979936

Natural compounds with biological activities are good tools to identify new targets with therapeutic potentials. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most bioactive ingredient of boswellic acids, a group of compounds with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Target identification of AKBA and metabolomics analysis of psoriasis helped to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its effect, and provide new target(s) to treat the disease. Methods: To explore the targets and molecular mechanism of AKBA, we performed affinity purification, metabolomics analysis of HaCaT cells treated with AKBA, and epidermis of imiquimod (IMQ) induced mouse model of psoriasis and psoriasis patients. Findings: AKBA directly interacts with methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), inhibited its enzyme activity, decreased level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAM/SAH ratio, and reprogrammed one‑carbon metabolism in HaCaT cells. Untargeted metabolomics of epidermis showed one‑carbon metabolism was activated in psoriasis patients. Topical use of AKBA improved inflammatory phenotype of IMQ induced psoriasis-like mouse model. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis revealed AKBA bound to an allosteric site at the interface of MAT2A dimer. Interpretation: Our study extends the molecular mechanism of AKBA by revealing a new interacting protein MAT2A. And this leads us to find out the dysregulated one‑carbon metabolism in psoriasis, which indicates the therapeutic potential of AKBA in psoriasis.

It employs the log t regression test method and the club clustering algorithm developed by Phillips and Sul (2007) to separate the provinces and municipalities in China into three convergence clubs with different transportation carbon emission levels and one divergent group. Among them, the divergent group consisted of Beijing and Liaoning; the high carbon emission club consisted of Shanghai and Inner Mongolia; the low carbon emission club consisted of Jiangxi, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Sichuan; the medium carbon emission club consisted of the remaining 21 provinces and municipalities. On this basis, this article adopts the Ordered Logit model to explore factors influencing the formation of the convergence clubs. The regression results showed that the per capita transportation carbon emissions in the provinces with a high energy intensity of the transportation sector, a high urbanization level, or a high fixed assets investment intensity of the transportation sector tended to converge into the high carbon emission club. © 2018 by the authors.","Club convergence; Log t regression test; Ordered Logit model; Transportation carbon emissions","algorithm; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; convergence; energy intensity; logit analysis; numerical model; traffic emission; transportation system; urbanization; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Henan; Jiangxi; Liaoning; Nei Monggol; Shandong; Shanghai; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060286951

The environmentally optimum insulation thickness exists at a point where the total CO2 emissions are minimum. This work presents the optimum insulation thickness for external walls of different composition and orientation, for both the heating and the cooling period. Three different wall types and insulation materials are being presented. The dynamic thermal behavior of the external walls simulation is based on the heat conduction transfer functions method and using the hourly climatic data available for the city of Athens, Greece. The optimization methodology uses a single objective function approach, combining the simulation of the thermal behavior of external walls with an optimization algorithm. The results indicate that the optimum insulation thickness varies from 11.2 to 23.4 cm and is different for each orientation, wall type, and insulation material. In addition, the total annual CO2 emissions per unit area of the wall can be reduced by 63.2%–72.2%, depending on the insulation material and its position on the wall. © The Author(s) 2018.","GenOpt; greenhouse gas reduction; Optimum insulation thickness; total CO2 emissions; TRNSYS","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat conduction; Insulating materials; Permafrost; Walls (structural partitions); CO2 emissions; GenOpt; Greenhouse gas reductions; Optimum insulation thickness; TRNSYS; Insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047383339

Upper-level governments are well positioned to create an enabling environment for adaptation and build local public health authorities' capacity, yet adaptation literature has not specified how upper-level governments can build local-level adaptive capacity. In this paper we examine how federal and regional governments can contribute to enabling and supporting public health adaptation to climate change at the local level in federal systems. We outline the local level's self-assessed adaptive capacity for public health adaptation in Canadian and German comparative case studies, in terms of funding, knowledge and skills, organizations, and prioritization, drawing upon 30 semi-structured interviews. Based on interviewees' recommendations and complemented by scientific literature, we develop a set of practical measures that could enable or support local-level public health adaptation. We find that adaptive capacity varies widely between local public health authorities, but most report having insufficient funding and staff for adaptation activities. We propose 10 specific measures upper-level governments can take to build local public health authorities' capacity for adaptation, under the interrelated target areas of: building financial capital; developing and disseminating usable knowledge; collaborating and coordinating for shared knowledge; and claiming leadership. Federal and regional governments have an important role to play in enabling local-level public health adaptation, and have many instruments available to them to fulfill that role. Selecting and implementing measures to enable local public health authorities' adaptive capacity will require tailoring to, and consideration, of the local context and needs. © 2018","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Canada; Climate change; Germany; Health policy; Multi-level governance; Public health","climate change; climate effect; federal system; governance approach; health policy; local adaptation; public health; article; Canada; climate change; drawing; funding; Germany; government; health care policy; human; human experiment; leadership; organization; scientific literature; semi structured interview; skill; staff; Canada; cooperation; Germany; government; health services research; interview; leadership; public health; Canada; Germany; Canada; Climate Change; Cooperative Behavior; Germany; Health Policy; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Leadership; Local Government; Organizational Case Studies; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056827825

This paper presents an original model based on mass conservation and on the First- and Second Law of Thermodynamics, which results in a set of equations that allow for the calculation of the Primary Productivity (NPP) and consequently lead to a measure of the plant growth. The model is lumped, steady-state and totally deterministic, because no primary process is modelled in detail: the control volume is a portion of the universe that contains the plant and its immediate surroundings (atmosphere and the relevant portion of the soil), and the solution is strongly depending on the imposed boundary conditions. In such a formulation, the tree is considered as a non-equilibrium system evolving at a steady rate, and the only implicit assumption is the local equilibrium hypothesis. The general evolution equations are derived, and their steady-state form is analysed in detail. The approach is based on the calculation of the exergy in- and outflows from the control volume. Based on reasonably accurate empirical data, the exergy budget shows that the overall exergy conversion efficiency is quite low in plants and is very sensitive to even small changes in the environmental condition and to the adopted evapotranspiration model, as it would have been expected. The model is applied to a mature specimen of Pinus sylvestris and the results are compared with some literature data: despite neglecting the real chemo-physical details, the model reproduces the most salient characters of the tree growth. The sensitivity of the results to the tree age as well to the main model parameters is also calculated. The application of the same model to different species may reveal asymmetries in the “adaptability” of certain genotypes to different environments. On the more specific engineering side, the model may see an immediate application in the estimate of CO2 capture by plants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biological systems; Exergy analysis; Non-equilibrium systems; Plant growth model","Budget control; Exergy; Forestry; Metabolism; Physiology; Trees (mathematics); Environmental conditions; Evapotranspiration modeling; Exergy Analysis; Nonequilibrium system; Plant growth modeling; Primary productivity; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Thermodynamic treatment; Biological systems; boundary condition; coniferous tree; energy efficiency; evapotranspiration; gas exchange; genotype-environment interaction; growth rate; metabolism; model validation; parameterization; physicochemical property; primary production; sensitivity analysis; thermodynamics; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056649323

But this silence cannot obliterate the obligations of the developed countries that caused these omissions to make reparations to affected developing countries. This article includes in its scope the grounds of these obligations and the forms that such compensation might take, and their relation to adaptation. By way of methodology, the authors employ both ethical analysis and the application of ethical findings to areas such as technology transfer and early-warning systems. They also argue that geo-engineering should not be included among the forms that compensation might adopt. The authors’ aim is to foster among countries responsible for carbon emissions an enhanced awareness of imaginative ways in which the harms they have caused can be mitigated or ameliorated. The Agreement enshrines some modest but significant steps towards climate change mitigation and towards adaptation to climate change that either has happened already or unavoidably will happen. These steps, while insufficient, are likely to prove crucial in the struggle to combat climate change. Without them humanity and the planet would have been on course for disastrous increases of greenhouse gas emissions, and equally disastrous related impacts in the form of extreme weather events of ever increasing frequency. Even as things stand, there is a high risk of the flooding of coastlines and of small islands worldwide, while famine due to droughts has returned to several regions of Africa.

Yet, little is known about the response of large carnivores to climate change, globally and regionally. In this study, we utilized the ensemble modeling based on six species distribution models in order to predict the spatial vulnerability of the globally endangered Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) to climate change in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, a semi-arid region in Iran. We showed that about 12.12 to 22.38% of leopard habitats in the area may be lost by 2050 due to climate change under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) within the framework of two general circulation models (GCMs). In contrast, 1.87 to 13.01% of currently unsuitable habitats can become suitable with climate change. Overall, a considerable portion of the leopard range will remain intact under global warming, but still habitat loss to climate change will vary from 5.89 to 14.59%. Thus, large-scale but locally focused and flexible conservation strategies should be applied in intact and sensitive areas so that to prevent the intensification of anthropogenic threats such as overgrazing and forest degradation from collection of firewood, charcoal, and medicinal plants under changing climate. © 2018, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.","Climate adaptability; Conservation; Fragmentation; Habitat loss; Persian leopard; Zagros","adaptive management; climate change; conservation; endangered species; felid; fragmentation; global warming; habitat loss; land use change; modeling; predator; semiarid region; vulnerability; Iran; Zagros; Panthera pardus; Panthera pardus saxicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059443680

The environment is a wholesome entity that provides every eminent need required by humans, but humans, in the wake of urbanization, have degraded the quality of their surroundings through activities like extensive extraction of natural resources and extravagant use of nonrenewable resources. Combustion of fossil fuel releases CO2, which leads to changes in the composition of the atmosphere. Hence, it is required to minimize the immense use of fossil fuel and reduce CO2 emissions. Although it is quite impossible to cut back the use of natural resources all at once, consumption of fuel can be minimized by a reduction in the consumption of energy and this would result in a reduction in harmful emissions. This chapter summarizes an attempt toward resolving barriers and establishing an in-depth look for energy-efficient green buildings. Green building, or energy-efficient building, is defined as the practice of enhancing the efficiency of buildings regarding their use of resources, such as energy, water, and materials, and finding an achievable solution to the problems of pollution, climate change, and energy security. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Adverse effects of climate change increasingly reduce both productivity and production. Rice plays an important role in the food security of population. However, rice production faces many constraints, including low water control and soil fertility management. In order to improve water control and soil management and increase the productivity of local rice production in the context of climate change, a new technology (smart-valley approach) was introduced in Benin and Togo since 2010. The aim of this study is to assess the adoption, the diffusion and impact of smart-valley approach. Data were collected from 590 rice farming households in Benin and Togo. Results revealed that land tenure, total available area, paddy price and production in the lowland increase the adoption of smart-valley approach. Adoption of smart-valley approach increased from 110 ha in 2012 to 474 ha in 2014. In addition, the adoption enables producers to increase the yield by 0.9 tons ha-1, the net income by USD 267 per hectare under the condition of climate change. The study suggests that large diffusion and training on the technology would help for adaptation to climate change and improving their livelihood of smallholder rice farmers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Climate change; Diffusion; Impact; Rice; Smart-valley approach; West Africa",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078650353

This increasing demand for food has been previously tried to be met through the use of synthetic fertilizers and effective application of weed- and pest-controlling chemicals. However, these methods of increasing crop productivity rely on finite resources and are often unsustainable. They are now proven to be posing a great threat to the environment and causing a negative change in the planet’s natural climate. Fortunately, the threat has been realized by scientists, and the world has started to lay the foundations for sustainable intensification of agriculture and to heighten the resilience of crops to climate change. The solutions discovered so far are numerous with many of them not yet tested. Climate change assessment is the first priority in this regard. Much of the recent researches have demonstrated a multi-scale and multidimensional nature of climate change to assess the potential effects of climate change on agriculture and the options for adaptation. These options for adaptation have been different in different regions of the world with clear differences among strategies in rich and poor countries. The pressure for adaptation is greatest in poor countries where the adaptive capacity is least abundant. Adaptation to climate change could be autonomous (market-driven) or planned. Both of these adaptation strategies are driven by certain measures. Some adaptation strategies are easily achieved with the help of existing technologies, some need development of new technologies while others just need policy and institutional/market reforms. Numerous researchers have tried to assess and give tools for the potential impact of climate change which are largely based on modelling techniques. Indeed, models are useful tools for assessing this potential impact and evaluating the options for adaptation, yet they do not match the level of real solutions that could be brought about by efficient adaptive human agency. The importance of agriculture as performance is useful in counterbalancing the modelling approaches towards mitigating the negative impacts of climate change. The adaptation and mitigation strategies are and should be social phenomena which need social attendance in the form of improved and sustainable agricultural practices and could help agriculture contribute less to the changing climate. This chapter will focus on numerous strategies that could be adapted to assess and cope with the negative impacts of changing climate on agriculture. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate-smart agriculture; Food security; Mitigation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085826880

To address this issue, the emission legislations are becoming more stringent with an aim to reduce the emissions at national level. App based taxis are becoming lifeline for all major Indian cities. So far, these taxis are predominantly diesel powered compact cars. Thus, vehicle powertrain electrification is a good idea to improve local air quality in such urban pockets. While upgradation of internal combustion engines will add significant costs due to expensive exhaust after-treatment systems, electric motor driven taxis can be the ideal solution for emission reduction, as their operation is completely free of local pollutant emissions. However, the currently available electric vehicles are more expensive than the internal combustion engine powered counterparts. Against this backdrop, this paper focuses on optimizing battery electric vehicles for taxi segment requirements, and analyzes possible ways to make the technology affordable. The presented work begins with a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threads (SWOT) analysis for vehicle electrification, having clean urban mobility as central objective. Taxi driving data collected from Pune city driving is analyzed statistically to arrive at a real driving pattern for an app-based taxi operation. The driver demanded torque from the real world driving is used for drivetrain sizing. The powertrain losses and other accessory loads from the real driving measurements are included to define the maximum vehicle power requirement. The daily running distance, calculated based on the app-based taxi survey, forms the basis for the determination of the required energy storage system capacity. A cost optimization between 48 V and high voltage (100......400 V) energy storage systems and propulsion components is also included in the study, as are analyses of various battery charging infrastructure possibilities in Indian cities compared to the best practices available globally. There are hosts of subsidies provided by governments across the globe to make electrified powertrains affordable. The possibilities of binning different subsidies are also analyzed based on energy consumption of the proposed vehicle and current energy price levels. This paper considers tank to wheel efficiency with a focus on affordability of electrified powertrains in the urban taxi segment. The output from this work establishes the requirements for right sizing the electric vehicle components and for the promotional subsidies to strengthen the position of battery electric vehicle in the app-based taxi segment. © 2019 SAE International.

In the process, community land is transformed into a new form of aesthetically controlled and ordered nature for the middle and upper classes and for tourists.

Over the years, and notably since 2003, the government has promulgated a series of policies intended to constrain coal consumption, promote the use of non-fossil fuels, reduce air pollution, and enhance energy efficiency. These measures include improving the efficiency of coal-fired power stations and industrial plants, switching from coal to gas, testing carbon capture and storage or use, and boosting the share of low-carbon energy sources in the power sector. These strategies have met with a high degree of success, due mainly to the rigorous application of administrative policy instruments and subsidies. The country has great potential for the further deployment of wind and solar energy, as well as scope to boost the share of natural gas. The key determinants of the pace at which China reduces its use of fossil fuels in absolute terms are two-fold. First is the rate of economic growth. Coal has long been the swing fuel and an increase in economic growth has always boosted coal consumption. The second key variable is the mix of market and administrative policy instruments deployed. Whilst the continued introduction of market forces into the energy sector may be welcome on purely economic grounds, it is not evident that they will be effective at enhancing efficiency or reducing emissions for as long as the major energy producing and consuming enterprises remain in state hands. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","China; Coal; Electricity; Fossil fuel; Natural gas; Renewable energy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086188657

This work presents a detailed method for assessing the technical and economic viability of using these renewable forms of energy to power desalination facilities. The method relies on a multi-layered, spatial model that incorporated multiple variables such as depth of water resource, salinity levels, magnitude of local renewable energy resources, distance to water infrastructure, and, for comparative purposes, the local price of water. To illustrate this method, it was applied to 1445 site locations on state of Texas lands owned by the General Land Office that overlay brackish aquifer resources. Using this method, 193 potentially economically viable sites were identified that have estimated renewable desalination water production costs lower than local municipal water prices.

It is the only part of the building which has direct solar gain due to the transparent materials. Consequently, this part of building envelope should reap high consideration by architects and engineers, particularly in regions where solar radiation is high. The research aims to investigate the influence of glazing to wall ratio in different microclimate regions in Saudi Arabia which has been introduced by the author hot dry, hot humid and moderate climates. The research has studied the most possible glazing ration in the region based on previous work 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% out of the external wall.

It is due to its improved combustion technology that will benefit the environment and automotive sectors. The intensive research of HCCI combustion is in line with the current trend in renewable fuels demand such as biofuels. One of the advantages of an HCCI engine to operate with a wide range of fuels including gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and hydrogen makes the HCCI technology emerged as the next internal combustion engine candidate for commercialization. This engine is considered as the potential alternative engine to provide what SI (Spark Ignition) and CI (Compression Ignition) engines could not sufficiently offer. Other than its good volumetric efficiency, it produces cleaner combustion and lower emissions levels of NOx and Particulate Matters (PM). Hydrogen is knowingly able to reduce emissions level in an internal combustion engine, but the performance will be greatly reduced and not work in stable condition if runs in a single fuel. However, when the hydrogen is combined with biofuels, the emissions levels can be attained, and engine efficiency can be better than that of the biodiesel in a single mode. The combination of hydrogen with biofuels in dual-fuel mode can be achieved by inducing the hydrogen through the air intake manifold. Several ignition control strategies are performed experimentally (e.g. hydrogen addition, dual-fuel mode and exhaust gas recirculation) and other issues associated with HCCI engines are also discussed in detail in this review paper. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060484964

We use the model to estimate the effects of four solar energy policy interventions on photovoltaic (PV) investments, government expenditure, economic outputs, CO2e emissions and the uses of steel, aluminium, concrete and energy. The results of our analysis call for the abolition of the PV donor gift policy, the improvement of production efficiency in the PV industry and the establishment of after-sales services and rural financing institutions. A 100 W peak (Wp) PV under this recommendation would be affordable for 80.6% of rural households that are projected to be without access to electricity in 2029. Net metering is the most effective policy for encouraging urban people to invest in PV in a situation where fossil energy prices are increasing and PV prices are declining. A donor gift policy may induce USD 51.9 new economic outputs for every Wp of PV operating to capacity in 2029, but would require a subsidy of USD 18.6/Wp. The recommended policies do not require subsidies and reduce CO2eq emissions and the consumption of aluminium, energy, steel and concrete by between 83.1% and 89.7% more than the existing policy.

However, the status of genetic resources diversity and the utilisation patterns of many orphan crops have been poorly investigated to inform breeding programs and management strategies. In this study, we assembled Kersting’s groundnut diversity, associated farmers’ knowledge and production systems across three ecological zones in Benin and Togo. We collected data through focus group discussions in 43 villages. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 300 farmers. Four cell analyses was performed using cropping areas and number of Kersting’s groundnut farmers as criteria. We conducted a comparative analysis of the Kersting’s groundnut utilisations and production systems across ecological zones. In total, 308 accessions of Kersting’s groundnut were collected using farmers’ criteria such as grain colour, grain size, maturity time, yield potential, medicinal properties and marketability. Farmers grouped the accessions into five landraces based solely on grain colour. All landraces were cultivated in the Sudanian zone while only three of them were found in the Guinean and Sudano-Guinean zones. Most of these landraces were produced by a few farmers on small cropping areas. The choice of landraces for production depended on local intention for production and different use categories across ecological zones. Up to 46.80% of decrease in cropping areas was observed in most zones due to specific production bottlenecks such as drought and diseases. We discuss our findings and suggest tailored actions including effective in situ and ex situ conservation strategies, germplasm collection and characterization in other countries where the crop is produced, development of new cultivars with farmers’ preferred traits and enhancement of the genetic base of the species. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Cultivar development; Folk nomenclature; Genetic resources conservation; Landrace; Macrotyloma geocarpum; On-farm diversity","agricultural development; agricultural practice; climate change; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; cropping practice; cultivar; developing world; drought; ecozone; genetic resource; germplasm; groundnut; nomenclature; plant breeding; smallholder; Benin [Edo]; Edo; Edo; Guinea; Nigeria; Sudan; Togo; Macrotyloma geocarpum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055752560

To achieve the research objectives, data were collected using survey questionnaires and analysed using statistical tools. The results show that most of the respondents are between the age of 31-45 years in the sample size, 45% has secondary education and 34% of the respondents' monthly income is between RM2,000-RM4,000. It has been found that approximately 76% of farmers had heard about climate change. The results also revealed that socio-economic characteristics such as education, income, type of farmer, attitudes and awareness were positive and highly significant.

The acid dissociation constant of RCOOH (pK a (L)) was shown to govern the redox and emission properties of the clusters. Temperature (T)-controlled emission experiments (3-300 K) demonstrated that the clusters showed large T-dependent emission energies (ν em ) and lifetimes (τ em ) because of zero-magnetic-field splitting in the emissive excited triplet (T 1 ) states. The spin sublevel (φ n , n = 1-4) model in the T 1 state of the cluster explained very well the T-dependent emission characteristics (ν em and τ em ), irrespective of the clusters studied. Furthermore, we revealed that the energy difference between the lowest-energy (φ 1 ) and energetically upper-lying third (φ 3 ) or fourth spin sublevels (φ 4 ), ΔE 13 or ΔE 14 , respectively, correlated very well with pK a (L).

However, little has been shown about the long-term association between ambient PM2.5 and asthma. Methods: A survey from 2007 to 2010 was conducted among adults over 50 years of age in six low- and middle- income countries (including China, India, Ghana, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa), which belonged to one part of a prospective cohort study - the Study on global AGEing and adult health. The yearly mean PM2.5 concentrations of the residential communities of participants were estimated from remote sensing data. A mixed effects model was applied to investigate the association between ambient PM2.5 and asthma. Results: A total of 4553 asthma patients were identified among the 29,249 participants in this study, producing a prevalence of 15.57%. For each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, the adjusted prevalence ratio of asthma was 1.05 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.01, 1.08) after controlling for the effects of sex, age, BMI, education attainment, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposure. Further analyses showed that males and smokers might be particularly vulnerable populations. Additionally, it was estimated that about 5.12% of the asthma cases in the study population (95% Confidence Interval: 1.44%, 9.23%) could be attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure. Conclusion: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 might be an important risk factor of asthma. Effective air pollution reduction measures should be taken to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in order to reduce the associated asthma cases and disease burden. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Asthma; Disease burden; Effect modification; Particulate matter","alcohol; adult; asthma; atmospheric pollution; disease incidence; disease prevalence; health risk; occupational exposure; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; remote sensing; respiratory disease; suspended particulate matter; young population; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; asthma; body mass; China; controlled study; cross-sectional study; educational status; female; Ghana; human; India; long term exposure; low income country; major clinical study; male; Mexico; middle aged; middle income country; occupational exposure; particulate matter; remote sensing; Russian Federation; smoking; South Africa; vulnerable population; adverse event; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; asthma; developing country; environmental exposure; prospective study; toxicity; China; Ghana; India; Mexico [North America]; Russian Federation; South Africa; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asthma; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Environmental Exposure; Female; Ghana; Humans; India; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter; Prospective Studies; Russia; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054431298

Among the AFM nanomachining mode features, which include elastic/plastic deformations and crack generation, pile-up (by ploughing) is a key surface phenomenon that can represent plastic deformation characteristics, such as a sign of chip making. Moreover, because the pile-up formation mechanism of coated materials is reported to be distinct from that of bulk materials, the examination of pile-up in coated materials is challenging, along with brittle transition (crack initiation). In this research, the pile-up formation and crack initiation, that occur during nanoscratching, were examined and analyzed near the coating-substrate (glass) boundary. In addition, acoustic emission (AE), a sensing scheme with nanoscale sensitivity, was introduced to detect significant machining state variations and mode transitions. Experimental and analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme is viable for characterizing/monitoring the nanoscale machining of coated materials. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","acoustic emission monitoring; AFM nanomachining; crack initiation; IZO-coated Pyrex glass; ploughing","Acoustic emission testing; Atomic force microscopy; Crack initiation; Glass; Nanotechnology; Piles; Sensitivity analysis; Acoustic emission monitoring; Brittle transitions; Coating-substrate; Deformation Characteristics; Formation mechanism; Nanomachining; ploughing; Pyrex glass; Coated materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046626412

International communities have agreed in recent Paris agreement to reduce global pollution to certain level and have shown great concern with Chinese pollution. China is not only the world second largest and fast growing economy but the highest CO2 emitters as 29.4% world emissions source is China. This paper adds in this debate by exploring cointegration and causal relation between real GDP per capita, CO2 emissions per capita, energy consumption per capita and urban population for China utilizing annual data for the period of 1971–2014. Autoregressive distributed lag model has been used to confirm the cointegration among variables. Results reveal short run income coefficient is positive while it turns to negative and insignificant in long run marking that growth and development is supportive in CO2 emissions reduction in China. Its insignificancy gives impression that only growth dependency to overcome CO2 emissions will not be appropriate choice for China. By introducing income cubic function, N-shape relation between income and CO2 emissions was found in long run that re-emphasis though income is helping in emissions reduction, however, there is need to dependent on multiple environmental policies. Further, results show that energy consumption has positive and significant impact on CO2 emissions and energy coefficient was becoming fatter with the time. Urban population was insignificant while it turns to negative and significant with income cubic model suggesting that urbanization process is not adding to pollution emissions in China. Overall, results give feelings that model with income cubic function is suited well for Chinese economy. FMOLS and GMM estimators confirm ARDL results are robust. In addition, this paper also explores causal relation between the variables by utilizing error correction based on granger causality models. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","China; CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Global warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044725011

Innovation in physical technologies and social behaviours is key to this transformation. But innovation has not been at the heart of economic models of climate change. This chapter reviews the state of the art on the economics of innovation, applying recent insights to climate change. The core insight is that technological innovation is a path-dependent process in which history and expectations matter greatly in determining eventual outcomes. This insight has six important implications for climate policy design. First, efficient climate policy requires direct research subsidies for inducing and/or diffusing clean innovations, combined with carbon pricing (whether by taxes or trading). Second, both public and private sector involvement is required. Third, path dependence and system inertia imply that delaying policies that redirect innovation towards clean technologies significantly increases costs in the future. Fourth, more developed countries should act as leaders in clean technology and should subsidise access to such technologies for less developed countries. Fifth, if a transition from coal to clean energy is to be made via intermediates (for example, gas), the use of gas (without carbon capture) should be agreed to be on a time-limited basis. Finally, investment in coal should not be encouraged, as its continued use is only safe if we assume the cost-effectiveness of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. While much greater efforts should be taken to reduce the costs of CCS, the speed that these technologies can be developed and deployed is uncertain. © Roger Fouquet 2019.

These changes, as projected by the well-known General Circulation Model will grossly impact the food-cropping system. While developing adaptation strategies, it would be useful to understand the current climatic and farming regimes in similar or analogue sites, which have already experienced future conditions. The data used in this article are from a study using the Climate Analogues tool, a web-based tool developed by the Research Programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security, which uses spatial and temporal variability in climate projections for different climatic scenarios using the General Circulation Model. Sites with statistically similar climates were thus identified and mapped; these include two sites from four different agroecological regions of wheat cropping in India. Comparisons were made specifically for the year 2030, keeping in mind changes in agricultural techniques and mechanisms that could potentially occur over a span of one and a half decades. Temperature was prioritized over other climatic variables in this study, which was conducted using the ECHAM model for the A2 scenario. A comparison of the current yields of the selected sites with those of the future analogue sites revealed the former to be at low, moderate or high risk, in accordance with the projected future climatic conditions for wheat cultivation. Most sites appeared to be at moderate risk due to temperature increase at these sites by the year 2030, and except for two sites, had significantly reduced yields. © 2019 Current Science Association, Bengaluru.","Climate analogue; Future temperature; Similar site; Wheat production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060461551

The implementation of circular economy can be conducted at three levels: in single enterprise or group of enterprises, in a group of collocated firms and at the city or municipal level. Currently, implementation of circular economy in Malaysia is at firm level. There is a lack of legal framework on the implementation of circular economy in Malaysia. However, there are certain sections and regulations in Environmental Quality Act 1974, Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007 and in Environmental Quality (Scheduled Waste) Regulation 2005, respectively, that promote resource circulation. Nationwide initiatives taken to promote circular economy are inclusion of integration of sustainable production and consumption, reduction of 40% of greenhouse gas emissions intensity from GDP compared to 2005 level and 22% of recycling of MSW, in Eleventh Malaysian Plan. Additionally, SWCorp has launched SWCorp Strategic Plan to promote sustainable solid waste management services, and CIDB has initiated CITP that has a target of incorporating 20% of recycled construction and demolition waste (tonnage) by year 2020 from baseline of 2016. Also, there are guidelines on coprocessing and proposals on establishment of industrial ecology by DOE. A few case studies show implementation of circular economy in manufacturing industries. The benefits of these implementations were reduction in energy and resource consumption, reduction in waste generation, protection of environment and human health, cost savings by reusing or recycling waste and additional profit gains by selling waste to potential buyers. Several opportunities of sustainable waste management and resource circulation have been highlighted in this chapter such as manufacturing of bioproducts and butanol from biomass to coprocessing between ELVs and construction industry.

Two different forest management strategies are practiced in a tropical forest in western Kenya: (1) a protection strategy where human entry is prohibited except for minimalistic human presence (e.g., research activities); and (2) a conservation strategy where human access to the forest and its resources are permitted. We assessed the effects of these management strategies and different levels of disturbance caused by the legacy effects of legal logging activities and the contemporary effects of unauthorized harvesting of forest products on the abundance of guava and non-guava trees and carbon storage in both plant biomass and soil in this forest. We found that guava trees were less likely to thrive and carbon storage in plants and soils was similar in sites with minimal disturbance under both the protection and conservation strategies. However, as disturbance increased, whether by the historical or contemporary effects of human activities, guava trees were more likely to thrive and carbon storage in plants shifted from non-guava trees to guava trees, but without an effect on more stable soil carbon. We conclude that regulations should be strictly enforced to prevent all logging activity, but the conservation strategy would provide similar effects on both forest plant and soil carbon to the protection strategy, while providing benefits to the surrounding community who rely on the forest for cultural and spiritual nourishment. © 2018","Africa; Carbon; Disturbance; Forest; Invasive species; Management; Tropical","Carbon; Laws and legislation; Management; Soil conservation; Soils; Storage management; Tropics; Africa; Disturbance; Forest; Invasive species; Tropical; Forestry; abundance; biological invasion; carbon sequestration; disturbance; forest management; invasive species; invasiveness; shrub; soil carbon; tropical forest; Africa; Carbon; Forestry; Management; Tropics; Kenya; Psidium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054427978

The cumulative gaseous pollutants resulting from simultaneous operations of all the identified plant air emission point sources are 0.01–276.13% of their respective 24-h limits along the fenceline, with 1-h SO2 within the threshold limit at all fenceline locations, but 1-h NOX exceeds the threshold limit at all locations 16–21 times. The 24-h CO and VOCs are within their limits at all fenceline locations; however the 24-h SO2 and NOX are breaching the limits at some locations 30–34 times (0.34–0.39% of the investigation period) and 44–87 times, respectively. Daily and Annual averaging concentrations of PM10 was 14.32–31.54% and 4.90–52.60% of their respective limits. Process facilities are the major point sources of atmospheric emissions identified in the factory. Several fugitive emission sources were also identified during the field work. Comprehensive evaluation of the fugitive emission sources should be carried out in the cement plant for immediate attention. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air quality index; Dispersion; Gaseous pollutants; Particulate matter; Receptor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051499142

This study assessed the effect of shifting trans−/planting date of dry season Boro rice as an adaptation strategy, with focus on water requirements under future climate scenarios. Potential crop water requirement, effective rainfall and irrigation requirement to satisfy crop evapotranspiration of Boro rice were estimated using CropWat 8.0 for early, normal and late planting dates for 2050s and 2080s. Future climate scenarios were constructed using five global circulation model (GCM) outputs for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 by statistical downscaling and bias correction. Number of days exceeding the threshold temperatures (maximum of 35 °C and minimum of 25 °C) was counted for critical period of Boro rice to understand compatibility of the changed planting dates. Results indicate that late planting can substantially reduce irrigation demand by increasing rainfall availability during Boro growth duration, but the option is very limited due to both day- and night-time heat stress. An early planting, on the other hand, accounts for high water demand but ensures suitable temperature during the critical growth stages of the crop. The normal planting dates show the possibility of day-time heat stress. So, late planting of temperature-tolerant cultivars or early planting of high-yielding varieties would be recommended based on local water availability. However, adjustment of the planting date is currently limited because high temperature-tolerant cultivars are not available in the study region. © 2018","Bangladesh; CropWat; Heat stress; Transplanting date; Water demand","adaptive management; agricultural modeling; climate change; cultivar; cultivation; downscaling; environmental stress; evapotranspiration; food security; high yielding variety; plantation; rice; strategic approach; temperature tolerance; transplantation; water demand; water use efficiency; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056774031

Using cross-sectional data of 450 farmers collected from three agro-ecological zones of Punjab, Pakistan, this study investigates farmer perceptions of climate change and their agreement with observed climatic trends. In addition, this study explores the correlation between different adaptation stages (perceptions, intentions, and adaptation) and their key drivers using a Multivariate Probit Model. This study also explores the adaptation measures adopted by farmers. The results of the study show that the perceptions of increasing mean temperature match well with locally recorded data. However, a discrepancy is found in some cases between farmer perceptions of rainfall changes and local climate records. Moreover, education, experience, land tenure, land holdings, extension, cooperation, access to weather forecasting, and marketing information are the factors influencing the three adaptation stages. A strong association is found among the three adaptation stages. Particularly, the study confirms the hypothesis that accurate perceptions lead to stronger adaptation intentions compared to underestimated or no perceptions. Further, farmers prefer basic adaptation measures including changing crop varieties, input use and planting dates over advanced measures, such as planting shade trees, soil conservation, and crop diversification. The study recommends providing farmers, especially small landholders and tenants, easy access to information, institutional services and training on the use of advanced measures to reduce negative impacts of climate change at the farm level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Accuracy of perceptions; Adaptation intentions; Climate change; Farm level adaptation; Pakistan","Crops; Plants (botany); Soil conservation; Weather forecasting; Adaptation intentions; Agricultural system; Agro-ecological zones; Crop diversification; Farm-level adaptation; Marketing information; Multivariate probit; Pakistan; Climate change; rain; accuracy assessment; adaptive management; agriculture; agroecology; climate change; environmental impact assessment; extreme event; farmers attitude; perception; rainfall; risk perception; trend analysis; willingness to pay; adaptation; agricultural management; agricultural worker; agriculture; Article; climate change; cooperation; crop rotation; education; environmental temperature; forecasting; human; marketing; Pakistan; personal experience; planting time; soil management; trend study; weather; agricultural worker; agriculture; cross-sectional study; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Agriculture; Climate Change; Cross-Sectional Studies; Farmers; Humans; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055551063

This study uses 17 climate models to evaluate when changes in fire weather, as realized through the Fire Weather Index, emerge from the expected range of internal variability due to anthropogenic climate change using the time of emergence framework. Anthropogenic increases in extreme Fire Weather Index days emerge for 22% of burnable land area globally by 2019, including much of the Mediterranean and the Amazon. By the midtwenty-first century, emergence among the different Fire Weather Index metrics occurs for 33–62% of burnable lands. Emergence of heightened fire weather becomes more widespread as a function of global temperature change. At 2 °C above preindustrial levels, the area of emergence is half that for 3 °C. These results highlight increases in fire weather conditions with human-caused climate change and incentivize local adaptation efforts to limit detrimental fire impacts. ©2018.

Adverse environmental conditions including high temperature, drought, salinity, and precipitation resulting from the changing climate in different regions increase the risk of dramatic losses in agricultural production. The altered species distribution resulting from the changed climatic scenario has affected the functional interactions and integrations existing between species. The differential origin, evolution, and dispersal abilities of organisms determine their susceptibility and response mechanisms under the changed environment and functions on multiple levels. Soil microbiota (including rhizospheric and endophytic microorganisms) play an indispensable role in the mitigation of climate change and induced abiotic stresses, and also promote plant growth and development through a plethora of mechanisms that work at multiple levels, including regulation of nutrient transformation, allowing for coexistence among neighboring and controlling plant populations. The functional aspects and ecological dynamics of natural ecosystems are highly dependent on plant functional traits and their interactions with organisms occupied at a multitrophic level. The changed climatic conditions influence the environmental variables and therefore alter the multifunctional responses or interaction mechanisms existing between the plants and microbes. Furthermore, the mutual interactions between plants and soil microbes have substantial consequences in regulating the community compositions and ecosystem functions. This chapter discusses the effect of climate change on ecosystem mechanics and dynamics, and how microorganisms play crucial roles in regulating the functional dynamics of ecosystem properties. In recent years, rapid industrialization and increased anthropogenic activities have resulted in rapid and continuous changes in climatic conditions, causing significant changes in agricultural productivity. In this context, there is an urgent need to understand, define, and interpret the plant-microbe interactions in terms of their efficient use and indigenous mechanisms against abiotic stresses without compromising the sustainability of the ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
