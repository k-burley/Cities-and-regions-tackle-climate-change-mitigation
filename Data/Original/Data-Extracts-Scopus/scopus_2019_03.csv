The Illinois portion of the St. Louis area includes Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair counties, and Baldwin Township in Randolph County. EPA is taking this action because it has determined that the St. Louis area is attaining the annual 1997 PM2.5 standard based on the most recent three years of certified air quality data. EPA is also proposing to approve a revision to the Illinois SIP for maintaining the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS through 2030. Illinois’ maintenance plan submission includes an updated emission inventory, which includes emission inventories for PM2.5, NOx, VOC, and NH3. The maintenance plan submission also includes motor vehicle emission budgets for the mobile source contribution of PM2.5 and NOx to the St. Louis PM2.5 area for transportation conformity purposes. EPA is proposing to approve and update both the emissions inventory and MVEBs. EPA is proposing to take these actions in accordance with the Clean Air Act and EPA’s SIP rules regarding the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.

The most effective strategy for de-carbonization is by substituting the power generation from fossil fuels with available sources of renewable energy. Determining suitable location for such project which will socially be acceptable and economically feasible largely depends on many factors such as environmental, economic, social and technical. The main objective of this study is to analyze and identify a better location for a utility scale wind farm to be connected to the national grid using GIS-based multi-criteria decision-making method. The designed methodology for this study considers seven factors which were classified into two main classes: Environmental and economic where maximum power output and minimum cost of the project will be achieved. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used for weighing the criteria and computation of land suitability index (LSI) to evaluate probable locations. In this study, the whole of Jigawa State of Nigeria was considered. In conclusion, the resultant output index was classified into four as “Low suitable”, “moderately suitable”, “suitable” and “highly suitable”. As a result, the total area of 2721.33km2 (11.8%) is “Highly suitable”, 14927.02km2 (65.02%) is “Suitable”, 5299.34km2 (23.08%) is “Moderately suitable” and 10.75km2 (0.05%) is “Low suitable�. © BEIESP.","Analytical hierarchy process; Geographical Information System; Land suitability index; Multi-criteria decision making; Suitability analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066984760

The new energy vehicles (NEVs) technology, as one of the high-tech good samples around the world, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect the environment effectively, and finally accomplish the low-carbon economy of sustainable development. So the Chinese government pays close attention and billions of Research and Development (R&D) subsidies to help the NEVs companies research their generic technology. Based on the lack of the effective decision-making mechanism for R&D subsidies by the government, this paper aims to propose a novel decision-making model and help the policy-maker choose the right objects for R&D subsidies, avoiding the problems like a waste of the public resources, cheating for taking the subsidy and so on.

To continue implementing GI, financial tools are needed for upfront project capital or development costs and later for maintenance. This study's purpose is to evaluate financing tools used in a selected GI dataset and to assess how those tools are linked to various GI technologies and other GI project characteristics like cost and size. The dataset includes over 400 GI U.S. projects, comprising a convenience sample, from the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA). GI project characteristics were organized to answer a number of research questions using descriptive statistics. Results indicated that the number of projects and overall cost shares were mostly located in a few states. Grants were the most common financial tool with about two-thirds of the projects reporting information on financial tools receiving grant funding. Most projects reported financing from only one tool with a maximum of three tools. Projects primarily included multiple GI technologies averaging three and a maximum of nine. The most common GI technologies were bioswales, retention, rain gardens, and porous pavements. These findings are useful for decision-makers evaluating funding support for GI. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate mitigation and adaptation; Co-benefits; Financial sources; Green infrastructure finance; Green infrastructure project costs; Private finance; Public finance; Stormwater management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063780132

There has been less agreement in estimating internal climate variability (V). In recent years, an initial condition ensemble (ICE) of a climate model has been developed to study V. ICE is simulated by running a climate model using an identical climate forcing but different initial conditions. Inter-member differences of an ICE manifestly represent V. However, ICE has been barely used to investigate relative importance of climate change uncertainties. Accordingly, this study proposes a method of using ICEs, without assuming V as constant, for investigating the relative importance of climate change uncertainties and its temporal–spatial variation. Prior to investigating temporal–spatial variation in China, V estimated using ICE was compared to that using multi-model individual time series at national scale. Results show that V using ICE is qualitatively similar to that using multi-model individual time series for temperature. However, V is not constant for average and extreme precipitations. V and M dominate before 2050s especially for precipitation. S is dominant in the late 21st century especially for temperature. Mean temperature change is projected to be 30–70% greater than its uncertainty until 2050s, while uncertainty becomes 10–40% greater than the change in the late 21st century. Precipitation change uncertainty overwhelms its change by 70–150% throughout 21st century. Cold regions (e.g., northern China and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau) tend to have greater temperature change uncertainties. In dry regions (e.g., northwest China), all three uncertainties tend to be great for changes in average and extreme precipitations. This study emphasizes the importance of considering climate change uncertainty in impact studies, especially taking into account that V is irreducible in the future. Using ICEs without assuming V as constant is an appropriate approach to study climate change uncertainty. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","China; climate change; global climate model; greenhouse gases emissions scenario; internal climate variability; uncertainty","Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ice; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; China; Global climate model; Greenhouse gases emissions; Internal climate variability; uncertainty; Climate change; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; climate variation; greenhouse gas; precipitation intensity; spatial variation; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057496352

To decrease the sensitivity of the dynamic error for the decoupling control and fulfill various requirements of constraints, such as safety operation, energy conservation, emission reduction, etc., the plant is transmitted through a scheduled steady state region which is achieved from the optimized reference governor in advance.

This approach has the two advantages of admitting random input and output, and allowing the evaluation unit to exceed the front edge under the given probability constraint. Furthermore, by utilizing the meteorological observation data incorporated with the economic and social data for Jiangsu Province, the chance constrained stochastic DEA model was solved to explore the relationship between the meteorological elements and human activities and PM 2.5 pollution. The results are summarized by the following: (1) Among all five primary indexes, social progress, energy use and transportation are the most significant for PM 2.5 pollution. (2) Among our selected 14 secondary indexes, coal consumption, population density and civil car ownership account for a major portion of PM 2.5 pollution. (3) Human activities are the main factor producing PM 2.5 pollution. While some meteorological elements generate PM 2.5 pollution, some act as influencing factors on the migration of PM 2.5 pollution. These findings can provide a reference for the government to formulate appropriate policies to reduce PM 2.5 emissions and for the communities to develop effective strategies to eliminate PM 2.5 pollution. © 2019 by the authors.

Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) is one of the most important afforestation species in Three-North Regions in China. Yet our knowledge on the relationship between height growth and climate for Mongolian pine is limited. Based on survey data for the dominant height of Mongolian pine and climate data from meteorological station, a mixed-effects Chapman-Richards model (including climate factors and random parameters) was used to study the effects of climate factors on the height growth of Mongolian pine in Zhanggutai sandy land, Northeast China. The results showed that precipitation had a delayed effect on the tree height growth. Generally, tree heights increased with increasing mean temperature in May and precipitation from October to April and decreased with increasing precipitation in the previous growing season. The model could effectively predict the dominant height growth of Mongolian pine under varying climate, which could help in further understanding the relationship between climate and height growth of Mongolian pine in semiarid areas of China. © 2019 Zhou et al.

In this study, we adopt a Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) model combined with plant-level data to study the impact of energy policies on water resources management. The results indicate that energy efficiency improvements and industry structure optimization can result in 40% and 33% water withdrawal savings respectively in the future depending on the level of optimization. With several integrated measures, total water use can meet the 2030 targets set by the Jiangsu provincial government. Shifts in cooling technology can bring significant water-savings benefits and help fulfill water use-control targets. Furthermore, we find that the Suzhou and Xuzhou administrative areas will experience power output efficiency reductions and will need more water in 2030 under the RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios.

The performance discrepancy analysis between steady-state and transient operation is completed based on a fairly optimized steady-state baseline. The result shows that during the transient operation, the transient NOx emission can track the steady-state baselines much better than particle matter, and the cumulative NOx in transients is even lower than the cumulative NOx of the steady-state baselines, while the rising particle matter emissions mainly due to appearance in particle matter emission spikes during the cycle. And the transient particle matter spikes appeared almost in two typical transient conditions: sharp acceleration from idling and abrupt load transients. The instantaneous equivalence ratio (Φ) is found to be the main physical factor governing particle matter spikes formation in transients. Particle matter spikes become prominent when Φ cannot track the steady-state baseline well or Φ rises over a critical value of 0.8. The control strategy of intake valve closing timing mechanism-variable geometry turbine-exhaust gas recirculation to bridge the gap of Φ between the steady-state and the transients has been established, which effectively cut down the emission spikes, reducing particle matter emissions by 32.9% with almost no change in NOx. © IMechE 2018.","eliminating particle matter spikes; High density diesel engines; intake valve closing timing mechanism; transient emissions; transient operation; variable compression ratio","Compression ratio (machinery); Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Intake valves; Nitrogen oxides; Superchargers; Timing circuits; Turbines; Intake valve closings; Particle matter; Transient emissions; Transient operation; Variable compression ratio; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042562922

Structures and defect-related photoluminescence of quenched glasses and glass-ceramics were significantly dependent on ZnO content in precursor and post heat treatment time. Nano-sized ZnO crystals could generate in quenched glass before heat treatment with a particular precursor composition (44SiO2-11Al2O3-40ZnO-10K2O, mol%), and this quenched glass emitted strong green emission. For glass-ceramics, short time (5 min) heat treatment was conducive to intensive green or yellow emission depending on the excitation energy. Further extending of heat treatment resulted in yellow emission as the dominant one, together with a decline of intensity due to reduced defects. Moreover, the emission peaks shifted towards longer wavelength, from violet, blue, to green and yellow, with an increase of heat treatment time, which can be ascribed to different defect states along with crystal growth during heat treatment. Green light corresponded to oxygen vacancies (Vo), the main defect of ZnO before heat treatment, whereas yellow light was associated with the transition from zinc interstitials (Zni) to oxygen interstitials (Oi) produced with the structure transformation during heat treatment. Yellow emission can emit with both above- and below-bandgap excitation, and preferentially excited by energy (395 nm, ∼3.14 eV) below the bandgap, near Zni level. Green emission was only efficient under the excitation larger than bandgap. Defect-based mechanisms of visible emissions with different initial states were proposed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Glass-ceramic; Photoluminescence; Visible emission; ZnO nanocrystal","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Defects; Energy gap; Heat treatment; II-VI semiconductors; Nanocrystals; Oxygen vacancies; Photoluminescence; Silicates; Zinc oxide; Glasses and glass ceramics; Heat treatment time; Melt quenching method; Oxygen interstitials; Precursor composition; Structure transformations; Visible emissions; ZnO nanocrystal; Glass ceramics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055512843

A recent wave of studies has emerged examining whether this public investment can achieve its goals. Employing the difference in difference method, this paper examines the medium-term effect of the opening of a completely new subway line on local air pollution in Changsha. Our findings show that carbon monoxide pollution, one key type of automobile pollution in areas close to the subway line experienced a greater reduction relative to areas further away from the stations in the first year after the subway line opened. However, there is no evidence that the opening of the subway line affected particulate matter or ozone pollution.

An accurate emission inventory plays an important role in air pollution control policy making. In this study, we develop a unit-based emission inventory for industrial sectors in the BTH region, including power plants, industrial boilers, steel, non-ferrous metal smelting, coking plants, cement, glass, brick, lime, ceramics, refineries, and chemical industries, based on detailed information for each enterprise, such as location, annual production, production technology/processes, and air pollution control facilities. In the BTH region, the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter with diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), PM2.5, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) from industrial sectors were 869, 1164, 910, 622, 71, 63, and 1390 kt in 2014, respectively, accounting for a respective 61 %, 55 %, 62 %, 56 %, 58 %, 22 %, and 36% of the total emissions. Compared with the traditional proxy-based emission inventory, much less emissions in the high-resolution unit-based inventory are allocated to the urban centers due to the accurate positioning of industrial enterprises. We apply the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ; version 5.0.2) model simulation to evaluate the unit-based inventory. The simulation results show that the unit-based emission inventory shows better performance with respect to both PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants than the proxy-based emission inventory. The normalized mean biases (NMBs) are 81 %, 21 %, 1 %, and -7% for the concentrations of SO2, NO2, ozone (O3), and PM2.5, respectively, with the unit-based inventory, in contrast to 124 %, 39 %, -8 %, and 9% with the proxy-based inventory; furthermore, the concentration gradients of PM2.5, which are defined as the ratio of the urban concentration to the suburban concentration, are 1.6, 2.1, and 1.5 in January and 1.3, 1.5, and 1.3 in July, for simulations with the unit-based inventory, simulations with the proxy-based inventory, and observations, respectively, in Beijing. For O3, the corresponding gradients are 0.7, 0.5, and 0.9 in January and 0.9, 0.8, and 1.1 in July, implying that the unit-based emission inventory better reproduces the distributions of pollutant emissions between the urban and suburban areas. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; industrial emission; metropolitan area; modeling; particulate matter; policy making; pollution control; pollution policy; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063208674

The results of the correlational experiments show that the reduction of carbon dioxide by the activated nanosized alkaline-earth metal hydrides is highly selective and efficient in the absence of a catalyst under moderate conditions. Only a hydrocarbon species, namely methane, is produced, and the methane yield can reach 88% for the reactions between CaH 2 and carbon dioxide.

However, a global influence of PM2.5-induced metabolic and proteomic disorders remains confusing, and the underlying mechanism is still under-explored. Herein, LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics, lipidomics and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteomics were applied to analyze the toxicological characteristics of PM2.5 from Taiyuan City in China (Taiyuan-PM2.5) on human lung carcinoma cells (A549) after the 24-h treatment. Metabolites, lipids and proteins that have distinctive differences were screened by SIEVE, LipidSearch and Proteome Discoverer, respectively. The abundance of 56 metabolites (40 increased and 16 decreased), 22 lipids (19 increased and 3 decreased) and 81 proteins (55 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated) were significantly changed upon the PM2.5 treatment. Among the proteomics analysis, 16 proteins were specifically related to RNA splicing, mainly including up-regulated serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), SRSF2, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70 kDa (snRNP70), small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide B (SNRPB), SNRPC, SNRPE and down-regulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 2 (hnRNP UL2). At the metabolic level, PM2.5 exposure significantly altered the sphingolipid metabolism, including ceramide, serine, sphingosine and sphingomyelin. It was proposed that excessive accumulation of ceramide and expression of key enzymes (ceramide synthases, phingomyelinase, sphingosine kinase types 2 and protein phosphatase-1) induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, generation of lipotoxicity and alterations of RNA splicing in PM2.5-treated A549 cells. In general, our results demonstrated that ceramide accumulation and altered RNA splicing could becritical contributors to PM2.5-induced cytotoxicity at metabolic and proteomic level, which might be considered as potential markers for toxicological evaluation of PM2.5 samples.

We hypothesized that with additions from labile to recalcitrant carbon substrates, the soil priming effects changed from positive to negative. Materials and methods: Representing from labile to recalcitrant carbon substrates, glucose, oxalic acid, and tannin were added to soil, respectively. Physicochemical properties of soil, carbon dioxide emission rate, soil organic carbon in the labile and recalcitrant carbon pools, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and microbial community diversity and structure were measured in different treatments. Results and discussion: Results showed that the addition of glucose and tannin produced positive priming effects, while the addition of oxalic acid led to a negative priming effect. The addition of glucose and tannin significantly increased the MBC. The addition of glucose significantly promoted the carbon decomposition in both the labile and recalcitrant soil carbon pools. The addition of tannin greatly promoted carbon decomposition in the labile carbon pool and slightly decreased carbon decomposition in the recalcitrant carbon pool of the soil. However, the addition of oxalic acid reduced the MBC and resulted in insignificant changes of the different soil carbon pools. The addition of organic carbon substrates reduced the soil microbial community diversity, especially the addition of glucose. The different priming effects of the treatments with glucose and tannin were attributable to the different phases in the succession of SOM decomposition processes. The treatment with oxalic acid reduced the soil pH, resulting in inactive microbial growth and reproduction. Conclusions: The addition of both glucose (labile carbon) and tannin (recalcitrant carbon) produced positive priming effects.

The potential biological mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study examined the effects of mitigated ambient pollution on hospital admissions and inflammatory biomarker levels in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) COPD patients. Daily hospital admissions were compared over 51 days associated with the Asian Games period (Nov 1-Dec 21, 2010) with the identical calendar dates of baseline years (2004–2009 and 2011–2013). A three-year cohort study was conducted with 36 COPD patient participants. The daily particulate matter (PM 10 ) decreased from 65.86 μg/m 3 during the baseline period to 62.63 μg/m 3 during the Asian Games period; the daily NO 2 level decreased from 51.33 μg/m 3 to 42.63 μg/m 3 . Between the baseline period and the Asian Games, daily hospital admissions from non-accidental diseases decreased from 116 to 93, respectively; respiratory diseases decreased from 20 to 17, respectively; and cardiovascular diseases decreased from 11 to 9 during the Asian Games period, respectively. No statistically significant reductions were seen in the remaining months of 2010 in Guangzhou, during the the Asian Games period in the control city, and two other control diseases. Furthermore, we identified significant improvement in CRP and fibrinogen by -20.4% and -15.4% from a pre-Asian game period to a during-Asian game period, respectively. For CRP, we found significant increases in NO 2 at lag1-3 days after-Asian game period and significant increases in PM 10 at lag1-2 days. Similar effects were also seen with fibrinogen. This discovery provides support for efforts to diminish air pollution and improve public health through human air pollutants intervention. Improved air pollution during the 2010 Asian games was correlated with decreases in biomarkers associated with systemic inflammation in COPD patient participants. © 2019 Zhang et al.

This study aims to quantify the contribution of altered sowing time windows to reduce climate risk for the production of oats (Avena sativa), a crop that is well adapted to short growing seasons and low rainfall. The APSIM-Oats model was calibrated and validated for phenology, above-ground dry matter and yield using data from field experiments with five sowing dates, conducted from 2009 to 2013 in Inner Mongolia, China. The model was used to determine yield trends and yield-limiting factors under rain-fed conditions using historical weather data. Changes in temperature had greater impact on crop production than changes in rainfall and the simulations indicated the importance of changed sowing windows to lengthen the growth duration and optimize water use. Delayed sowing of oats, 10 days later than current practice, ensured more secure temperature and rainfall conditions from emergence to flowering and substantially increased yields and decreased climate risk. Delayed sowing also reduced climate risk under two future climate scenarios, RCP4.5 (stabilize growth) and RCP8.5 (high greenhouse gas emission). We conclude that adaptation of sowing time of oats provides a practical strategy for enhancing yield and mitigating climate risk under climate change. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM-Oats; Climate change; Cumulative probability; Optimal sowing time window; Water limited potential yield; Yield gap","agricultural ecosystem; climate change; crop improvement; crop production; crop yield; dry matter; emergence; environmental risk; grass; growing season; growth; rainfall; rainfed agriculture; semiarid region; sowing date; temperature; temperature effect; water use efficiency; China; Nei Monggol; Avena; Avena sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059397325

Predictions of changes in the requirements for irrigation water in food crop production under climate change may provide scientific support for the optimum allocation of water resources and measures to mitigate climate change. We conducted a spatial grid-based analysis using projections of future climate generated by a bias-correction and spatial disaggregation multi-model ensemble for three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) adopted by the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We investigated the effects of climate change associated with increasing temperature, changed precipitation and increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on the irrigation water requirements of maize, rice, wheat and soybean in China at the end of the 21st century (2081–2100). Our results indicate that the irrigation water requirements of maize and wheat are driven by temperature and especially by CO2 concentrations in the northwest interior area as a result of the low rainfall and high rates of evaporation; the irrigation water requirement of soybean is influenced by a combined effect of temperature, precipitation and CO2 concentration, whereas the irrigation water requirement for rice is dominated by precipitation alone in the southern coastal region, which has high rainfall. The irrigation water requirements of crops decrease mainly as a result of the beneficial effects of CO2 on plant growth in China. The regions requiring vast amounts of irrigation water as a result of climate change are mainly concentrated in northwestern China. The effects of climate change affect the requirement for irrigation water, especially under high-emission scenarios, and should be studied further to design appropriate adaptation strategies for the management of agricultural water to maintain the sustainable development of agriculture. © 2018","Atmospheric CO2 concentrations; China; Crop irrigation water requirements; Representative concentration pathways","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Food supply; Irrigation; Planning; Rain; Water; Water resources; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide concentrations; China; CO2 concentration; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Future climate scenarios; Irrigation water requirements; Representative concentration pathways; Climate change; carbon dioxide; rain; water; carbon dioxide; rain; snow; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate prediction; concentration (composition); crop production; irrigation; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; water use; Article; climate change; concentration (parameters); evaporation; food security; irrigation (agriculture); maize; plant growth; precipitation; priority journal; rice; soybean; temperature; water supply; wheat; catering service; China; crop; growth, development and aging; irrigation (agriculture); Oryza; physiology; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; China; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agricultural Irrigation; Carbon Dioxide; China; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Food Supply; Models, Theoretical; Oryza; Rain; Snow; Soybeans; Temperature; Triticum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057463504

Two phases of intensive campaigns were conducted during February–April and June–July of 2017 at a rural coastal site and in open oil fields of the Yellow River Delta region, northern China. C1–C5 alkyl nitrates showed higher concentration levels in summer than in winter-spring (p &lt; 0.01), whilst their parent hydrocarbons showed an opposite seasonal variation pattern. The C3–C5 RONO2 levels in the oil fields were significantly higher than those in the ambient rural air. Alkyl nitrates showed well-defined diurnal variations, elucidating the effects of in-situ photochemical production and regional transport of aged polluted plumes. Backward trajectory analysis and fire maps revealed the significant contribution of biomass burning to the observed alkyl nitrates and hydrocarbons. A simplified sequential reaction model and an observation-based chemical box model were deployed to diagnose the formation mechanisms of C1–C5 RONO2. The C3–C5 RONO2 were mainly produced from the photochemical oxidation of their parent hydrocarbons (i.e., C3–C5 alkanes), whilst C1–C2 RONO2 compounds have additional sources. In addition to parent hydrocarbons, longer alkanes with &gt;4 carbon atoms were also important precursors of alkyl nitrates in the oil fields. This study demonstrates the significant effects of oil field emissions and biomass burning on the volatile organic compounds and alkyl nitrate formation, and provides scientific support for the formulation of control strategies against photochemical air pollution in the Yellow River Delta region. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alkyl nitrate; Biomass burning; Observation-based model; Oil field; Sequential reaction model; Yellow River Delta","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Biomass; Field emission; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Oil fields; Paraffins; Rivers; Volatile organic compounds; Alkyl nitrates; Biomass-burning; Observation-based model; Sequential reaction; Yellow River delta; River pollution; c1 alkyl nitrate; c2 alkyl nitrate; c3 alkyl nitrate; c4 alkyl nitrate; c5 alkyl nitrate; hydrocarbon; nitric acid derivative; organic compound; unclassified drug; atmospheric modeling; biomass burning; hydrocarbon; nitrate; oil field; rural area; temporal variation; ambient air; Article; biomass; chemical model; China; concentration (parameters); environmental impact; field emission; fire; oil field; photochemistry; photooxidation; plume; pollution transport; priority journal; river ecosystem; seashore; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; winter; China; Shandong; Yellow River Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057334583

This study aimed to establish a coupling relationship between installed capacity versus energy consumption and pollutant emissions, namely the installed efficiency, and to further provide ideas and methods for the control of regional air pollutants and installation planning. An inventory of 338 installed thermal power units in the Jing-Jin-Ji Region in 2013 was established as a case study, and comparisons were made by clustering classification based on the installed efficiencies of energy consumption and pollutant emissions. The results show that the thermal power units were divided into five classes by their installed capacity: 0–50, 50–200, 200–350, 350–600, and 600+ MW. Under the energy conservation and emissions reduction scenario, with the total installed capacity and the power generation generally kept constant, the coal consumption was reduced by 17.1 million tons (8.7%), and the total emissions were reduced by 79.8% (SO 2 ), 84.9% (NO x ), 60.9% (PM), and 59.5% (PM 2.5 ). © 2019 by the authors.

It is found that the combination state between Si 3 N 4 hollow microsphere and ceramic matrix is enhanced due to its superiority on the coagulation mechanism. This novel colloidal forming method efficiently contributes to the close contact between hollow microspheres and ceramic particles, leading to the improvement of interface strength between the pore-former and ceramic matrix. More importantly, it is proved that ceramic hollow microspheres could well perform as both pore-former and toughening phase. The porosity regulation of porous ceramics is realized by tailoring ludox and carbon amount through carbothermal reduction method. This method turns out to regulate the performance of porous ceramics better especially through the sintering parameters.

Inspired by the preparation of the traditional green Tofu, we report a general protocol to fabricate biomass carbon aerogel based on extraction of cellulose from the plant leaves, freeze-drying and carbonization of cellulose. In this strategy, the plant leaves-derived celluloses were extracted from premna microphylla (PM) leaves and sisal leaves via alkalization and bleaching processes. Then, the superhydrophobic hierarchical porous carbon-X aerogel (SHPC-X aerogel) with ultralow density and excellent elastic properties were observed by carbonizing the freeze-dried celluloses. The incorporation of plant cellulose into aerogel could not only improve the specific surface areas and morphologies, but also enhance hydrophobic properties and mechanical properties of materials. When the sisal cellulose content of 200% (sisal: PM cellulose mass ratio), the SHPC-200 aerogel exhibited robust superhydrophobicity (WCA = 158°) and large specific surface areas (475.68 m 2 g −1 ). In addition, the as-prepared SHPC-200 aerogel exhibited high absorption capacity (77.7–147.3 g g −1 ) for different oils and organic solvents and excellent oil recoverability, high durability, and regenerability during oil/water separation for 10 cycles. This study provides an effective strategy for fabrication of biomass carbon aerogel by using PM leaves as raw material that can be extended for the fabrication of other biomass aerogels for application in chemical separation, environmental remediation and energy storage. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Biomass cellulose; Carbon aerogel; Freez-drying; Green Tofu gel; Oil absorption; Premna microphylla leaves; Superhydrophobicity","Biomass; Carbon; Carbonization; Cellulose; Hydrophobicity; Mechanical properties; Oils and fats; Plants (botany); Porous materials; Specific surface area; Biomass cellulose; Carbon aerogels; Oil absorption; Premna microphylla leaves; Superhydrophobicity; Aerogels; Biomass; Carbonization; Cellulose; Mechanical Properties; Water Repellence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059444294

The HTP has direct impacts on the establishment and maintenance of Asian monsoon, and therefore on the climate of its surrounding areas. Besides, soil moisture plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle and is a critical link between land surface and atmosphere. Hence, soil moisture was greatly emphasized by Global Climate Observing System Programme as an Essential Climate Variable. However, little is known about soil moisture changes on the HTP from a long-term perspective. By comparing remotely sensed and modelled soil moisture datasets against in-situ observations from 100 observation stations, here we find that Noah performed better than other soil moisture datasets. In past years, soil moisture first decreased and then increased obviously. In most regions on HTP, precipitation changes can be taken as the major cause behind soil moisture variations. In future, there is persistently decreasing soil moisture trend since ~2010 with a decreasing rate of −0.044 kg/m2/10a, −0.031 kg/m2/10a and −0.0p 88 kg/m2/10a under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, in CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparision Project Phase 5). Specifically, a sudden decrease of soil moisture with a rate of −0.372 kg/m2/10a can be expected after ~2080 under RCP8.5 scenario. Amplifying terrestrial aridity due to increasing precipitation but more significant increasing potential evapotranspiration potentially results in drying HTP. Potential water deficiency for Asian rivers due to drying HTP should arouse considerable concerns. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CMIP5 data; Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau; Historical observations; Soil moisture","Climate models; Drying; Soil moisture; Water resources; Water towers; CMIP5 data; Global climate observing systems; Historical observation; Long-term perspective; Potential evapotranspiration; Precipitation change; Surface soil moisture; Tibetan Plateau; Soil surveys; CMIP; estimation method; evapotranspiration; future prospect; observational method; precipitation (climatology); soil moisture; trend analysis; Article; controlled study; environment; evapotranspiration; Himalayan Tibetan plateau; historical research; precipitation; priority journal; remote sensing; soil moisture; surface soil; China; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058947982

However, the generation of electricity, and especially coal power generation, is an important source of greenhouse gases. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the potential of carbon emission reduction of urban rail transit based on specific electricity consumption structures. In this study, 18 cities in China were taken as the research object, and backward analysis was used to analyze the proportion limit of coal power consumption for rail transit in each city under three scenarios from 2015 to 2017. By comparing the limit value with the actual coal power consumed by urban rail transit, we analyzed the potential carbon emission reduction of rail transit relative to other traffic modes. The study results supported several conclusions. First, the traffic demand is in direct proportion to the carbon emission reduction potential in rail transit. Second, for cities with high coal power consumption, the development of ground bus transit is more conducive to achieving carbon reduction targets compared with rail transit. Finally, promoting the development of rail transit technology and lowering the energy consumption per capita unit travel distance are the fundamental ways to increase the emission reduction potential of rail transit. Therefore, as a modern transportation tool, rail transit is not an absolute emission reduction advantage for all cities. A city needs to analyze its own resource structure and travel demand together, set up suitable traffic modes to realize green growth and sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Backward analysis; Carbon reduction potential; Coal power proportion limit; Electricity consumption structure; Rail transit","Carbon; Coal; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Backward analysis; Carbon reduction potentials; Coal power; Electricity-consumption; Rail transit; Light rail transit; carbon; coal; diesel fuel; fossil fuel; gasoline; kerosene; natural gas; carbon emission; coal; electricity generation; emission control; energy use; railway transport; urban area; Article; carbon footprint; China; coal power; electricity; electricity consumption; energy consumption; fuel consumption; gas turbine power; human; hydropower; mathematical model; rail transit; traffic and transport; urban area; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057321657

First, an analytical equation of state is modified to calculate the nanoscale phase behaviour by considering the effects of pore radius and molecule–molecule interactions. Second, a new empirical correlation for calculating the adsorption thickness in nanopores is initially developed. The modified equation of state coupled with the new adsorption thickness correlation and fracture geometry equation is used to calculate the phase behaviour of confined pure and mixing CO2 streams in fractured nanopores with adsorptions. Third, the pressure–volume diagrams, pressure–temperature diagrams, and critical properties of 12 pure substances of CO2, N2, and alkanes of C1–10 and 12 binary and ternary CO2-dominated mixtures are studied. The calculated pressures for all cases in nanopores with and without the adsorptions and fractures are reduced with the system volume increases but increased by increasing the system temperature with constant compositions. The pressures in nanopores are always larger than those in bulk phase at small volumes but in good agreement at large volumes. In comparison with the N2 or C1–10, the pure CO2 is more easily transited to be a liquid or supercritical phase. Any additions of contaminations (e.g., N2 or C1–10) into the pure CO2 increase the pressures in the pressure–volume or temperature diagram while decrease the critical properties to different extent, especially in nanopores, wherein the N2 exerts the strongest effect and the effects of the alkanes are weakened with the carbon number increase. Overall, three optimum strategies are determined for CO2 storage projects in the deep tight/shale formations as follows: large pore radii, purified CO2 streams, and low temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical equation of state; CO2 storage; Fractured nanopores with adsorptions; Implications and strategies; Thermodynamic phase behaviour","Binary mixtures; Equations of state; Fracture; Molecules; Nanopores; Paraffins; Temperature; Analytical equations; CO2 storage; Constant composition; Empirical correlations; Fracture geometries; Implications and strategies; Molecule interactions; Supercritical phase; Carbon dioxide; absorption; adsorption; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; ephemeral stream; equation of state; fracture geometry; temperature effect; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060494944

Pearson correlation analysis is conducted on the concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), sulphate, sulfide and that of CH4 in wastewater.

However, the annual methane (CH4) emissions from alpine fens degraded due to drainage for grazing have not been well characterized due to a lack of year-round observations. In this study, the year-round CH4 fluxes from a degraded alpine fen that is typical in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were measured. The temperature sensitivity of the CH4 emissions during the nongrowing season (NGS) was different between the microsites with and without CH4 uptake during the growing season (GS), showing apparent activation energy of 59–61 vs. 22–43 kJ mol−1 (or variation folds induced by the 10-degree change (i.e., Q10): 2.61–2.74 vs. 1.38–1.91). The CH4 emissions amounted to 0.2–63.3 kg C ha−1 yr−1 (with −0.8 to 41.4 kg C ha−1 and 0.9 to 21.9 kg C ha−1 in the GS and NGS, respectively), which were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) related to the distances to the drainage ditch or water tables across the six microsites. As a key factor, the water table determined the role of the CH4 emissions during freezing/thawing. For cool/cold/alpine wetlands with no CH4 uptake in the GS, a mean factor of 1.52 (within a range of 1.00–2.44 at the 95% confidence interval), corresponding to an NGS contribution of 34% (ranging from 0 to 59%), was recommended to upscale the GS emissions to annual totals. Degradation of the native peat marshes in the Zoige region (originally the largest area of alpine wetlands) due to intentional drainage has greatly reduced the quantities of CH4 emissions. Additional studies are still needed to minimize the large uncertainties in CH4 emissions estimates for the changes in alpine wetlands in this region and for the entire TP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine peatlands; Annual flux multiplier; Methane; Nongrowing season; Tibetan Plateau; Wetland drainage","Activation energy; Groundwater; Methane; Uncertainty analysis; Annual flux; Nongrowing season; Peat land; Tibetan Plateau; Wetland drainage; Wetlands; methane; methane; activation energy; alpine environment; atmospheric chemistry; drainage; fen; methane; peatland; wetland; air and air related phenomena; air temperature; Article; controlled study; degradation kinetics; environmental factor; freeze thawing; land drainage; methane emission; precipitation; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil moisture; soil temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature sensitivity; water table; wetland; analysis; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; pollutant; temperature; Tibet; wetland; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Animalia; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Temperature; Tibet; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058386592

Consumption of 10% (v/v) ethanol by inbred C57BL/6J female mice from 0.5 to 8.5 days post coitum was used to model alcohol exposure during the first 3–4 weeks of gestation in humans, when pregnancy is not typically recognized. At adolescence (postnatal day [P] 28) and adulthood (P64), the brains of male offspring were scanned ex vivo using ultra-high field (16.4 T) magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Energy metabolism and body composition were measured in adulthood by indirect calorimetry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), respectively. Ethanol exposure had no substantial impact on white matter organization in the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, internal capsule, optic tract, or thalamus. Whole brain volume and the volumes of the neocortex, cerebellum, and caudate putamen were also unaffected. Subtle, but non-significant, effects were observed on the hippocampus and the hypothalamus in adult ethanol-exposed male offspring. Ethanol exposure was additionally associated with a trend toward decreased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and reduced daily energy expenditure, as well as significantly increased adiposity, albeit with normal body weight and food intake, in adult male offspring. In summary, ethanol exposure restricted to early gestation had subtle long-term effects on the structure of specific brain regions in male offspring. The sensitivity of the hippocampus to ethanol-induced damage is reminiscent of that reported by other studies – despite differences in the level, timing, and duration of exposure – and likely contributes to the cognitive impairment that characteristically results from prenatal ethanol exposure. The hypothalamus plays an important role in regulating metabolism and energy homeostasis. Our finding of altered daily energy expenditure and adiposity in adult ethanol-exposed males is consistent with the idea that central nervous system abnormalities also underpin some of the metabolic phenotypes associated with ethanol exposure in pregnancy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Alcohol; Body composition; Brain structure; Energy metabolism; Prenatal","alcohol; carbon dioxide; alcohol; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; anterior commissure; Article; body composition; body weight; brain; brain size; capsula interna; controlled study; corpus callosum; dorsal striatum; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; energy expenditure; energy homeostasis; energy metabolism; female; food intake; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampal CA2 region; hippocampal CA3 region; homeostasis; indirect calorimetry; male; mouse; neocortex; nonhuman; obesity; optic tract; oxygen consumption; prenatal exposure; thalamus; trend study; age; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; energy metabolism; fetal alcohol syndrome; metabolism; obesity; physiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Adiposity; Age Factors; Animals; Brain; Energy Metabolism; Ethanol; Female; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054590865

In order to enhance coalbed methane production and greenhouse gases sequestration, adsorption phase should be understood deeply, and it is the most basic and the most important. Experimental measurements performed in this work on three samples from Kaiping Basin using carbon dioxide. Basing on Gibbs adsorption model, the steady-state swelling model is developed, which also assume that the change of the coal surface free energy induced by adsorption is equal to the change of energy caused by adsorption deformation. The mass balance equation of gas in porous media is combined with the steady-state swelling model. The dynamic variation of porosity and internal gas pressure of coal are integrated into the transient swelling model. The steady-state model and transient model are applied to describe the experimental volumetric strain. The results show good agreement between the models and the experimental strain data. The coal pore tests with different probe scales are also used to investigate the true pore size distribution and porosity, which provide more accurate parameter values. According to the transient swelling model, the effects of porosity on adsorption-induced swelling are further analyzed. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Free energy; Gas adsorption; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Pore size; Porous materials; Coalbed methane production; Dynamic variations; Effect of adsorptions; Experimental strains; Internal gas pressure; Mass balance equations; Steady-state modeling; Volumetric strain; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063047361

Here, we improved the Jayaweera-Mikkelsen (JM) model through multiplying the concentration of aqueous NH 3 in ponded water by an activity coefficient that was determined based on high-frequency flux observations at Jingzhou station in Central China. We found that the improved JM model could reproduce the dynamics of observed NH 3 flux (R 2 = 0.83, n = 228, P &lt; 0.001), while the original JM model without the consideration of activity of aqueous NH 3 overstated NH 3 flux by 54% during the periods of fertilization and pesticide application. The validity of the improved JM model was supported by a mass-balance-based indirect estimate at Jingzhou station and the independent flux observations from the other five stations across China. The NH 3 volatilization losses that were further simulated by the improved JM model forced by actual wind speed were in general a half less than previous chamber-based estimates at six stations. Difference in wind speed between the inside and outside of the chamber and insufficient sampling frequency were identified as the primary and secondary causes for the overestimation in chamber-based estimations, respectively. Together, our findings suggest that an in-depth understanding of NH 3 transfer process and its robust representation in models are critical for developing regional emission inventories and practical mitigation strategies of NH 3 . © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic chamber; Improved Jayaweera-Mikkelsen model; Model simulation; NH 3; Paddy field","ammonia; concentration (composition); emission inventory; flux chamber; paddy field; pesticide application; rice; simulation; wind velocity; ammonia; fertilizer; agriculture; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; Oryza; procedures; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; volatilization; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ammonia; China; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Models, Statistical; Oryza; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061029396

How to adapt to future climate change is one of the biggest concerns in the city’s built and natural systems. It thus requires a comprehensive understanding of possible changes in the local climate of Ottawa, which can hardly be reflected in the coarse outputs of Global Climate Models (GCMs). Therefore, a stepwise clustered downscaling (SCD) model is employed in this study to help investigate the plausible changes in daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures in Ottawa. Outputs from multiple GCMs under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are used as inputs to drive the SCD model in order to develop downscaled climate projections. The performance of SCD model is evaluated by comparing the model simulations to the observations (R 2  &gt; 0.87) over the historical periods. Future temperature projections and their likely temporal trends throughout this century are analyzed in detail to explore the regional variations of global warming in Ottawa, thus to provide scientific basis for developing appropriate adaptation strategies at different management levels. The results suggest that the City of Ottawa is likely to expect significant increasing trends in temperatures (i.e., 0.18–0.38 °C per decade in maximum temperature, 0.16–0.31 °C per decade in minimum temperature, and 0.17–0.34 °C per decade in mean temperature under RCP4.5; 0.46–0.54 °C per decade in maximum temperature, 0.37–0.45 °C per decade in minimum temperature, and 0.42–0.50 °C per decade in mean temperature under RCP8.5) throughout this century. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Impact studies; Multiple GCMs; Ottawa; Stepwise clustered downscaling; Temperature","climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; future prospect; global climate; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature anomaly; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Ottawa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049570888

Application of this strategy in hot climates is scarce, and the majority of published work has been conducted in moderate and continental climates. Therefore, in the present work, a modular PCM-air heat exchanger appropriate for buildings application in hot-arid regions has been investigated, utilising commercial paraffin-based RT28HC PCM modules. The thermal performance of the proposed system has been investigated under various operating conditions for different PCM modules arrangements. The results confirmed that a compact TES unit with narrow air flow channels has a better thermal performance, resulting in 10–14% reduction in the charging time, whilst this has a negligible impact on the comfort time during the discharging period. The results have shown that the proposed system is capable of operating satisfactorily under hot-arid climate conditions, and substantial energy savings are achievable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Free cooling; Hot-arid; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Arid regions; Charging time; Energy conservation; Heat storage; Phase change materials; Thermal energy; Cooling of buildings; Discharging periods; Free cooling; Hot arid; Latent thermal energy storages; Operating condition; Sustainable strategies; Thermal Performance; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060681583

Numerous authors have calculated potential GHGE reductions in case such a tax was implemented in certain countries or regions. They did however assume a reduced production of GHGE-intense foods equal to the decline in demand induced by the tax. This omits however possible increases of net-exports that might offset such a demand reduction. Herein, the market dynamic behind this so-called “emission leakage” is explained and its effect quantified for a greenhouse gas tax in the European Union. We use the European Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model for the quantitative analysis and simulate a greenhouse gas tax on all food products, based on their individual emission levels. The partial equilibrium model covers all world regions and hence the tax's effects on international trade of agricultural commodities can be examined. It was found that 43% of the greenhouse gas reduction indicted by a domestic consumption reduction is lost through emission leakage. This already includes the mitigating effects of a production shift from inefficient to efficient producers that is another consequence of increased exports from the European Union. A greenhouse gas emission tax on food products is hence much less efficient than previously proposed, if it is not introduced globally or trade is not restricted. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Emission mitigation; Emission policy; Livestock; Meat; Trade","Agriculture; Carbon; Commerce; Food products; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Meats; Taxation; Agricultural commodities; Agricultural emissions; Domestic consumption; Emission mitigation; Greenhouse gas reductions; Livestock; Optimization modeling; Partial equilibrium model; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059590731

We thoroughly analyzed the stability of differently oxygen covered terminations starting from ΘO = 0.86 nm−2 (isolated monoatomic species) up to ΘO = 5.21 nm−2 (full oxygen monolayer). The constructed 3-dimensional thermodynamic (γ T, pO2) surface redox state diagram revealed that in typical catalytic pressures of O2 (pO2/p° ∼ 0.01– 1) three principal states of the spinel surface, including a region associated with the presence of μ-superoxo CoO3c–O2–CoT3c and metal-oxo CoO3c-O species (T &lt; 450– 500 °C), a bare surface region (450– 500 °C to 550–600 °C), and a region were surface oxygen vacancies appear (T &gt; 600 °C) may be distinguished. This diagram was used for quantitative assignment of the experimental TPD-O2 desorption peaks, and also, for interpretation of the role that various adoxygen and lattice oxygen species play in the investigated model catalytic reactions. It was shown that CO is primarily oxidized by the suprafacial CoO3c-O2-CoT3c diatomic oxygen and/or cobalt-oxo CoO3c-O species, whereas in low temperature activation of CH4 only the CoO3c-O adducts are involved. With the increasing temperature, the suprafacial methane oxidation route gradually changes into the interfacial Mars van Krevelen scheme, and the later pathway is accelerated above 600 °C, due to the onset of oxygen vacancy formation (in line with 18O2/Co316O4 isotopic exchange experiments). In the case of N2O decomposition the reaction occurs preferably on a bare surface, and the favorable thermodynamics provides a steady driving force for efficient removal of the recombined adoxygen intermediates in the form of gaseous O2. The phase diagram of the alterable surface oxygen states on the (1 1 1) termination was compared to the corresponding diagram for the (1 0 0) facet, to explain the nature and differences in catalytic redox behavior of the cobalt spinel nano-octahedra and nano-cubes. This allows also for prediction of oxygen speciation anisotropy on cubo-octahedral nanocrystals at various temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","(1 1 1) facet; Carbon monoxide oxidation; Co3O4; First principles thermodynamics; Isotopic exchange; Methane combustion; Nitrous oxide decomposition; Reactive oxygen species; Redox state","Calculations; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Catalytic oxidation; Cobalt; Isotopes; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Reaction intermediates; Reactive oxygen species; Temperature; Carbon monoxide oxidation; Co3O4; First principles; Isotopic exchange; Methane combustion; Nitrous oxide decomposition; Redox state; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061457550

Carbon is generally diffused to α-Fe matrix to improve some of its mechanical properties. The presence of carbon may alter the irradiation response of the steel. In the current study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the influence of carbon (∼in either dispersed form or carbon-rich region as chain) in the primary damage states of α-Fe low carbon steels. It is found that carbons in dispersed form have no significant effect on the self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) in α-Fe. While, carbon-rich (C-rich as pseudo-precipitation) region clearly increased the number of SIAs in bulk. A simple power formula was proposed to estimate the number of defects as a function of primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy and the number of atoms in the C-rich region. Cluster analyses of the defects formed in α-Fe containing 0–0.1 at.% dispersed carbon and with a C-rich region (with carbon chain of 0–100 atoms positioned in octahedral positions) showed that the presence of carbon in dispersed form had no effect on the average number of defect clusters (both the SIAs and the vacancies) in α-Fe containing 0–0.1 at.%. On the other hand, the average number of defect clusters for the α-Fe containing C-rich region apparently increases with increasing the number of carbon atoms in carbon chain. In addition, the average number of the interstitial clusters was significantly higher than that of the vacancy clusters. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","C-rich region; Frenkel pairs; LAMMPS; Molecular dynamic; Pseudo-precipitation; Radiation damage; α-Fe low carbon steel","Atoms; Cluster analysis; Irradiation; Mechanical properties; Molecular dynamics; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Pressure vessels; Radiation damage; Atomistic simulations; Frenkel pairs; LAMMPS; Molecular dynamics simulations; Number of carbon atoms; Primary knock-on atoms; Reactor Pressure Vessel; Self-interstitial atoms; Low carbon steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061048123

These organisms are active in the cycling of nutrients, since they fragment the organic matter hereby accelerating microbial decomposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the invertebrate community in no-tillage, conventional tillage, minimum tillage and secondary forest in regeneration to determine the relationship of mesofauna to litter, soil attributes, management and seasonality. Therefore, ten soil samples in each system and eight litter samples in no-tillage and the forest were taken over four seasons. These samples remained in Berlese extractors for seven days for quantification and identification of mesofauna. For each fauna sample, soil samples were collected for chemical analysis. Next, diversity indices and richness were calculated and multivariate analyses were used to establish relationships between the mesofauna, soil attributes and management. In the soil, mites were more abundant in the agricultural systems than in the forest, but the springtails, sensitive to low moisture and high temperature, were more abundant in the forest. Diversity and richness were higher in soil from the forest than under other systems. In no-tillage, there was a lower density of soil mesofauna, however, under this system, many invertebrates live in litter, since litter is the main food resource for them. In forest litter, we found lower invertebrate density and higher diversity than in no-tillage. Carbon, basic cations, pH, Al and V% were the attributes that best explained fauna variability in the systems. © 2019, Scientia Agricola.

The following unique features are obtained. (1) The mean temperature structure shows similar characteristics to an earlier report based on a smaller dataset. (2) Temperature inversion layers (TILs) occur at 94-96 km in spring, at ∼ 92 km in summer, and at ∼ 91 km in early autumn. (3) The first complete range-resolved climatology of GWPE derived from temperature data in the tropical MLT exhibits an altitude-dependent combination of annual oscillation (AO) and semiannual oscillation (SAO). The maximum occurs in spring and the minimum in summer, and a second maximum is in autumn and a second minimum in winter. (4) The GWPE per unit volume reduces below ∼ 97 km altitude in all seasons. The reduction of GWPE is significant at and below the TILs but becomes faint above; this provides strong support for the mechanism that the formation of upper mesospheric TILs is mainly due to the reduction of GWPE. The climatology of GWPE shows an indeed pronounced altitudinal and temporal correlation with the wind field in the tropical mesopause region published in the literature. This suggests the GW activity in the tropical mesopause region should be manifested mainly by the filtering effect of the critical level of the local background wind and the energy conversion due to local dynamical instability. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Doppler lidar; gravity wave; mesopause; potential energy; seasonal variation; temperature profile; Arecibo; Puerto Rico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062838848

As a kind of environmental behavior, ECB of residents is a complicated process. In this paper, ECB is divided into four types, considering habit adjustment, quality threshold, efficiency investment, and interpersonal facilitation. A comprehensive conceptual framework is built, adding perception about energy conservation results (PER) and contextual factors from a new perspective. Based on a survey in Jiangsu province of China, this paper examines the impact of intention on behavior under the moderation of contextual factors, as well as the effect of perception of energy-conservation results on intention and ECB by means of multivariate statistical analysis. The results show that the intention of energy conservation is the determinant of behavior, but it does not well transform into behavior, especially into quality threshold and interpersonal facilitation behavior. Different contextual factors have positive effects on the relationship of intention and different behavior. However, modulating effects of contextual factors as amplifiers do not function effectively due to their low rating scores. PER has a positive impact on intention but not on all types of ECB. Finally, this paper presents important implications for policy makers to optimize energy conservation policy. © 2019 by the authors.

First, the electric grid is integrating variable renewable generation, such as wind and solar. Second, demands are changing as heating systems are shifting from gas-based to high efficiency electric heat pumps. This paper provides a comparative analysis of future energy scenarios with distributed technology options including (1) wind and solar generation; (2) heat pumps for heating and cooling; and (3) battery and thermal storage in representative residential blocks in four cities, including New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Tallahassee, Florida; and Fort Collins, Colorado. These cities are located in three climate regions with different weather patterns which result in different demand profiles and different local renewable resources. Future energy demand scenarios with 100% penetration of air source or ground source heat pumps for heating and cooling are estimated for the four residential city blocks. Under a future scenario with all electric demand with air source heat pumps and high renewable energy penetration, this study finds that (1) the optimal wind and solar generation mix varies with location and amount of storage and (2) battery storage is more cost effective than thermal storage, ground source heat pumps, and overbuilt renewable generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed technology; Heat pump; Residential; Solar; Storage; Wind","Cost effectiveness; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Gas emissions; Geothermal heat pumps; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Housing; Pumps; Solar power generation; Thermal management (electronics); Wind; Comparative analysis; Distributed technologies; Heat pumps; New York City ,New York; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable generation; Residential; Solar; Air source heat pumps; alternative energy; climate change; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy resource; energy storage; environmental technology; future prospect; pump; residential location; scenario analysis; solar power; wind power; Colorado; Florida [United States]; Fort Collins; Minneapolis; Minnesota; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; Tallahassee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059519541

PAH concentrations decrease with increasing latitude in the order of Pallas > Zeppelin > Alert. Forest fire was identified as an important contributing source. Three representative PAHs, phenanthrene (PHE), pyrene (PYR), and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) were selected for the assessment of their long-term trends. Significant decline of these PAHs was not observed contradicting the expected decline due to PAH emission reductions. A global 3-D transport model was employed to simulate the concentrations of these three PAHs at the three sites. The model predicted that warming in the Arctic would cause the air concentrations of PHE and PYR to increase in the Arctic atmosphere, while that of BaP, which tends to be particle-bound, is less affected by temperature. The expected decline due to the reduction of global PAH emissions is offset by the increment of volatilization caused by warming.

In order to solve the contradiction between economic development and environmental protection in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Chinese government decided to adjust and optimize the urban layout and spatial structure of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Therefore, it is imperative to systematically analyse the factors affecting energy-consumption carbon emissions in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to explore the relationship between factors and carbon emission intensity. This paper determined the influencing factors and conducted a systematic comparative analysis on energy-consumption carbon emissions in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

Case study was conducted to evaluate energy conservation effect of the distributed energy supply system and obtain the findings concerning on its feasibility. The case study was focusing on all municipal multi-family housing in Nagoya city, Japan, and it was evaluated based on primary energy consumption reduction, CO2 emission reduction, simple pay-back period, and recurring expenses merit by introducing the system. Annual energy consumption was estimated for nine typical municipal multi-family houses with different average occupied floor area and number of dwelling for each individual building unit. Based on the results of the case study, it was found that the effect of the distributed system varies depending on the average occupied floor area and the number of residences, and the generator capacity of CHP. In addition, when assuming adapting a distributed energy supply system into a type of housing has occupied floor area of 30m2-50m2 per a dwelling that accounts for 83.5% of the total municipal housing in Nagoya, at least the overall reduction of 16.7% CO2 emission reduction rate could be expected. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this study, the formation mechanisms of air pollution episodes between late September and early October were investigated on the basis of observations and reanalysis data from 2006 to 2015. During the transitional period from the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) to the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), an abrupt change in meteorological conditions resulting in heavy PM2.5 pollution episodes was regularly observed in autumn (around October 4–5). Thereafter, pollution episodes with higher PM2.5 concentrations and more frequent and longer duration occurred after October 4–5. In particular, another marked increase in the PM2.5 concentration occurred around mid-November when city heat supply began. We applied the moving t-test (MTT) and Mann–Kendall (MK) methods to investigate the role of meteorological factors affected by the Asian monsoon. The abrupt change in the PM2.5 concentration in autumn (around October 5) was closely related to the monsoon transition, during which the atmospheric circulation and diffusion conditions were undergoing a transition from summer to winter type. This could be favorable for the transport, accumulation and secondary formation of PM2.5. The PM2.5 concentration increased obviously around November 15, and it could be caused by the combination of more emissions from city heat supply and the more stable winter atmosphere. This study revealed significant differences between the two mechanisms that produced increases in the PM2.5 concentration in autumn and winter, and indicated close connections between the variation of monsoon type and air pollution characteristics to some extent. When considering emission reductions, attention could also be given to the monsoon transition period when the atmospheric circulation pattern and diffusion conditions begin to change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Abrupt change; City heat supply; Mechanism analysis; Meteorological conditions; Monsoon; PM2.5","Air pollution; Climatology; Emission control; Abrupt change; Heat supply; Mechanism analysis; Meteorological condition; Monsoon; PM2.5; Atmospheric thermodynamics; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; concentration (composition); monsoon; particulate matter; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; urban area; winter; air pollution; article; attention; autumn; China; clinical article; diffusion; heat; meteorology; summer; winter; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059232475

Moreover, no prior studies have explored the exposure-response relationship among all populations and different sub-sociodemographic groups. A distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was applied to evaluate the adverse health effects of temperature on CVD mortality for all populations and different sub-sociodemographic groups (by age, sex, educational level, living arrangement, and occupation) in Beijing. Based on the exposure-response relationships, firstly, we proposed a new model (COCKTAIL, Code Of Climate Key To An Ill) for revealing the split-and-merge relationships of the temperature-CVD mortality curve. This method could be used to apply the CVD deaths in a studied area to forecast the exposure-response relationships in the same area in the future. Secondly, this is the most detailed study to analyze the relationship between temperature and CVD mortality for different subgroups among the existing researches for developed and developing countries. We found that the cold temperature (at − 14 °C) was the risk factor for people with low socioeconomic status, especially for single people (including unmarried, divorced, and widowed), for indoor workers, and for people with low education, compared with the minimum mortality temperature, with a cumulative increase of 3.9 (80%CI, 2.9–5.4), 3.8 (80%CI, 2.8–5.1), and 4.5 (80%CI, 3.1–6.3) times respectively. Meanwhile, the hot temperature (at 35 °C) was the risk factor for CVD death, with a cumulative increase of 2.6 (80%CI, 2.0–3.4) for females, and 3.1 (80%CI, 2.4–4.2) for single people.

How to design and coordinate the goals of these policies becomes a key issue. This study quantitatively evaluates the effects of RPS and carbon caps in China's power sector using a multi-regional power optimization model combining with decomposition method. Based on the framework, this study focuses on two questions: (1) How to coordinate policy goals of RPS and carbon caps to ensure the effectiveness of each policy in the face of policy overlapping? (2) How to design power generation and transmission planning to achieve the goals of different policy mixes? Results show that these two policies contain overlapping elements, yet remain different impacts on regional power structures, inter-regional power and coal dispatches. An effective policy interval for RPS and carbon caps is estimated to examine the effectiveness of any policy mixes. If an RPS with a 17% non-hydro renewable share is implemented by 2030, the effective interval of carbon caps will be between a 27.5% and 38.2% reduction in carbon intensity. Results support that there are strong inner linkages between reasonable power system planning and current status of policy mix. © 2018","Carbon cap; Optimization; Policy coordination; Renewable portfolio standards","Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission; Optimization; Decomposition methods; Low carbon transformations; Overlapping element; Power generation and transmission; Power Optimization; Power system planning; Quantitative assessments; Renewable portfolio standard; Carbon; alternative energy; assessment method; electricity industry; energy planning; energy policy; optimization; policy approach; policy implementation; power generation; qualitative analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059424585

Surface modification of multiwalled carbon nanotubes was treated by nitric acid at different reflux times. The individual and interaction effects between the design factors of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube amount and functionalization reflux time with the corresponding responses of nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency were structured via the Response Surface Methodology based on five-level central composite design. The urea functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes fertilizer with optimized 0.5 weight% functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes treated at 21 h of reflux time achieve tremendous nitrogen uptake at 1180 mg/pot and NUE up to 96%.

The morphological observation of transmission electron microscopy shows extracellular regions to be the preferred localization of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes in fresh plant root cells independent of their size and geometry. Penetration into the plant cell results in breaching of graphitic tubular structure of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes with their length being shortened until ∼50 nm and diameters becoming thinner until less than 10 nm.

However, its biosynthetic pathway and regulation mechanisms have rarely been reported which hinders the improvement of production efficiency. Therefore, this study aims to identify key metabolic nodes in the chrysolaminarin biosynthetic pathway. A phosphoglucomutase (PGM) in the model microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum, revealing its critical role in chrysolaminarin biosynthesis is identified. PGM overexpression significantly elevates chrysolaminarin content by 2.54-fold and reaches 25.6% of cell dry weight; while algal growth and photosynthesis are not impaired. Besides, PGM overexpression up- and down-regulates the expression of chrysolaminarin and lipid biosynthetic genes, respectively. Microscopic analysis of aniline blue stained cells reveals that overproduced chrysolaminarin localized predominantly in vacuoles. Lipidomic analyses reveal that PGM overexpression significantly reduces the lipid content. The findings reveal the critical role of PGM in regulating the carbon flux between carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis in microalgae, and provide a promising candidate for high efficiency production of chrysolaminarin. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is based on photosensitizer (PS)-induced phototoxicity after irradiation. However, most clinically approved PSs will be widely distributed in normal tissues, especially in the skin, where they will induce phototoxicity on exposure to light. Therefore, patients must remain in a dark room for up to several weeks during or after a PDT. Herein, we proposed a strategy of aggregation-induced emission PSs (AIE-PSs) entrapped in liposomes with controlled photosensitization. The AIE-PSs begin to lose their photosensitivity when entrapped in liposomes. After liposomes have carried AIE-PSs into tumor tissues, the AIE-PSs will be released and immediately reaggregate in a targeted area as the liposomes are decomposed. Their photosensitivity can be triggered at turn-on state and induce cytotoxicity.

However, information regarding the effects of biochar on the carbon cycle in paddy fields under water-saving irrigation remains limited. Thus, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of biochar addition on the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO 2 and soil organic carbon (SOC) content of paddy fields under water-saving irrigation in the Taihu Lake region of China. Four treatments were applied: controlled irrigation (CI) without biochar addition as the control (CA), CI with biochar addition at a rate of 20 t·ha −1 (CB), CI with biochar addition at a rate of 40 t·ha −1 (CC), and flooding irrigation (FI) with biochar addition at a rate of 40 t·ha −1 (FC). Biochar addition increased rice yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) by 24.0–36.3 and 33.4–42.5%, respectively, compared with the control. In addition, biochar addition increased the NEE of CI paddy fields. The average NEE of paddy fields under CB and CC was 2.41 and 30.6% higher than that under CA, respectively. Thus, the increasing effect of biochar addition at a rate of 40 t·ha −1 was considerably better than those of the other treatments. Apart from biochar addition, irrigation mode was also identified as an influencing factor. CI management increased the NEE of paddy fields by 17.6% compared with FI management. Compared with CA, CB increased total net CO 2 absorption by 10.0%, whereas CC decreased total net CO 2 absorption by 13.8%. Biochar addition also increased SOC, dissolved organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon contents. Therefore, the joint regulation of biochar addition and water-saving irrigation is a good technique for maintaining rice yield, increasing IWUE, and promoting soil fertility. Furthermore, when amended at the rate of 20 t·ha −1 , biochar addition will be a good strategy for sequestering carbon in paddy fields. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biochar; NEE; Paddy fields; Soil organic carbon; Water-saving irrigation","biochar; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; crop production; experimental study; irrigation system; net ecosystem exchange; organic carbon; paddy field; rare earth element; soil fertility; water use efficiency; China; Taihu Lake; biochar; carbon; charcoal; carbon sequestration; chemistry; China; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; irrigation (agriculture); microbiology; Oryza; procedures; season; soil; water conservation; Agricultural Irrigation; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal; China; Conservation of Water Resources; Ecosystem; Oryza; Seasons; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060988155

However, the impacts of biochar on greenhouse gases from paddy field have not been investigated under controlled irrigation (CI). Field experiments were conducted during 2016–2017 to determine the effect of biochar application combined with controlled irrigation on rice yield and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from paddy fields in the Taihu Lake Region of China. Four treatments (0 t ha−1 biochar +CI, 20 t ha−1 biochar +CI, 40 t ha−1 biochar +CI, and 40 t ha−1 biochar + flooding irrigation (FI), named CA, CB, CC and FC, respectively) were designed in this study. The results showed that the effect of biochar application on greenhouse gases emissions from paddy fields under controlled irrigation had significant interannual differences. In the first season, CC decreased the global warming potential(GWP) of CH4 and N2O emission, and the CB increased the GWP of CH4 and N2O emission compared to CA, but these differences were not significant. For the second season, CB and CC decreased the GWP of CH4 and N2O emission by 35.7% and 21.5% significantly compared to CA due to the significant mitigation of CH4 and N2O emission. Biochar application significantly increased CH4 emission and decreased N2O emission from paddy fields under flooding irrigation compared to controlled irrigation (CC), which led to the FC's GWP was 1.70 and 5.47 times higher than CC's in the first and second season. In addition, biochar application increased soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents of paddy fields under controlled irrigation. And CB and CC increased rice yield by 16.7% and 24.3% and irrigation water productivity by 26.1% and 30.8% compared with CA (mean of two seasons). These results suggest that 20 and 40 t ha−1 biochar can be utilized under controlled irrigation not only for mitigation of CH4 and N2O emission but also to increase rice yield, soil fertility and irrigation water productivity. Therefore, the combination of biochar amendment and controlled irrigation might be a good option for mitigating greenhouse gases emission and realizing the sustainable utilization of soil and water resources of paddy fields in the Taihu Lake Region of China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Controlled irrigation; Greenhouse gas; Rice yield; Soil fertility","Floods; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Productivity; Soils; Water; Bio chars; Controlled irrigations; Dissolved organic carbon; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases emissions; Rice yield; Soil fertility; Sustainable utilization; Irrigation; methane; nitrogen oxide; organic carbon; water; annual variation; biochar; crop yield; dissolved organic carbon; flooding; global warming; greenhouse gas; irrigation system; methane; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; paddy field; rice; soil carbon; soil fertility; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; field experiment; flooding; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); lake; priority journal; rice; soil; China; Taihu Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058454433

In particular, mixing mature compost with raw composting materials reduced ammonia, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions by 58.0%, 44.8%, and 73.6%, respectively. As a result, nitrogen could be conserved to increase nutrient contents and germination index of the compost product.

While CHP reduces overall emissions compared to generating the same amount of electricity and heat separately, its on-site nature also means that CHP facilities operate in populated areas, raising concerns over their near-source air quality impact. Evaluation of the near-source impact of distributed CHP is limited by emission data availability, especially in terms of particulate matter (PM). In this paper, we report on stack emission testing results of a community-scale CHP plant with two natural gas turbine units (15 MW each) from measurements conducted in both 2010 and 2015, and assess the near-source air quality impact using an integrated modeling framework using the stack test results, site-specific meteorological data and terrain profiles with buildings. The NOx removal efficiency by selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is estimated to be ∼83% according to the emission testing. The integrated framework employs AERMOD to screen air quality in a 2.7 km × 2.3 km domain from 2011 to 2015 to identify the highest ground-level concentrations (GLCs). Examining the corresponding meteorological conditions, we find that those high GLCs appeared during the stable atmospheric boundary layer with relative high wind speed. Next, the worse-case scenarios identified from the screening process are simulated using the detailed Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) model coupled with a chemistry solver. The results generally show low GLCs of primary PM2.5 for this case study. However, our analysis also suggests greater building downwash impacts with the presence of taller and denser urban structures. Therefore, the near-source impact of natural gas-fired CHP in large metropolitan areas is worthy of further investigation. © 2018 The Authors","Air quality; Building downwash; Comprehensive turbulent aerosol dynamics and gas chemistry (CTAG); Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Distributed generation","Air; Air quality; Atmospheric boundary layer; Computational chemistry; Computational fluid dynamics; Distributed power generation; Energy efficiency; Gas turbines; Meteorology; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Navier Stokes equations; Selective catalytic reduction; Wakes; Wind; Building downwashs; Combined heat and power; Gas chemistry; Ground level concentrations; Integrated model framework; Meteorological condition; Stable atmospheric boundary layer; Unsteady reynolds-averaged navier-stokes; Cogeneration plants; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; natural gas; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; catalysis; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (composition); emission; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; power plant; air quality; Article; atmosphere; building; chemistry; combined heat and power facility; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric power plant; environmental impact; Gaussian based dispersion modeling; ground level concentration; mathematical model; particulate matter; reduction (chemistry); selective catalytic reduction; Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes model; urban area; wind speed; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; heat; procedures; theoretical model; urbanization; wind; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Models, Theoretical; Natural Gas; Particulate Matter; Power Plants; Urbanization; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059346345

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can be used to monitor air pollution effectively. In this paper, the Spearman coefficient is used to analyze the correlations between AOD and urban development, construction factors, and geographical environment factors in Shandong Province. The correlation between AOD and local climatic conditions in Shandong Province is analyzed by geographic weight regression (GWR). The results show that in the time period from 2007 to 2017, the AOD first rose and then fell, reaching its highest level in 2012, which is basically consistent with the time when the national environmental protection decree was issued. In terms of quarterly and monthly changes, AOD also rose first and then fell, the highest level in summer, with the highest monthly value occurring in June. In term of the spatial distribution, the high-value area is located in the northwestern part of Shandong Province, and the low-value area is located in the eastern coastal area. In terms of social factors, the correlation between pollutant emissions and AOD is much greater the correlations between AOD and population, economy, and construction indicators. In terms of environmental factors, the relationship between digital elevation model (DEM), temperature, precipitation, and AOD is significant, but the regulation of air in coastal areas is even greater. Finally, it was found that there are no obvious differences in AOD among cities with different development levels, which indicates that urban development does not inevitably lead to air pollution. Reasonable development planning and the introduction of targeted environmental protection policies can effectively alleviate pollution-related problems in the process of urbanization. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerosol optical depth MODIS; DEM; Spearman rank correlation; Urbanization","Aerosols; Coastal zones; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Optical correlation; Optical properties; Radiometers; Surveying; Urban growth; Aerosol optical depths; Digital elevation model; Environmental factors; Geographical environment; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Spatial and temporal distribution; Spearman rank correlation; Urbanization; Air pollution; aerosol property; correlation; digital elevation model; MODIS; optical depth; pollution monitoring; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; urbanization; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063447502

Temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 650 °C and a pressure of 50 MPa with heating rates of 2 °C/h were used to investigate the gas generation behavior of OSB. The extractable residual bitumen content decreased systematically with increasing heating temperatures resulting in a continuous increase in total hydrocarbon gas yields with the highest value of about 480 mg/g bitumen at 650 °C. Among hydrocarbon gases, the yields of methane (C1) increased consistently with experimental temperatures, while the yields of ethane (C2), propane (C3), butanes (i + n-C4) and pentanes (i + n-C5) increased initially to a critical pyrolysis temperature and then decreased at higher temperatures. Molecular indices (C1/C2, C2/C3, C2/i-C4, C3/C4, i-C4/n-C4, i-C5/n-C5 and C1/ΣC1-5) obtained in this work are different from typical primary thermogenic gases generated from kerogen or secondary thermogenic gases derived from thermal cracking of oil. Three stages of OSB thermal evolution were identified over a wide range of heating temperatures. The first stage (300–425 °C) reflects initial decomposition of thermally unstable moieties in resins and asphaltenes. Gas generated at this stage was dominated by carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide with minor amounts of hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbon gases were enriched in wet gas components with increasing heating temperatures. The second stage (425–525 °C) corresponds to liquid oil cracking and wet gas generation. While the yields of methane and ethane still increased with heating temperatures, yield of propane reached a maximum and yields of butane and pentane started to decline. The third stage (525–650 °C) reflects wet gas cracking and dry gas generation as indicated by the dramatic decrease of wet gas components and increase in gas dryness. Variations of gas yields and chemical compositions from two OSBs were partially caused by different levels of biodegradation. The top OSB has experienced less biodegradation influence than the bottom one as indicated by higher saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon contents and intact alkylphenanthrene distribution. Increased biodegradation of OSB yielded a higher concentration of polar compounds and an overall lower hydrogen content, which reduced the hydrocarbon gas generation potential. Slightly higher amounts of wet gas components were generated from the top OSB because of the relatively higher content of reactive moieties (mainly alkyl groups) at a lower biodegradation level, while a higher proportion of methane was observed from the bottom, severely biodegraded OSB that was enriched in cross linked ring structures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Athabasca oil sand bitumen; Biodegradation; Gas generation; Gas geochemistry; Gold-tube pyrolysis","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Biodegradation; Bituminous materials; Butane; Carbon dioxide; Crosslinking; Ethane; Gas generators; Gold; Heating; Methane; Oil sands; Propane; Pyrolysis; Sand; Sulfur compounds; Athabasca oil sands; Chemical compositions; Gas generation; Gas geochemistry; Heating temperatures; McMurray formations; Pyrolysis experiments; Pyrolysis temperature; Gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056887110

Here, based on Multi-Resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) modeling data, carbon emissions from industrial, power generation, residential, and transportation sources were analyzed in the Pearl River Delta region from 2008 to 2012, and the corresponding spatiotemporal distributions and main influencing mechanisms were elucidated. The results were as follows. (1) From 2008 to 2012, the total amount of carbon emissions increased gradually, and carbon emissions per unit area increased from 6513.65 × 10 3 gC∙m −2 ∙a −1 to 7519.03 × 10 3 gC∙m −2 ∙a −1 , where industrial carbon emissions were the highest, followed by power and transportation emissions; residential carbon emissions were the lowest. (2) The spatial characteristics of carbon emissions in the Pearl River Delta region showed a carbon emissions belt with a shape similar to that of the number seven and Shenzhen carbon emissions center. Industrial carbon emissions resembled a “one belt, one center” pattern. Power carbon emissions mainly showed a “seven shape” pertaining to a carbon emissions belt and secondary carbon emissions centers. Residential carbon emissions were mainly located in the Guangzhou–Foshan carbon emissions belt and Shenzhen secondary center. Lastly, transportation-related carbon emissions were mainly located in the Guangzhou–Foshan and Shenzhen–Dongguan carbon emissions belt. (3) From 2008 to 2012, carbon emissions from industrial, transportation, and residential sources all showed obvious spatial distribution characteristics related to the carbon belt of Guangzhou–Foshan, and the two carbon emissions centers displayed a centripetal agglomeration development trend, in which the emissions gradually expanded out from around this area. The reasons were attributed to the influences of the “Guangfo One City” policy, whereby joint development in Guangzhou and Foshan is being focused on in its entirety. (4) The future development direction of the Pearl River Delta region should be based on controlling the scale of urban development, construction of low-carbon industrial production areas, and low-carbon-oriented land use planning; the formulation of such reasonable measures would help to reduce future carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; MEIC model; Pearl River Delta region","Carbon; Gems; Housing; Land use; Rivers; Urban growth; Carbon emissions; Development directions; Distribution characteristics; Pearl River Delta region; Spatial characteristics; Spatiotemporal distributions; Temporal characteristics; Total amount of carbons; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060018787

Smaller and more homogeneous climate zones could help policy-makers and building designers to improve building energy efficiency while improving the indoor thermal environment. A new climate zoning method, with two-tier classification designed for passive building design, is proposed, using climate data (degree-days, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed) with Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) following the Ward's method. The method is applied to the Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW) zone of China as a showcase, where there are no fine climate zones for energy efficient building design with diverse climate characteristics. Seven sub-zones that consider both cooling and heating demands are generated in Tier 1. In the second tier, the HSCW zone is further sub-divided into three humidity groups, three solar radiation clusters, and four wind speed clusters. To assess the impact of climate zoning on building heating and cooling, EnergyPlus simulations are conducted with the output of heating and cooling load. The cooling loads decrease from sub-zone A to B to C (mean = 82.8, 65.3, 43.8 kWh m −2 , respectively) with sub-zone mean heating A1 larger than A2 and A3, B1 larger than B2, and C1 larger than C2, which is in accordance with the assumption made in the first-tier division. The higher wind speeds can raise the possibility of natural ventilation, and further increase the free-running period (FRP) when heating and cooling are not needed. The proposed zones are mapped and provide a useful reference for the policy/building code makers for heating and cooling strategies in this region. The method to create the climate zones could be applied in any region with local climate data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic zoning; Energy efficient building design; Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC); Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW) zone; Passive design","Air conditioning; Architectural design; Cluster analysis; Heating; Intelligent buildings; Solar radiation; Ventilation; Wind; Zoning; Building energy efficiency; Climate characteristics; Energy efficient building; Heating and cooling loads; Hierarchical agglomerative clustering; Hot summer and cold winters; Indoor thermal environments; Passive design; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060957734

Parks were labelled the lungs of the city, a metaphor which gained support as studies revealed the deposition of pollutants to leaf surfaces. More recently air purification by urban vegetation came to be seen as an ecosystem service, that add to the other important services it provides. However, the significance of deposition to foliage in reducing air pollutant concentrations in cities and the service this provides is often questioned. Although pollutants deposit on vegetation, the change in turbulence and wind speed brought about by increased friction can often limit dispersion and means that pollutant concentrations can be higher than expected. This paper re-analyses pollutant transects away from roads and into parks to compare the relevance of deposition and dispersion to lowered concentrations in park interiors and shows that pollutant concentrations typically decline more rapidly along transects with vegetation than those without. This may support the notion that deposition to vegetation rapidly reduces pollutant concentrations, but simulations using ENVI-MET reveal that even dense foliage offers little improvement to air quality via removal of pollutants in small urban parks with length scale less than 100 m. New field observations show the dominance of aerodynamic factors in changing air quality in urban parks and the way vegetation affects pollutant concentrations through altering air flows. Deposition is generally not important for parks although it plays a role in the rapid removal of large particles with rapid settling velocities (&gt;10 cm s−1) at the park borders (&lt;5 m). Across cities as a whole rarely more than a percent or so of individual pollutants are removed by urban vegetation. Deposition on foliage is not an important contribution to improved air quality. Vegetation can alter the dispersion of pollutants from roads into parks and effectively increase pollutant concentrations. Nevertheless stands of trees or flower beds can affect the distribution of park users, so may change exposure to air pollutants by altering the spatial distribution of occupants. © 2018","Ecosystem services; Foliage density; Park design; Traffic derived air pollution; Transects from roads; Urban green spaces","Air quality; Deposition; Ecosystems; Vegetation; Wind; Air pollutant concentrations; Deposition of pollutant; Ecosystem services; Field observations; Foliage density; Pollutant concentration; Transects from roads; Urban green spaces; Air cleaners; air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; dispersion; ecosystem service; Envisat; greenspace; park design; spatial distribution; traffic emission; urban pollution; urban region; vegetation structure; wind velocity; air pollutant; air quality; airflow; article; city; ecosystem; flower; foliage; friction; recreational park; simulation; vegetation; wind speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059482903

To enhance productivity and eco-efficiency of the typical winter wheat-summer maize rotation simultaneously in the North China Plain (NCP), we optimized the Genotype (G) × Environment (E) × Management (M) interactions to propose the optimal agronomic management practices and cultivars for four representative sites, with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and detailed field trial data. The results showed that an appropriate delay in sowing date could mitigate climatic negative effects and a proper increase in sowing density could increase yield. The optimal nitrogen application rate could be 180 kg N ha −1 year −1 for maize. For the cropping system, 240 mm of irrigation for wheat and 330–390 kg N ha −1 year −1 of nitrogen application rate (150–210 kg N ha −1 year −1 for wheat and 180 kg N ha −1 year −1 for maize) were suitable to sustain high yield, resource use efficiency, and lower N 2 O emissions. These recommended levels were, respectively, 40% less than the current irrigation and N application rate commonly used by local farmers. The recommended management practices could increase groundwater recharge while reducing nitrogen leaching and N 2 O emissions without reducing yield. The maize cultivars with a long growth duration, large grain number and grain-filling rate are desirable. The desirable wheat cultivars are characterized with a medium vernalization sensitivity and high grain filling rate.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying CO2 fluxes resulting from the soil property changes caused by tillage are poorly understood. A one-year simulation experiment using different tillage frequencies was conducted to quantify the impacts of tillage and soil property changes on CO2 flux. Treatments included conservation tillage (T0), semiannual tillage (T1), tillage every four months (T2), bimonthly tillage (T3), and monthly tillage (T4). The effects of tillage on soil CO2 flux had a strong seasonal pattern. CO2 fluxes in higher tillage frequencies of T3 and T4 were significantly higher than those of other treatments in spring, summer, and autumn. For viable tillage management, CO2 fluxes in T1 and T2 were significantly higher than those in T0 in spring and autumn. No significant differences in CO2 flux were found among treatments in winter. Tillage also had a significant influence on soil biogeochemical properties. Aggregate stability, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) significantly decreased in T2, T3, and T4, whereas SOC significantly decreased just in T3 and T4 after 1 year. A structural equation model analysis showed that the annual cumulative soil CO2 flux was directly affected by annual changes in SOC (∆SOC), DOC (∆DOC), and MBC (∆MBC). Tillage frequency directly influenced annual changes in large macroaggregates (∆AG) and ∆MBC. These results indicated that tillage practice indirectly lowered SOC by reducing large macroaggregates and microbial biomass, which in turn, enhanced CO2 flux. Our results suggested that tillage disturbance in the karst soil significantly increased SOC loss through enhanced CO2 flux compared with that in the non-karst soil in a similar climate. In contrast, reducing or eliminating tillage in the wet-hot season could lower CO2 flux rate by minimizing large macroaggregate disturbance and, by extension, microbial access to mobile carbon sources. © 2018","CO2 fluxes; Karst soils; Soil properties; Tillage frequency","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Landforms; Organic carbon; Soil conservation; Soils; Biogeochemical property; CO2 fluxes; Dissolved organic carbon; Microbial biomass carbon; Soil property; Strong seasonal pattern; Structural equation modeling; Tillage frequency; Agriculture; calcareous soil; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; conservation tillage; dissolved organic carbon; experimental study; karst; soil carbon; soil emission; soil property; tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053460746

Nowhere has that threat been more challenging than in rapidly urbanized China, the world's largest anthropogenic Nr producer. The Nanjing Declaration in 2004 called for global reductions in Nr emissions. To assess China's progress, multisource Nr emissions were evaluated with a quantitative method from 2004 to 2014. The results showed that national Nr emissions had increased with fluctuation over this period, 55–59% of the total Nr emissions were emitted to the atmosphere, and that agricultural production still was the biggest contributor (62–69%). The hotspots were mainly located in the developed and coastal regions that also have high population densities. Urbanization was associated with overall decreases in agricultural Nr emission and increases in industrial and residential Nr emissions. The overall increase in residential Nr emission per capita played a large role in driving the growth of national Nr emission.

For large-diameter carbon nanofiber (CNF), the lattice matching and epitaxy are the main mechanism for hybrid structure formation under the static state. This study provided a new understanding of HSK formation, wherein PE underlay on the surface of carbon material fiber played an important role. The shear flow induced PE chains to orient along the CNF surface and formed PE underlayer. Subsequently, ordered subglobules were periodically formed along the CNF axis and finally evolved to typical HSK structures with well-aligned arraying PE lamellae rather than random one. As the diameter increased to 7000 nm, even though the graphite (002) planes in carbon fibers (CFs) was similar to that in CNFs, the attractive van der Waals interactions between CFs and PE chains were too weak to drive enough PE chains to absorb on the CFs surface and form PE underlay even under the shear flow, leading to the absence of PE lamellae on the CF surface. Based on that, the “soft epitaxy” could be the main formation mechanism of HSK structures for carbon material fibers regardless of their diameters. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

It is critical for the global sustainable development by decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions at country level, specifically for the largest emitter, China. This study conducts a decoupling analysis from the perspective of carbon intensity (CI), per capita carbon emissions (PC) and total carbon emissions (TC) with reference to 30 Chinese provinces, covering the period of 2001–2015. Based on the Log Mean Divisa Index (LMDI) method, the effects of energy structure (ES), energy intensity (EI), economic output (EO) and population size (P) on TC at provincial level are investigated. Results show that: (1) a strong decoupling relation between GDP and CI is found in most provinces except Hainan, Qinghai and Xinjiang, while there is large room for China to decouple completely from PC and TC; (2) EO and EI are the dominated inhibiting and promoting factors respectively for carbon emission reduction; (3) ES effect on increasing carbon emission changes between positive and negative, while P has a positive but insignificant effect on the increase of carbon emissions for most provinces. The results help local governments formulate measures to coordinate regional economic development and carbon emission reduction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission reduction; Carbon emissions; Economic growth; LMDI model; Tapio decoupling","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Global warming; Population statistics; Regional planning; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Decoupling analysis; Economic development; Economic growths; Energy structures; Regional economic development; Tapio decoupling; Economic and social effects; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental economics; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; local government; sustainable development; Article; carbon footprint; China; economic development; empiricism; energy resource; environmental change; environmental impact; environmental management; government regulation; greenhouse effect; gross national product; population size; priority journal; program development; rural area; socioeconomics; sustainable development; sustainable growth; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057799391

Although the structure of CYP1A2 is available, the mechanism of CYP1A2-specific binding to AFB 1 has not been fully clarified. In this study, we used calculation biology to predict a model of CYP1A2 with AFB 1 , where Thr-124, Phe-125, Phe-226, and Phe-260 possibly participate in the specific binding. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to construct mutants T124A, F125A, F226A, and F260A. Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant proteins T124A, F226A, and F260A had active structures, while F125A did not. This was evidenced by Fe 2+ ·Carbon monoxide (CO)-reduced difference spectra and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Mutant F125A was expressed in HEK293T cells. Steady kinetic assays showed that T124A had enhanced activity towards AFB 1 , while F125A, F226A, and F260A were significantly reduced in their ability to activate AFB 1 , implying that hydrogen bonds between Thr-124 and AFB 1 were not important for substrate-specific binding, whereas Phe-125, Phe-226, and Phe-260 were essential for the process. The computation simulation and experimental results showed that the three key CH/π interactions between Phe-125, Phe-226, or Phe-260 and AFB 1 collectively maintained the stable binding of AFB 1 in the active cavity of CYP1A2. © 2019 by the authors.

In addition, global climate change often leads to novel shifts in plant communities which are difficult to anticipate with detailed models based on current system dynamics, which are often greatly altered under novel climates. In order to identify nonforested plant communities that are highly susceptible to state transitions under global climate change, we examined differences between the historical climate envelopes and end-of-century projections. We developed a vulnerability index based on the realized climate envelope for a given plant community relative to future climate exposure under two different climate-forcing models. To provide an approach to prioritizing climate-change adaptation resources at smaller scales, we used scenario analysis to determine the probability of falling outside of the historical climate envelope for each vegetation type present in a given management unit. The large-scale index consistently identified several areas as highly vulnerable to ecosystem state transition under future global climate change. South and north central Texas, the northwestern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions, eastern Kansas, and large portions of central and western Texas appear most vulnerable under both climate models. Scenarios identified thresholds of potential state shift for every vegetation type in the small-scale management areas investigated. Our study identifies a simple method for determining the relative vulnerability of nonforested plant communities to state shifts, providing a robust approach for prioritizing limited climate-adaptation resources at multiple scales. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Alternative states; Rangelands; Scenario analysis","Climate models; Vegetation; Alternative state; Climate change adaptation; Global climate changes; Plant communities; Rangelands; Scenario analysis; State transitions; Vulnerability index; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; global climate; mountain region; plant community; rangeland; scenario analysis; vegetation type; vulnerability; Great Plains; Kansas; Rocky Mountains; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064042018

Through an online survey experiment with US adults (N = 980), we examine three factors that may shape public support for different types of CDR strategies: (1) perceptions that CDR tampers with nature, (2) individual-level variation in the degree to which people are uncomfortable with activities that tamper with nature, and (3) information about the risks and benefits associated with each CDR strategy. Using a moderated mediation analysis, we find that support for different CDR strategies is, in part, a function of how much each strategy is perceived to tamper with nature. Support for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC) was lower than support for afforestation and reforestation (AR), as BECCS and DAC were perceived to tamper with nature more. These effects were particularly strong among individuals generally opposed to the idea of humans interfering with natural processes. Moreover, we find evidence that describing the risks and benefits of each CDR strategy dampens support; for AR and BECCS, this effect was again mediated through perceptions of tampering, while for DAC, the effect of describing these tradeoffs appeared to operate independently of perceived tampering. We conclude that policymakers and science communicators need to be mindful of how CDR strategies are described to the public, as perceptions of tampering with nature may be an important driver of their acceptance. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Carbon capture; Climate change; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Public risks; Reforestation; Risk perception; Carbon dioxide removal; Individual levels; Mediation analysis; Natural process; Online surveys; Policy makers; Public support; Science communicators; Carbon dioxide; afforestation; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; environmental economics; perception; pollutant removal; public attitude; questionnaire survey; trade-off; World Wide Web; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061215469

Four scenarios were analyzed: two conventional scenarios that examined the impacts of using diesel as a vehicle fuel with typical LFG management practices and two that assessed the advantages/disadvantages of using LFG as a feedstock for producing two types of alternative vehicle fuels. Producing LFG-derived compressed natural gas (CNG) or electricity as an alternative fuel source for the fleet is generally found to be significantly more economically and environmentally advantageous than practicing one of the more conventional scenarios, especially as the value of financial incentives (e.g. RINs) increase. The LFG-to-CNG scenario offers the greatest financial benefit when these incentives are high. However, when financial incentives are not available, this scenario is not feasible to undertake in the system modeled, but an LFG-to-electricity scenario could still save $1.32 for every gallon of diesel that is replaced with the alternative fuel. Using LFG-derived electricity as a vehicle fuel substitute also offers greater financial benefits than using the same volume of LFG for more commonplace purposes, such as generating electricity that is fed to the grid. Additionally, from the LCA, this scenario has the lowest global warming potential of all four scenarios analyzed, with over a 50-fold reduction in CO2-equivalent emissions over the baseline scenario. © 2018","Compressed natural gas; Economic analysis; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Landfill gas; Life-cycle assessment","Alternative fuels; Biogas; Compressed natural gas; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Finance; Fleet operations; Gases; Global warming; Land fill; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gasoline plants; Alternative vehicle fuels; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Economic and environmental assessments; Environmental life cycle assessment; Global warming potential; Landfill gas; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Renewable energy resources; compressed natural gas; diesel fuel; fuel; natural gas; unclassified drug; economic analysis; electric vehicle; environmental assessment; environmental economics; landfill; life cycle analysis; management practice; municipal solid waste; natural gas; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; economic aspect; electricity; energy conversion; environmental management; financial management; landfill; life cycle assessment; motor vehicle; waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057599589

Recent Findings: Self-aggregation generates significant humidity variability, dries the mean state, reduces high cloud cover, and increases the ability of the atmosphere to cool to space. Some studies find that convection is more self-aggregated at warmer temperatures but other studies, or other ways of measuring the degree of self-aggregation, disagree. There is not a simple, monotonic relationship between self-aggregation and surface temperature. Summary: Self-aggregation, through its effect on the humidity distribution and radiative budget, can affect climate. However, there is uncertainty over how strong the modulation of climate by self-aggregation is, in part because of the ambiguity over its temperature dependence. There are some indications that self-aggregation may modestly reduce climate sensitivity even without a dramatic temperature dependence, but more research is needed to understand this behavior. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate sensitivity; Cloud feedback; Convective organization; Radiative-convective equilibrium; Self-aggregation; Tropical convection",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060695648

To test whether camouflage mismatch is reducing hare survival we translocated 96 hares to a site recently extirpated of snowshoe hares, and monitored coat color change, mismatch with snow, habitat use, and weekly survival in winter-spring of 2017. Hare survival was low during periods of camouflage mismatch, and mismatched hares were 3.2 × less likely to survive, but this pattern varied by habitat. We found that aspen-alder stands >5 hectares negated the mortality costs of mismatch. We provide experimental evidence that mismatch is driving the range contraction of snowshoe hares, and identify specific habitats to buffer the consequences of climate change on this declining winter specialist. © 2018 The Authors.

Methods: The study assessed 107 peer-reviewed scientific publications on LCA about Indonesia or written by authors affiliated with institutions in Indonesia. Relevant programs and recommendations to advance LCA adoption were elaborated. Results and discussion: The first paper on the subject of LCA appeared as early as in 1996, while the number of publication significantly increased since 2010. The majority of these articles came from universities, research institutions, and international organizations. Drivers were mainly related to product competitiveness aiming to fulfill sustainability requirements of the global commodities market. Government policies also played an essential role in many aspects, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable consumption and production, green public procurement, eco-labeling, and green industry. Simultaneously, life cycle thinking has been embraced by governments and industries, especially with an immediate increase in the number of organizations implementing the recent version of ISO 14001. Increased participation in voluntary sustainability reporting also provides evidence of the prevalence of the sustainability concept. We believe that this development can serve as an essential step toward the spread of LCA studies in the future. Furthermore, the recent adoption of ISO 14040/44 as national standards in 2016/2017 also marked the commitment of Indonesian governments in LCA and is expected to stimulate the adoption of LCA-based environmental labels, such as carbon footprint, environmental product declaration, and product environmental footprint. Conclusions: The research and application of LCA in Indonesia are still in its infancy, as partly proved by a relatively small number of publications as compared to some other Southeast Asian countries. However, there was a notable increase in publication over the last 5 years, indicating a growing interest in LCA, mainly from academics and to less extent from private sectors. Although LCA has not been explicitly formulated in the national strategies and legislation, Indonesian governments do require life cycle thinking to inform policy-making. Nevertheless, the lack of incentives for green products, LCA programs, LCA expertise, and localized inventory data hampers its implementation. In the future, improvement should focus on LCA capacity building, the establishment of a forum to communicate LCA studies and resources, development of national life cycle inventory databases, and provision of market incentives for green products. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental labeling; Environmental policy; Life cycle thinking; Product competitiveness; Sustainability standards","carbon footprint; competition; developing country; energy consumption; environmental management; government; human; Indonesia; Indonesian; life cycle; life cycle assessment; medical society; Note; organization; peer review; policy; prevalence; priority journal; publication; traffic and transport; university",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043688322

Here, we report a simple CO2-separation cycle using an aqueous bis(iminoguanidine) (BIG) sorbent that reacts with CO2 and crystallizes into an insoluble bicarbonate salt. X-ray diffraction analysis of the bicarbonate crystals revealed “anti-electrostatic” hydrogen-bonded (HCO3−)2 dimers, stabilized by guanidinium cations and water. Mild heating of the crystals releases the CO2 and regenerates the BIG sorbent quantitatively, thereby closing the CO2-separation cycle. Experimental and computational investigations support a CO2-release mechanism consisting of surface-initiated low-barrier proton transfer from guanidinium groups to bicarbonate anions with the formation of carbonic acid dimers, followed by CO2 and H2O release in the rate-limiting step, with a measured activation energy of 102 ± 12 kJ/mol. The minimum energy required for sorbent regeneration is 151.5 kJ/mol CO2, which is 24% lower than the regeneration energy of monoethanolamine, a benchmark industrial sorbent. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.A crystallization-based CO2-separation method involving a simple aqueous guanidine sorbent offers the prospect of energy-efficient and cost-effective carbon-capture technologies that could help mitigate climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Human activities in the last one and a half centuries have perturbed the natural carbon cycle, shifting massive amounts of carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere and leading to climate change at an unprecedented pace. Carbon capture and storage, consisting of capturing CO2 from fossil fuel emissions and sequestering it deep underground, offer the prospect of limiting the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration and the global temperature. This requires the development and large-scale deployment of energy-efficient carbon-capture technologies. Here, we demonstrate a promising approach to CO2 capture based on crystallization of bicarbonate-water clusters with a simple guanidine compound. The CO2 separation cycle involves a unique proton-transfer mechanism via the formation of a carbonic acid dimer, leading to efficient CO2 release and quantitative regeneration of the guanidine compound and requiring significantly less energy than state-of-the-art carbon-capture technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","anion clusters; carbon capture; carbonic acid; crystallization; guanidine; hydrogen bonding; SDG13: Climate action; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062375803

Industrial fresh produce processing wastewater streams usually do not actively employ water recycling despite the large quantities of water being consumed. Further, there is a paucity of information on water reuse options for this sector. Therefore, this study assessed selected treatment processes for washwater from vegetable processing. The work focused on turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon at ambient and low-temperature vegetable processing environments (4 °C). Microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and novel biocatalyst composites were evaluated using both synthetic washwater and composite washwater samples collected from a commercial produce processing plant. Results showed that ultrafiltration and microfiltration were able to substantially reduce turbidity, but achieved only minimal chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon reduction. A majority of the constituents contributing to these two parameters were dissolved compounds, causing challenges for physical separation treatment techniques. The biocatalyst system demonstrated good efficiency at both 22 and 4 °C, with respect to the removal of chemical oxygen demand (72 and 66%, respectively), and dissolved organic carbon (74 and 70%, respectively). Reverse osmosis generated high-quality water that could be employed in vegetable production line; however, extensive pretreatment processes were required. This study demonstrated the potential to recover washwater in produce processing industry. Moreover, the results showed that the biocatalyst treatment could be applied at low temperature and potentially applied to water recycling schemes for wastewater streams from food industries that operate under low operating temperatures. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Advanced treatment; Industrial reuse; Vegetable processing; Water reuse","Biocatalysts; Chemical oxygen demand; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Industrial water treatment; Microfiltration; Organic carbon; Reverse osmosis; Stream flow; Temperature; Thermal processing (foods); Turbidity; Ultrafiltration; Vegetables; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Advanced treatment; Dissolved organic carbon; Industrial reuse; Low operating temperature; Processing environments; Sustainable practices; Vegetable productions; Water reuse; Water recycling; assessment method; chemical oxygen demand; composite; dissolved organic carbon; food industry; low temperature; pollutant removal; processing; recycling; reverse osmosis; separation; turbidity; ultrafiltration; vegetable; wastewater; wastewater treatment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047177357

We tested them with a distributed pulse experiment and evaluated the relative importance of Na limitation to other classic drivers of climate, macronutrient levels, and plant productivity. Herbivore abundance increased by 45% with Na addition. Moreover, the magnitude of increase on Na addition plots decreased with increasing levels of plant Na, indicating Na satiation at sites with high Na concentrations in plant tissue.

But the detail of what a just transition might entail is rarely specified. This article examines how policy interventions in Australia in 2012–2013, as part of the Gillard government’s Clean Energy Future package, approached the problem of a just transition in the case of Victoria’s coal dependent Latrobe Valley. It describes how policymakers framed the issue as transition, adopted a regional scaling, and expanded the territorial arena of policy action. A stakeholder-based multilevel governance committee shrouded this top-down decision-making from public scrutiny. These moves made it possible to conjure a narrative of benign transition governed by market processes. The paper explains how these strategic framings sidelined local interests, misrepresented the issues, exacerbated local disempowerment, and enabled the redirection of re-distributional funding to communities that were not directly affected by the impending closure of coal-fired power stations. The perceived injustice of this process exposes the limitations of climate policy-related strategic issue, scale and place framing. © The Author(s) 2018.","Australia; decarbonization; place framing; regional policy; Strategic framing","coal-fired power plant; emission control; policy analysis; policy making; regional policy; social justice; stakeholder; strategic approach; Australia; Latrobe Valley; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049690755

Cities have come to rely on disaster and climate resilience plans to future-proof their landscapes and protect vulnerable populations. Yet while data is collected, models are built and plans are drafted, environmentally destructive development practices continue unabated and often unchallenged. This article examines and seeks to explain the contradictions between a growing awareness of the risks of climate-induced flooding in resilience plans and the continuation of development practices widely acknowledged to exacerbate those risks. It analyzes these contradictions in the context of Mumbai and Kolkata, India's largest coastal cities, which are facing the severest threats from climate-induced flooding. Based on analyses of key resilience planning documents and both planned and unplanned developments in some of Mumbai's and Kolkata's most ecologically sensitive areas, our analysis reveals that resilience planning, promoted by the central government and international consultants, and presented in locally produced ‘fantasy plans’, fails to address the risks of climate-change-related flooding owing to tendencies to sidestep questions of politics, power and the distributional conflicts that shape urban development. We conclude that efforts to reduce urban flood risk would benefit from the research, methods and analytic concepts used to critically study cities, but significant gaps remain between these fields. © 2019 Urban Research Publications Limited","climate change; climate resilience; disaster mitigation; flood risk; flooding; India; Kolkata; Mumbai; resilience","climate change; coastal zone; conceptual framework; flooding; risk factor; urban climate; urban development; urban planning; India; Kolkata; Maharashtra; Mumbai; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062206327

Previous studies have found a large number of seeds or plant remains of wheat, barley, rye, foxtail millet, and broomcorn millet at the Donghuishan ruins. Findings: In this study, a batch of carbonized plant remains was obtained through the flotation method at the cultural layer of this ruin. Furthermore, three complete carbonized buckwheat kernels were found and identified with modern buckwheat kernels for the first time. Conclusions: The 14 C dating result was from 3,610 to 3,458 years before present. These carbonized buckwheat kernels from the late Neolithic period are the oldest that have been found in China.

In this study, the Driving-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) method is used to identify the influential factors of China's carbon emissions. This empirical research, which is based on provincial panel data and the structural equation model through the partial least squares approach, reveals the path relationships between carbon emissions and their influential factors. The estimation comprehensively covers 35 indicators during the period of 1996–2015. Empirical results show that the driving factor, pressure, state and response on the national level significantly impact carbon emissions. From a regional perspective, driving factor has significant impact in the northeast, northwest, southwest and south of China, and pressure factor exerts effect in the northeast, north, east, northwest, southwest and central south of China. The state factor plays a role in the southwest, central and south. As for response factor, the northeast, east, northwest and southwest are affected regions. This study provides a comprehensive and accurate indicator estimation framework for carbon emission.

The gravity of the situation only appears to be growing as recent reports have shown that climate change denial is not limited to the United States and that other global citizens also appear to be confused regarding the legitimacy of climate change science data. The prevalence of confusion highlights the dire need for better educational programs and grassroots actions by the scientific and academic communities. However, the path from 'data' to citizen action is hardly a direct one, and thus the engagement of the climate science community (ENGOs and other boundary organizations, academia, governments) in education will not be simply one of 'getting the word out'. That community will need to grapple with the complex socio-epstemic space that lies between scientific knowledge production and citizens' participatory engagement with climate change policies. This paper outlines some aspects of that complexity and suggests ways how certain types of knowledge dissemination as such, which lead to increased scientific literacy, can contribute to increased citizen action. © 2019 Saint Petersburg State University.

This paper uses a careful designed household survey in South China that considers an exogenous shock of drought, to determine whether the presence of natural and planted forests near rice-producing villages can reduce the adverse effects of drought on rice yield. After controlling for local climate and water infrastructure, we find robust evidence that natural forests and not planted forests have significant positive effects on rice yield, due to their influence on the availability of water for irrigation. Although drought hinders farmers’ access to irrigation, which negatively affects rice yield, forests near villages provide protection for rice against drought.

However, beyond the ORR, the development of carbon-based catalysts for other electrocatalytic reactions is still limited. More importantly, the intrinsic activity of most carbon-based metal-free catalysts is inadequate compared to their metal-based counterparts. To address this challenge, more design strategies are needed in order to improve the overall performance of carbon-based materials. Herein, using water splitting as an example, some state-of-the-art strategies in promoting carbon-based nanomaterials are summarized, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphitic-carbon nitride, as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. It is shown that by rationally tuning the electronic and/or physical structure of the carbon nanomaterials, adsorption of reaction intermediates is optimized, consequently improving the apparent electrocatalytic performance. These strategies may facilitate the development in this area and lead to the discovery of advanced carbon-based nanomaterials for various applications in energy-conversion processes. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, the Na-montmorillonite models with various pore sizes and water densities were generated to gain insights into the CO2/CH4 competitive adsorption behaviors using the combined molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. The effects and corresponding mechanisms of clay pore size, structure heterogeneity and water content on CO2/CH4 adsorption capacity, contribution of selectivity and isosteric adsorption heat were discussed in detail. Simulation results show that the Na-montmorillonite clay favors the preferential adsorption of CO2 over CH4, and the preferential adsorption of CO2 reduces with increasing clay pore size and pressure. Adsorbility factor is the major contribution for the CO2/CH4 adsorption selectivity in dry clay models, while the contribution of volumetric factor enhances with rising pore heterogeneity caused by increasing water content and decreasing pore size. The physical pore heterogeneity in the upper near-wall region resulted from Na+ distribution, associated with the difference of CO2/CH4 dynamic diameter is one reason for the asymmetrical CO2/CH4 density profiles, while the strong affinity between CO2/Na+ and substituted Al atoms in the upper tetrahedron is the other reason. Interestingly, a later increase of CO2/CH4 adsorption selectivity with further rising water density is observed, which is due to the solvation of Na+ in interlayer water phase, re-exposing some high energy adsorption sites for CO2 adsorption. This result provides implication that the CS-EGR efficiency can be potentially improved by increasing the water content in clay. This study gains deep insights into the CO2/CH4 competitive adsorption mechanism in montmorillonite clay at microscopic scale, and can open new potentials for tuning the application of CS-EGR in clay-rich shale gas reservoirs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 sequestration; Competitive adsorption; Heterogeneity; Molecular simulation; Montmorillonite clay; Water","Adsorption; Clay minerals; Driers (materials); Methane; Molecular dynamics; Monte Carlo methods; Organic polymers; Petroleum reservoirs; Pore size; Shale gas; Sodium compounds; Water; CO2 sequestration; Competitive adsorption; Heterogeneity; Molecular simulations; Montmorillonite clay; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056169527

The socio-economic uncertainty was considered by introducing Shared Socio-economic Pathways into scenario design. Moreover, a comparison between China, India and West Europe was conducted, to provide information on the key challenges for regions at different industrialization stages. Modeling results show that: 1. In reference scenarios, global industrial energy demand and CO2 emissions would keep growing in next decades, industry sector may emit over 25% of total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2050; 2. The changes in socio-economic developing pattern could slow down the emission growth, however, under 2-degree target, at least 118 Gt of additional emission reduction is required from 2010 to 2050; 3. The mitigation requirement would lead to great energy structure changes including rapid electrification, electricity may be able to provide nearly 40% of Western Europe's industrial final energy consumption by 2050; 4.

However, the socioeconomic factors affecting energy-related PM2.5 emissions are indistinct. Therefore, this study first explored the change in PM2.5 emissions over time in China from 1995 to 2012. Then the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model was adopted for quantitatively revealing the mechanisms of various factors on energy-related PM2.5 emissions. Finally, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis was adopted to examine whether an EKC relationship between affluence and energy-related PM2.5 emissions is present from a multiscale perspective. The results showed that energy-related PM2.5 emissions in most regions showed an increasing trend over the study period. The influences of the increase in population, energy intensity, and energy use mix on energy-related PM2.5 emissions were positive and heterogeneous, and population scale was the major driving force of energy-related PM2.5 emissions. The effects of the increase in the urbanization level and the proportion of tertiary industry increased value to GDP on energy-related PM2.5 emissions varied from area to area. An inverse U-shape EKC relationship for energy-related PM2.5 emissions was not verified except for eastern China.

In all kinds of applications, an accurate real-time estimation for state of charge (SOC) of battery is necessary. Some conventional methods usually need to sample both battery currents and voltages. This article presents a novel SOC estimation algorithm without current detection. This algorithm just acquires the port voltages of cell to calculate the open-circuit voltage (OCV) which is related to SOC. By extracting a large number of battery voltages based on a step response, some important parameters that can track battery working process are determined. In order to verify the algorithm feasibility and accuracy, it has been tested on a commercial common field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in different application conditions. The algorithm accuracy is mainly limited by model accuracy and sampling sensor accuracy. The maximum error between ideal SOC and calculated SOC by this algorithm is within 4%, and the mean error is about 0.99%.

Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant–soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiurnal tides. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of potential interactive effects between plant traits and tidal disturbances in regulating biogeochemical cycles, especially carbon sequestration, in coastal saltmarsh systems. © 2019 The Authors.","biogeochemical elements; edaphic conditions; plant traits; Suaeda salsa; tidal regime",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080983518

The possible increases that this can suppose constitutes and environmental concern in China. We studied areas dedicated to rice crop that have been partially converted to jasmine cultivation with some parts still kept as rice fields. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O varied significantly among the seasons. CO2 and CH4 cumulative emissions and the global-warming potential (GWP) of these emissions were significantly lower in the jasmine than the paddy field. N2O emission, N2O cumulative emission, however, were higher in the jasmine than the paddy field, despite in some concrete studied periods the differences were not statistically significant. The total decrease in GHG emissions from the conversion from rice to jasmine production was strongly influenced by the indirect effects of various changes in soil conditions. The expected changes due to the great differences in water and fertilization use and management and organic matter input to soil between these two crops were in great part due to modified soil traits. According to structural equation models, the strong direct effects of the change from rice to Jasmine crop reducing the emissions of CO2 and N2O were partially decreased by the indirect effects of crop type change decreasing soil pH and soil [Fe2+] for CO2 emissions and by decreasing soil salinity and soil [Fe3+] for N2O emissions. The negative effects of the crop conversion on CH4 emissions were mostly due to the globally negative indirect effects on soil conditions, by decreases in soil salinity, water content and [Fe2+]. Soil salinity, water content, pH, [Fe2+], [Fe3+] and [total Fe] were significantly lower in the jasmine than the paddy field, but temperature had the opposite pattern. CO2 emissions were generally correlated positively with salinity, temperature, and water content and negatively with [Fe3+] and [total Fe] in both fields. CH4 emissions were positively correlated with salinity, temperature, water content and pH in both fields. N2O emissions were positively correlated with temperature and were negatively correlated with water content, pH, [Fe2+], [Fe3+] and [total Fe] in both fields. CO2 was the most important GHG for the GWPs, and the total GWP was significantly lower for the jasmine than for the rice cropland field. The change in the land use in this area of paddy fields will decreased the global GHG emission, and the effect on the GWPs was mostly due to changes in soil properties. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CH4; CO2; Emission; GWP; Jasmine cultivation; N2O; Paddy field","Carbon dioxide; Crops; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Neutron emission; Soils; Tropics; Change in land use; Cumulative emissions; Environmental concerns; Global warming potential; Organic matter inputs; Paddy fields; Structural equation models; Subtropical China; Iron compounds; carbon dioxide; concrete; ferric ion; methane; nitrous oxide; organic matter; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; crop plant; global warming; land use change; methane; nitrous oxide; organic matter; paddy field; rice; soil property; subtropical region; Article; carbon footprint; China; crop production; cropland; environmental factor; greenhouse effect; jasmine; land use; priority journal; rice; salinity; seasonal variation; soil acidity; soil fertilization; soil temperature; soil water content; structural equation modeling; tropics; China; Fujian; Fuzhou; Jasminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060270787

These biosensors have been widely used to sense small molecules, detect environmental cues and diagnose disease markers. Metabolic engineers and synthetic biologists have been able to exploit metabolites-responsive transcriptional factors (MRTFs) as basic tools to rewire cell metabolism, reprogram cellular activity as well as boost cell's productivity. This is commonly achieved by integrating sensor-actuator systems with biocatalytic functions and dynamically allocating cellular resources to drive carbon flux toward the target pathway. Up to date, most of identified MRTFs are derived from bacteria. As an endeavor to advance intelligent biomanufacturing in yeast cell factory, we will summarize the opportunities and challenges to transfer the bacteria-derived MRTFs to expand the small-molecule sensing capability in eukaryotic cells. We will discuss the design principles underlying MRTF-based biosensors in eukaryotic cells, including the choice of reliable reporters and the characterization tools to minimize background noise, strategies to tune the sensor dynamic range, sensitivity and specificity, as well as the criteria to engineer activator and repressor-based biosensors. Due to the physical separation of transcription and protein expression in eukaryotes, we argue that nuclear import/export mechanism of MRTFs across the nuclear membrane plays a critical role in regulating the MRTF sensor dynamics. Precisely-controlled MRTF response will allow us to repurpose the vast majority of transcriptional factors as molecular switches to achieve temporal or spatial gene expression in eukaryotes. Uncovering this knowledge will inform us fundamental design principles to deliver robust cell factories and enable the design of reprogrammable and predictable biological systems for intelligent biomanufacturing, smart therapeutics or precision medicine in the foreseeable future. © 2019 The Author(s).","Eukaryotic cells; Intelligent biomanufacturing; Metabolic engineering; Sensors; Synthetic biology; Transcriptional factors","transcription factor; transcription factor; biomanufacturing; biotechnology; chemical procedures; dynamics; engineering; equipment design; eukaryote; eukaryotic cell; metabolite responsive transcriptional factor biosensor; nonhuman; nuclear export; nuclear import; regulatory mechanism; reporter gene; Review; sensitivity and specificity; small molecule sensing; transcription regulation; transcriptional activator based biosensor; transcriptional repressor based biosensor; eukaryote; gene expression; genetic procedures; genetics; metabolic engineering; procedures; synthetic biology; Biosensing Techniques; Eukaryota; Gene Expression; Metabolic Engineering; Synthetic Biology; Transcription Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063490092

This paper explores a success case of adaptive governance in a non-western country and tries to understand what factors lead to the adoption of this type of governance. Adaptive governance is considered most efficient to address the many challenges of climate change and natural disasters because it embraces uncertainty by focusing on collaboration, flexibility and learning. Yet, the concept remains underdeveloped and the conditions under which governments decide to embrace adaptive governance are not clear. The paper argues that two main factors are crucial for governments to turn to adaptive governance. First, a traumatic shock is likely to stimulate a reconsideration of the manner in which governance is thought and applied. The shock by involving considerable economic and human cost creates a momentum for governance rethinking. Second, a committed political leadership is essential to make use of that momentum to reform previous governance practices to create a more resilient system. These arguments are explored in the case of Odisha, an Indian state that was able to adopt adaptive governance and that became a successful example of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

However, there is obvious deficit in observations on the course of this recovery; in particular, no data on direct comparisons of the state of communities before and after reduction of emissions are available for soil macroinvertebrates. We have studied the structure of soil macrofauna communities at the level of supraspecific taxa in southern taiga spruce-fir forests in the region exposed to emissions from the Middle Ural Copper Smelter (MUCS; Revda, Sverdlovsk oblast). The data over three periods—high, reduced, and almost terminated emissions (1990–1991, 2004, and 2014–2016, respectively)—have been compared to test the hypothesis that the communities do not recover rapidly. The results partly confirm this hypothesis. On the one hand, the response of pedobionts to pollution at a qualitative level has remained basically unchanged: in each of the three periods, their total abundance (and that of the majority of groups) decreased abruptly as the MUCS was approached, with dominance shifting from saprophages to phyto- and zoophages. On the other hand, signs of recovery have appeared during the last period: the abundance of pedobionts has increased, and pollution-sensitive groups (earthworms, enchytraeids, and mollusks) have approached closer to the MUCS. This is most likely explained by decrease in the toxicity of metals due to normalization of soil pH. Rapid recolonization of defaunated territory may be accounted for by the presence in it of microsites with more favorable conditions, compared to the surrounding area, which allow low-mobile forms to survive beyond the boundaries of their main distribution area. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","community structure; dynamics; earthworms; enchytraeids; heavy metals; industrial pollution; insects; lithobiids; mollusks; natural recovery; recolonization; resilience; soil macroinvertebrates; spiders; stability; succession","abundance estimation; community structure; copper; earthworm; ecotoxicology; emission control; heavy metal; industrial emission; insect; macroinvertebrate; mollusc; recolonization; soil fauna; spider; succession; Russian Federation; Sverdlovsk; Abies; Araneae; Enchytraeidae; Hexapoda; Lithobiomorpha; Mollusca; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065260757

As means of Equisetum reproduction and propagation, spores are expected to reflect the evolutionary adaptation of the plants to the climatic conditions at different times of the year. Combining methods of Raman and scanning electron microscopy and assisted with density functional theory, we conducted material spatial-spectral correlations to characterize the distribution of biopolymers and silica based structural elements that contribute to the bio-mineral content of the elater. The elater tip has underlying skeletal-like structural elements where cellulose fibers provide strength and flexibility, both of which are necessary for locomotion. The surface of the elater tips is rich with less ordered pectin like polysaccharide and shows a ridged, folded character. At the surface we observe silica of amorphous, colloidal form in nearly spherical structures where the silica is only a few layers thick. We propose the observed expansion of elater tips upon germination and the form of silica including encapsulated biopolymers are designed for ready dispersion, release of the polysaccharide-arginine rich content and to facilitate silica uptake to the developing plant.

Their important ecosystem services at local and regional scope are currently threatened by climate and land use changes. Recent studies in these ecosystems suggest their importance to the provision of climate regulation services, prompting a better understanding of the underlying functions and their variability at ecosystem scales. The objective of this study is to determine the variability of methane (CH 4 ) fluxes and carbon (C) sequestration within a tropical alpine peatland in three locations along a microtopographic gradient and its associated plant diversity. These locations accounted for: 1) hummocks, found mostly near the edge of the peat with a water table below the soil surface, 2) lawns, in the transition zone, with a water-table near the soil surface, and 3) hollows, permanently flooded with a water table above the soil surface, composed of small patches of open water intermingled with unconsolidated hummocks that surface the water level. Results indicate that CH 4 flux is lowest in the lawns, while C sequestration is highest. Conversely, the hummock and hollow have higher CH 4 flux and lower C sequestration. In addition, plant diversity in the lawns is higher than in the hummock and hollow location. Dryer conditions brought by current climate change in the northern Andes are expected to lower the water tables in the peatland. This change is expected to drive a change in CH 4 flux and C sequestration at the lawns, currently dominating the peatland, towards values more similar to those measured in the hummocks. This decrease may also represent a change towards the lower plant diversity that characterized the hummock. Such changes will reduce the ratio of C sequestration:CH 4 flux signifying the reduction of resilience and increment of vulnerability of the climate-regulating service to further perturbations. © 2018","Carbon sequestration; Climate regulation; Ecosystem services; Methane emission; Páramo; Resilience; Vulnerability","Carbon; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Land use; Location; Methane; Soils; Tropics; Water levels; Wetlands; Carbon sequestration; Climate regulation; Ecosystem services; Methane emissions; Resilience; Vulnerability; Climate change; carbon; methane; water; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; emission; methane; peatland; plant; species diversity; topography; vulnerability; Article; carbon sequestration; climate change; controlled study; environmental factor; microtopography; peatland; plant community; priority journal; soil; topography; vegetation; Andes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056470008

It is pointed that cheapening of these technologies should be supported by a reduction of the cost of capital to improve economic opportunities for their development in competition with the thermal generation in terms of LCOE analysis. In addition to this, supplemental costs related with the integration of renewable generation sources into power system are also investigated as a negative factor for their expansion.

Nevertheless, CO 2 and CH 4 discharged from hydrothermal fluid reservoirs may support active soil microbial communities. Such secondary processes can control and reduce the flux of these gases to the atmosphere. In order to evaluate the effects deriving from the presence of microbial activity, chemical and carbon (in CO 2 and CH 4 ) isotopic composition of interstitial soil gases, as well as diffuse CO 2 fluxes, of three hydrothermal systems from Italy were investigated, i.e. (i) Solfatara crater (Campi Flegrei), (ii) Monterotondo Marittimo (Larderello geothermal field) and (iii) Baia di Levante in Vulcano Island (Aeolian Archipelago), where soil CO 2 fluxes up to 2400, 1920 and 346 g m −2 day −1 were measured, respectively. Despite the large supply of hydrothermal fluids, 13 CO 2 enrichments were observed in interstitial soil gases with respect to the fumarolic gas discharges, pointing to the occurrence of autotrophic CO 2 fixation processes during the migration of deep-sourced fluids towards the soil-air interface. On the other hand, (i) the δ 13 C-CH 4 values (up to ~48‰ vs. V-PDB higher than those measured at the fumarolic emissions) of the interstitial soil gases and (ii) the comparison of the CO 2 /CH 4 ratios between soil gases and fumarolic emissions suggested that the deep-sourced CH 4 was partly consumed by methanotrophic activity, as supported by isotope fractionation modeling. These findings confirmed the key role that methanotrophs play in mitigating the release of geogenic greenhouse gases from volcanic and hydrothermal environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon isotopes; CH 4 consumption; Greenhouse gases; Soil gases; Volcanic and hydrothermal systems","Air; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Geothermal fields; Greenhouse gases; Isotopes; Phase interfaces; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Volcanoes; Carbon isotopes; CH4 consumption; Hydrothermal environment; Hydrothermal system; Isotope fractionation; Isotopic composition; Microbial activities; Soil gas; Gas emissions; carbon; methane; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; carbon fixation; carbon isotope; crater; emission; enrichment; geothermal system; greenhouse gas; hydrothermal system; methane; soil gas; Article; autotroph; carbon fixation; carbonylation; chemical composition; environmental enrichment; environmental management; fumarole; gas diffusion; greenhouse gas; isotope analysis; microbial activity; priority journal; soil; soil analysis; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; Italy; thermal spring; Campania [Italy]; Campi Flegrei; Italy; Larderello; Lipari Islands; Messina [Sicily]; Napoli [Campania]; Pisa [Tuscany]; Sicily; Tuscany; Vulcano; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Greenhouse Gases; Hot Springs; Italy; Methane; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057063387

In microbial eukaryotes, carbon catabolite repression (CCR) mediates the preferential utilization of glucose, primarily by repressing alternate carbon source utilization.

Through genetic and genome-wide methods, this study aimed to comprehensively characterize CCR in fission yeast by identifying the genes and biological processes that are regulated by Scr1, Tup/Ssn6 and Rst2, the core CCR machinery. Results: The transcriptional response of fission yeast to glucose-sufficient or glucose-deficient growth conditions in wild type and CCR mutant cells was determined by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Scr1 was found to regulate genes involved in carbon metabolism, hexose uptake, gluconeogenesis and the TCA cycle. Surprisingly, a role for Scr1 in the suppression of sexual differentiation was also identified, as homothallic scr1 deletion mutants showed ectopic meiosis in carbon and nitrogen rich conditions. ChIP-seq characterised the targets of Tup/Ssn6 and Rst2 identifying regulatory roles within and independent of CCR. Finally, a subset of genes bound by all three factors was identified, implying that regulation of certain loci may be modulated in a competitive fashion between the Scr1, Tup/Ssn6 repressors and the Rst2 activator. Conclusions: By identifying the genes directly and indirectly regulated by Scr1, Tup/Ssn6 and Rst2, this study comprehensively defined the gene regulatory networks of CCR in fission yeast and revealed the transcriptional complexities governing this system. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon catabolite repression; Carbon metabolism; ChIP-seq; RNA-seq; Rst2; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Scr1; Transcriptional regulation; Tup11","regulator protein; Rst2 protein; Scr1 protein; Tup Ssn6 complex; Tup11 protein; unclassified drug; carbon; glucose; RST2 protein, S pombe; Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein; transcription factor; Article; carbon catabolite repression; carbon metabolism; catabolite repression; chromatin immunoprecipitation; citric acid cycle; fungal genome; gene regulatory network; gluconeogenesis; hexose transport; loss of function mutation; meiosis; nonhuman; promoter region; RNA sequence; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; sex differentiation; transcription regulation; DNA sequence; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mutation; procedures; Schizosaccharomyces; whole genome sequencing; Carbon; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Gene Regulatory Networks; Glucose; Mutation; Schizosaccharomyces; Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transcription Factors; Whole Genome Sequencing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063812131

Sound strategies for marine chemical monitoring call for measurement systems capable of producing comparable analytical results with demonstrated quality. An analytical procedure for simultaneous measurements of the Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn mass fractions in open ocean waters was validated. Procedure validation, including systematic combined uncertainty estimations on measurement results, and the traceability of data are described and explained. Off-line analytes pre-concentration and matrix separation was performed with the commercially available automated seaFAST-pico™ system, followed by inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS) mass fractions determination. The validation approach applied in the present study is in line with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 standard and Eurachem guidelines. Selectivity, working range, linearity, recovery (from 93% to 100%, obtained using the NASS-6 CRM from NRC, Canada), repeatability (1.5–3%), intermediate precision (2–%), limits of detection (0.00006–0.004 μg kg −1 ) were systematically assessed. The relative expanded uncertainties obtained were at range from 7.0% to 14.0% (k = 2). Excellent results were obtained when applying this procedure to the NASS-7 CRM from NRC, Canada. The potential of this analytical procedure was also tested on open seawater samples from different regions of the world.

Main factors addressed by the regulation include the share of driving operation, ambient temperature range, altitude and elevation difference. However, RDE is still debatable since not only boundary conditions but also the evaluation methods and trip selection are being discussed together with a carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation, which is planned to be implemented in the short term. Thus, this work focuses on analyzing the effect of different data measurement and analysis methods (i.e. cold-operation, road grade, trip selection and driving style) on CO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions based on 13 RDE tests performed in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, Portugal. The tests were conducted by 2 drivers using 5 vehicles. Each driver performed 2 trips per vehicle, one in normal driving and other in aggressive driving. A Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) was used to collect 1 Hz data, which was compared and analyzed using the European Commission (EC) proposed method for RDE tests. Results show the effects of each parameter such as average difference between drivers (7% in CO2 and 55% in NOx emissions) and between aggressive and normal driving. For road grade, big oscillations happen during the slope profile, which impacts emissions during all trips. Considering cold-operation, CO2 and NOx emissions are, on average, ~25% and 55% higher, respectively, than in hot-operation. These results highlight the need for deeper studies on these factors to assure that RDE tests evolve to a more established certification procedure than laboratorial certifications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Data analysis methods; Fuel use and emissions; Portable emission measurement systems; Real driving emissions; Testing boundary conditions","Boundary conditions; Carbon dioxide; Data handling; Information analysis; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Testing; Vehicles; Aggressive driving; Data analysis methods; Emission measurement systems; European Commission; Fuel use; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Real drivings; Real world operations; Air pollution control equipment; carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; assessment method; boundary condition; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; nitrogen oxides; traffic emission; air quality control; altitude; Article; behavior; car driver; car driving; carbon footprint; city; cold; controlled study; data analysis; driving ability; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental temperature; Europe; geographic elevation; human; nitrous oxide emission; Portable Emission Measurement System; Portugal; priority journal; Real Driving Emission test; travel; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058804065

Of these variables, the influence of precipitation has been studied most widely, while temperature, radiative forcing and their derived product potential evapotranspiration (PET) have received little attention from the perspective of hydrological forecasting. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the usability of potential evaporation forecasts for 10-day-ahead streamflow forecasting in the Rhine basin, Europe. In addition, the forecasts of the meteorological variables are compared with observations. Streamflow reforecasts were performed with the daily wflow-hbv model used in previous studies of the Rhine using the ECMWF 20-year meteorological reforecast dataset. Meteorological forecasts were compared with observed rainfall, temperature, global radiation and potential evaporation for 148 subbasins. Secondly, the effect of using PET climatology versus using observation-based estimates of PET was assessed for hydrological state and for streamflow forecast skill. We find that (1) there is considerable skill in the ECMWF reforecasts to predict PET for all seasons, and (2) using dynamical PET forcing based on observed temperature and satellite global radiation estimates results in lower evaporation and wetter initial states, but (3) the effect on forecasted 10-day streamflow is limited. Implications of this finding are that it is reasonable to use meteorological forecasts to forecast potential evaporation and use this is in mediumrange streamflow forecasts. However, it can be concluded that an approach using PET climatology is also sufficient, most probably not only for the application shown here, but also for most models similar to the HBV concept and for moderate climate zones. As a by-product, this research resulted in gridded datasets for temperature, radiation and potential evaporation based on the Makkink equation for the Rhine basin. The datasets have a spatial resolution of 1.2×1.2 km and an hourly time step for the period from July 1996 through 2015. This dataset complements an earlier precipitation dataset for the same area, period and resolution. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Climatology; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Precipitation (meteorology); Solar radiation; Stream flow; Forecast uncertainty; Hydrological forecasting; Meteorological variables; Potential evaporation; Potential evapotranspiration; Radiative forcings; Streamflow forecast; Streamflow forecasting; Weather forecasting; climate modeling; hydrological regime; potential evapotranspiration; radiative forcing; spatial resolution; streamflow; temperature profile; weather forecasting; Rhine River; Hepatitis B virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063002742

Model-based methods are very time-consuming to set up and require a good understanding of human processes and time series of water abstraction, land use change, and water infrastructure and management, which often are not available. Therefore, observation-based methods are being developed that give an indication of the direction and magnitude of the human influence on hydrological drought based on limited data. We suggest adding to those methods a ""paired-catchment"" approach, based on the classic hydrology approach that was developed in the 1920s for assessing the impact of land cover treatment on water quantity and quality. When applying the paired-catchment approach to long-term pre-existing human influences trying to detect an influence on extreme events such as droughts, a good catchment selection is crucial. The disturbed catchment needs to be paired with a catchment that is similar in all aspects except for the human activity under study, in that way isolating the effect of that specific activity. In this paper, we present a framework for selecting suitable paired catchments for the study of the human influence on hydrological drought. Essential elements in this framework are the availability of qualitative information on the human activity under study (type, timing, and magnitude), and the similarity of climate, geology, and other human influences between the catchments. We show the application of the framework on two contrasting case studies, one impacted by groundwater abstraction and one with a water transfer from another region. Applying the paired-catchment approach showed how the groundwater abstraction aggravated streamflow drought by more than 200% for some metrics (total drought duration and total drought deficit) and the water transfer alleviated droughts with 25% to 80%, dependent on the metric. Benefits of the paired-catchment approach are that climate variability between pre-and post-disturbance periods does not have to be considered as the same time periods are used for analysis, and that it avoids assumptions considered when partly or fully relying on simulation modelling. Limitations of the approach are that finding a suitable catchment pair can be very challenging, often no pre-disturbance records are available to establish the natural difference between the catchments, and long time series of hydrological data are needed to robustly detect the effect of the human activities on hydrological drought. We suggest that the approach can be used for a first estimate of the human influence on hydrological drought, to steer campaigns to collect more data, and to complement and improve other existing methods (e.g. model-based or large-sample approaches). © 2019 Author(s).",,"Abstracting; Catchments; Drought; Groundwater; Land use; Reservoir management; Runoff; Time series; Water treatment; Climate variability; Disturbance records; Groundwater abstraction; Hydrological droughts; Model-based method; Qualitative information; Reservoir buildings; Water infrastructure; Reservoirs (water); catchment; drought; groundwater abstraction; human activity; land cover; land use change; quantitative analysis; reservoir; streamflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063585527

However, emissions of ammonia, surpluses of nitrogen and phosphorus, and use of pesticides per hectare of agricultural land are also among the highest in the EU. In spite of successful policies and farm measures to reduce this pollution, agriculture still constitutes the largest environmental pressure on biodiversity. Dutch agriculture, including horticulture, also contributes 14% (32 Mton CO2-eq in 2016) to the national emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG). These emissions hardly decreased since 2000. In the current bid to meet the Paris Climate Agreement (PCA), the agricultural sector will need to reduce emission by 3.5 Mton in 2030. The relative reduction target for GHG by agriculture is 11% and less than the national target of 49%, but still is a challenge because the technical potential for reduction of methane and nitrous oxides is relatively small. Apart from technical measures and innovations, there is an increasing call in society for structural measures, like reduction of livestock, to assure an appropriate reduction of GHG emission from agriculture. However, there are also concerns about leakage effects when livestock production would increase elsewhere, e.g., in the EU, causing a net increase of GHG emission and increased local environmental pollution. We carried out a Life Cycle Analysis for production of milk, pork, poultry, potato, and wheat in other EU countries which disclosed that GHG emission per unit of product in the Netherlands is similar to that in Germany and France, while lower than in central and southern EU. Nitrogen and phosphorus surplus per unit of product for Dutch products often are higher due to the high use of manure. These results indicate that the risk of transboundary leakage effects likely is small when implementing PCA for agriculture in the Netherlands or stricter environmental policies, also when including reduction of livestock production. Further, growth of livestock production in other European regions might be avoided by climate policies or when consumption of livestock products would decrease due to increased consumer awareness or targeted interventions. © Copyright © 2019 van Grinsven, van Eerdt, Westhoek and Kruitwagen.","agriculture; eco-efficiency; European Union; greenhouse gas; nutrients",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077582863

Lorentz factors of 10 and 1.0014 were used for the high and low Lorentz factor cases, respectively. The hydrodynamic simulations show a division in the morphology of jets based on their initial injection luminosity. An additional simulation was set-up to investigate the evolution of the low Lorentz factor jet if the mass injection was lowered after a certain time. A synchrotron emission model was applied to these simulations to reproduce intensity maps at radio frequencies (1.5 GHz) which were compared to the observed emission structures of FR I/FR II radio galaxies. The effect of Doppler boosting on the intensity maps was also investigated for different polar angles. The intensity maps of both the high and low Lorentz factor cases reproduced emission structures that resemble those of FR II type radio galaxies with a dominant cocoon region containing time-dependent hotspots and filaments.

However, careful evaluation of the real impacts of the programs is still inadequate. The paper provides an insight into the relationship between the expected outcomes and the actual results of an energy efficiency program. It does so on a case example of one of the most significant energy efficiency and renewable energy sources programs in Central Europe, the Green Savings Programme. In total, 206 measures were inspected in 124 projects of the program. The analysis of the inspections showed that there is a significant difference between the expected, verified CO 2 emission reduction and ex post, real attained reduction (25% on average). The reasons are partly methodical, but most can be attributed to the behavioral factors of occupants in the respective buildings. The results therefore clearly show the need to tackle the relationship between the calculated (expected) energy savings (and related CO 2 emission reduction) and the real savings which are highly influenced by building users. Ex post evaluations should be done, among other things, to provide a more accurate picture regarding the member states’ energy efficiency improvement obligations. Furthermore, such evaluation also provides an essential input for further optimisation of the future energy efficiency support programs.

CIB. A truncated AccS protein that contains only the soluble C-terminal autokinase module (AccS=) accounts for the succinate-dependent CCR control. In vitro assays with purified AccS= revealed its autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer from AccS=~P to the Asp60 residue of AccR, and the phosphatase activity toward its phosphorylated response regulator, indicating that the equilibrium between the kinase and phosphatase activities of AccS= may control the phosphorylation state of the AccR transcriptional regulator. Oxidized quinones, e.g., ubiquinone 0 and mena-dione, switched the AccS= autokinase activity off, and three conserved Cys residues, which are not essential for catalysis, are involved in such inhibition. Thiol oxidation by quinones caused a change in the oligomeric state of the AccS= dimer resulting in the formation of an inactive monomer. This thiol-based redox switch is tuned by the cellular energy state, which can change depending on the carbon source that the cells are using. This work expands the functional diversity of redox-sensitive sensor kinases, showing that they can control new bacterial processes such as CCR of the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. The AccSR two-component system is conserved in the genomes of some betaproteobacteria, where it might play a more general role in controlling the global metabolic state according to carbon availability. IMPORTANCE Two-component signal transduction systems comprise a sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator, and some have evolved to sense and convert redox signals into regulatory outputs that allow bacteria to adapt to the altered redox environment. The work presented here expands knowledge of the functional diversity of redox-sensing kinases to control carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a phenomenon that allows the selective assimilation of a preferred compound among a mixture of several carbon sources. The newly characterized AccS sensor kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of the AccR master regulator involved in CCR of the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds in the betaproteobacterium Azoarcus sp. CIB. AccS seems to have a thiol-based redox switch that is modulated by the redox state of the quinone pool. The AccSR system is conserved in several betaproteobacteria, where it might play a more general role controlling their global metabolic state. © 2019 Valderrama et al.","Catabolite repression; Quinones; Redox switch; Sensor kinase","aspartic acid; bacterial protein; bacterial protein AccS; carbon; cysteine; menadione; phosphatase; phosphotransferase; protein histidine kinase; thiol derivative; ubiquinone; unclassified drug; protein histidine kinase; quinone derivative; anaerobic metabolism; Article; autophosphorylation; Azoarcus; bacterial genome; carbon source; catabolism; catabolite repression; catalysis; cell energy; controlled study; enzyme activity; in vitro study; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein modification; protein phosphorylation; anaerobic growth; Azoarcus; enzymology; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; phosphorylation; protein multimerization; protein processing; Anaerobiosis; Azoarcus; Catabolite Repression; Histidine Kinase; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphorylation; Protein Multimerization; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Quinones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064721189

The total observations (∼69%) of cloud by using ceilometer show annual cloud occurrence frequency of around 64%. Seasonal variation of CBH and cloud occurrence frequency reveal that the maximum/minimum cloud cover is found during southwest (SW) Indian summer monsoon/pre-monsoon season. Three CBHs (CBH1, CBH2, and CBH3) are presented in monsoon period due to high cloud occurrence, and two CBHs (CBH1 and CBH2) are observed in other seasons due to low cloud occurrence by ceilometer over the observational site. The CBH1 (∼100–2000 m) and CBH2 (500–3000 m) are observed during SW monsoon and summer season, respectively. The CBH3 is occurred usually in SW monsoon season. Moreover, the cloud cover during the day and night time shows that the occurrence of cloud is more frequent in daytime than nighttime during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season.

It belongs to the MARKAL/TIMES family of models supported by the International Energy Agency, and includes a detailed bioenergy sector. Compared to the reference case (baseline), our results indicate a larger share of bioenergy in 2030 (up to a threefold increase in the most stringent GHG reduction scenario), with up to a fourfold increase in the total amount of feedstock used for bioenergy production.

The actual prevalence of toxic nephrop-athies in children is not fully known, because renal functional and structural changes caused by nephro-toxins are nonspecific. The objective of the study was to evaluate the aetiology and renal involvement in severe poisoning with lethal potential in children. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed a group of patients, aged between 0-18 years, with deaths due to acute intoxication, who were investigated at the National Institute of Legal Medicine „Dr. Mina Minovici“Bucharest, Romania, during a 9 years period. We analyzed the aetiology of deaths by poisoning in children, the aetiology and the frequency of nephrotoxic injury and the pathological aspects of nephrotoxic poisonings. Results. From a total of 69 children deaths due to acute intoxication, the most common cause of death was acute poisoning with carbon monoxide (23 cases). The other etiologies were represented by multidrug poisoning - 9 cases, organophosphorus intoxications - 9 cases, and intoxications with illicit drugs - 8 cases. Acute renal injury was present in 20 patients, mainly in acute multidrug poisoning. The most common aspect was tubular nephrosis in 15 cases, followed by the appearance of acute tubular necrosis in 10 cases, tubulo-interstitial nephritis in 1 case, and non-specific aspects with renal stasis in the remaining 6 cases. Conclusions. Kidney involvement in pediatric poisoning is rare, but when acute kidney injury occurs, the prognosis of the intoxication becomes severe. Renal injury was present in 30% of cases, either by direct kidney damage with acute tubular necrosis, or by association of haemodynamic, cardiogenic, or septic shock.

The nonparametric Mann–Kendall, Sen's slope estimator, least squares method, and two-tailed simple t-test methods were used to assess the trend in nine temperature extreme indices. The results of the study indicated that the trends in annual mean anomalies of cold nights, cold days, and frost days significantly decreased at the rates of −1.09, −1.58, and −1.05 day/decade, respectively. The number of warm nights, warm days, and summer days exhibited significant positive trends at the rates of 1.49, 1.04, and 4.32 day/decade, respectively. In addition, the trends of the warmest day and coldest day also increased significantly at the rates of 0.45 and 0.51 °C/decade, respectively. The trend of diurnal temperature range decreased significantly with −0.35 °C/decade. The spatial distribution of temperature extreme indices indicated that the number of cold nights, cold days, and diurnal temperature range have been decreased, while the trends of warm nights, warm days, summer days, warmest day, and coldest day have been increased over the whole country. Large-scale atmospheric circulation changes derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis show that a weak (strong) wind pressure, increasing (decreasing) geopotential height, and rapid warming (cooling) over the northern (southern) region have contributed to the changes in temperature extremes in Pakistan to some extent. With respect to elevation-dependent warming (EDW), the trends of cold nights, warm days, summer days, warmest day, and diurnal temperature range showed significant positive correlations with increasing elevation. However, the trends of cold days, warm nights, frost days, and coldest day showed significant negative relationships with increasing elevation. The findings of this study will be helpful in the adaptation of climate change and mitigation of climatological disasters in the region.

From a detailed stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic approach (carbon and oxygen isotopes, total organic carbon, total sulfur and selected elements abundances), we identified transgressive-regressive intervals and depositional settings within the Bambuí Group stratigraphy and developed a new model for the origin of the extremely positive Middle Bambuí Excursion (MIBE) present in the middle section of the basin. A post-Marinoan cap carbonate interval is recorded in the first ~10 m, preserving aragonite pseudomorph fans, barite-rich layers and negative δ 13 C anomaly. A hiatus separates the cap carbonate from the late Ediacaran succession that makes up the remaining Bambuí Group. The younger intervals preserve both siliciclastic (middle Serra de Santa Helena Formation) and carbonate (middle/upper Sete Lagoas and Lagoa do Jacaré formations) shallow-water depositional settings, requiring tectonic influence or climatic changes in source areas. The MIBE yields δ 13 C values as high as +14‰ and extends for about 350 m, from the upper Sete Lagoas Formation to the lower Serra da Saudade Formation. We suggest a model of a restricted basin setting that favored local carbon isotopic signals in the δ 13 C record of sedimentary carbonates through preferential weathering of ancient carbonate platforms on the continent and higher burial rate of authigenic carbonate.

However, the impact of future climate on the geographic range of many crops in West Africa is still uncertain. This is exacerbated by considerable uncertainty in projecting future West African climate by global circulation models (GCMs). In this paper, the current land suitability for rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) production in West Africa and how it would change in response to a range of future climate changes were assessed. A novel non-additive approach involving the integration of a fuzzy measure modelling procedure and the Choquet integral to deal with non-linear relationships among criteria was introduced. The supervised and unsupervised variants of the approach and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregators were evaluated and compared using data on the current climate, soil characteristics, and actual maize yield estimates at some locations across the region. The supervised fuzzy measure modelling outperformed the unsupervised variant and the OWA operators, demonstrating the importance of considering interaction among criteria and incorporating human reasoning in multicriteria analysis. Consequently, the supervised modelling approach was used to estimate suitability scores for rainfed maize for the current and a range of plausible future climates which were generated from unique combinations of temperature and rainfall percentile values (5th, 50th and 95th) from 25 and 32 GCMs projections under the RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Under the current climate in West Africa, the combined suitable/highly suitable areas for rainfed maize production are in the humid savanna zones. In contrast, the forest region to the south exhibited moderate suitability with the semi-arid savanna zones being marginally suitable. Relative to the current climate in which 91.3% of West Africa is at least moderately suitable for maize production, suitability for maize will change in at least 43% of West Africa in response to future climate change. Across all scenarios and years, future suitability in the semi-arid region of the Sudano-Sahelian savannas shows strong sensitivity to uncertainty in rainfall projections. However, regardless of the trajectory of future rainfall projection, the 95th percentile temperature projection will decrease suitability in about 15% of the West African region by 2080 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Because of the incorporation of uncertainties of future climate projections in this analysis, the results from this study can be used in the development of flexible climate adaptation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Choquet integral; Global circulation model; Land suitability; Ordered Weighted Averaging; Representative concentration pathways","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Fuzzy systems; Grain (agricultural product); Integral equations; Rain; Statistical methods; Uncertainty analysis; Choquet integral; Global circulation model; Land suitability; Ordered weighted averaging; Representative concentration pathways; Climate change; adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; future prospect; fuzzy mathematics; general circulation model; global change; humid environment; maize; multicriteria analysis; rainfed agriculture; savanna; semiarid region; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sudan; West Africa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060696449

The subducted oceanic lithosphere contains considerable amounts of iron so that Fe3+/Fe2+ equilibria in mineral assemblages are able to buffer the (intensive) fO2 and the valence of carbon. Alternatively, carbon itself can be a carrier of (extensive) ‘excess oxygen’ when transferred from the slab to the mantle, prompting the oxidation of the sub-arc mantle. Therefore, the correct use of intensive and extensive variables to define the slab-to-mantle oxidation by C-bearing fluids is of primary importance when considering different fluid/rock ratios. Fluid-mediated processes at the slab–mantle interface can also be investigated experimentally. The presence of CO2 (or CH4 at highly reduced conditions) in aqueous COH fluids in peridotitic systems affects the positions of carbonation or decarbonation reactions and of the solidus. Some methods to produce and analyse COH fluid-saturated experiments in model systems are introduced, together with the measurement of experimental COH fluids composition in terms of volatiles and dissolved solutes.

However, quantifying this distribution is challenging due to a lack of spatially explicit and temporally dynamic empirical data of both surface water and its drivers of change at large spatial scales. We focused on one of the largest dryland basins in the world, Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), recently identified as a global hotspot of water decline. We used a new remotely sensed time-series of surface water extent dynamics (SWD) data to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in surface water across the entire MDB and catchments and to assess natural and anthropogenic drivers of SWD, including climate and historical land use change. We show high intra- and inter-annual dynamics in surface water with a rapid loss during the Millennium Drought, the worst, decade-long drought in SE Australia. We show strong regional and catchment differences in SWD, with the northern basin showing high variability compared to the southern basin which shows a steady decline in surface water. Linear mixed effect models including climate and land-use change variables explained up to 70% variability in SWD with climate being more important in catchments of the northwestern MDB, whereas land-use was important primarily in the central MDB. Increase in fraction of dryland agriculture in a catchment and maximum temperature was negatively related to SWD, whereas precipitation and soil moisture were positively related to SWD. The fact that land-use change was an important explanatory variable of SWD in addition to climate is a significant result as land-use can be managed more effectively whereas climate-mitigation actions can be intractable, with global change scenarios predicting drier conditions for the area followed by a further reduction in surface water availability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Climate variability; Drought; Flood; Land-use change; Murray-Darling Basin","Catchments; Climate models; Drought; Dynamics; Floods; Land use; Runoff; Soil moisture; Australia; Climate variability; Explanatory variables; Land-use change; Murray-Darling Basin; Murray-darling basins (MDB); Spatiotemporal distributions; Spatiotemporal patterns; Climate change; surface water; arid region; climate variation; decadal variation; drought; flooding; land use change; Landsat; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; agriculture; Article; Australia; catchment; climate change; controlled study; explanatory variable; flooding; land use; limit of quantitation; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; river basin; soil moisture; surface water extent dynamics; surface water hydrology; water availability; wetland; Australia; Murray-Darling Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059310306

The purpose of the case study was to examine the energy use of imported palm kernel shell (PKS) in Taiwan, which has generated superheated steam for the end users in the industrial sector. In this work, characterizing the thermochemical properties of imported PKS (including proximate analysis, elemental analysis and calorific value) was first conducted by the standard test methods. Based on the statistics of imported PKS and the method developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the preliminary benefit analysis of PKS-to-energy was further addressed in the paper to verify its equivalent GHG emission mitigation. The results showed the annual benefit of equivalentGHGmitigation of about 78,647 metric tons (using annual imported PKS of 60,000 metric tons on an average). In addition, the economic benefit for purchasing PKS in the industrial boilers can gain the cost-down at approximately NT$60,000,000 (US$2,000,000) in comparison with that of fuel oil. Furthermore, the regulatory measures for upgrading PKS-to-energy and countermeasures for controlling air pollutant emissions from PKS-to-energy facilities were briefly summarized to create another circular economy. Finally, some technological recommendations have been addressed to upgrade the added values of imported PKS in Taiwan. © 2019 by the author.","Benefit analysis; Biomass-to-energy; Boiler; Feed-in-tariff; Palm kernel shell; Regulatory measure & countermeasure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073878205

The composition of the briquettes was characterized by 13C CP/MAS, proximate analysis, and X-ray diffraction and the results were compared with equilibrium calculations. In addition to these techniques, we report for the first time on the use of XμCT for characterizing such materials. The XμCT analysis showed that the briquette structure contains carbon, binder and inorganic matter, with quartz retained from the original feedstock in torrefied biomass and coal briquettes. The CO2 reactivity of pulverized briquettes was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. Results showed that the inorganic matter influences the reactivity less than the organic composition and porosity.

Unlike the classical metal halide materials in which organic molecules are optically inactive, both organic and inorganic components in this structure are chromospheres. At ambient temperature, photoluminescence measurements show and intense emission in the yellow green region. This emission is believed to be due to π– π* electronic transition within the organic cation [C6N2H5]+.

Moreover, photoluminescence study as function of temperature using the Arrhenius model, reveals the behavior a quasi-localized exciton with a binding energy of 73 meV, substantially lower than those found for homologous compounds but it reflects the localized character of the exciton and it may explain the stability of the exciton at ambient temperature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bismuth chloride; Metal halides; Organic-inorganic; Resonance charge transfer","Binding energy; Bismuth compounds; Charge transfer; Chlorine compounds; Crystal structure; Energy transfer; Excitons; Hybrid materials; Light absorption; Metal halides; Molecules; Photoluminescence; Positive ions; Resonance; Semiconductor quantum wells; Temperature; Bismuth chloride; Charge transfer process; Electronic transition; Organic-inorganic; Photoluminescence excitation; Photoluminescence measurements; Photoluminescence spectrum; Resonance energy transfer; Optical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061175922

Different from previous approaches that rely on empirical relationships between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM2:5 (PM with particle diameters less than 2.5 μm), for the first time, we derive PM2:5 concentrations, during both daytime and nighttime, from near-surface CALIOP aerosol extinction retrievals using bulk mass extinction coefficients and model-based hygroscopicity. Preliminary results from this 2-year study conducted over the CONUS show a good agreement (r2 ∼ 0:48; mean bias of -3:3 μgm-3) between the averaged nighttime CALIOPderived PM2:5 and ground-based PM2:5 (with a lower r2 of ∼ 0:21 for daytime; mean bias of-0:4 μgm-3), suggesting that PM concentrations can be obtained from active-based spaceborne observations with reasonable accuracy. Results from sensitivity studies suggest that accurate aerosol typing is needed for applying CALIOP measurements for PM2:5 studies. Lastly, the e-folding correlation length for surface PM2:5 is found to be around 600 km for the entire CONUS (∼ 300 km for western CONUS and ∼ 700 km for eastern CONUS), indicating that CALIOP observations, although sparse in spatial coverage, may still be applicable for PM2:5 studies. © Author(s) 2019.",,"accuracy assessment; aerosol composition; CALIOP; concentration (composition); hygroscopicity; mass extinction; optical depth; particulate matter; pollution incidence; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063229127

Hotelling, manoeuvring and cruising operations in the harbour areas generate a large share of local and global pollution, external costs and public health issues. Emission abatement demands effective regulation for vessel compliance and enforcement adequacy in despite of geographic differences in jurisdiction. A connecting relation between regulatory frameworks and atmospheric pollution from vessels operations at port is so far, missing in literature. This paper aims at filling in this gap by addressing exhaust gasses (NOx, SOx, CO, CO 2 ) and particles (PM 2.5 ) released from operative vessels in port with differing regulatory frameworks (Las Palmas, St. Petersburg, and Hong Kong). Estimations are based on the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) and AIS traffic information over a twelve-month timeframe. Contribution of this paper relates to revealing emission patterns of vessel operations in port and the assessment of current regulatory frameworks. Results and lower emission profiles shed light to sulphur regulation differences and the potential benefits in new policy measures (polluter pays principle, cold ironing and others) of accounting operative modes and shipping sub-sectors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air emissions; Automatic Identification System (AIS); Port-Cities; Regulation","pollution policy; port operation; regulatory framework; traffic emission; traffic management; vessel; Canary Islands; China; Hong Kong; Las Palmas; Russian Federation; Saint Petersburg; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019751743

It is therefore increasingly important to analyze the sustainability and resilience of mid- and long-term electric utility and water system capacity expansion plans. Due to the inherent interdependency between power and water critical infrastructure, these expansion plans should be analyzed with respect to potential challenges posed by climate change and other risks. Decision-makers therefore require tools that facilitate an integrated analysis that captures the interdependency of power and water to better inform future expansion plans. Here we develop an agent-based model of a typical regional power system that incorporates the features of specific plant types and their cooling systems that are dependent on adequate water supplies at appropriate temperatures to support full power operation.

This is particularly true in the coastal tropics, where numerous actors and institutions intersect to shape environmental governance. Here, we investigate stakeholder preferences for an array of options regarding the sustainable development and conservation of mangrove forests. These include: payments for ecosystem services (PES), ecotourism, selling non-timber forest products, bio-charcoal production, and forest restoration financed via corporate social responsibility (CSR). Empirical studies from two socio-ecological settings in Thailand reveal the preferences of government agencies, corporations, municipal and village heads, and several community associations (fishers, senior citizens, housewives, environmentalists, salt-flat workers, oil palm plantation owners). Interviews and participatory multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) elicited preferences based on the likelihood of achieving favourable environmental, economic, and social outcomes. Findings reveal (1) PES was favoured – although motivations were not driven solely by the prospect of financial gain, but by the land tenure security, collaborations, and long-term ecological benefits that were perceived to occur as a result; (2) PES for local services (water quality) were preferred over global services (climate change mitigation); (3) criteria related to wellbeing, livelihoods, and environmental stewardship are influenced by broad cultural and political ideologies, rather than site-specific characteristics; and (4) clear tensions both between private and public actors, and between national and local actors. Our study highlights the importance of involving all informed stakeholders in the decision-making process in order to understand the complex reasons driving environmental management preferences, and to gain greater acceptance of biodiversity conservation and natural resource management actions. We also call for greater transparency in MCDA studies by presenting more of the qualitative data used to subjectively construct the quantitative criteria. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Charcoal; Corporate sustainability; Incentives; Multi-criteria evaluation; Wetland","biodiversity; carbon; charcoal; corporate social responsibility; decision analysis; ecosystem service; ecotourism; environmental economics; environmental management; multicriteria analysis; restoration ecology; stakeholder; sustainable development; wetland; aged; Article; climate change; community structure; conservation biology; ecosystem; Elaeis; empiricism; environmental management; environmentalist; fee; financial management; forest; government; Gulf of Thailand; housewife; livelihood; lowest income group; mangrove; miscellaneous named groups; payments for ecosystem service; salt flat worker; social responsibility; survival rate; Thailand; wellbeing; environmental protection; forest; human; wetland; Thailand; Elaeis; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Thailand; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059131813

Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts.

Early loss of seasonal snow exposes the ice layer of the glaciers directly to sunlight, consequently leading to their ablation and alterations in discharge of glacier-fed rivers. Therefore, any alteration in the melting rate of the Himalayan snow pack can significantly affect the ecological balance in the region. Besides global warming, enhanced melting of snow, caused by light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) such as dust and elemental carbon (EC), has also been recognized as prominent cause of enhanced melting of snow in the Himalayas of China and Nepal. However, in light of vast area of the Himalayas and persistent emissions from India, studies, emphasizing the potential of LAIs to substantially affect the snow radiation budget of snow cover in IWHs, are still scanty. Therefore, in this study, field campaigns were made on three glaciers, i.e., Hamta, Beas Kund, and Deo Tibba, in IWHs to collect snow samples for estimation of LAIs. Snow of the studied glaciers was observed to be contaminated with 13.02 to 74.57 ng/g of EC and 32.14 to 216.54 μg/g of dust. Albedo simulations done using SNow and ICe Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) model indicated that besides the changes caused by increased grain size, EC and dust, cumulatively induced 0.60 to 32.65% reduction in albedo of snow. Further assessment, constrained by measurements, illustrated that radiative forcing (RF), of 1.8 to 80 W/m 2 , was instigated due to enhanced thermal absorption of snow. Ten hours of daily mean RFs in this range could correspond to 3 to 9.65 mm/d of snow melt and contribute significantly in reducing the seasonal snow cover in IWHs. Considering the consequences of LAIs-induced snow melt and lack of in situ observations in the IWHs, the outcomes of this study could assist researchers and policy makers in developing efficient climate models and framing mitigation measures, respectively. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Albedo; Elemental carbon; Glaciers; Indian Western Himalayas; Light-absorbing impurities; Radiative forcing; Snow melt","absorption; albedo; climate modeling; elemental carbon; glacier; grain size; melting; radiation budget; radiative forcing; river basin; snow cover; snowmelt; Himalayas; India; Nepal; carbon; salt water; snow; aerosol; chemistry; China; dust; environmental monitoring; freezing; ice cover; India; Nepal; research; river; sunlight; Aerosols; Carbon; China; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Freezing; Ice Cover; India; Nepal; Research; Rivers; Saline Waters; Snow; Sunlight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060457292

Significantly, they also entail varying expectations concerning the meaning of water and the political promises of technology in advancing more sustainable futures. Drawing on sociological science and technology studies, particularly the sociology of expectations, this article analyses competing, parallel and confronting expectations regarding water and technology that different actors produce, negotiate and contest in the context of the recently launched 1500 MW hydropower megaproject Coca Codo Sinclair in Ecuador. It takes expectations as performative as they may shape and challenge policies, discourses, social interactions, institutions and power relations.

Here, we tried to understand three related important questions through literature survey: how did soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change in Chinese croplands in the past decades? What are the agronomic management practices and their potentials to increase the SOC of croplands in China? And how do changes in the SOC affect crop yields? The analyses showed that the SOC stock in the surface soil (0–20 cm) of Chinese croplands increased on average by 0.48% yr–1 from 1980 to 2011. The increase was significant in the eastern and northern China, and particularly in the paddy soils in southern China; however it decreased in the northeastern China. The increase of the SOC stock was attributed to substantial increase in organic inputs, resulted from increased crop productivity, the amendments of crop residues and organic manure, the increases in synthetic fertilizer application and the optimal combination of nutrients, as well as adopting no-tillage practice. Increase in the SOC can increase crop yield and reduce yield variability. Additional means to enhance soil carbon sequestration can be application of biochar, and improvement of synthetic nitrogen use efficiency through disseminating formula fertilizer application based on soil testing, optimized application of inorganic and organic fertilizers associated with extension of conservation tillage. Currently, the straw return ratio has reached about 50%, whereas organic fertilization and conservation tillage (about 6.6%) are still at relatively low levels, the recommended management practices can be further extended to the regions with degraded soils and high population pressure. Further implementation of the recommended management practices on Chinese croplands would increase the SOC stock by ≥25.0 Tg C yr–1 or 0.63% yr–1, compensating for Chinese CO2 emissions by ≥1.0%. In conclusion, Chinese croplands can meet the 4 per mille target and play a crucial role in food security, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation.

These challenges can be addressed by combining electrochemical, biological, and bio-electrochemical technologies within existing WWTPs. The results from this review indicate that electrochemical technology is an effective advanced treatment method for WWTPs. However, electrochemical technology is not yet economically suitable as a stand-alone unit for treating wastewater because it consumes energy in the operation process. Electricity generation from biological and bio-electrochemical technologies can provide the power supply needed for WWTP electrochemical processes while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Environ., Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, 361021, China","In this paper, we present a quantitative determination of the NOx emission in Hefei using mobile Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. The measurements were carried out during winter time from December 2016 to February 2017. The measured NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) show a strong spatial gradient with higher values within the city center, indicating the majority of NOx emission sources are located at the city center. A significant “holiday effect” was found by comparing measurements taken during weekdays and weekend. The weekend reduction is more significant in the suburban (∼28%) compared to the city center (∼13%). Mobile measurements of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) were analyzed together with meteorological data to determine the NOx emission by applying the loop-integral method. Detailed error analysis of the NOx emission shows the variation of wind field and large measurement gap dominated the total error of NOx emission calculation. The result shows the NOx emission in Hefei during winter time varies in a wide range from 10 × 1024 to 40 × 1024molecs−1 with an average of 18.44 × 1024molecs−1. Our estimation is about 43% lower than the number reported in the previous emission inventory in 2012. The reduction of NOx emission reflects the successful implementation of emission control measures in recent years. Our result also shows about 73% of the total NOx in the city were transported from outside of the city during winter. The impacts of transported NOx are especially large when air masses originated from heavily polluted regions, i.e. North China Plain and Yangtze River Delta. The result presented provides a better understanding of the impacts of local emissions and transportation of pollutants on the local air quality of Hefei. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","MAX-DOAS; Mobile measurement; NOx emission; Regional transport","Absorption spectroscopy; Air quality; Emission control; Light absorption; Meteorology; Optical emission spectroscopy; Differential optical absorption spectroscopy; Emission control measures; MAX-DOAS; Mobile measurements; NOx emissions; Quantitative determinations; Regional transport; Vertical column densities; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen oxide; atomic absorption spectroscopy; density; emission control; emission inventory; error analysis; estimation method; measurement method; nitrous oxide; quantitative analysis; regional pattern; winter; absorption spectroscopy; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; analytical error; Article; China; circadian rhythm; environmental protection; meteorology; mobile application; multi axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy; priority journal; time; wind; winter; Anhui; China; Hefei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058998123

Several practices have been shown to reduce nutrient runoff and water pollution, and improve soil fertility, while often yielding profits for farmers. Yet many of these beneficial practices remain underutilized. Participants at an expert workshop identified five candidate financial mechanisms that could increase adoption of these beneficial farming practices in four focal Midwest states in the next five years: crop insurance premium subsidies, transformation of the private service provider business model, expansion and targeting of 2019 U.S. Farm Bill funding, development of new state funds, and direction of post-disaster federal funds towards habitat restoration, particularly in floodplains. This study provides rough approximations of the change in nutrient runoff and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the annualized costs, and the nutrient and GHG reductions per dollar likely to result from deployment of each financial mechanism. Based upon these approximations, the adoption of these programs could reduce annual nitrate flows at the outlet of the Ohio and Upper Mississippi River Basins by 25%, surpassing the intermediate 2025 target (20% reduction) and achieving more than half of the long-term target (45% reduction) set by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force. These approximations also illustrate that these five mechanisms could provide the same GHG reductions (∼43 Tg CO2e yr−1) as taking 12 coal-fired energy plants offline. The total cost of these five financial mechanisms is estimated at ∼$2.6 billion, or 64 g of nitrates and ∼17 kg of CO2e per dollar spent. These proposed solutions all face political, financial, cultural or institutional challenges, but with industry support, creative political action, and continued communication of both private and public benefits, they can create meaningful nutrient reductions and rebuild soils by 2022. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beneficial practices; Dead zone; Financial incentives; GHG reductions; Mississippi river basin; Nitrate reductions","coal; nitrate; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; economic development; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental economics; expert system; financial system; greenhouse gas; incentive; local participation; management practice; nitrate; reduction; soil fertility; soil management; subsidy system; agricultural management; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; crop; disaster; energy crop; funding; greenhouse gas; Gulf of Mexico; insurance; Mississippi; nutrient; river basin; runoff; soil; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi; motivation; Ohio; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Midwest; Mississippi Basin; Ohio; United States; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi; Motivation; Ohio; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059334295

The increasing trend of GHG emissions from cement sector highlights the importance of GHG mitigation in this industry. In the current study, bottom-up energy modelling and scenario analyses were used to assess long-term GHG mitigation potential in the cement industry. The developed comprehensive, data-intensive, and technology-rich model is flexible and can be used to study the GHG mitigation potential in different regions. For the case study of Canada, a reference scenario along with 20 GHG emissions’ reduction scenarios were developed in the Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model. For each scenario, cumulative energy saving and GHG reduction potential were analyzed. Furthermore, the net present value, cost of saved energy, and carbon were calculated to assess the economic performance of different scenarios. Carbon abatement cost curves were also developed using the GHG mitigation potential and the cost of implementing different energy efficiency options. Overall, compared to the reference scenario, the cumulative GHG mitigation potentials in the Canadian cement sector are 27 and 59 million tonnes CO2eq. by the years 2030 and 2050, respectively.

For over a decade, the EU has displayed an interest and political motivation to integrate climate policy priorities into its energy governance. However, the history of European energy governance does not start there, though political science scholarship has tended to downplay the importance of energy sector regulation. Recent years have finally seen the merging of two distinct research programs on European energy politics, and the emergence of a more inclusive and historically accurate approach to energy governance in Europe. This thematic issue follows that new paradigm. It is divided into three sections. The first investigates the EU Energy Union, its governance and decarbonization ambitions. The second section looks at the increasing overlaps between energy and competition policies, particularly the role of State Aid Guidelines in influencing energy subsidies-for renewable as well as conventional energy. Finally, the third section analyses the energy and climate policy of “new” EU members and the relationship between the EU and non-members in the energy sector. © 2019. by the authors.","Climate policy; Decarbonization; Electricity; Energy policy; Energy transition; European Union; Governance; Public policy; Renewable energy; State aid",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064149026

Surface methane emission rate, as well as methane content in the landfill gas, were determined for a period of three years. The results indicate that the average methane emission rate from the test cell with passive gas vents (42.13 g/t dry wt./d) was about half of that from the test cell without gas vents (90.33 g/t dry wt./d). Methane emission rates from both test cells fluctuated and were influenced by precipitation. The emission rate during the wet period in the test cell with gas vents (61.67 g/t dry wt./d) was 3 times as much as that observed during the dry period (20.95 g/t dry wt./d). The emission rate during the wet period in the test cell without gas vents (120.33 g/t dry wt./d), was twice the value of that observed during the dry period (60.32 g/t dry wt./d). The measurements also revealed the formation of methane hotspots in the test cell with passive vents after rainfall events, leading to higher localized surface emissions.

Firstly, through the global optimization algorithm, the energy distribution mode under the optimal fuel economy and emission performance state under different initial conditions is obtained in a specific cycle condition. Then the parameters are extracted from the global optimal results. As a reference, the fuzzy control rules are formulated and the corresponding fuzzy control system is designed. Finally, the fuzzy control, global optimal algorithm and traditional fuzzy control designed in this paper are compared. It shows that the fuzzy control based on the global optimal design has a significant improvement in fuel economy and emissions compared with the traditional fuzzy control. It is closer to the global optimal value.

Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and stopped-flow kinetics, we examined the reactive form of 2-KPCC and its single turnover reactions with a suicide substrate and CO2. The reductive half-reaction of 2-KPCC was kinetically and spectroscopically similar to that of a typical DSOR, GSH reductase, in which the active-site histidine had been replaced with an alanine. However, the reduced, reactive form of 2-KPCC was distinct from those typical DSORs. In the absence of the histidine, the flavin and disulfide moieties were no longer coupled via a covalent or charge transfer interaction as in typical DSORs. Similar to thioredoxins, the pKa between 7.5 and 8.1 that controls reactivity appeared to be due to a single proton shared between the cysteines of the dithiol, which effectively stabilizes the attacking cysteine sulfide and renders it capable of breaking the strong C–S bond of the substrate. The lack of a histidine protected 2-KPCC’s reactive intermediate from unwanted protonation; however, without its input as a catalytic acid– base, the oxidative half-reaction where carboxylation takes place was remarkably slow, limiting the overall reaction rate. We conclude that stringent regulation of protons in the DSOR active site supports C–S bond cleavage and selectivity for CO2 fixation. © 2019 Streit et al.

In this study, the potential effects of such closures on air quality and human health were analyzed by linking a regional photochemical model with a health impacts assessment tool. The impacts varied significantly across 13 of the state’s largest coal-fired power plants, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude, even after normalizing by generation. While some power plants had negligible impacts on concentrations at important monitors, average impacts up to 0.5 parts per billion (ppb) and 0.2 µg/m3 and maximum impacts up to 3.3 ppb and 0.9 µg/m3 were seen for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respectively. Individual power plants impacted average visibility by up to 0.25 deciviews in Class I Areas. Health impacts arose mostly from PM2.5 and were an order of magnitude higher for plants that lack scrubbers for SO2. Rankings of health impacts were largely consistent across the base model results and two reduced form models. Carbon dioxide emissions were relatively uniform, ranging from 1.00 to 1.26 short tons/MWh, and can be monetized based on a social cost of carbon. Despite all of these unpaid externalities, estimated direct costs of each power plant exceeded wholesale power prices in 2016. Implications: While their CO2 emission rates are fairly similar, sharply different NOx and SO2 emission rates and spatial factors cause coal-fired power plants to vary by an order of magnitude in their impacts on ozone, particulate matter, and associated health and visibility outcomes. On a monetized basis, the air pollution health impacts often exceed the value of the electricity generated and are of similar magnitude to climate impacts. This suggests that both air pollution and climate should be considered if externalities are used to inform decision making about power-plant dispatch and retirement. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Gas plants; Global warming; Health; Mining; Natural gasoline plants; Ozone; Plant shutdowns; Visibility; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coal power plants; Coal-fired power plant; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Particulate Matter; Regional photochemical modeling; Renewable energies; Social cost of carbon; Fossil fuel power plants; coal; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; Texas; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Power Plants; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060953215

However, the closer the dialogue comes to settling agreements, the more difficult it gets for municipal officials to steer the process and its outcomes in favor of climate proofing.

Post-test the wear scar on the disc was measured and surface deposits in and around the rubbed region were analysed by Micro InfraRed Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (Micro-IRRAS). In most tests the HSF samples gave higher wear than the 25BCS solution; in some cases, up to 77%. After rinsing a similar pattern of surface deposits was observed in and around the wear scar for both the model and HSF. Micro-IRRAS showed the deposits were primarily denatured proteins with an increased β-sheet content. In some cases, trans-alkyl chain/carbonyl components were also present and these were assigned to lipids. Thioflavin T fluorescent imaging also indicated aggregated non-native β-sheet fibrils were present in the deposits and their presence was associated with lower wear. The formation of insoluble, denatured protein films is thought to be the primary lubrication mechanism contributing to surface protection during rubbing. From this and earlier work we suggest inlet shear induces denaturing of proteins resulting in the formation of non-native β-sheet aggregates. This material is entrained into the contact region where it forms the lubricating film. Patient synovial fluid chemistry appears to influence wear, at least in the bench test, and thus could contributes to increased risk of failure, or success, with metal-metal hips.

These studies have been of fundamental importance to understanding the origin of carbonated magmas varying in composition from carbonatitic to kimberlitic. The occurrence of diamonds in natural rocks is further evidence of the presence of (reduced) carbon in the Earth’s interior. The oxygenation of the Earth’s interior (i.e. its redox state) through time has strongly influenced the speciation of carbon from the mantle to mantle-derived magmas and, in turn, to the volcanic gases released to the atmosphere. This paper explains how the knowledge of the oxygen fugacity recorded by mantle rocks and determined through the use of appropriate oxy-thermobarometers allows modelling of the speciation of carbon in the mantle, its mobilization in the asthenospheric mantle by redox partial melting, and its sequestration and storage during subduction by redox freezing processes. The effect of a gradual increase of the mantle fO2 on the mobilization of C is here discussed along with the main variables affecting its transport by subduction into the mantle. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"Carbides; Melting; Phase equilibria; Freezing process; Function of pressure; In compositions; Mantle derived magmas; Mantle rocks; Natural rocks; Oxygen fugacity; Partial melting; Earth atmosphere; carbon dioxide; carbonate; carbonatite; eclogite; magma; melt; oxygenation; peridotite; volcanic gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063323978

This study combines Eddy Covariance (EC) measurements of CO2 flux (FC) during one year period over the city centre of Heraklion with analytical morphological and land cover data to achieve a thorough investigation of the spatiotemporal variability and the controlling factors of FC in the urban setting. The detailed characterization of the urban land cover and 3D structure was performed using high resolution Earth Observation data. The urban morphological data was used to parameterize a turbulent flux source area model and the land cover data used to analyse the contribution of the source area components to the measured FC. Heraklion FC does not present any specific seasonal trend according to the meteorological or vegetation changes throughout the year. Heraklion centre behaves as a net emitter diurnally and throughout the year. The diurnal variability presents a standard pattern in weekdays with a major peak in midday and a secondary in afternoon, clearly following the traffic rush-hour peaks. Space heating emissions during winter remain low, hardly affecting the seasonal and diurnal FC patterns. The main CO2 sources are the major roads and the intersections, where the heavy traffic is located. The source area analysis revealed that traffic contributes 69% to the estimated annual CO2 emissions. Space heating contributes only 11.6%, while human metabolism is estimated to contribute 19.4%. Vegetation cover of the source area is very low and was assumed to have minor effect to the annual FC budget. The estimated total annual emissions of Heraklion case study reach 19.4 kg CO2 m−2 y−1. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Earth observation; Eddy covariance; Source area; Urban environment","Budget control; Digital storage; Emission control; Global warming; Observatories; Space heating; Urban planning; Vegetation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Earth observations; Eddy covariance; Source area; Urban environments; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; eddy covariance; emission inventory; measurement method; observatory; partitioning; seasonal variation; source apportionment; urban pollution; vegetation cover; Article; building; carbon footprint; climate; Eddy covariance; Greece; heating; land use; priority journal; surface area; traffic; urban area; vegetation; Aegean Islands; Crete [Greece]; Greece; Iraklion [Crete]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059856349

This paper assesses biofuels technology readiness and developments to provide foresight to biofuels development in Southern Africa. Efficient conversion pathways, coupled with biomass from waste or high-yielding energy crops, will reduce both the costs of biofuels production, and the environmental impacts. Compared to petroleum fuels, the current commercial biofuels (ethanol, biogas and biodiesel) typically offer carbon emission reductions of 30–50% but are marginally more expensive. The extent of biofuels market penetration will therefore be influenced by mandates (blending targets) and subsidies (green premium). Advanced biofuels promise greater efficiencies and carbon emission reductions at reduced cost but will require further research and development to reach commercialisation. If developed appropriately, biofuels can reduce carbon emissions and improve energy security, while enabling sustainable agriculture and improved natural resources management. © 2018, © 2018 UNU-WIDER.

To get revenues, one of the considered solutions is to implement an urban road toll. Adding to well-known congestion reduction, this solution would get car drivers to contribute better, and it would also lead to reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In these circumstances, it is necessary to assess the potential effects of implementing this type of pricing solution. In this paper, we propose to evaluate this new pricing measure with respect to several urban indicators (environmental, accessibility, social inequality, public transport performance, public funding requirements). We used the MOSART modelling platform to test several pricing solutions for the Lyon Metropolitan Area based on several possible scenarios for the future (2030). The analysis of our results shows that it is possible to implement an urban toll capable of generating new revenues without increasing inequality. Furthermore, if it associated to the transformation of the fleet of vehicles into electric vehicles, it would also generate positive results regarding CO2 emissions. As a consequence, urban road toll and electric vehicles become the winning ticket for Lyon Metropolitan Area in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Public funding requirements); Public policy evaluation; Public transport performance; Social inequality; Urban indicators (environmental; Urban road pricing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062893806

However, the decrease in these target contaminants in soils is not necessarily followed by a decrease in toxicity. The remaining contaminants can be enough to retain toxicity, while incomplete degradation of several compounds can generate sub-products, which can be even more toxic. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess acute and chronic toxicity in Eisenia andrei exposed to soil contaminated with 5% spent lubricant oil before and after 22 months of bioremediation in 150 L aerobic reactors. Applied bioremediation strategies were biostimulation (BIOS), bioaugmentation by adding mature compost from municipal solid waste (BIOA 1 ) and bioaugmentation by adding non-mature compost from municipal solid waste (BIOA 2 ). After 22 months, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were reduced 71% in BIOS and 73% in both BIOA 1 and BIOA 2 . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were reduced in about 98% in all treatments (BIOS, BIOA 1 and BIOA 2 ). At the 14 th day of exposure, mortality rates were 7 ± 2, 20 ± 0, 75 ± 25, 93 ± 12 and 100 ± 0% for Eisenia andrei exposed to CONT (soil with no oil addition), BIOS, OLU (soil newly contaminated with 5% spent oil), BIOA 1 and BIOA 2 , respectively. After 14 days, surviving specimens in both BIOS and OLU soils exhibited anatomic deformations, less biomass than the controls, and decrease in juvenile forms and coelomocytes. After 28 days, the mortality rate for BIOS and OLU soils increased to 97 and 100%, respectively. Therefore, even with a reduction of 71–73% for TPH and 98% for PAH, toxic effects remained in all soils bioremediated, probably due to the remaining hydrocarbons and/or hydrocarbon biodegradation products. The results indicate that both chemical analyses and toxicological monitoring are required to follow-up soil remediation progress. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bioaugmentation; Biostimulation; Contaminated soil; Ecotoxicity; Petroleum hydrocarbons","petroleum derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; spent lubricant oil; unclassified drug; bioremediation; composting; earthworm; ecotoxicology; lubricant; mortality; municipal solid waste; oil pollution; petroleum hydrocarbon; soil pollution; soil remediation; acute toxicity; Article; bioaugmentation; biodegradation; biomass; bioremediation; biostimulation; chemical analysis; chronic toxicity; coelomocyte; compost; controlled study; Eisenia andrei; environmental monitoring; follow up; leukocyte; mortality rate; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; priority journal; soil pollution; toxicity testing; animal; bioremediation; chemistry; comparative study; drug effect; oil spill; Oligochaeta; soil; soil pollutant; time factor; toxicity testing; Eisenia andrei; Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Oligochaeta; Petroleum Pollution; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Time Factors; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Toxicity Tests, Chronic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059852872

The nexus of wheat productivity with selected climatic variables that includes temperature, precipitation and humidity was also inquired through this research. Panel data of wheat crop's input and aforesaid climatic variables for the period of thirty years (1985-2015) was employed to figure-out the major findings. Econometric diagnostic tests were used to verify the model stability. Therefore, LM test was encompassed to detect the serial correlation. The result of Hausman test has suggested applying ""Fixed Effect Model"" for further analysis. Major estimates of the overall 30 years data reveal that among non-climatic variables, area under wheat cultivation and seed are highly significant to the wheat yield at 1 percent level of significance. Whereas, contribution of fertilizer to wheat crop in KP province was observed insignificant. Furthermore, the computation of climatic variables depicts that temperature contributes significantly but has inverse association with wheat yield in KP province. This implies that surge in temperature by one Celsius degree centigrade (0C) can drop-down the wheat yield by 0.074 percent. The impact of precipitation was also observed negative with wheat crop in the panel data since 1985 to 2000. This study concludes that temperature and precipitation have inverse association with wheat production while humidity is positively associated.

In the present study, atmospheric PM10 and PM2.5 were measured during 2014–15 at a semi-urban site in Dehradun, situated in the Doon valley between the Shivalik range and lesser Himalayas. Based on the information of chemical species associated with the particles, source apportionment study was performed using positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. The carcinogenic risk due to inhalation of PM was calculated through inhalation unit risk. The atmospheric PM showed a seasonal cycle with a maximum during winter (PM10: 90 ± 32 μg m−3; PM2.5: 63 ± 27 μg m−3) and minimum during summer season (PM10: 87 ± 40 μg m−3; PM2.5: 39 ± 19 μg m−3). Identified major sources of atmospheric PM are soil/road dust, vehicular activities, industrial activities, mixed aerosols, and anthropogenic burning. Seasonal variation of sources reveals that during summer, soil/road dust (56%) is the predominant source of PM10, whereas industrial activities (50%) in case of PM2.5. During winter, mixed aerosols comprising of emissions from vehicular activities, biomass and anthropogenic burning (62%) are predominant sources of PM10, whereas industrial activities (42%) in case of PM2.5. The study of aerosol vertical profile using satellite-derived CALIPSO data reveals the presence of polluted aerosol at high altitude (0.6–2.9 km) over Doon valley, suggesting the influence of neighboring polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region during both seasons. The carcinogenic risk assessment revealed that inhalation of PM over Dehradun can cause health risk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dehradun; Health risk; Particulate matter; Positive matrix factorization; Source apportionment","Aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Dust; Factorization; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Matrix algebra; Risk assessment; Urban growth; Aerosol vertical profiles; Atmospheric particulate matter; Carcinogenic risk assessments; Dehradun; Particulate Matter; Positive Matrix Factorization; Positive matrix factorization models; Source apportionment; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078982991

To better achieve emission reduction targets, it is necessary to study the characteristics of carbon dioxide emissions in Asia and their emission reduction potential. Firstly, the gravity movement of Asia's carbon dioxide emissions and its leading forces are explored. Then, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method is applied to find the driving factors governing carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, this paper establishes a theoretical model of carbon dioxide emission reduction. At last, the influencing factors are utilized to construct a decoupling index, which is used to describe the dependence of economic development on carbon dioxide emissions. The gravity center for Asia's carbon dioxide emissions was an overall movement towards southwest. However, the gravity center for carbon dioxide emissions per capita was an overall movement towards the southeast. The energy intensity effect was the most factor decreasing Asia's carbon dioxide emissions. Only five countries achieved theoretical reduction of carbon dioxide emissions over 2000–2015. However, three countries were failed to achieve the theoretical reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in this period.

The distribution of the carbon nanotubes is varied through the plate thickness in accordance with a modified power law. Four types of carbon nanotube distributions are considered. The four edges of the plate are simply supported for Navier method, whereas for Levy method, two opposite only of them are simply supported and the other ones are arbitrary. The present FGCNT plate is subjected to uniform, linear, sinusoidal or exponential distributed loadings. A refined shear deformation plate theory with four unknown functions is employed to obtain the closed form solution. The four coupled governing partial differential equations are derived utilizing Hamilton's principle. Applying Levy solution and then the state space concept to the governing equations, a nonhomogeneous first-order linear ordinary differential system with constant coefficients is obtained. The solution of the homogeneous system (homogeneous solution) is obtained by using the matrix method. While, the method of undetermined coefficients is applied to find the particular solution of the nonhomogeneous linear system.

The Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) contribution to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016) seeks to improve our understanding of this phenomenon through a coordinated set of numerical model experiments documented here. In particular, PAMIP will address the following primary questions: (1) what are the relative roles of local sea ice and remote sea surface temperature changes in driving polar amplification? (2) How does the global climate system respond to changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice? These issues will be addressed with multi-model simulations that are forced with different combinations of sea ice and/or sea surface temperatures representing present-day, pre-industrial and future conditions. The use of three time periods allows the signals of interest to be diagnosed in multiple ways. Lower-priority tier experiments are proposed to investigate additional aspects and provide further understanding of the physical processes. These experiments will address the following specific questions: what role does ocean-atmosphere coupling play in the response to sea ice? How and why does the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice depend on the pattern of sea ice page1140 forcing? How and why does the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice depend on the model background state? What have been the roles of local sea ice and remote sea surface temperature in polar amplification, and the response to sea ice, over the recent period since 1979? How does the response to sea ice evolve on decadal and longer timescales? A key goal of PAMIP is to determine the real-world situation using imperfect climate models. Although the experiments proposed here form a coordinated set, we anticipate a large spread across models. However, this spread will be exploited by seeking ""emergent constraints"" in which model uncertainty may be reduced by using an observable quantity that physically explains the intermodel spread. In summary, PAMIP will improve our understanding of the physical processes that drive polar amplification and its global climate impacts, thereby reducing the uncertainties in future projections and predictions of climate change and variability. © 2019 Author(s).",,"amplification; anthropogenic effect; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate change; CMIP; global climate; numerical model; radiative forcing; sea ice; sea surface temperature; simulation; surface temperature; Arctic and Antarctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063428019

One of the important processes of the society which is affected by present-day climate change scenario is the wastewater management. Wastewater includes municipal sewage effluents, industrial effluents and urban and agricultural runoff, which without appropriate management could be harmful to human health. Changing climate impacts wastewater systems through changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, sea level rise and storm-related changes. It is estimated that climate change has a dual effect on water resources and wastewater treatment plants. Climate change events like extreme weather range will lead to more untreated wastewater. As such, the necessity for wastewater management is continuously increasing. However, emission of certain greenhouse gases like CO2, CH4 and N2O during the process of wastewater treatment further contributes to the already aggravated problem of climate change. As such, there exists a nonending scuffle between the phenomenon of climate change and wastewater management, each intensifying the other problem. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Wastewater treatment plants; Water; Weather",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074678284

Fertilizer management practices included nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilization, manure application, and root-stubble retention of all three crops. Soil carbon (C) model RothC was used to simulate the critical C input rates needed to maintain initial soil C level in long timescale (44 years). SOC change was significantly influenced by the long-term fertilizer management practices and the edaphic variable of initial SOC content. The effects of fertilizer combination “100%NPK+FYM” on SOC changes were most significant over “100%NPK” fertilization. If the 100% NPK fertilizer along with manure applied with stubble and roots retention of all crops, alluvial soils of such agro-ecosystem would act as a net C sink, and the average SOC density kept increasing from 18.18 Mg ha−1 during 1972 to the current average of ∼22 Mg ha−1 during 2065 s. On an average, the critical C input was estimated to be 5.30 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, depending on local soil and climatic conditions. The critical C input could be effectively estimated using a summary model driven by current SOC level, mean annual temperature, precipitation, and soil clay content. Such information will provide a baseline for assessing soil C dynamics under potential changes in fertilizer and crop residues management practices, and thus enable development of management strategies for effectively mitigating climate change through soil C sequestration. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon sequestration; jute-rice-wheat system; long-term fertilization; RothC model","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural modeling; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; clay soil; climate change; crop residue; fertilizer application; management practice; organic carbon; rice; soil carbon; soil nutrient; strategic approach; wheat; Corchorus capsularis; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062950277

Long-dated capital-intensive asset industries like electricity supply anticipate a conventional policy cycle. What they have experienced instead is consistent with garbage can theory. Policy clarity may be emerging for only the second time in two decades.

Depending on thermal conditions, certain trees tend to emit more biogenic volatile organic compounds, which act as precursors for ozone formation, thus hampering air quality. Combining a theoretical approach from a box model analysis and microscale modeling from the microclimate model ENVI-met, we analyze this relationship for a selected region in Germany and provide the link to air quality prediction and climate sensitive urban planning. A box model study was conducted, indicating higher ozone levels with higher isoprene concentration, especially in NO-saturated atmospheres. ENVI-met sensitivity studies showed that different urban layouts strongly determine local isoprene emissions of vegetation, with leaf temperature, rather than photosynthetic active radiation, being the dominant factor. The impact of isoprene emission on the ozone in complex urban environments was simulated for an urban area for a hot summer day with and without isoprene. A large isoprene-induced relative ozone increase was found over the whole model area. On selected hot spots we find a clear relationship between urban layout, proximity to NOx emitters, tree-species-dependent isoprene emission capacity, and increases in ozone concentration, rising up to 500% locally. © 2019 by the authors.

Well-intentioned AM actions could alter disease dynamics for target species and recipient sites, resulting in unanticipated detrimental economic and ecological impacts. Although disease risks are occasionally mentioned in AM debates, current regulations or best practices that reduce or mitigate these complex risks are generally lacking in North America. We use the “Disease Triangle”, a foundational framework in pathology, to illustrate pathways through which AM may impact disease emergence, to identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest best practices to reduce disease risks. We highlight empirical examples in which altering pathogen distributions, host communities, and environment have historically resulted in costly and ecologically damaging diseases in plants. Although guidelines to reduce disease risks in AM are generally lacking, policies governing endangered species, invasive species, and disease management can provide starting points for a more comprehensive policy. We use examples from the United States to identify key strengths and weaknesses that can inform regulations to reduce disease risks associated with AM.

Design/methodology/approach: Different serious academic databases were searched for material regarding the issue of air pollution in Mexico, such as Scopus and Social Science Citation Index. Regional concern was an important factor that was considered in this review. Material was considered based on its recency, academic importance and veracity. The studies selected mainly ranged from the mid-1990s to 2018. Findings: Air pollution in Mexico has been a primary issue for the country’s administration and that of Mexico’s North American neighbour, the USA. It has contributed significantly to climate change and has had detrimental effects on both the environment and on the health of Mexican citizens in various ways. While efforts to ameliorate the situation have been relatively strong, it is hoped that ongoing cooperation between Mexico, the USA and Canada will influence the development of stricter emissions standards. Originality/value: This paper considers current circumstances and whether enough has been done to mitigate Mexico’s significant air pollution problem. It also considers several recommendations made by commentators as to potential future directions to rectify the issues, as no similar review has been made for a developing Country. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Air pollution; Air quality; Management; Mexico; Mexico city; Urban areas","air quality; atmospheric pollution; developing world; emission control; emission inventory; future prospect; strategic approach; urban area; urban pollution; waste management; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; Scopus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056202154

The effects of environmental variations of stress factors, such as rainfall and temperature, on the kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence (CF) induction in leaves of three genotypes, Janaúba (NEF 01), CPATSA 1501 (NEF 02), and CPATSA C2/10 (NEF 03), were investigated for 4 years. High performance of photosystem II, transpiration rate, and rate of net CO2 assimilation were observed mainly in the NEF 02 accession. Since it was necessary to understand the dependence of tolerance mechanisms to diverse environmental stresses, the NEF team followed the development of these plants in several locations. The coastal region presents warm humid tropical climate, in contrast with an inland region where the temperature is very hot in the summer and cold in winter with extremes around 8C. The development of J. curcas plants was affected by the level of photosynthetically active radiation, seasonality of temperature and precipitation, casting doubt on the agroclimatic zoning, which meant that physiological variables needed to be considered. The plants with the best yield were those grown in the inland region, although the photochemical efficiency (PIABS and PITOTAL) and the net assimilation of CO2 (A) of the plants in the coastal region were higher. The molecular mechanisms underlying the species adaptability may serve for modeling plant traits in order to maximize biofuel production and improve the agronomic features. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Net CO2 assimilation; Photochemical efficiency; Photosynthetically active radiation; Rainfall; Temperature",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078643299

In this study, we use historical (2010–2015) environmental sea surface temperature (SST), upwelling index (UI), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and biological (i.e., anchovy adults acoustic presence) data (i.e., Maxent) to determine anchovy habitat suitability in the coastal areas off central-northern (25°S–32°S) Chile. Using geographic information systems (GIS), the model was forced by changes in regionalized SST, UI and Chl-a as projected by IPCC models under the RPC (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) emissions scenarios for the simulation period 2015–2050. The model simulates, for all RCP scenarios, negative responses in anchovy presence, reflecting the predicted changes in environmental variables, dominated by a future positive (warming) change in SST and UI, and a decrease in chlorophyll-a (i.e., phytoplankton biomass). The model predicts negative changes in habitat suitability in coastal areas from north of Taltal (25°S) to south of Caldera (27°45′S) and in Coquimbo littoral zone (29°–30°12′S).

Planners have responded with approaches to control low-density development (‘sprawl’) that dominates North American exurbia. However, the ability of sprawl alternatives to preserve ecosystem services have not been systematically evaluated. Using a novel integration of land change simulation and ecosystem services modeling, we used proxies to estimate changes in water quality, climate regulation and biodiversity, and returns to landowners associated with sprawl alternatives and business-as-usual trends for the rapidly urbanizing Charlotte (NC) region by 2030. We found no single growth scenario simultaneously reduced pollution, stored additional carbon, and retained sensitive habitat, underscoring trade-offs likely encountered when balancing development and environmental outcomes. Watersheds at the extremes of the urban-rural gradient exhibited significantly different and often opposing responses to policies aimed at reducing environmental impacts. Scenarios of increased land use density yielded stronger financial returns to landowners as concentrated economic activity drove up land rents while minimizing broader pollution costs. Our simulated landscape approach overcame limitations associated with scale and data, and projected regional environmental outcomes emerging from local development events. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem service planning; Land change model; Non-point source pollution; Urban density; Urban form; Urban growth modeling","Biodiversity; Climate change; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Land use; Pollution; Rural areas; Water quality; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Land change modeling; Non-point source pollution; Urban density; Urban form; Urban growth modeling; Urban growth; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental planning; land use change; nonpoint source pollution; scenario analysis; trade-off; urban growth; urban morphology; urban sprawl; Charlotte; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056267088

However, the origin and evolution of these filaments are not yet well understood, partly because of the lack of kinematic information. Aims. We confirm from a kinematic viewpoint that the Taurus B211/B213 filament is accreting background cloud material, and we investigate the potential influence of large-scale external effects on the formation of the filament. Methods. To examine whether the B211/B213 filament is accreting background gas because of its gravitational potential, we produced a toy accretion model and compared its predictions to the velocity patterns observed in 12CO (1-0) and 13CO (1-0). We also examined the spatial distributions of Hα, Planck 857 GHz dust continuum, and HI emission to search for evidence of large-scale external effects. Results. We estimate that the depth of the Taurus cloud around the B211/B213 filament is ~0.3-0.7 pc under the assumption that the density of the gas is the same as the critical density of 13CO (1-0). Compared to a linear extent of &gt;10 pc in the plane of the sky, this suggests that the 3D morphology of the cloud urrounding the B211/B213 filament is sheet-like. Position-velocity (PV) diagrams observed in 12CO (1-0) and 13CO (1-0) perpendicular to the filament axis show that the emission from the gas surrounding B211/B213 is redshifted to the northeast of the filament and blueshifted to the southwest, and that the velocities of both components approach the velocity of the B211/B213 filament as the line of sight approaches the crest of the filament. The PV diagrams predicted by our accretion model are in good agreement with the observed 12CO (1-0) and 13CO (1-0) PV diagrams, supporting the previously proposed scenario of mass accretion into the filament. Moreover, inspection of the spatial distribution of the Hα and Planck 857 GHz emission in the Taurus-California-Perseus region on scales up to &gt;200 pc suggests that the B211/B213 filament may have formed as a result of an expanding supershell generated by the Per OB2 association. Conclusions. Based on these results, we propose a scenario in which the B211/B213 filament was initially formed by large-scale compression of HI gas and is now growing in mass by gravitationally accreting molecular gas of the ambient cloud. © 2019 Y.

Here, we examined how climate conditions, plant diversity and soil properties affect EDGs of soil bacteria at different soil depths. Bacterial communities were investigated at four soil depths in 60 vegetation survey plots along elevational gradients in central Japan. In this study, elevational gradients reflected climate conditions, including mean annual temperature and seasonality of temperature and precipitation. Bacterial diversity decreased with elevation in the surface soil, but showed no relationship with elevation in deep soils. The structural equation modeling showed that soil bacterial diversity was directly affected by plant functional diversity, where leaf C:N ratio diversity had stronger effects than soil properties. We found that EDGs of soil bacteria were determined by the degree of indirect effects of climate conditions, via plant functional diversity and soil properties, against the direct effect of climate conditions on bacterial diversity. These findings demonstrate that community assembly of soil microbes is causally linked with climate conditions, plant functional diversity and soil properties, which determine EDGs. © FEMS 2019.","forest ecosystems; functional traits; microbial diversity; plant-soil linkages; soil depth; structural equation modeling","bacterium; climate conditions; equation; forest ecosystem; microbial community; soil depth; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; Japan; Bacteria (microorganisms); altitude; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; climate; ecosystem; genetics; isolation and purification; latent class analysis; metabolism; microbiology; plant; soil; Altitude; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Climate; Ecosystem; Latent Class Analysis; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062954028

Multiple studies have predicted the potential risks posed by rapidly expanding glacial lakes in the Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) National Park and Buffer Zone of Nepal. People’s perceptions of such cryospheric hazards can influence their actions, beliefs, and responses to those hazards and associated risks. This study provides a systematic approach that combines household survey data with ethnography to analyze people’s perceptions of GLOF risks and the socioeconomic and cultural factors influencing their perceptions. A statistical logit model of household data showed a significant positive correlation between the perceptions of GLOF risks and livelihood sources, mainly tourism. Risk perceptions are also influenced by spatial proximity to glacial lakes and whether a village is in potential flood zones. The 2016 emergency remediation work implemented in the Imja Tsho (glacial lake) has served as a cognitive fix, especially in the low-lying settlements. Much of uncertainty and confusions related GLOF risks among locals can be attributed to a disconnect between how scientific information is communicated to the local communities and how government climate change policies have been limited to awareness campaigns and emergency remediation efforts. A sustainable partnership of scientists, policymakers, and local communities is urgently needed to build a science-driven, community-based initiative that focuses not just in addressing a single GLOF threat but develops on a comprehensive cryospheric risk management plan and considers opportunities and challenges of tourism in the local climate adaptation policies. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Cryospheric hazards; GLOFs; Mt.

We simultaneously examined the community compositions and structures of soil bacteria, fungi, and diazotrophs across desert, typical, and meadow steppes in Inner Mongolia using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that soil bacteria, fungi, and diazotrophs exhibited different distribution patterns across steppe types. Although different steppes displayed obvious differences in climate conditions, plant traits, and soil properties, most of bacterial species were shared by all the steppes while only a few species were unique, indicating that the soil bacterial compositions were hardly influenced by the steppe types. Nevertheless, the habitat heterogeneity could cause shifts in the relative abundance of some bacterial groups, which resulted in significant changes in the community structure of soil bacteria across steppes. However, the fungal community compositions and structures were similar in typical and meadow steppes but that in desert steppe were significantly different. Whereas, the community compositions and structures of diazotrophs were strongly related to the steppe types. In this study, the similar parent material backgrounds of the steppe soils might be the important factor in shaping the homologous bacterial compositions. However, the variations in soil fertility, soil water repellency, and plant species across steppes would be the major driving forces in regulating the compositions and structures of fungal communities, while the diazotrophic communities would be more closely related to the changes in plant traits and soil fertility among steppes.

In this study, concentrations of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) throughout China, and specifically in nine typical urban agglomerations and one economic region, were statistically analyzed using high-resolution ground-based PM2.5 observations from June 2014 to May 2018. The spatial variation of PM2.5 was also explored via spatial autocorrelation analysis. High annual mean PM2.5 concentrations were predominantly concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Central Plain, Northern Slope of Tianshan Mountain, and Cheng-Yu urban agglomerations, as well as the Huaihai Economic Region. The proportion of air quality nationwide monitoring sites where annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) Grade II annual standard were 82.8%, 77.1%, and 70.8% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Moreover, the frequency of PM2.5 concentrations meeting the CAAQS Grade I 24-h standard increased in five national-level urban agglomerations, and the average annual PM2.5 decreased from 2015 to 2017 with a reduction rate of over 20%. The southern Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration and surrounding areas revealed the highest PM2.5 pollution in four seasons. Monthly mean PM2.5 typically exhibited a characteristic “U” shape. Diurnal mean PM2.5 concentrations were generally consistent with typical urban agglomerations, with maximum and minimum PM2.5 values occurring at approximately 08:00–12:00 and 15:00–17:00, respectively, except for the Northern Slope of Tianshan Mountain urban agglomeration (NSTM-UA) (14:00 and 08:00, respectively). A positive spatial autocorrelation of PM2.5 concentrations was observed in all urban agglomerations (except NSTM-UA); high-high agglomeration centers of PM2.5 pollution were located far inland with a circular distribution, and low-low agglomeration centers formed at the periphery of the high-high agglomeration region. This study is key for understanding the difference in PM2.5 concentrations among urban agglomerations and region-oriented air pollution control strategies are highly suggested. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; PM2.5 concentrations; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial-temporal variations; Urban agglomeration","Air pollution control; Air quality; Air quality standards; Autocorrelation; Economics; China; PM2.5 concentration; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial temporals; Urban agglomerations; Agglomeration; agglomeration; air quality; atmospheric pollution; autocorrelation; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution monitoring; spatiotemporal analysis; urban atmosphere; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; article; China; monitoring; particulate matter; season; spatial autocorrelation analysis; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Tien Shan; Citrus maxima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056794320

Annual forest maps (1986-2016) of Guangdong, China were generated using time series Landsat images and PALSAR data. Initially, four PALSAR-based classifiers were used to classify land cover types. Then, the optimal mapping algorithm was determined. Next, an accurate identification of forest and non-forest was carried out by combining Landsat-based phenological variables and PALSAR-based land cover classifications. Finally, the spatio-temporal distribution of forest cover change due to afforestation was created and its forest biomass dynamics changes were detected. The results indicated that the overall accuracy of forest classification of the improved model based on the PALSAR-based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) classification and the maximum value of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; SGB-NDVI) were approximately 75-85% in 2005, 2010, and 2016. Compared with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) PALSAR-forest/non-forest, the SGB-NDVI-based forest product showed great improvement, while the SGB-NDVI product was the same or slightly inferior to the Global Land Cover (GLC) and vegetation tracker change (VCT)-based land cover types, respectively. Although this combination of multiple sources contained some errors, the SGB-NDVI model effectively identified the distribution of forest cover changes by afforestation events. By integrating aboveground biomass dynamics (AGB) change with forest cover, the trend in afforestation area closely corresponded with the trend in forest AGB. This technique can provide an essential data baseline for carbon assessment in the planted forests of southern China. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass; Data integration; Forest change (afforestation); Landsat; PALSAR; Time series","Biomass; Carbon; Conformal mapping; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Space research; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Vegetation; Active and passive remote sensing; Forest change; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; LANDSAT; Normalized difference vegetation index; PALSAR; Spatiotemporal distributions; Stochastic gradient boosting; Data integration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062939637

The key finding is that these local policy innovations have played an important role to kick off carbon trading activities effectively, by addressing a number of challenges such as highly imbalanced economic and political contexts, very limited emissions data and technological capacity, and low participants’ awareness of ETS. The implications of such policy innovations to the construction of a nationwide ETS system are also discussed.

Total carbon in soil is accounted to be more than combined carbon in the vegetation and atmosphere; it contributes significantly to climate adaptation, biodiversity and nutrient recycling. These basic characteristics are essential for global food security, eco-friendly environment, and human welfare. The method of eliminating atmospheric CO2 and its accumulation in the soil carbon pool known as carbon sequestration is primarily mediated by plants through the process of photosynthesis and respiration. Ultimately, dead animal and plant residues are decomposed by microbes through their saprophytic, mutual or pathogenic activities. Thus, microbes are the chief modulators of the terrestrial carbon cycle and regulate the net carbon storage or turnover rates in soil carbon sequestration (SCS). Recent studies are shading light on the major factors involved in the mechanism of SCS and their associations with soil-plant-microbe interactions. These factors mainly include soil properties (soil depth, type, pH, pore space, bulk density, and texture), climate parameters (temperature and precipitation) and land management practices (LMPs). This chapter summarizes the basic concept of carbon sequestration, forms of carbon (organic and inorganic), factors influencing the SCS and microbial activity, microbial communities associated with SCS and their potential in enhancing the soil carbon storage. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Carbon sequestration; Organic soil carbon; Priming effect; Soil fertility; Soil microbial biomass; Soil-plant-microbial interactions",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074348712

Estimating the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on ES values (ESV) is an important tool to support decision making. This study used remote sensing and GIS tools to analyze LULC change and transitions from 2001 to 2016 and assess its impact on ESV in a tropical forested landscape in the southern plains of Nepal. The total ESV of the landscape for the year 2016 is estimated at USD 1264 million year-1. As forests are the dominant land cover class and have high ES value per hectare, they have the highest contribution in total ESV. However, as a result of LULC change (loss of forests, water bodies, and agricultural land), the total ESV of the landscape has declined by USD 11 million year-1. Major reductions come from the loss in values of climate regulation, water supply, provision of raw materials and food production. To halt the ongoing loss of ES and maintain the supply and balance of different ES in the landscape, it is important to properly monitor, manage and utilize ecosystems. We believe this study will inform policymakers, environmental managers, and the general public on the ongoing changes and contribute to developing effective land use policy in the region. © 2019 by the authors.","Deforestation and forest degradation; Ecosystem service valuation; Land use and land cover change; Remote sensing; Tropical forests",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066875446

The estimates of idling fuel losses and corresponding emissions were expanded to ∼950 signalized intersections presently operational in Delhi city. In the study, idling fuel consumption tests were carried out using a fuel flow meter set-up on 341 test vehicles of different categories representing the traffic mix of Delhi. Direct greenhouse gases (viz., CO2, CH4 and N2O) and indirect greenhouse gases (viz., CO, NOx and NMVOC) emissions were estimated using fuel-based IPCC emission factors. The results indicated that every day 9036 liters of petrol, diesel, LPG and 5461 kg of CNG losses occurred due to the idling of motor vehicles at these intersections which is equivalent to nearly 4.5million USD per year. GHG emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) estimated were ∼37 tonnes of CO2 eq/day.

The reasons for this are that coal-fired power plants offer localized large point sources (LPS) of CO 2 and that the Indian power sector contributes to roughly half of all-India CO 2 emissions. CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) can be implemented in these power plants for long-term decarbonisation of the Indian economy. In this paper, two artificial intelligence (AI) techniques—adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi gene genetic programming (MGGP) are used to model Indian coal-fired power plants with CO 2 capture. The data set of 75 power plants take the plant size, the capture type, the load and the CO 2 emission as the input and the COE and annual CO 2 emissions as the output. It is found that MGGP is more suited to these applications with an R 2 value of more than 99% between the predicted and actual values, as against the ~96% correlation for the ANFIS approach. MGGP also gives the traditionally expected results in sensitivity analysis, which ANFIS fails to give. Several other parameters in the base plant and CO 2 capture unit may be included in similar studies to give a more accurate result. This is because MGGP gives a better perspective toward qualitative data, such as capture type, as compared to ANFIS. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","artificial intelligence; carbon capture and storage; genetic programming; neuro fuzzy; power plants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025074804

In this study, we investigated soil amendment of municipal wastewater treatment (MSS) converted biochar for its recycling in agricultural soils. In a field experiment, unpyrolyzed (USS) and pyrolyzed municipal sewage sludge (PSS) was amended at 20 t ha −1 on dry base to a rice paddy before rice plantation, with a control without amendment. Grain yield and emission of non-CO 2 potent greenhouse gases were examined as well as topsoil metal mobility and plant uptake determined throughout a rice-wheat rotation year. Compared to USS treatment, addition of PSS caused a significantly increased grain yield of rice by 35% but no change in grain yield of wheat following the rice season. No distinct difference was observed in grain concentration of major nutrients of N, P, and K between USS and PSS treatments. Compared to USS treatment, PSS treatment reduced CH 4 emissions by 91.6% from soil and by 78.5% from ecosystem during rice-growing season. Whereas, PSS treatment led to a reduction of ecosystem N 2 O emissions by 70.8% relative to USS treatment during wheat-growing season. While both USS and PSS treatments slightly but insignificantly increased soil total content of heavy metals, PSS treatment reduced CaCl 2 -extractable Cd pool by 33~40% over USS treatment. Grain contents of Cd and Pb and Cd/Zn were markedly reduced under PSS over USS, without exceeding the Chinese state guideline limit. Carbon emission intensity was considerably (by over 20%) reduced for soil and ecosystem but unchanged for wheat soil, under PSS over USS. Thus, soil amendment of pyrolyzed sewage sludge could be a measure for climate smart soil and for safe grain production in rice agriculture. It deserves further study if repeated amendment could exert sustainable impacts on soil health and food security in the paddy. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biochar; Biowaste treatment; C emission intensity; Greenhouse gas; Heavy metals; Pyrolysis; Rice paddy; Sewage sludge","biochar; concentration (composition); element mobility; food security; heavy metal; municipal solid waste; paddy field; pyrolysis; reduction; sewage; sludge; soil amendment; wastewater treatment; Triticum aestivum; biochar; carbon; charcoal; heavy metal; agriculture; air pollution; analysis; food grain; Oryza; procedures; rotation; sewage; soil; statistics and numerical data; wheat; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Carbon; Charcoal; Edible Grain; Metals, Heavy; Oryza; Rotation; Sewage; Soil; Triticum; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061205072

A number of policies have been implemented in Tehran during the last two decades to tackle the air quality issue. Concentrated mostly on transportation sector, these policies aimed to improve fuel quality and emission performance of vehicles. Nevertheless, there is no quantified evaluation regarding the effectiveness of such policies. In order to address the air pollution problem, a comprehensive policy package called Tehran comprehensive clean air action plan have been developed. This study quantifies the impacts of these policies on pollutants emission from mobile sources in Tehran using the emission inventory approach. Furthermore, the mobile source emission inventory of Tehran is updated considering monthly temperature and humidity changes. The results show that after implementation of Tehran clean air act, the emission of CO, VOC, NOx and PM will reduce by 20, 19, 14 and 17%, respectively. The most effective policies are shown to be bus and minibus renovation in case of PM emissions, and implementation of LEZ on passenger cars and motorcycles, taxis renovation and catalyst replacement in case of other air pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Emission inventory; Policy evaluation; Tehran",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060345195

Heat waves have been described by several attributes and combinations which constitute various event typologies. Attributes of heat waves from 10 cities are analyzed over the period 1950–2016 to understand how these attributes determine variability in local heat waves and how climate change affects heat waves across the United States. This study uses eight definitions to differentiate heat waves and tests for temporal trends in key properties of heat waves over the period 1950–2016. At least five harmful attributes of heat waves have increased simultaneously for Dallas, Miami, New York, Phoenix, and Portland.Miami showed the greatest change in heat wave season length, frequency, and timing over the study period. Surprisingly, the greatest mean heat wave intensities above daily thresholds were for Bismarck, ND (+8.2 °C) and Syracuse, NY (+6.5 °C). Similar results across Baltimore, MD, Colorado Springs, CO, Dallas, TX, Des Moines, IA, Miami, FL, New York, NY, Phoenix, AZ, and Portland, OR, are presented to clarify the many quantitative differences in heat wave attributes and variance in quantification approaches across climates. This work explores the nexus of quantitative description and social construction of heat waves through the lens of the various regional metrics to describe heat waves.

Many studies have addressed public acceptance through a case-based empirical lens with rather specific conclusions for individual technologies in a given context. This paper draws more universal insights by conducting an online survey on public acceptance for a set of technologies in the three sub-regions of the Upper Rhine region (URR). Using a representative dataset of 495 German, 501 French, and 493 Swiss inhabitants of the URR, several hypotheses from the acceptance literature are tested across sub-regions and RE technologies and results are compared to related empirical studies from the literature. Moreover, we explore for the first time how public acceptance is linked with community energy and energy autonomy. The latter is especially important to understand how policy and project initiators can mobilise the population to contribute to the energy transition. Our main findings are that public acceptance is, inter alia, highly dependent on the technology in question, the dimension of social acceptance (community versus socio-political dimension) and previous experiences with RE technologies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community energy; Energy autonomy; International survey; Public acceptance; Renewable energy","Surveys; Community energy; Energy autonomies; International survey; Public acceptance; Renewable energies; Climate change; alternative energy; autonomy; comparative study; energy policy; energy use; public attitude; survey method; France; Germany; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057266475

Without a good understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Swedish consumption, the formulation of efficient and well targeted policy initiatives to reach the generational goal is difficult. We have analysed the impacts of Swedish consumption in detail, investigating the impacts of different final consumers and different consumption clusters as well as the geographical location of where GHGs are emitted to satisfy Swedish demand. We use environmentally extended multi-regional input-output (EEMRIO) analysis and the database EXIOBASE3 to compute Swedish consumption-based (CB) GHG emissions over a time period of 20 years. Our study shows that total CB GHG emissions fluctuated but remained rather stable over the years. However, the origin of the emissions changed from within Sweden to outside Sweden's borders. CB emissions within Sweden have decreased substantially through a reduction of direct emissions associated with domestic heating and mobility, whereas GHG emissions outside Sweden have increased, especially in China and in the rest of Asia. We show that manufactured products are responsible for a large share of this development, displaying a strong trend toward future increases. This calls for policy measures targeting consumption, especially of manufactured products such as textiles, clothing and furniture that cause large impacts in other countries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CB accounting; Footprints; Generational goal; GHG emissions; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Sweden","Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Footprints; Generational goal; GHG emission; Input output analysis; Sweden; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059297943

Modelling results indicate that the cost effects of the EU-ETS addressing CO2 and non-CO2 emissions will be much larger than under the current scheme. This is because under the new approach, all climate relevant species are regulated and not just CO2. The cost effects also depend on the length and altitude of the flight. Both have consequences for the competitive environment of the airlines under the scheme. Especially the full service network carriers will have to bear a competitive disadvantage compared to airlines offering just short- and medium-haul services. Remarkably, some cost effects are in opposition to the corresponding results for an ETS for the regulation of CO2 alone. © 2018","Aviation; Climate relevant emissions; EU emissions trading scheme","air transportation; airline industry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate effect; economic impact; emissions trading; European Union; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058009680

Fourier Transform-Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a cost-effective and rapid analytical tool with potential beyond its current use in plant physiology. We tested the use of FTIR spectroscopy as a method for estimating wood density (WD) and xylem resistance to embolism formation (P50) in 24 angiosperm species. Higher WD was associated with more negative P50 (r2 = 0.41). Partial least squares regression was applied to establish models of FTIR spectra and the reference data. They showed a high predictive quality for WD (r2 = 0.73), whereas the prediction of P50 was weaker (r2 = 0.49). By including WD in the model as an additional factor influencing P50, its predictive power significantly increased (r2 = 0.59). The spectral range in the model elaboration has been also narrowed (bands of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose), but this did not influence the model descriptors, suggesting that for P50 prediction broad spectral range is more informative than narrow band regions reflecting main wood constituents. In conclusion, FTIR spectroscopy associated with WD measurements has proven to be a promising alternative to traditional methods for screening of individual- or species-specific resistance to embolism in angiosperms. © The Author(s) 2018.

Box 1041–00621, Nairobi, Kenya","Long-term changes in average temperatures, precipitation, and climate variability threaten agricultural production, food security, and the livelihoods of farming communities globally. Whilst adaptation to climate change is necessary to ensure food security and protect livelihoods of poor farmers, mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can lessen the extent of climate change and future needs for adaptation. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate GHG emissions without compromising food production. India is the third largest GHG emitter in the world where agriculture is responsible for 18% of total national emissions. India has identified agriculture as one of the priority sectors for GHG emission reduction in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Identification of emission hotspots and cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture can inform the prioritisation of efforts to reduce emissions without compromising food and nutrition security. We adopted a bottom-up approach to analyse GHG emissions using large datasets of India's ‘cost of cultivation survey’ and the ‘19th livestock census’ together with soil, climate and management data for each location. Mitigation measures and associated costs and benefits of adoption, derived from a variety of sources including the literature, stakeholder meetings and expert opinion, were presented in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). We estimated that by 2030, business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 Megatonne CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO2e per year through adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting only cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, i.e. efficient use of fertilizer, zero-tillage and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. © 2018 The Authors","Agriculture; Climate change; Greenhouse gas; India; Marginal Abatement Cost Curve; Mitigation","Agriculture; Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Emission control; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Surveys; Water management; Adaptation to climate changes; Agricultural practices; Agricultural productions; Climate change mitigation; Cost effective opportunity; India; Marginal abatement cost curves; Mitigation; Climate change; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; abatement cost; agricultural production; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; agriculture; animal husbandry; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; crop production; ecosystem restoration; environmental policy; food security; Gossypium; human; India; land use; livestock; no tillage; nonhuman; priority journal; rice; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; soil management; spatial analysis; sugarcane; water management; wheat; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057300469

The implementation of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) is an important air quality policy action to reduce air pollutant emissions. This study aims to assess the air quality improvements in Lisbon with the LEZ implementation, analysing its impact on the air pollutant concentrations. The analysis performed from 2009 to 2016 showed an improvement in air quality. In the Zone 1, the reduction of PM10 and NO2 annual average concentrations were 29% and 12%, respectively, while, in the Zone 2, the reduction of PM10 and NO2 annual average concentrations were 23% and 22%, respectively. The background pollution analysis showed the LEZ effect on the lowest levels of ambient air pollution to which the population is chronically exposed. The achieved reductions of PM10 and NO2 levels were 30.5% and 9.4% in Zone 1, and 22.5% and 12.9% in the Zone 2, respectively. Concluding, this study evidenced an air quality improvement mainly for PM10 and NO2; however, insignificant reductions were observed for NOx and PM2.5. Therefore, stricter restriction standards should be defined, combining with other air quality policy decisions to reduce the population exposure to air pollutants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality policy; Lisbon; Low emission zone; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate matter","Air quality standards; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollutant emission; Air quality improvement; Air quality policy; Annual average concentration; Lisbon; Low emission zones; Particulate Matter; Air quality; nitrogen oxide; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollution policy; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; cluster analysis; forced expiratory volume; low emission zone; lung function; maximum concentration; particulate matter; population exposure; urban area; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056866899

This fact has attracted the attention of energy system engineers to the importance of developing control strategies to use energy resources more efficiently. Moreover, the development of new energy efficient components and complex energy concepts in last decades has heightened the need to design advanced control strategies to reach the full potential of the recently-developed complex energy systems even more. The objectives of the advanced control strategies that have been developed to be energy efficient are obtained from energy analysis. However, an energy analysis is unable to provide information on the quality of energy streams flowing through a system. In this study, exergy, which is the maximum available work that can be extracted from a system during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with its environment, is considered as the objective of the optimization. The main objective of this research is to develop an exergy-based control strategy for building energy systems and investigate its applicability in real life. The control strategy is supposed to regulate a building energy system in a way that the most exergy efficient operation of the system in question is achieved. To reach this goal, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) for building energy systems using the exergy principles is developed. Model predictive control, which uses a system model to predict the future states of the system, offers a promising solution to the need for more advanced control strategies for complex building energy systems. In order to keep the calculation times as short as possible, the approach of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is used in the development of model predictive controller. To demonstrate the functionality of the linear model predictive controller, it is implemented in a building energy system. The use case of this research is the energy supply system of the E.ON Energy Research Center's main building in Aachen, Germany. During an experiment, the exergy-based mixed integer linear MPC made meaningful decisions and demonstrated that it is able to control the forward flow temperature of the energy system with only minor deviations from the specified set point range. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced controls; Building energy systems; Exergy; Experiment; Field test; Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP); Model Predictive Control (MPC); Optimization; Real-life implementation","Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Controllers; Energy management; Energy resources; Exergy; Experiments; Global warming; Integer programming; Model predictive control; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Advanced control; Building energy systems; Field test; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Real-life implementations; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060091438

In these systems, recycling strategies to close the loop between crop production (and agro-related industries) and soil conservation are of special interest in the current context of climate change mitigation. Pyrolysis represents a recycling option for the production of energy and biochar, a carbonaceous product with a wide range of environmental and agronomic applications. Considering that biochar functionality depends on both the original biomass and the pyrolysis conditions, we produced and characterized 22 biochars in order to evaluate their potential to sequester C and modify soil physicochemical properties. The pore size distribution was a function of the original biomass and did not change with the temperature of pyrolysis. The highest number of pores within the size 0.2-30 μm, relevant for plant available water retention, was reached at 600 °C. However, ideal pyrolysis conditions to optimize C stability and hydrologic properties was reached at 400 °C in woody derived biochars, as higher temperatures lead to a nontransient hydrophobicity.

Therefore, the use of renewable energy sources as an alternative source of energy for the rural communities become imperative in order to improve socioeconomic activities of these rural communities. In this study, a feasibility analysis on the use of a hybrid solar-wind-battery-diesel system for providing electricity to a rural secondary school is investigated.

Yet, in many regions, a paucity of weather and climate data has prevented rigorous assessment of recent climate trends and their causes, thereby limiting the effectiveness of forecasts and other services for climate adaptation. In rainfed systems, farmer perceptions of changing rainfall and weather patterns are important precursors for annual cropping decisions. Here, we propose that combining such farmer perceptions of trends in seasonal rainfall with satellite-based rainfall estimates and climate station data can reduce uncertainties regarding regional climatic trends. In western Uganda, a rural and climatically complex transition zone between eastern and central equatorial Africa, data from 980 smallholder households suggest distinct changes in seasonal bimodal rainfall over recent decades, specifically wetter rainy seasons and drier dry seasons. Data from three satellite-based rainfall products beginning in 1983 largely corroborate respondent perceptions over the last 10–20 years, particularly in the southernmost sites near Queen Elizabeth National Park. In addition, combining all three information sources suggests an increasing trend in annual rainfall, most prominently in the north near Murchison Falls National Park over the past two decades; this runs counter to recent research asserting the presence of a drying trend in the region. Our study is unique in evaluating and cross-validating these multiple data sources to identify climatic change affecting people in a poorly understood region, while providing insights into regional-scale climate controls. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Agriculture; Rain; Satellites; Soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; Climate variability and change; Complex transitions; Ground-based stations; Information sources; Multiple data sources; Rainfall estimates; Smallholder farmers; Sub-saharan africa; Climate change; climate change; farmers knowledge; livestock farming; precipitation intensity; satellite altimetry; seasonality; smallholder; transition zone; trend analysis; Murchison Falls National Park; Queen Elizabeth National Park; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060811954

Both are important for industrial, agricultural and societal development. Desalination seems to be one of the most suitable solutions to the water problem. The integration of renewable energy into water desalination systems has become increasingly attractive due to the growing demand for water and energy. In this paper, a proposed model consists of a solar photovoltaic (PV) powered seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant for the southern region of the Gaza Strip. The proposed system of reverse osmosis plant with a capacity of 2,400 m 3 /h is designed using ROSA software. As the solar PV plant is designed using System Advisor Model software that does not rely on expensive batteries, the water production cost is nearly the same as the current expenses (0.56 USD/m 3 ). The simple payback period for PV plant was found to be 5.9 years, the nominal levelized cost of energy was 9.3 cents/kWh, the net present value was around $800,000 and the investor internal rate of return was 10.6% (which is greater than the interest rate 6%). The system reduces the emission of greenhouse gases. Comparing the results obtained with the conventional values, this model would provide a much needed efficient compensator of the shortage of water and energy, making it more sustainable and economically feasible. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cost analysis; Desalination; Gaza Strip; Renewable energy; Reverse osmosis (RO); Solar photovoltaic (PV)","alternative energy; cost analysis; desalination; design; photovoltaic system; reverse osmosis; seawater; Gaza Strip; Occupied Territories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063012722

Seasonal variations and climate stability of a planet are very sensitive to the planet obliquity and its evolution. This is of particular interest for the emergence and sustainability of land-based life, but orbital and rotational parameters of exoplanets are still poorly constrained. Numerical explorations usually realised in this situation are therefore in heavy contrast with the uncertain nature of the available data. Aims. We aim to provide an analytical formulation of the long-term spin-axis dynamics of exoplanets, linking it directly to physical and dynamical parameters, but still giving precise quantitative results if the parameters are well known. Together with bounds for the poorly constrained parameters of exoplanets, this analysis is designed to enable a quick and straightforward exploration of the spin-axis dynamics. Methods. The long-term orbital solution is decomposed into quasi-periodic series and the spin-axis Hamiltonian is expanded in powers of eccentricity and inclination. Chaotic zones are measured by the resonance overlap criterion. Bounds for the poorly known parameters of exoplanets are obtained from physical grounds (rotational breakup) and dynamical considerations (equipartition of the angular momentum deficit). Results. This method gives accurate results when the orbital evolution is well known. The detailed structure of the chaotic zones for the solar system planets can be retrieved from simple analytical formulas. For less-constrained planetary systems, the maximal extent of the chaotic regions can be computed, requiring only the mass, the semi-major axis, and the eccentricity of the planets present in the system. Additionally, some estimated bounds of the precession constant allow to classify which observed exoplanets are necessarily out of major spin-orbit secular resonances (unless the precession rate is affected by the presence of massive satellites). © 2019 M.

Sites were selected to span a range of urban land use attributes, including urban background, near local and arterial roads, traffic intersections, urban street canyon, near-highway, near large industrial source, and restaurant density. The spatial variations in urban particle number concentrations varied by about a factor of three. Particle number concentrations are 2–3 times more spatially heterogeneous than PM2.5 mass. The observed order of spatial heterogeneity is UFP &gt; NO2 &gt; CO &gt; PM2.5. On average, particle number concentrations near local roads with a cluster of restaurants and near arterial roads are roughly two times higher than the urban background. Particle number concentrations in the urban street canyon, downwind of a major highway, and near large industrial sources are 2–4 times higher than background concentrations. While traffic is known as an important contributor to particle number concentrations, restaurants and industrial emissions also contribute significantly to spatial variations in Pittsburgh. Particle size distribution measurements using a mobile laboratory show that the local spatial variations in particle number concentrations are dictated by concentrations of particles smaller than 50 nm.

This study hypothesized that the combination of biochar amendments could be a part of sustainable agricultural strategy in semi-arid environment, therefore the objective was to investigate the effects of biochar rates under different irrigation regimes on soil properties, physiology and yield of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.). The experiment was conducted in Gorgan (Iran) in two successive years (2014 and 2015) and consisted of a factorial combination of four irrigation regimes [45%, 60%, 75% and 90% (called I1, I2, I3 and I4, respectively) of maximum allowable depletion (MAD) of available soil water (ASW)] with four rates of biochar derived from maize-straw feedstock [0, 5, 10 and 20 t biochar ha−1 (called B0 B5, B10 and B20, respectively)]. The results indicated that the incorporation of biochar into the soil increased both soil permeability (low bulk density and high pore volume) and the water holding capacity, particularly when biochar was applied at the rate of 20 t ha−1. Moreover, after pumpkin cultivation, the B20 showed high soil microbial biomass carbon. The reduction of irrigation water increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxygen radicals (O2 [rad] −), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in pumpkin leaves, while all the antioxidant activities and proline contents declined on pumpkin plant treated with biochar, especially at the highest rate (B20). The adoption of biochar as amendment increased chlorophyll content and the uptake of nutrients in leaves regardless of irrigation regimes. The seed yield showed a decrease of 6%, 46% and 58% in I2, I3 and I4, respectively, in comparison with I1 regardless of biochar rate. Response rate to biochar was ceased in lower biochar rates by prolonging irrigation, but I2 response to biochar ceased in higher biochar rate as Bcritical (14 t biochar ha−1). This implies that I2 irrigation regime improved response of pumpkin to biochar, which was accompanied by its high WUE. These results indicate that biochar amendment could provide a suitable strategy for improving the physical status of agricultural soils, water use efficiency and vegetable crop yield. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidant activities; Cucurbita pepo L.; Seed yield; Soil properties; Water stress; Water use efficiency","antioxidant; biochar; climbing plant; irrigation system; physiological response; seed production; soil property; water stress; water use efficiency; Cucurbita pepo; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058813239

Recent Findings: Regional approaches to renewable deployment in Africa can reduce overall system costs and improve operation by expanding access to higher quality renewable resources, while unlocking a greater diversity of renewable options. Regional approaches can also provide greater flexibility and stability to national power systems, as well as complementarity that allows countries to scale up development of single sources while still reducing risks related to climate variability and future change. Summary: Based on a long history of experience, the benefits of regional approaches to power sector development and operation are now well established. New methodologies using more granular geospatial and temporal data have emerged to make the analysis of these benefits more feasible and more detailed. Novel additions to planning studies are also presenting more nuanced insights into the implications that climate change, technological innovations, and socio-political influences could have on regional renewable energy deployment. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Africa; Capacity expansion; Modelling; Planning; Power pools; Regional integration; Renewable energy; SAPP; WAPP","Climate change; Regional planning; Analytical approach; Climate variability; Development and operations; National power systems; Political influences; Regional coordination; Renewable energy deployments; Technological innovation; Electric power system interconnection",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063903321

BEVs have significantly greater energy conversion efficiency from energy storage to wheel (tank-to-wheel [TTW]) and zero tailpipe emissions; these features are in stark contrast to the environmental burdens posed by vehicle production and electricity generation (well-to-tank [WTT]). Since CO2eq emissions from vehicle use of BEVs account for the majority of the entire life cycle emissions, it is important to closely examine the CO2eq intensity of electricity generation, which varies based on the sources of energy in the electricity mix of each country and time of day. This paper compares the environmental impact of diesel and electric buses in the city of Aachen throughout their life cycles and analyzes the effects of electricity generation with reference to variation in charging time. Based on recorded driving profiles, the vehicle dynamics of the longitudinal motion are simulated, and the energy demand as a function of the altitude profile and ambient temperature is calculated. The calculation of the quarter-hourly CO2eq intensity is combined with the vehicle life cycle model in order to examine the effects of electricity generation on BEV life cycle emissions. To analyze the correlation between charging time and BEV environmental impact, different charging scenarios are defined, and CO2eq savings from replacing ICEVs with BEVs are estimated. Scenario analyses are conducted over both short- and long-term time scales to predict the future environmental and economic benefits and costs of BEVs compared to ICEVs. The results demonstrate a significant dependency of BEV environmental impact on charging time, which varies by time of day and season. At night, the contribution of renewable energies to the electricity mix is low, and the variation in CO2eq intensity is limited; therefore, the environmental impact of charging time is lower compared to charging at noon. The larger CO2eq emissions of BEV production are compensated for all scenarios within the first year of operation. However, if BEVs are charged with electricity generated exclusively by lignite-fired power plants, more CO2eq emissions are released over their lifetimes compared to ICEVs; this scenario also holds when ICEVs are fueled with biodiesel. Overall, the positive environmental balance of BEVs is not based on a low CO2eq intensity, but on the greater energy conversion efficiency and the possibility of recuperating braking energy. These properties are particularly advantageous in urban traffic. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric vehicle; Charging strategy; CO2 emissions; Electricity generation; Environmental assessment","Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Conversion efficiency; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Secondary batteries; Tanks (containers); Wheels; Charging strategies; CO2 emissions; Electricity generation; Environmental assessment; Environmental balance; Environmental burdens; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Lignite-fired power plants; Environmental impact; alternative energy; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electricity generation; emission; energy storage; environmental assessment; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; power plant; traffic emission; urban area; Aachen; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059812689

We show that insulin deficiency in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice decreased mitochondrial ATP production and/or citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase activities in the cerebrum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Concomitant decrease in mitochondrial fusion proteins and increased fission proteins in these brain regions likely contributed to altered mitochondrial function. Although insulin deficiency did not cause any detectable increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission, inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters increased ROS emission and further reduced ATP production, indicating the causative roles of elevated ketones and lactate in counteracting oxidative stress and as a fuel source for ATP production during insulin deficiency. Moreover, in healthy mice, intranasal insulin administration increased mitochondrial ATP production, demonstrating a direct regulatory role of insulin on brain mitochondrial function. Proteomics analysis of the cerebrum showed that although insulin deficiency led to oxidative post-translational modification of several proteins that cause tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary degeneration, insulin administration enhanced neuronal development and neurotransmission pathways. Together these results render support for the critical role of insulin to maintain brain mitochondrial homeostasis and provide mechanistic insight into the potential therapeutic benefits of intranasal insulin.—Ruegsegger, G.

Process planning and initial design with multi-product and energy recovery approach is attempted in this work to ameliorate this limitation. Three retrofitting options are considered: the novel constraint mode with the local permeate CO 2 concentration that is always higher than the feed stream concentration is proposed for CO 2 enrichment to increase the output of the CO 2 -enriched product (with a general mode, the local permeate stream that is more diluted than the feed stream mixes in the permeate bulk); the turbine unit is used to take back the static energy in membrane residue; and the multi-product option with N 2 purification would have the advantage that N 2 has been enriched greatly after CO 2 separation. According to the comprehensive comparison conducted in this study, the retrofitted process involving both the novel constraint mode and the multi-product approach is the most effective for saving energy and enhancing production capacity. Crude CO 2 (50 vol%) and N 2 (99 vol%) would be generated simultaneously. In addition, the positive performance has been demonstrated by process simulation and economical analysis with both a normal polysulphone membrane and a novel Polaris membrane. On the whole, membrane separation system retrofitting with multi-product and energy recovery approach together should be an effectual approach to promote carbon capture, storage, and utilization. © 2018 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering","energy recovery; flue gases; membrane separation; multi-product; process planning","Carbon dioxide; Coal reclamation; Flue gases; Flues; Process planning; Product design; Recovery; Retrofitting; Separation; Comprehensive comparisons; Energy recovery; Membrane separation; Multi-products; Polysulphone membranes; Process simulations; Production capacity; Separation efficiency; Gas permeable membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058150524

Both vehicles with and without the GPFs were exercised over the LA92 drive cycle using a chassis dynamometer. Diluted exhaust emissions from the entire LA92 cycle were introduced to the mobile chamber and subsequently photochemically reacted. It was found that the addition of catalyzed GPFs will significantly reduce tailpipe particulate emissions and also provide benefits in gaseous emissions, including nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC). Tailpipe emissions composition showed important changes with the use of GPFs by practically eliminating black carbon and increasing the fractional contribution of organic mass. Production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was reduced with GPF addition, but was also dependent on engine design which determined the amount of SOA precursors at the tailpipe. Our findings indicate that SOA production from GDI vehicles will be reduced with the application of catalyzed GPFs through the mitigation of reactive hydrocarbon precursors. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Catalysis; Direct injection; Dynamometers; Engines; Environmental chambers; Hydrocarbons; Machine design; Particulate emissions; Vehicles; Chassis dynamometers; Gasoline direct injection; Gasoline direct injection engines; Light duty vehicles; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Particulate filters; Secondary organic aerosols; Tailpipe emission; Gasoline; black carbon; gasoline; hydrocarbon; aerosol composition; black carbon; catalysis; design method; energy efficiency; engine; exhaust emission; filter; hydrocarbon; organic compound; particulate matter; petroleum hydrocarbon; Article; catalysis; catalyst; chemical composition; exhaust gas; gasoline direct injection vehicle; limit of detection; motor vehicle; particle size; particulate matter; photochemistry; photooxidation; secondary organic aerosol; urban area; aerosol; catalysis; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; soot; Aerosols; Catalysis; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Soot; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063219091

Barrier islands are an important component of coastal ecosystems and freshwater and brackish wetlands on these islands provide an important habitat for a number of animal and plant species. However, organic carbon dynamics in these landscapes have received relatively little attention. The objective of this study was to document the accumulation of organic carbon and understand the factors influencing soil carbon dynamics on barrier islands. Ten topographic transects were established on different landforms on Assateague Island National Seashore, MD, USA. Soil organic carbon stocks, aboveground carbon inputs, and decomposition rates were compared among landforms (representing differing degrees of landform stability and soil age) and drainage conditions. Soil organic carbon stocks (0–1.0 m) ranged from 0.49 to 18.8 kg C m−2, and increased in magnitude with soil age. Higher carbon stocks in the older soils were partly attributed to the increased time over which carbon had accumulated. Additionally, a shift from herbaceous dominated to forest dominated plant communities led to greater carbon inputs in older soils. Carbon stocks were also greater in the very poorly and poorly drained soils (relative to drier soils) where high levels of carbon inputs (plant biomass) exceed decomposition rates, which were slowed under anaerobic conditions. While rates of carbon accumulation (average 0.021 kg C m−2 yr−1) are somewhat low compared to other more productive systems, barrier island soils have the potential to store large amounts of organic carbon (relative to other soils) as organic-rich surface horizons are buried during overwash events. © 2018",,"Decay (organic); Dynamics; Ecosystems; Geomorphology; Plants (botany); Soils; Wetlands; Above-ground carbons; Anaerobic conditions; Carbon accumulation; Drainage condition; Poorly drained soils; Productive systems; Soil carbon dynamics; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Organic carbon; barrier island; carbon sequestration; coastal landform; coastal wetland; decomposition; drainage; geoaccumulation; herb; landscape change; organic carbon; plant community; soil carbon; Assateague Island; Assateague Island National Seashore; Mid-Atlantic States; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057050590

Building energy simulation offers a promising approach to understand energy use and test plans to improve the efficiency of residential properties. As part of this, models of the urban stock must be created that accurately reflect its size, shape and composition. However, substantial effort is required in order to generate detailed urban scenes with the appropriate level of attribution suitable for spatially explicit simulation of large areas. Furthermore, the computational complexity of microsimulation of building energy necessitates consideration of approaches that reduce this processing overhead. We present a workflow to automatically generate 2.5D urban scenes for residential building energy simulation from UK mapping datasets. We describe modelling the geometry, the assignment of energy characteristics based upon a statistical model and adopt the CityGML EnergyADE schema which forms an important new and open standard for defining energy model information at the city-scale. We then demonstrate use of the resulting urban scenes for estimating heating demand using a spatially explicit building energy microsimulation tool, called CitySim+, and evaluate the effects of an off-the-shelf geometric simplification routine to reduce simulation computational complexity. © 2019 by the authors.","City modelling; CityGML; Energy simulation; EnergyADE; Generalisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066455624

The interactions between multiple socio-technical systems have, however, received more limited attention (e.g., how different systems of energy provision might come into contact as part of a low-carbon transition). In response, this study draws upon insights from transition studies and recent debates about ‘disruption’ to consider how different energy systems (electricity, transport, and heating) and their affiliated actors are interacting around key pillars of low-carbon pathways: expanded societal electrification and electricity trade. These dynamics are explored in the context of Ontario, Canada as this province appears to be moving along a decarbonisation pathway that is anticipated to be widely reflected across transition contexts. Steps along this pathway include the decarbonisation of the electricity system (through the procurement of low-carbon supply from domestic generators and regional interties) followed by the electrification of broader energy end-uses. Based on the analysis of actor positions surrounding climate-energy planning in Ontario, findings indicate that emerging interactions around the electrification of transport are marked by greater alignments, whereas electrification of heat and electricity trade are characterised by deeper tensions. These patterns hold implications for the acceleration of low-carbon transitions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse; Disruption; Energy; Low-carbon pathways; Politics; Socio-technical transitions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057791996

Objectives The aims of this study were to assess the GHGE from individual self-selected diets in the United States and examine their association with nutritional quality of the diets, demographic patterns, and food-related behaviors. Methods The dietary GHGE from US adults (>18 y, N = 16,800) in the 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were calculated by linking all foods consumed in their 24-h recall diets to our new database of food environmental impacts. Diets were ranked by GHGE/1000 kcal. Those in the top and bottom quintiles were compared on the US Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and on the amounts of specific nutrients known to be under-or overconsumed in the US population. Demographic and behavioral variables from the NHANES were also correlated to these dietary carbon footprints. Results Diets in the bottom quintile accounted for one-fifth the total emissions (GHGE/1000 kcal) of those in the top quintile, yet had significantly higher (P < 0.001) HEI scores by 2.3 ± 0.7 points on a 100-point scale. These low-GHGE diets contained higher amounts of fiber and vitamin E and lower amounts of sodium and saturated fats, whereas high-GHGE diets contained higher amounts of vitamins A and D, choline, calcium, iron, and potassium. Low-GHGE diets had less meat, dairy, and solid fats, and more poultry, plant protein foods, oils, whole and refined grains, and added sugars. Conclusions Food patterns responsible for lower GHGE had a better overall diet quality and were more nutritious on several key dimensions, although not all. These results can inform dietary guidance and other policies that seek to address the goals of improved dietary intakes and reduced food-related emissions. © 2019 American Society for Nutrition.",,"animal protein; branched chain amino acid; calcium; plant protein; potassium; protein; protein G; saturated fatty acid; sugar; alpha tocopherol; aged; amino acid composition; Article; body composition; body height; body mass; body weight; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; daily life activity; diet; female; follow up; food frequency questionnaire; human; male; normal human; nutritional assessment; observational study; physical activity; prospective study; protein intake; questionnaire; thigh muscle; adult; carbon footprint; diet; dietary fiber; feeding behavior; middle aged; nutrition; nutritional value; United States; young adult; Adult; Aged; Carbon Footprint; Diet; Diet, Healthy; Dietary Fiber; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Nutritive Value; United States; Vitamin E; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058833199

This study presents a framework for testing the ability of adaptation thresholds to dynamically identify vulnerable scenarios within ensemble projections. Streamflow projections for 91 river sites predominantly in the western USA are used as a case study in which vulnerability is determined by the ensemble members with the lowest 10% of end-of-century mean annual flow. Illustrative planning thresholds are defined through time for each site based on the mean streamflow below which a specified fraction of scenarios is vulnerable. We perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to compute the frequency of incorrectly identifying or failing to identify a vulnerable scenario (false positives and false negatives, respectively). Results show that in general, this method of defining thresholds can identify vulnerable scenarios with low false positive rates (< 10%), but with false negative rates for many rivers remaining higher than random chance until roughly 2060. This finding highlights the tradeoff between frequently triggering unnecessary action and failing to identify potential vulnerabilities until later in the century, and suggests room for improvement in the threshold-setting technique that could be benchmarked with this approach. This testing framework could extend to thresholds defined with multivariate statistics, or to any application using thresholds and ensemble projections, such as long-term flood and drought risk, or sea level rise. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Multivariant analysis; Sea level; Stream flow; Water resources; Water supply; Adaptation strategies; Dynamic classification; False negative rate; False positive rates; Leave-one-out cross validations; Multivariate statistics; Testing framework; Water resources planning; Ability testing; adaptive management; drought; flood; sea level change; streamflow; testing method; vulnerability; water supply; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063864898

The main objective of the study is to determine the capacities, thermal power and energy potential of 19 TM springs in 4 spas of this region. This study supports the hypothesis that in the Kopaonik tourist region, TM springs have considerable capacity, as well as heat power and energy potential. The modern method for determining the energy potential and heat power, based on the flow rate, the inlet and outlet temperatures of the TM springs, was applied in the region with rich geothermal sources, and the obtained results were converted to the fossil fuel energy. The research of the given region, using the above method, is more detailed than the previous research carried out at the national level, so the results are more reliable and suggest that similar research should be carried out at the regional and local level. The estimated total heat energy is 758.51 TJ/year, and heat power (capacity) is 24.1 MWt. The TM springs of this region make up 9.06% of the estimated geothermal energy of Serbia and 7.53% of the estimated heat power. The total energy of this region is equivalent to 210697222.3 kW/h (210.7 GWh) or 18116.7 toe and represent significant energy saving potential. The results indicate the possibility of direct use of energy from TM spring and replacement of fossil fuels, which reduces CO2 emissions and positively affects the quality of the environment.

Odor and chemical monitoring are thus critical steps in providing suitable strategies for air pollution control at waste treatment units. In this study, 141 gas samples were extensively analyzed to characterize the odor and chemical emissions released upon the aerobic treatment of 10 raw substrates and five digestates. For this purpose, agricultural wastes, biowastes, green wastes, sewage sludge, and municipal solid waste (MSW) were composted in 300 L pilots under forced aeration. Gas exhausts were evaluated through dynamic olfactometry and analytical methods (i.e., GC/MS) to determine their odor concentration (OC in OUE m−3) and chemical composition. A total of 60 chemical compounds belonging to 9 chemical families were identified and quantified. Terpenes, oxygenated compounds, and ammonia exhibited the largest cumulative mass emission. Odor emission rates (OUE h−1) were computed based on OC measurements and related to the initial amount of organic matter composted and the process time to provide odor emission factors (OEFs in OUE g−1OM0). The composting process of solid wastes accounted for OEFs ranging from 65 to 3089 OUE g−1OM0, whereas digestates composting showed a lower odor emission potential with OEF fluctuating from 8.6 to 30.5 OUE g−1OM0. Moreover, chemical concentrations of single compounds were weighted with their corresponding odor detection thresholds (ODTs) to yield odor activities values (OAVs) and odor contribution (POi, %). Volatile sulfur compounds were the main odorants (POi = 54–99%) regardless of the operational composting conditions or substrate treated. Notably, methanethiol was the leading odorant for 73% of the composting experiments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Forced aeration; Methanethiol; Odor activity values; Odor emission factors; Volatile sulfur compounds","ammonia; chemical compound; methanethiol; organic matter; sulfur derivative; terpene; fragrance; aeration; chemical analysis; composting; concentration (composition); emission; exhaust emission; experimental study; factor analysis; gas; methodology; odor; organic compound; pollution control; solid waste; volatile substance; aeration; agricultural waste; Article; chemical composition; composting; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; gas analysis; mass fragmentography; municipal solid waste; olfactometry; pilot study; sludge treatment; solid waste management; sewage; solid waste; Composting; Odorants; Sewage; Solid Waste; Sulfur Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059300712

Certain scholarly works on science–policy interfaces and evidence-based policy are optimistic, while the literature on research utilization is pessimistic. The field of science, technology, and society and the concept of co-production advance a broader view, suggesting that more holistic (i.e., institutional or systemic) changes may offer a way forward. This article synthesizes causal claims from such literatures into an analytical framework of potential pathways from co-productive SPR characteristics to policy action. It then investigates, through expert interviews, three climate SPRs in Canada: a municipal-level case between the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium and local communities, a provincial-level case between the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions and the Climate Action Secretariat, and a national-level case between the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences and the federal government. In light of the analytical framework, the cases suggest a theoretical hierarchy of function for SPRs: incidental interaction (at the bottom), basic partnership, interactive dialogue, and true co-production (at the top), each of which can be coupled with a supplementary network (to the side). This template is presented as the Science–Policy Relationship Hierarchy model. Collectively, the cases and the model reveal causal pathways that may explain why any given SPR ends up functioning the way it does (e.g., external political conditions are important), implying prescriptions for improvement. Besides the analytical framework and model, the main contribution is the finding that co-productive strategies are unlikely to lead to concrete policy changes on their own, but are crucial for cultivating soft policy influences and side benefits. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Canada; Climate change; Co-production; Evidence-based policy; Research utilization; Science–policy interfaces","adaptive management; analytical framework; climate change; hierarchical system; policy analysis; policy approach; policy making; science and technology; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049939804

We studied four cold-hardy cultivars grown in the Midwestern U.S.: St. Croix, Frontenac, Marquette, and La Crescent. These cultivars have gained popularity among local growers and winemakers, but still very little is known about their performance compared with long-established V. vinifera grapes. Volatiles were collected using two novel approaches: biogenic emissions from grape clusters on a vine and single grape berries. A third approach was headspace collection of volatiles from crushed grapes. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was used to collect volatiles. Vacuum-assisted SPME was used in the case of single grape berry. Collected VOCs were analyzed using separation and identification on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS). More than 120 VOCs were identified using mass spectral libraries. The dataset provides evidence that detecting biogenic emissions from growing grapes is feasible. The dataset provides a record of temporal and spatial variability of VOCs, many of which could potentially impart aroma and flavor in the wine. The number of VOCs detected followed the order from single berry (the least) to crushed berry (the most). Thus, more information for potential use in harvesting in order to obtain the desired flavor is found in data from crushed grapes. © 2019 by the authors.

Due to its chemical stability and unique physicochemical, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has become research hotspots in the community. However, g-C3N4 photocatalyst still suffers from many problems, resulting in unsatisfactory photocatalytic activity such as low specific surface area, high charge recombination and insufficient visible light utilization. Since 2009, g-C3N4-based heterostructures have attracted the attention of scientists worldwide for their greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance. Overall, this review summarizes the recent advances of g-C3N4-based nanocomposites modified with transition metal sulfide (TMS), including (1) preparation of pristine g-C3N4, (2) modification strategies of g-C3N4, (3) design principles of TMS-modified g-C3N4 heterostructured photocatalysts, and (4) applications in energy conversion. What is more, the characteristics and transfer mechanisms of each classification of the metal sulfide heterojunction system will be critically reviewed, spanning from the following categories: (1) Type I heterojunction, (2) Type II heterojunction, (3) p-n heterojunction, (4) Schottky junction and (5) Z-scheme heterojunction. Apart from that, the application of g-C3N4-based heterostructured photocatalysts in H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation and pollutant degradation will also be systematically presented. Last but not least, this review will conclude with invigorating perspectives, limitations and prospects for further advancing g-C3N4-based heterostructured photocatalysts toward practical benefits for a sustainable future.

We assessed the role of multiple factors in shaping soil bacterial and nematode communities in an ongoing plant invasion in western Michigan sand dunes. We aimed to determine which factors were important for structuring soil communities. Methods: We surveyed seven sites containing the exotic plant, Leymus arenarius, in western Michigan, USA sand dunes. We sampled the plant community and collected soil cores to assess bacterial and nematode communities. We assessed bacterial functional diversity using Biolog Ecoplates. Nematode communities were assessed based on morphological identification. Results: Temperature was a strong determinant of bacterial functional diversity and community composition. Precipitation and Ammophila density were also correlated with bacterial function composition. Nematode communities were shaped by a combination of temperature, precipitation, Ammophila density, and to a lesser degree soil organic matter and Leymus density. Soil bacteria and bacterivorous nematode assemblages were not significantly associated in their responses to the environment. Conclusions: Soil communities of bacteria and nematodes in this early successional dune system are affected strongly by changes in climatic factors, rather than exotic plant presence. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ammophila breviligulata; Climate; Exotic plant invasion; Leymus arenarius; Sand dunes","community structure; dune; environmental factor; grass; microbial community; morphology; nematode; plant community; soil fauna; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; Michigan; United States; Ammophila breviligulata; Bacteria (microorganisms); Leymus; Leymus arenarius; Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060674042

Many of the important challenges of the next decade lie at the intersection of the natural environment, human decision making and the design of space technology to inform decision making. There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations through 2030. Several of these Sustainable Development Goals can be addressed by asking: 1) What is happening in the natural environment? 2) How will humans be impacted by what is happening in the natural environment? 3) What decisions are humans making in response to environmental factors and why? and 4) What technology system can be designed to provide high quality information that supports human decision making? The answers to these questions are often interrelated in complex ways; thus it is helpful to use a framework from complex systems to integrate these questions. Within the list of Sustainable Development Goals, several fit the three questions above, including #2 Zero Hunger, #6 Clean Water and Sanitation, #13 Climate Action, #14 Life Below Water, and #15 Life on Land. This paper presents a research agenda to apply environmental modeling, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering to inform the design of space systems in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. This work builds on previous research in the following areas: 1) physics-based environmental modeling; 2) complex systems modeling to simulate human decision making using agent-based models; and 3) model based systems engineering to inform the architecture of satellites or space-enabled data systems. This paper presents a review of the state of the art, shows examples of how these methods have been combined to inform space system design and presents a future research agenda. As an example, the paper discusses a project related to Sustainable Development Goal #15 to design an earth observation system using space-based and ground-based data collection regarding an invasive plant species in Benin, West Africa. In this example, insights are needed regarding natural variables (i.e. salinity, temperature and turbidity of local waterways), social variables (i.e. economic impact of the invasive plant on local communities), and design variables (i.e. the technical performance of existing imagery satellites and in-situ sensor networks). © 2019 IEEE.",,"Autonomous agents; Complex networks; Computational methods; Decision making; Earth (planet); Engineering research; Planning; Sensor networks; Systems engineering; Earth observation systems; Environmental factors; High quality information; Human decision making; Model-based systems engineering; Natural environments; Space system designs; Technical performance; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068310760

Although previous evidence showed a clear association between wildfire smoke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, findings from recent studies are more mixed. Current evidence in support of an association between respiratory infections and wildfire smoke exposure is also mixed. Only one study has investigated long-term respiratory health impacts of wildfire smoke, and few studies have estimated future health impacts of wildfires under likely climate change scenarios.SummaryWildfire activity has been increasing over the past several decades and is likely to continue to do so as climate change progresses, which, combined with a growing population, means that population exposure to and respiratory health impacts of wildfire smoke is likely to grow in the future. More research is needed to understand which population subgroups are most vulnerable to wildfire smoke exposure and the long-term respiratory health impacts of these high pollution events. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In particular, they could contribute in a complementary manner to natural soils to global climate regulation by storing large quantities of carbon (C). However, the evolution of C stocks in such newly formed soils remains largely unknown. This work aimed at evaluating the dynamics of C in constructed Technosols, focusing on two experimental sites in Lorraine, France, where Technosols were constructed from thermally-treated industrial soil, papermill sludge and green waste compost, and planted with grasses. Soil samples were collected over 12 years, and stocks of C were calculated, taking into account the increase in soil bulk density and the associated decrease in soil thickness over the years. The evolution of the stocks of organic C was compared to the evolution reported for natural grassland soils from the same region and for other Technosols. Initial organic C stocks in the two constructed Technosols were 50% higher than in natural analog soils when calculated over 30 cm, and up to 5 times higher when calculated over 100 cm. Organic C stocks in the two Technosols decreased over the first three years, but increased during the following years, most likely due to the accumulation of plant-derived C. A similar evolution was observed in other planted Technosols. We conclude that Technosols constructed from an adequate set of parent materials can keep large amounts of organic C over time and sequester additional C under permanent plant cover. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Derelict land; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil compaction; Technogenic materials","Carbon; Composting; Land reclamation; Soil mechanics; Vegetation; Green waste compost; In- situ monitoring; Natural grassland; Papermill sludge; Soil bulk density; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil compaction; Technogenic materials; Soils; bulk density; carbon sequestration; compaction; environmental monitoring; experimental study; global climate; grassland soil; in situ measurement; land reclamation; natural analog; soil carbon; soil type; France; Grand Est; Lorraine; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054852234

The implementation of the Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA) regulation was expected to raise the operating cost for RoRo and RoPax shipping, and slow steaming was proposed as an immediate solution to save the increased cost. Previous research has investigated the issue of slow steaming and SECA using a quantitative approach. However, the reaction of the RoRo and RoPax shipping firms toward slow steaming as a mitigating factor in the face of expected additional SECA compliance costs using qualitative methodology has not been explored yet. In addition, the knowledge regarding the impact of slow steaming on the competitiveness of short sea RoRo and RoPax with respect to service quality is limited. This article has addressed these issues through the analysis of multiple cases focusing on RoRo and RoPax firms operating in the North and Baltic Seas. Overall, our findings suggest that the 0.1% SECA regulation of 2015 requiring the use of higher-priced MGO has not caused slow steaming in the RoRo and RoPax segments to a large extent. The increased bunker prices are partially transferred to the customers via increased Bunker Adjustment Factor and partly borne by the shipowners. We have found that out of 11 case firms in our study only one RoRo and one RoPax firm have reduced vessel speeds to compensate for the additional SECA compliance costs. We conclude that for RoPax and RoRo segment bunker prices, rigorous competition and, most important, different service quality requirements have significantly restricted the potential implementation of slow steaming. © 2019 by the authors.","Competitiveness; SECA compliance; Short sea shipping; Slow steaming","competitiveness; compliance; knowledge; service quality; shipping; vessel; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062919534

Plants differ in their potential to capture, store and release carbon. Consequently, it is important to develop a trait-based relationship between plant functional diversity and carbon stocks. Here, we studied seven primary plant traits (tree height, wood density (WD), leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC)) of 10 dominant tree species and their relationship with carbon stocks in a temperate forest ecosystem. We found that both stem and leaf traits were significant predictors of carbon storage. Among the traits studied, community-weighted mean (CWM) of tree height, SLA and LPC and functional divergence (FDvar) of tree height, LNC, and LDMC were the most important components determining carbon accumulation in the temperate forest. These results suggest that CWM and FDvar are significant in understanding the role of plant traits in carbon storage. The results also suggest that the mass ratio and niche complementarity hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but rather act simultaneously in biomass accumulation, i.e. carbon capture, in temperate forest ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Carbon; Community-weighted mean; Functional divergence; Leaf traits","Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Biomass accumulation; Carbon accumulation; Functional divergence; Leaf nitrogen content; Leaf traits; Plant functional diversities; Temperate forest ecosystems; Weighted mean; Forestry; bioaccumulation; carbon; carbon sequestration; complementarity; divergence; forest ecosystem; functional change; leaf; niche; plant community; temperate forest; Himalayas; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057734040

The 30% fire case reflects a 70% reduction in fire activities due to harvesting of logging residues for use as a feedstock for a potential aviation biofuel supply chain. Overall model performance improves for several performance metrics when fire emissions are included, especially for organic carbon, irrespective of the model goals and criteria used. This effect on model performance is more pronounced for the rural and remote IMPROVE sites for organic carbon and total PM2.5. A reduction in prescribed fire emissions (30% fire case) results in significant improvement in air quality in areas in western Oregon, northern Idaho, and western Montana, where most prescribed fires occur. Prescribed burning contributes to visibility impairment, and a relatively large portion of protected class I areas will benefit from a reduced emission scenario. For the haziest 20% days, prescribed burning is an important source of visibility impairment, and approximately 50% of IMPROVE sites in the model domain show a significant improvement in visibility for the reduced fire case. Using BenMAP, a health impact assessment tool, we show that several hundred additional deaths, several thousand upper and lower respiratory symptom cases, several hundred bronchitis cases, and more than 35,000 workday losses can be attributed to prescribed fires, and these health impacts decrease by 25–30% when a 30% fire emission scenario is considered. Implications: This study assesses the potential regional and local air quality, public health, and visibility impacts from prescribed burning activities, as well as benefits that can be achieved by a potential reduction in emissions for a scenario where biomass is harvested for conversion to biofuel. As prescribed burning activities become more frequent, they can be more detrimental for air quality and health. Forest residue-based biofuel industry can be source of cleaner fuel with co-benefits of improved air quality, reduction in health impacts, and improved visibility. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Air cleaners; Air quality; Biofuels; Health; Organic carbon; Smoke; Supply chains; Visibility; Biofuel supply chains; Health impact assessment; Natural environments; Performance metrics; Potential reduction; Prescribed burning; Respiratory symptoms; Visibility impairment; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058695896

The impact of peatland WT on ecosystem function, including C exchange, alters over time, and the factors that cause some peatlands to display resilience and others to undergo degradation are poorly understood. Here we use CO 2 flux measurements, measured by eddy covariance, to compare ecosystem function between two raised bogs; one drainage-affected, with a deep and fluctuating water table and the other near-natural, with a shallow and stable water table. The drainage-affected bog was found to be a moderate sink for CO 2 (69 g C m −2 yr −1 ), which was 134 g C m −2 yr −1 less than the near-natural bog (203 g C m −2 yr −1 ). Greater ecosystem productivity has allowed the drainage-impacted bog to act as a CO 2 sink despite higher ecosystem respiration; most likely due to an increase in photosynthetic capacity caused by expansion of ericaceous shrub cover. The tolerance of the vegetation community, particularly the main peat former Empodisma robustum (Restionaceae), to low and fluctuating WT appears to have been key in allowing the site to remain a sink. Despite the current resilience of the ecosystem CO 2 sink, we found gross primary production to be limited under both high and low water tables, even in a year with typical rainfall. This is best explained by the limited physiological ability of ericaceous shrubs to tolerate a fluctuating WT. As such we hypothesise that if the WT continues to drop and become even more unstable, then without further vegetation change, a reduction in gross primary production is likely which may in turn cause the site to become a source for CO 2 . © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Eddy covariance; ER; GPP; Light response; Water table","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Erbium; Vegetation; Wetlands; Biogeochemical process; Ecosystem productivity; Eddy covariance; Gross primary production; Light response; Photosynthetic capacity; Water table fluctuations; Water tables; Groundwater; carbon dioxide; rain; carbon dioxide; ground water; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; eddy covariance; water table; wet deposition; Article; carbon sink; controlled study; ecosystem resilience; Empodisma robustum; environmental impact; Ericaceae; land drainage; nonhuman; peatland; photosynthesis; plant; primary production (biomass); priority journal; vegetation; water table; air pollutant; analysis; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; Finland; wetland; Empodisma; Restionaceae; Air Pollutants; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Finland; Groundwater; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057119095

Changes in SOC are likely to vary across soil and climate conditions, yet long-term data to elucidate these trends across different ecosystems remains limited. In this study we evaluated long-term changes in SOC across a gradient of climate conditions (from arid to hyper humid), soil orders, and land uses (non- cultivated, woody perennial, and cultivated) in central Chile. Thus, we sought to find evidence for SOC changes in the agricultural lands over past three or four decades. Surface soils (8–29 cm depth) were sampled between 2014 and 2016 and analyzed for total C and N content, aggregate stability, texture, bulk density, pH as well as spectral properties using Mid-infrared (MidIR) and Near-infrared spectroscopy. SOC stocks were compared to those previously measured at the same sites between 1968 and 1994, covering a wide range of SOC values (from 12 Mg C ha−1 to 128 Mg C ha−1). Our findings show that the largest SOC losses occurred in semiarid and subhumid areas for the time frame considered, decreasing from their initial C stocks by 24.7% and 26.1%, respectively. Moreover, cultivated soils in semiarid regions were more vulnerable than those in arid regions to SOC losses. The results also indicated that in cooler and humid regions, SOC stocks were stable or increased over time. Among soil orders, Mollisols showed the largest losses (29.9% reduction between sampling dates). The MidIR results indicate that the mineral bands for clays and silicates were associated with these sites demonstrating SOC conservation, suggesting that mineral protection played an important role in the long-term SOC storage in semiarid areas. This study provides a better understanding of temporal changes of SOC to address the restoration of degraded land and adaptation for future trends in global change. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Mid-infrared spectroscopy; Mollisols; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Phyllosilicate clay; Soil carbon sequestration","Agriculture; Arid regions; Digital storage; Infrared devices; Infrared spectroscopy; Land use; Magnesium; Near infrared spectroscopy; Organic carbon; Silicates; Soils; Climate change mitigation; Developing strategy; Environmental control; Mid-infrared spectroscopy; Mollisols; Phyllosilicate; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Climate change; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate conditions; long-term change; Mollisol; near infrared; organic carbon; soil carbon; spectroscopy; temporal variation; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056650448

Modal shifts in freight, that is, moving freight from a higher emission mode to one associated with lower emissions, are discussed as a strategy to reduce emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, there is limited knowledge of the magnitude of potential benefits and their impacts on human health. The overall goal of this study is to identify and characterize the potential of modal shifts in freight transport for mitigating air pollutant emissions, air pollutant concentrations, population exposure to air pollutants, and health impacts. The analysis was conducted in the Canadian context, with a focus on land-based freight such as trucks, trains, and pipelines, as well as marine shipping for inland and coastal waters. A structured review of the existing literature database, and a critical assessment of the findings was conducted, using a weight-of-evidence approach. The assessment took into consideration potential local and regional variables for Canada. The results indicated that there is limited evidence that road-to-rail, road-to-marine, and rail-to-marine modal shifts could reduce pollutant and GHG emissions. There was insufficient evidence on modal shifts involving the pipeline mode, and on the air quality, population exposure, and health impacts related to any modal shift.

Objective of this research was to determine the operating strategies to reduce the start-up phase of high-solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD) process and to improve the digestion of food waste (mainly fruits and vegetable wastes [FVW]) with or without animal manure in a low-cost AD system at 20-25°C. In addition, this study aimed to obtain the basic design criteria for starting up of scaled-up HSAD system using adapted liquid inoculum. Inoculum to feedstock ratio was varied from 6:1 to 3:1. The organic loading rate (OLR) expressed as volatile solids (VS) and operational cycle length was varied from 0.44-2.1 KgVS Kginoculum-1 d-1 and 33-14d, respectively. Obtained results show that methane (CH4) production from FVW was feasible at low-to-moderate temperature and specific methane yield of 0.4-0.6 L gVS-1 was observed even at high OLR. CH4 conversion rates and its quality were not affected, while maintaining the operational stability (e.g. no acidification or VFA accumulations). CH4 content reached over 60% and remained almost steady. Results also suggest that HSAD process at 25°C is comparatively efficient in saving heat energy and at the same time obtains the CH4 values close to mesophilic conditions. This means that the smaller size digester (in the case of HSAD) is preferred as there is no waste dilution involved and also suitable for cold countries. Using this concept, livestock producers can play a role in reducing GHG emissions while also earning C-offset credits. © 2018 Cisa Publisher.","Biomass adaptation; Fruit and vegetable waste; High-solid anaerobic digestion; Low-to-moderate temperature; Methane yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087794397

The development of micro-cogeneration systems based on dual fuel engines requires the actual heat recovery estimation, which in turn depends on the power efficiency in all operating range. In this paper, the development of a dual-fuel engine cogeneration model (DECOG) based on International Energy Agency-Annex 42 methodology is presented. This model considers the effect of substitution level on micro-cogeneration efficiencies, capturing these effects on model correlations. Through an experimental study, the steady-state performance of the unit is presented and analyzed and compared with original correlations of Annex 42 model. The effect of overall thermal conductance variations with the load and substitution level are analyzed. Good agreement was found between the model proposed and the data collected to calibrate it, with cumulative errors below 4% for system efficiencies, pilot fuel flow rate, and air flow rate. An improvement near to 90% on the agreement between experimental and predicted efficiencies was found using the correlations of the model proposed respect to IEA-Annex 42 model correlations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dual fuel engine; MCHP; Micro-cogeneration; Model calibration","Cogeneration plants; Diesel engines; Fuels; Waste heat; Compression-ignition engines; Effect of substitution; International energy agency; MCHP; Micro cogeneration; Model calibration; Part load conditions; Steady state performance; Dual fuel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061318787

The roof albedo measured in the field tests is independent of the inverted pyranometer height. A 0.493 increase in solar reflectance (laboratory measurements) yields SRI increase by 67.5, roof surface temperature reduction by 25.5 °C, annual peak demand reduction by 0.1 kWm-2yr-1, and annual net energy savings by 6.8 kWhm-2yr-1, while a 0.459 increase in roof albedo (laboratory measurements) generates SRI increase by 62.3, roof surface temperature reduction by 23.5 °C, annual peak demand reduction by 0.1 kWm-2yr-1, and annual net energy savings by 6.4 kWhm-2yr-1.

They also vary in the same sector when governments at two levels (national and subnational) have different political alignments. As the policy environment becomes more complex, with global problems like climate change, and politics more dividing, better coordination among various levels of government is a tough governance challenge. Scholars and practitioners need to realize how best to build institutions to bridge the various levels of government in different political environments and environmental sectors. This research analyzes the influence of intergovernmental relations in two environmental sectors in two localities with contrasting political alignments between two levels of government. It draws lessons from solid waste management and climate policy in two Malaysian states (Johor and Penang). In an evolving State and new policy arenas, when formal institutions for intergovernmental relations may not be effectively in place, politics play an even larger role through the discretionary power of federal and subnational authorities. An open political process can help with the engagement of different political groups and civil society to bring legitimacy, resources and efficiency to environmental management, if it is done with robust intergovernmental institutions; otherwise, intergovernmental relations can also become a tool for zero-sum games, cronyism and patrimonialism, which can undermine policies, and result in inefficiencies and ineffectiveness in environmental management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Asia; Climate change; Developing country; Environmental governance; Intergovernmental relations; Johor; Malaysia; Penang; Waste management","civil society; climate change; developing world; environmental management; environmental policy; governance approach; intergovernmental relations; political process; solid waste; waste management; article; climate change; developing country; environmental management; government; human; Johor; Penang; physician; solid waste management; politics; solid waste; waste management; Asia; Johor; Malaysia; Penang; West Malaysia; Climate Change; Government; Politics; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059625079

The original design of Tamm plasmon structures features a purely one-dimensional array of layers including a Bragg mirror and a metal. The resonant field enhancement next to the metal interface corresponding to optical Tamm states leads to resonant emission at the target wavelength, which depends on the lateral dimensions of the bandgap structure. We demonstrate the application of this concept to a silicon slab structure instead of deploying extended one dimensional layers thus enabling coupling into slab waveguides. Here we focus on the mid-infrared region for absorption sensing applications, particularly on the CO2 absorption line at 4.26 μm as an example. The proposed genetic-algorithm optimization process utilizing the finite-element method and the transfer-matrix method reveals resonant absorption in case of incident modes guided by the slab and, by Kirchhoff's law, corresponds to emittance up to 90% depending on different choices of the silicon slab height when the structure is used as a thermal emitter. Although we focus on the application as an emitter in the present work, the structure can also be operated as an absorber providing adjusted lateral dimensions and/or exchanged materials (e.g., a different choice for metal). © 2019 by the authors.","Mid-infrared; Silicon photonics; Tamm plasmons; Thermal emitter","CMOS integrated circuits; Genetic algorithms; Infrared devices; Integrated circuit design; Interface states; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Plasmons; Silicon photonics; Surface states; Band-gap structures; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Genetic-algorithm optimizations; Mid-infrared regions; Midinfrared; One-dimensional arrays; One-dimensional layers; Thermal emitter; Transfer matrix method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063507196

Health is enhanced when livestock forage on phytochemically rich landscapes, is reduced when livestock forage on simple mixture or monoculture pastures or consume high-grain rations in feedlots, and is greatly reduced for people who eat highly processed diets. Circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that phytochemical richness of herbivore diets enhances biochemical richness of meat and dairy, which is linked with human and environmental health. Among many roles they play in health, phytochemicals in herbivore diets protect meat and dairy from protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation that cause low-grade systemic inflammation implicated in heart disease and cancer in humans. Yet, epidemiological and ecological studies critical of red meat consumption do not discriminate among meats from livestock fed high-grain rations as opposed to livestock foraging on landscapes of increasing phytochemical richness. The global shift away from phytochemically and biochemically rich wholesome foods to highly processed diets enabled 2.1 billion people to become overweight or obese and increased the incidence of type II diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Unimpeded, these trends will add to a projected substantial increase in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) from producing food and clearing land by 2050. While agriculture contributes one quarter of GHGE, livestock can play a sizable role in climate mitigation. Of 80 ways to alleviate climate change, regenerative agriculture—managed grazing, silvopasture, tree intercropping, conservation agriculture, and farmland restoration—jointly rank number one as ways to sequester GHG. Mitigating the impacts of people in the Anthropocene can be enabled through diet to improve human and environmental health, but that will require profound changes in society.

We examine this question and argue that without access to additional earmarked financial resources, climate action would get overshadowed by developmental priorities and effective mainstreaming might not be possible. A systematic literature review was carried out to draw insights from the current state of implementation of adaptation projects, programmes and schemes at the subnational levels, along with barriers to mainstreaming climate change adaptation. The findings from a literature review were supplemented with lessons emerging from the implementation of India’s National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC). The results of this study underscore the scheme’s relevance. Key policy insights Experience with NAFCC implementation reveals that states require sustained ‘handholding’ in terms of financial, technical and capacity support until climate change issues are fully understood and embedded in the policy landscape. Domestic sources of finance are critically important in the absence of predictable and adequate adaptation finance from international sources. The dedicated window for climate finance fosters a spirit of competitive federalism among states and encourages enhanced climate action.

Although the architecture of AP systems resembles that of the natural leaves, they lack an important component like stomata to capture CO2 directly from the dilute sources. Here we design and evaluate the solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiency of the integrated AP system that captures CO2 directly from the air/flue gas and converts it to fuels using sunlight. The thermodynamic limit to the STF efficiency of such integrated AP system range from 34% to 40% for various products such as CO, HCOOH, CH4, CH3OH, C2H4, and C2H5OH using ideal multijunction light absorbers and reversible carbon capture. The performance limits of real, integrated AP systems are obtained here for two different integration schemes such as integrated cascade systems and fully integrated systems that use technology-ready materials and components. The fully integrated AP systems can be &gt;66% more efficient than the integrated cascade systems as they do not need additional energy for compression, separation, and recycling of CO2. While the integrated cascade systems show highest STF efficiency with the adsorption-based carbon capture process, the fully integrated AP systems are only compatible with the membrane-based carbon capture process. We also show that the synthesis of higher-electron products such as CH4, CH3OH, C2H4, and C2H5OH can be more favorable for the robust operation of an integrated AP system. A design of the fully integrated AP system is proposed that uses moisture-gradient across the anion-exchange membrane to capture CO2 from the air, which is then converted directly to fuels using water, and sunlight. Such a fully integrated AP system can produce ∼0.4 ton/day of CO at a cost of ∼185/ton and STF efficiency of ∼14% while reducing the CO2 level of the surrounding air by 10% at steady-state operation. The fully integrated AP systems are modular, scalable, and ∼14 times more efficient than natural leaves.

Climate change is emphasized as being just a part of the total risk for human life and health and economic growth, which is proved by the set of goals of sustainable development adopted by the world community. Hence, a solution of the problem of climate change is necessary—in the long and and distant future—but insufficient condition to minimize the risk for the quality of human life, primarily health, and sustainable economic growth. It is agrued that an efficient action strategy to reduce climate risks for socioeconomic development must target not finding the ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but rather development and implementation of a set of measures to ensure the basic goals of sustainable development. In addition, priority must be given to the reduction of emissions of hazardous substances, as well as to planning and implementing measures of the communitiesэ and economy adaptation to climate change with adaptation remaining a key component of the climate risk reduction policy.

They evolved ecological specialisations and exhibit behaviours that make them particularly informative subjects to study palaeoenvironmental constraints affecting species distribution and speciation. Interspecific competition and isolating geographical barriers are considered as the principal factors that define species range boundaries. The present paper provides a first comprehensive compilation of the living and extinct Spermophilus species in Europe. These data suggest ‘patchwork quilt’ model for the expansion and spatial distribution of ground squirrel species. Here we consider mainly small-sized Spermophilus species because large-sized (e.g., S. superciliosus) ground squirrels consist another ‘patchwork quilt’, which overlap the first one. This overlapping of the species ranges is possible because of the size difference that lowers interspecific competition (Hutchinson's rule). We consider two main types of range boundaries. One type includes roughly ‘sub-parallel’ boundaries that oscillate in concert with climatic and vegetational changes (a case of climatically controlled competitive exclusion). The other type consists of roughly ‘sub-meridional’ boundaries corresponding to geographical barriers (e.g., water barriers, mountain ridges); these boundaries are rather stable. Examples of ‘sub-parallel range modifications include: oscillations of boundaries between S. pygmaeus and S. suslicus; the immigration of S. citellus into the Pre-Carpathian area; the branching of S. suslicus from S. pygmaeus; the regional appearance of the Late Pleistocene species S. severskensis and S. citelloides. Examples of ‘sub-meridional events’ are: the crossing of the Danube by S. citellus; the appearance of an isolated population of S. pygmaeus on right bank of the Dnieper during the Late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene; a crossing of the Dnieper river by S. pygmaeus, which resulted in the appearance of S. odessanus; the intrusion of eastern populations of S. pygmaeus into the Trans-Volga areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Geographical barriers; Interspecific competition; Palaeobiogeography; Quaternary; Species range dynamics; Spermophilus","interspecific competition; paleobiogeography; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; Quaternary; range size; rodent; species occurrence; species richness; Black Sea; Europe; Mammalia; Spermophilus; Spermophilus citellus; Spermophilus pygmaeus; Spermophilus suslicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045853353

This paper investigated battery electric vehicle (BEV) substitution of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) on a provincial level, to better plan for additional electricity requirements. This was achieved by developing the E-StratBEV model, using system dynamics. The model results show that nationally, although the Low Growth scenario indicates about 233,700 BEVs by 2040, the adjusted number (based on the spending behaviour within deciles) may result in 44,155 BEVs while the High Growth scenario's expected 2.39 million BEVs by 2040 could be adjusted down to 451,736 BEVs. For a coal heavy supply mix, the cumulative carbon emissions from 2019 until 2040 resulted in negligible benefits, so provinces may not be able to leverage on passenger electric vehicles to reduce provincial environmental emissions. Lastly, the BEV growth drivers introduced an additional 1589 BEVs to the Low Growth scenario and an additional 16,257 BEVs to the High Growth targets from 2019 to 2040, with the purchase price being the dominant driver. © 2018","Battery electric vehicles; Carbon emissions; Electricity demand; South Africa","Coal combustion; Economic analysis; Housing; Internal combustion engines; Secondary batteries; Carbon emissions; Demographic profile; Electricity demands; Environmental emissions; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Residential electricity; Residential sectors; South Africa; Battery electric vehicles; carbon emission; combustion; demand analysis; economic growth; electric vehicle; energy market; energy storage; engine; residential energy; substitution; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060914437

We assessed Tillandsia recurvata L. species as a biomonitor of air pollution in an urban area, using the passive biomonitoring method. The objectives of this work were to analyze the abundance of T. recurvata, morphophysiological parameters, heavy metals accumulation and its relation as biointegrators, indicating the impact through the change in population density. Five sample points were selected and classified according to vehicle traffic. Points P1 and P2 were classified as high traffic, point P3 was classified as moderate traffic, and points P4 and P5 were classified as low traffic. The abundance analysis and the results obtained for metals analysis (by cluster analysis) were correlated with the intensity of vehicular traffic (P1 > P2 = P3 > P4 = P5). Such result demonstrates that the abundance of T. recurvata is greater in air-pollution-impacted urban areas, thus indicating that T. recurvata absorbs and accumulates metals and can be used in biomonitoring of air pollution in urban areas affected by vehicular traffic. Morphophysiological parameters analyzed showed that the plant’s internal structure is not impacted by urban air pollution due to the plant’s adaptations and her ecological plasticity. Spearman correlation has not shown correlation between the concentrations of the metals studied and morphophysiological parameters analyzed. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the T. recurvata as a passive biomonitor of pollution, with an affordable and immediate application, especially in cities from the Southern Hemisphere, where is abundant. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; Bioaccumulation; Bioindication; Ecological plasticity; Heavy metals; Passive biomonitoring","cadmium; chromium; copper; heavy metal; iron; lead; zinc; air pollution; Article; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; classification; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecological plasticity; nonhuman; plasticity; pollution monitoring; population abundance; population density; priority journal; Tillandsia; Tillandsia recurvata; traffic; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056817753

Thus, present study was undertaken to determine the disease incidence (DI) and disease severity (DS) in six different vegetable and fruit crops namely Cucumis sativus, Brassica oleracea var. botrytis, Capsicum annuum, Solanum lycopersicum, Luffa sp. and Fragaria spp. grown under protected cultivation in various areas of Ladakh. Results suggest that the DI for the studied crops did not show significant variation (F ≤ 2.7; p ≥ 0.15). Similarly, the DS among the study crops was also statistically indifferent among different protected cultivation sites studied in different areas of Ladakh region (p ≥ 0.08), except for Solanum lycopersicum (F = 6.1; p = 0.037). The highest DI recorded was 51.5 ± 5.5 in Solanum lycopersicum followed by 30.9 ± 5.2 in Brassica oleracea var. botrytis. Similarly, highest DS was 27.0 ± 3.1 observed in Solanum lycopersicum followed by 23.6 ± 4.8 in Brassica oleracea var. botrytis.

We explored the association between state-level policy liberalism and past-year cannabis use (CU) and cannabis use disorder (CUD). Methods: We obtained state-level prevalence of past-year CU and CUD among past year cannabis users for ages 12–17, 18–25, and 26+ from the 2004–2006 and 2010–2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. States were categorized as liberal, moderate, or conservative based on state-level policy liberalism rankings in 2005 and 2011. Linear models with random state effects examined the association between policy liberalism and past-year CU and CUD, adjusting for state-level social and economic covariates and medical cannabis laws. Results: In adjusted models, liberal states had higher average past-year CU than conservative states for ages 12–17 (+1.58 percentage points; p = 0.03) and 18–25 (+2.96 percentage points; p = 0.01) but not for 26+ (p = 0.19). CUD prevalence among past year users was significantly lower in liberal compared to conservative states for ages 12–17 (−2.87 percentage points; p = 0.045) and marginally lower for ages 26+ (-2.45 percentage points; p = 0.05). Conclusion: Liberal states had higher past-year CU, but lower CUD prevalence among users, compared to conservative states. Researchers and policy makers should consider how the broader policy environment, independent of MCL, may contribute to CU outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cannabis; Cannabis/marijuana use disorder; Marijuana; Medical cannabis laws; Medical marijuana laws; State-level policy","medical cannabis; cannabis; medical cannabis; adolescent; adult; Article; cannabis addiction; cannabis use; child; demography; economic aspect; groups by age; health care policy; health practitioner; human; law; male; management; prevalence; priority journal; public health; social aspect; aged; cannabis addiction; cannabis smoking; cross-sectional study; drug legislation; epidemiology; female; legislation and jurisprudence; middle aged; policy; politics; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cannabis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Legislation, Drug; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Marijuana Smoking; Medical Marijuana; Middle Aged; Policy; Politics; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062807931

The heating and cooling of buildings represents 40% of global energy consumption, while vast energy savings potential remains largely unexploited. Given the low turnover of housing stock and ambitious emission reduction targets, most of this potential will require retrofitting existing buildings. In this study, we investigate how to best take advantage of retrofits in the residential sector of Quebec (Canada) using environmental and economic criteria. Within the province, heating is mainly powered by electricity from renewable sources. We propose an approach based on a consequential life cycle assessment that focuses on marginal impacts combined with “consequential life cycle costing.” Seven alternatives using different heating systems and building envelopes are compared to a reference case, which consists of a typical detached house heated with electric baseboards. This approach permits an assessment of cost-efficiency and sustainable technological solutions. Our results show that the amount of energy saved by retrofits (especially for air source heat pumps with and without building envelop improvements) generates environmental and economic benefits.

The number of excited particles decreases by means of photon emission through interactions of the particles. We analyse the rare event of flashes, i.e., the emission of a very large number of photons B during a fixed time interval T . We employ the theory of large deviations to provide the asymptotics of the probability of such event when the total number of particles N tends to infinity. This theory gives us also the optimal trajectory of scaled process corresponding to this event. The stationary regime of this process we call the large emission regime. In several cases we prove that in the large emission regime a share of excited particles in a system is stable under the changes of the pumping and emission rates. © 2019 Independent University of Moscow.","Continuous-time Markov processes; Hamiltonian; Hamiltonian system; Infinitesimal generator; Large deviations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063409086

Measures to address climate change include both mitigation to reduce emissions and adaptation to climate change impacts. Prior to the Paris Conference of Parties 21 in 2015, few low-income countries had made extensive progress on either mitigation or adaptation. Ethiopia’s Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) policy, introduced in 2011, stands out as an unusual example in its scope to reduce future emissions while also promoting adaptation through economic development. The formation of Ethiopia’s CRGE between 2011 and 2014 demonstrates how a low-income country can rapidly develop a comprehensive policy for climate change using green growth. A case from the Rift Valley, however, illuminates the challenges facing government efforts to have its climate policy reach its predominantly rural population. Using multiple methods of key informant interviews, analysis of policy documents, and survey data collected during three years of study, 2012–2014, the data suggest a confluence of factors contributed to the design and emergence of Ethiopia’s climate policy, notably Ethiopia’s institutional autonomy and capacity. Despite being at the global forefront of climate policy for low-income countries, the reach of the Ethiopian state to implement programmes in the rural sector remains limited. Ultimately, Ethiopia is a bellwether for the combined mitigation and adaptation policy responses needed in many low-income countries to promote sustainable development in the face of climate change. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate policy; Ethiopia; green growth; mitigation","adaptive management; climate change; economic development; emission control; environmental policy; green economy; low income population; mitigation; national economy; questionnaire survey; rural area; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; Ethiopia; Kenya; Rift Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042931502

Because the impacts are most acutely felt in local communities, it is critical to improve understanding of the response options that are available for and being chosen by communities. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of case studies reporting community-based responses to climate change hazards. Based on content analysis of published case studies, we generated an emergent evidence-based typology of such responses according to their nature and goals. Using this typology, we quantitatively analysed more than 1500 response examples and determined the patterns with which community-level climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation strategies vary across world regions and across economic and governance conditions. Specifically, diversity of responses is lower in developing countries, and implementation of local-level policy and planning responses is less frequent in countries characterised by low governance quality. Our results confirm that, although there is much that local communities can do to respond to the challenges of climate change, there is also a need for increased support of local activities. By synthesising data from many local studies, our research provides a first global evidence base for local-level climate change adaptation policy. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Developing countries; Hazards; Climate change adaptation; Climate hazards; Community-based; Content analysis; Disaster mitigation; Global analysis; Local activity; Local community; Climate change; climate change; community response; developing world; disaster management; global perspective; governance approach; quantitative analysis; typology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059863988

In Morocco, on the other hand, there is less gender mainstreaming policy, but potentially more activity that is inclusive of gender considerations at the local levels with governmental policies to de-centralize decision-making for local development.

Beckwith Avenue, Missoula, MT  59801, United States","Forests are an incredibly important resource across the globe, yet they are threatened by climate change through stressors such as drought, insect outbreaks, and wildfire. Trailing edge forests—those areas expected to experience range contractions under a changing climate—are of particular concern because of the potential for abrupt conversion to non-forest. However, due to plant-climate disequilibrium, broad-scale forest die-off and range contraction in trailing edge forests are unlikely to occur over short timeframes (<~25–50 yr) without a disturbance catalyst (e.g., wildfire). This underscores that explicit attention to both climate and disturbance is necessary to understand how the distribution of forests will respond to climate change. As such, we first identify the expected location of trailing edge forests in the intermountain western United States by mid-21st century. We then identify those trailing edge forests that have a high probability of stand-replacing fire and consider such sites to have an elevated risk of fire-facilitated transition to non-forest. Results show that 18% of trailing edge forest and 6.6% of all forest are at elevated risk of fire-facilitated conversion to non-forest in the intermountain western United States by mid-21st century. This estimate, however, assumes that fire burns under average weather conditions. For a subset of the study area (the southwestern United States), we were able to incorporate expected fire severity under extreme weather conditions. For this spatial subset, we found that 61% of trailing edge forest and 30% of all forest are at elevated risk of fire-facilitated conversion to non-forest under extreme burning conditions. However, due to compounding error in our process that results in unknowable uncertainty, we urge caution in a strict interpretation of these estimates. Nevertheless, our findings suggest the potential for transformed landscapes in the intermountain western United States that will affect ecosystem services such as watershed integrity, wildlife habitat, wood production, and recreation. © 2019 The Authors.","climate analog model; climate change; climatic debt; disequilibrium; disturbance; trailing edge forest; type conversion; wildfire; wildland fire",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073958346

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust, rigorous and replicable methodology that is flexible to data limitations and spatially prioritizes the vulnerability of agriculture and rural livelihoods to climate change. We have applied the methodology in Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua, three contrasting developing countries that are particularly threatened by climate change. We conceptualize vulnerability to climate change following the widely adopted combination of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. We used Ecocrop and Maxent ecological models under a high emission climate scenario to assess the sensitivity of the main food security and cash crops to climate change. Using a participatory approach, we identified exposure to natural hazards and the main indicators of adaptive capacity, which were modelled and analysed using geographic information systems. We finally combined the components of vulnerability using equal-weighting to produce a crop specific vulnerability index and a final accumulative score. We have mapped the hotspots of climate change vulnerability and identified the underlying driving indicators. For example, in Vietnam we found the Mekong delta to be one of the vulnerable regions due to a decline in the climatic suitability of rice and maize, combined with high exposure to flooding, sea level rise and drought. However, the region is marked by a relatively high adaptive capacity due to developed infrastructure and comparatively high levels of education. The approach and information derived from the study informs public climate change policies and actions, as vulnerability assessments are the bases of any National Adaptation Plans (NAP), National Determined Contributions (NDC) and for accessing climate finance. © 2019 Parker et al.

In most large-size aerobic treatment plants, the excess sludge is digested in anaerobic reactors (AD), with the concomitant CH4 emissions. The guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have been adopted worldwide for quantifying the national emission inventories, which include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as a key category. The IPCC recommends using default emission factors (Tier 1) for countries with limited available data (such as Mexico and most developing countries). However, these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty, owing to the lack of reliable information about the operation process and local environmental conditions. In order to reduce uncertainty in the estimation of CH4 emission from WWTP in Mexico, a country-specific emission factor was determined for AD associated with activated sludge process. This was accomplished with on-site data obtained from the AD of six activated sludge WWTP. In addition, the measured CH4 emissions were compared to those resulting from the application of the IPCC Tier 1 method, using the recommended default methane correction factor (MCF: 0.8) as well as alternate values (0.32 and 0.26) recently proposed by the authors. Results show that the IPCC Tier 1 method, using the recommended MCF, highly overestimate CH4 emissions compared with the values obtained on-site. In contrast, the alternate MCF achieved better estimations than the IPCC-recommended MCF, much closer to the observed emission values. The CH4 emission factor proposed as country (Mexico) specific value is 0.49 kg CH4/kg BODrem, which would allow the application of IPCC Tier 2 method. By doing so, the uncertainty associated with CH4 emission from aerobic treatment plants with AD would be reduced. This, in turn, would provide important information for implementing appropriate CH4 mitigation strategies for the water sector. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Activated sludge; Country-specific emission factor; Methane correction factor; Methane emissions; Sludge digestion","Activated sludge process; Anaerobic digestion; Bioactivity; Climate change; Developing countries; Methane; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater treatment; Activated sludge; Correction factors; Emission factors; Environmental conditions; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Methane emissions; National emission inventories; Wastewater treatment plants; Sludge digestion; biogas; methane; methane; activated sludge; anoxic conditions; emission inventory; methane; wastewater treatment plant; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; calculation; climate change; environmental management; extreme environment; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 method; intermethod comparison; methodology; Mexico; on site determination; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sewage treatment plant; sludge digestion; waste water management; air pollutant; anaerobic growth; analysis; bioreactor; comparative study; devices; environmental monitoring; procedures; sewage; Mexico [North America]; Air Pollutants; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Mexico; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057553711

The 5th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change explicitly calls upon nations to enhance C-stock accounting and mitigate losses of global forest C sinks, which inherently will require more accurate and higher spatial resolution carbon accounting. Monitoring and predicting how disturbances, such as invasive species, influence forest C stocks and the transfer of C from live to dead pools remains a high priority both in the scientific and policy communities. We documented the effects of invasive North American beavers (Castor canadensis) on C-sequestration of riparian Nothofagus forests in Tierra del Fuego, Chile. Our paired plot sampling design quantified significant losses from beaver invasion in total aboveground, live standing, dead standing, and dead and downed C stocks (P &lt; 0.001, paired t tests).

Regression analysis is performed on the measured data by Simplified Local-Density model coupled with modified Peng-Robinson Equation of State (SLD-PR). Absolute sorption capacity of these two shale core samples is estimated based on the density profile of SLD-PR model. Additionally, the absorbed gas, which is regarded as the gas molecules dissolving/diffusing into the bulk of solid kerogen, is distinguished from the adsorbed gas through interpreting the results of gas expansion measurements using Fick's law of diffusion. Moreover, methane diffusion coefficients for the two shale core samples are determined, which range from 10−22 m2/s to 10−21 m2/s. The percentage of absorbed gas accounting for total sorbed gas increases with pore pressure. When the pore pressure increases, more gas molecules attempt to adsorb on the surface of kerogen and create a larger gas concentration gradient for gas diffusing into the kerogen. The gas molecules, which adsorb on the pore walls of kerogen and then diffuse into the solid lattice of kerogen, may lead to the swelling of kerogen and thus reduce the pore width for free gas transportation. Therefore, the accurate prediction of the gas absorption capacity of kerogen is significant to understand gas storage mechanism and characterize original gas in place (OGIP) in shale gas reservoirs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption; Adsorption; Diffusion; Kerogen swelling","Absorption; Adsorption; Core samples; Diffusion; Digital storage; Equations of state; Gases; Kerogen; Methane; Molecules; Oil shale; Petroleum reservoirs; Pore pressure; Quay walls; Regression analysis; Suspensions (components); Swelling; Accurate prediction; Analytical estimations; Fick's law of diffusion; Local-density models; Organic-rich mudstone; Original gas in places; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Shale gas reservoirs; Gas absorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057817581

However, natural history collections can have biases that influence the analysis of phenological events. Arctic environments, where remoteness and cold climate govern collection logistics, may give rise to unique or pronounced biases. Methods: We assessed the presence of biases in time, space, phenological events, collectors, taxonomy, and plant traits across Nunavut using herbarium specimens accessioned at the National Herbarium of Canada (CAN). Results: We found periods of high and low collection that corresponded to societal and institutional events; greater collection density close to common points of air and sea access; and preferences to collect plants at the flowering phase and in peak flower, and to collect particular taxa, flower colours, growth forms, and plant heights. One-quarter of collectors contributed 90% of the collection. Discussion: Collections influenced by temporal and spatial biases have the potential to misrepresent phenology across space and time, whereas those shaped by the interests of collectors or the tendency to favour particular phenological stages, taxa, and plant traits could give rise to imbalanced phenological comparisons. Underlying collection patterns may vary among regions and institutions. To guide phenological analyses, we recommend routine assessment of any herbarium data set prior to its use. © 2019 Panchen et al.

Codoping is a conventional strategy for manipulating the photoluminescence of active RE 3+ ions. However, energy transfer between sensitizers and activators usually induces nonradiative migration depletion that brings detrimental luminescent quenching. Here, a transparent framework is employed to assemble ordered RE 3+ -doped emitters to extend the emission spectral range by extracting photons from a variety of RE 3+ ions with sequential energy gradient. To block migration-mediated depletion between different RE 3+ ions, a nanoscopic heterogeneous architecture is constructed to spatially confine the RE 3+ clusters via a “nanocrystals-in-glass composite” (NGC) structure. This bottom-up strategy endows the obtained RE 3+ -doped NGC with high emission intensity (nearly one order of magnitude enhancement) and broadband near-infrared emission from 1300 to 1600 nm, which covers nearly the whole low-loss optical communication window. Most crucially, NGC is a versatile approach to design tunable broadband emission for the potential applications in high-performance photonic devices, which also provides new opportunities for engineering multifunctional materials by integration and manipulation of diverse functional building units in a nanoscopic region. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, we report the promotion of CO 2 reduction on N-C through the integration of increasing the numbers and inherent catalytic reactivity and selectivity of pyridinic N dopants. A novel sacrificial soft-templating approach was developed to construct a two-dimensional holey carbon nanostructure to preferentially host dense edge-located pyridinic N, and electron-rich fluorine (F) was simultaneously incorporated to activate pyridinic N sites by engineering their electronic properties. Consequently, the resultant N,F-codoped holey carbon layers achieve a CO Faradaic efficiency of 90% at a low overpotential of 490 mV for 40 h without decay, significantly surpassing the F-free N-C counterpart. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electron donation from a nearby F atom increases the charge density and delocalizes electronic density of states of pyridinic N. These electronic benefits thus greatly promote the CO 2 activation on the highly dense and active pyridinic N sites by facilitating the electron transfer and strengthening the binding interaction with∗COOH intermediate. The discovery of dopant-induced synergistic interaction may create a path for manipulating catalytic CO 2 reduction properties. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","CO 2 reduction; density functional theory; electrocatalysis; fluorine; nitrogen-doped carbon","Binding energy; Binding sites; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysis; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic density of states; Electronic properties; Fluorine; Nitrogen; Binding interaction; Carbon Nanostructures; Catalytic reactivity; CO2 reduction; Faradaic efficiencies; Intrinsic reactivity; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Synergistic interaction; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061555036

In order to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of this decision, the system must be examined using a life cycle approach. Furthermore, attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) does not suffice for a number of reasons, including the fact that ALCA does not model the incremental system and that allocating the benefits of recycling inhibits the modelling of system-wide consequences caused by the decision studied. This study thus uses a consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) framework. We examine the physical and economic processes that guide the North American light-duty vehicle fleet from its initial state in 2012 to a state in 2050. Industry projections are used to model the production and use phases. The system is expanded to include the scrap and material markets. This generates new insights regarding the environmental consequences of changes in scrap generation and recycling in automotive material substitution. The method is applied to the fleet in order to forecast if and when aluminum intensification constitutes net GHG reduction under various conditions. Using baseline parameter values compiled from public and industry data; we calculate a GHG payback period of 25 years, i.e. before a net reduction in emissions relative to a no change counterfactual is achieved. A local sensitivity analysis is performed, showing that the net GHG reduction may be achieved in a period as short as 12 years, or never be achieved at all. A global sensitivity analysis is performed using Monte Carlo simulation, where 16% of trials never reach a net reduction in GHG emissions. We also estimate which parameters contribute the most to variance in the model outcomes. The material replacement coefficient, or the amount of aluminum it takes to functionally replace one kilogram of steel, is the top contributor to the variance (29.8%). Overall, the results are most sensitive to parameters governing the amount of mass that can be replaced by each kilogram of additional aluminum, the GHG intensity of additional aluminum production, and the response of the aluminum scrap and material markets to additional aluminum scrap generation. We conclude that given the current lack of understanding of key parameters and their underlying uncertainties, it is not possible to definitively state that substituting aluminum for steel results in a net reduction in GHG emissions from a fleet of vehicles. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"Commerce; Fleet operations; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Sensitivity analysis; Vehicles; Automotive materials; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Environmental consequences; Global sensitivity analysis; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Light-duty vehicle fleet; Local sensitivity analysis; Life cycle; aluminum; decision making; emission control; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; parameterization; recycling; sensitivity analysis; steel; strategic approach; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059473027

The vis-NIR spectroscopy research enthusiasm around the world has created regional to global soil spectral libraries. While machine learning methods have been utilised in processing spectral data, such large regional datasets are better dealt with big data analytics. Deep learning is an exciting discipline that has already transformed the way data are analysed in many fields and could also change the way we model soil spectral data. This study developed and evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, as a new way to predict soil properties from raw soil spectra. We demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs on the LUCAS soil database, which consists of around 20,000 topsoil observations with physicochemical and biological properties from Europe. To fully utilise the capacity of the CNN model, we represented the soil spectral data as a 2-dimensional spectrogram, showing the reflectance as a function of wavelength and frequency. We showed the capacity of a CNN to be trained in a multi-task setting to simultaneously predict six soil properties in one model (OC, CEC, clay, sand, pH, total N). Compared with conventional methods such as PLS regression and Cubist regression tree, the CNN performed significantly better, especially the multi-tasking model. In the case of soil organic carbon prediction, the multi-task CNN decreased the error by 87% compared to PLS and 62% compared with Cubist. This approach proved to be effective when trained on a relatively large dataset. The high accuracy of CNN makes it an ideal tool for modelling soil spectral data. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Multi-task learning; Simultaneous prediction; Spectrograms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058709154

Currently, most of the existing research on PM2.5 have used linear regression analysis; very few studies on the subject have been conducted using non-linear models. This study adopts a panel threshold model, which is seldom used in environmental studies, to examine the non-linear effects of environmental regulation and economic growth on PM2.5 in 30 OECD countries, and we also explore the key driving socio-economic factors for PM2.5 emissions. The results of our analysis show that, along with an increase in environmental policy stringency, PM2.5 emissions first rise and then show no significant correlations, and thus a reduction in emissions can be expected if current trends continue. As for GDP per capita, significant and negative correlations are found across the three phases divided by the panel threshold model, indicating a promoting effect for PM2.5 mitigation. In addition, public expenditure on the air sector correlated positively with PM2.5 concentrations, expanding the share of service economy reward to reduce air pollution, and urban population ratio exhibits an inverted U-shaped pattern.

This study investigates how local practitioners in Metro Vancouver municipalities perceive and apply these concepts to reduce risk and adapt to flood hazards. Results from focus groups and surveys of practitioners find that the conceptualizations of vulnerability and resilience perceived as most valuable are often not applied in local risk reduction and adaptation efforts. Participants’ interpretations of how vulnerability and resilience concepts are applied to four main adaptation strategies—protect, accommodate, avoid, and retreat—reveal nuanced and complex challenges at the intersection of where theory meets practice. As currently operationalized, vulnerability and resilience appear unlikely to lead to anything more than incremental adaptation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate change; Floods; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reductions; Flood hazards; Focus groups; Risk reductions; Hazards; adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; ecosystem resilience; flood; hazard management; local participation; vulnerability; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064054294

PM2.5 causes similar outcomes but its effect among pulmonary compromised cancer survivors is unknown. This case-crossover study identified the PM2.5-associated odds for primary-respiratory hospitalizations and emergency department visits among childhood cancer survivors in Utah. We compared risk among chemotherapy-treated survivors to a cancer-free sample. We calculated 3-day-average PM2.5 by ZIP code and county for event and control days. Conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios. Models were stratified by cause of admission (infection, respiratory disease, asthma), previous chemotherapy, National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), and other variables. Results are presented per 10 µg/m3 of PM2.5. 90% of events occurred at 3-day PM2.5 averages &lt;35.4 µg/m3, the NAAQS 24-h standard. For survivors, PM2.5 was associated with respiratory hospitalizations (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.13–3.00) and hospitalizations from respiratory infection (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.06–4.14). Among chemotherapy-treated survivors, the PM2.5-associated odds of respiratory hospitalization (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.14–3.61) were significantly higher than the cancer-free sample (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.57–1.25). This is the first study to report significant associations between PM2.5 and respiratory healthcare encounters in childhood cancer survivors. Chemotherapy-treated survivors displayed the highest odds of hospitalization due to PM2.5 exposure and their risk is significantly higher than a cancer-free sample. © 2019 by the authors.

Alternatively, the diesel generator system can combine with other power supply systems to reduce the effect of greenhouse gases emitted to the environment and to improve power supply reliability. This paper aims at establishing an optimized configuration for typically powering base transceiver stations using remarkable hybrids of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) with optimal performance in cost consideration, emission, space management and adequate reliability in base-transceiver station area. The optimization was tested on the diverse set of hybrids of RESs for powering BTSs in Southwestern part of Nigeria using Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewables (HOMER) micro grid Analysis Tool 3.8.7. The simulated results show that hybrid H2 made of Photovoltaic Cell (PV), Wind Turbine, Diesel Generator, Battery Storage and Converter has the lowest Total Net Present Cost (TNPC) in Lagos, Ogun and Oyo States while hybrid H1 made of PV and DG emerged as the best in Ondo, Ekiti and Osun States. Hybrid H2 with desired characteristics has an average TNPC reduction of 35.01 % over the present system of Diesel Generator-only. Further results revealed precisely that TNPC responds more to change in the global horizontal irradiation than any other uncontrollable variables. These notable findings will be extremely applicable for a cost-effective and environmentally friendly powering schemes that may be efficiently implemented on BTSs in different Southwestern regions of Nigeria. © 2019 South African Institute of Electrical Engineers.

To date, there has not been a systematic study on climate patterns on these planets that will significantly influence their observations. Here we investigate the atmospheric dynamics of nonsynchronized, fast-rotating exoplanets across various radiative timescales, eccentricities, and obliquities using a shallow water model. The dynamical pattern can be demarcated into five regimes in terms of radiative timescale τ rad and obliquity θ. An atmosphere with τ rad shorter than a planetary day usually exhibits a strong day-night temperature contrast and a day-to-night flow pattern. In the intermediate τ rad regime between a planetary day and a year, the atmosphere is dominated by steady temperature and eastward jet patterns for θ ≤ 18° but shows a strong seasonal variation for θ ≥ 18° because the polar region undergoes an intense heating at around the summer solstice. If τ rad is larger than a year, seasonal variation is very weak. In this regime, eastward jets are developed for θ ≤ 54° and westward jets are developed for θ ≥ 54°. These dynamical regimes are also applicable to planets in eccentric orbits. The large effects of exoplanetary obliquities on circulation patterns might offer observational signatures, which will be investigated in Paper II of this study. © 2019.

Attempts have been made to use local feed resources in order to reduce feed costs. The objective of this study was to identify effect of using crushed tamarind seed meal (TSM) in concentrate mixture on rumen fermentation, dry matter intake, and digestibility of dairy steers. Four rumen-fistulated dairy steers were used in a 4 × 4 Latin Square Design. Four levels of TSM were used to replace rice bran (RB) in the concentrate mixtures in four treatments (T1 = 0% replacement of RB, T2 = 30% replacement of RB, T3 = 60% replacement of RB, T4 = 100% replacement of RB). The findings revealed that replacement of TSM for RB resulted in similar digestibility of nutrients and intakes (P > 0.05). However, rumen fermentation parameters were remarkably improved, namely total VFA and the concentration of C3 especially at the highest level of replacements (100%, T4), (P < 0.05). Rumen protozoal population was found lowered in all replacements, especially those in higher levels of TSM replacement. Consequently, the rumen methane productions were significantly reduced. TSM can be a promising energy source to replace rice bran, hence lowering the cost of concentrate mixture. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Feed resource; Rumen fermentation; Tamarind seed meal","analysis; animal; animal food; bovine; diet; digestion; fermentation; male; Oryza; physiology; plant seed; rumen; tamarind; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Digestion; Fermentation; Male; Oryza; Rumen; Seeds; Tamarindus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054643356

It is now in fact evident that a careful heat waste management leads not only to primary energy savings, but also to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, often with economic sustainability. The case presented here refers to a steel hot-forging industry situated in the Nord-west of Italy that is equipped with steel hot processing devices, and, in particular, with methane ovens for the hot cutting machines. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to carry out a project aimed at the recovery of the hot flows exiting from the ovens in order to produce electric and thermal power that could be used in the same industrial activity or in tertiary activities near the factory itself. After an in-depth analysis in this technological activity inside the factory concerning the electricity and natural gas consumption and hot gas flow-rate availability, different power plant solutions were considered and evaluated. At the end of the analysis process, the choice fell upon an Organic Rankine Cycle with a power of 50 [kWel]. The technical and economic analysis of this powerplant furnished a pay-back period between the 17th and the 18th year, as far as electrical energy is concerned, which was considered excessively long. An acceptable payback period, that is, of less than ten years, was instead found for the recovery of the thermal power of the ORC plant, which could be utilized, through a remote heating system, for public buildings, such as elementary/primary schools and the City Hall, which are located very close to the factory. In short, with this plant solution, it will be possible to produce more than 150 MWh/year of electric energy and about 600 MWh/year of thermal energy, with a reduction in CO2 emission of around 174 tons per year and also the energy saving, in terms of ""Tons of Oil Equivalent"", has been calculated around a mean value of 24 tons/year. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cutting; Earth sciences; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Flow of gases; Forging; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Machinery; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Ovens; Rankine cycle; Sustainable development; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Waste management; Economic sustainability; Energy saving methods; Environmental aspects; Industrial activities; Natural gas consumption; Organic Rankine cycles; Primary energy savings; Technological activity; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063467744

The precise patho-mechanisms of PLMT still remain unknown. Herein, we examined ten patients clinically identified with PLMT syndrome. All patients first presented persistent pain prior to the onset of motor symptoms. Each patient was examined by neurological investigation, neuro-imaging methods including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological methods. The brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of eight patients indicated hypoperfusion of frontal lobes and cerebellum. The conjunction analysis of brain SPECT imaging data of all eight patients, using the 3D-SSP program, compared to 34 controls indicated significant hypoperfusion in the prefrontal cortical, occipital cortical, and cerebellar surfaces, and thalamus, and hyperperfusion in the surface of the anterior cingulate gyrus and parietal cortices including primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, bilaterally. These areas reflected on a part of the pain matrix. Other electrophysiological examinations did not indicate specific abnormalities to explain the patients’ symptoms. On treatment with clonazepam, four out of nine patients could resolve their foot-related motor symptoms, but not the sensory symptoms. Overall, their pain was an intractable and persistent symptom throughout their clinical course. Our study infers that PLMT syndrome is fundamentally a chronic pain disorder, possibly relating to the central sensitization, involving the region of a part of pain matrix. Further studies need to confirm our results by adding more patients. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chronic pain; Pain matrix; Painful legs and moving toes syndrome; SPECT","baclofen; clonazepam; quetiapine; adult; aged; anterior cingulate; Article; cerebellum; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; electrophysiological procedures; female; frontal lobe; human; involuntary movement; male; neuroimaging; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; numeric rating scale; pain measurement; painful legs and moving toes syndrome; priority journal; retrospective study; single photon emission computed tomography; thalamus; treatment response; brain; chronic pain; diagnostic imaging; dyskinesia; leg; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; single photon emission computed tomography; syndrome; toe; Adult; Brain; Chronic Pain; Dyskinesias; Female; Humans; Leg; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Syndrome; Toes; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059961157

Most of these sites are located in remote and isolated aged-background regions, and few are in urban/semi-urban sites having averaged AOD ∼0.1 at 500 nm. These selected sites have a global distribution including tropical, mid-latitudes, high-latitudes and Polar regions. Among them, there are 14 high-altitude stations (∼1028–5050 m amsl), including Himalayan and Polar regions. The main objective of the present work is to evaluate the AOD trends over the aged-background sites across the globe. We found that significant number of sites located in North-South America, Europe, Arctic and Australia have statistically significant and negative trends varied from −6.3x10 −3 to −1.0x10 −3 AOD year −1 . The negative trends over these sites could be attributed to reduction in anthropogenic emission. Furthermore, there are mixed trends of positive as well as negative over Asian and southern oceanic regions including Antarctica. Some of the trends are weak and statistically non-significant, probably due to non-availability of long-term ground based data. However, the AOD trends over these regions show increasing tendency with statistically significant trends of 8.0x10 −4 to 4.7x10 −3 AOD year −1 . The present study has also many important aspects on global and regional climate change at high-mountain and aged-background sites in particular, where the satellite based measurements are inaccurate and biased due to extremely low AOD. © 2019","AERONET; Aerosol optical depth; Aged-background; Anthropogenic; SKYNET",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056473695

It has been recognized that Heilongjiang Province has become an important source of CH4 emission due to its dramatically increased rice planting area, while less attention has been paid to characterize the effects of climate change on the spatiotemporal dynamics of CH4 fluxes. In this study, we used the calibrated and validated Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) model and DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to simulate historical and future CH4 fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 of four global climate models (GCMs) in Heilongjiang Province. During 1960–2015, the average CH4 fluxes and climatic tendencies were 145.56 kg C/ha and 11.88 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. Spatially, the CH4 fluxes showed a decreasing trend from west to east, and the climatic tendencies in the northern and western parts were higher. During 2021–2080, the annual average CH4 fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 were predicted to be 213.46 kg C/ha and 252.19 kg C/ha, respectively, and their spatial distributions were similar to the historical distribution. The average climatic tendencies were 13.40 kg C/ha/(10a) and 29.86 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively, which decreased from west to east. The simulation scenario analysis showed that atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature affected CH4 fluxes by changing soil organic carbon (SOC) content and plant biomass. This study indicated that a paddy ecosystem in a cold region is an important part of China’s greenhouse gas emission inventory in future scenarios. © 2019 by the authors.

There is little data available on emissions from these sources, especially in the unique climate and management of central Africa. This research aimed at quantifying CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions from two open dumpsites in Cameroon, located in Mussaka-Buea, regional headquarters of the South West Region and in Mbellewa-Bamenda, regional headquarters of the North West Region. Emissions were measured during the wet season (May 2015 and August 2016) at the Mussaka and Mbellewa dumpsites respectively. Dumpsite surfaces were partitioned into several zones for emission measurements, based on the current activity and the age of the waste. Static flux chambers were used to quantify gas emission rates thrice a day (mornings, afternoons and evenings). Average emissions were 96.80 ± 144 mg CH4 m−2 min−1, 0.20 ± 0.43 mg N2O m−2 min−1 and 224.78 ± 312 mg CO2 m−2 min−1 in the Mussaka dumpsite, and 213.44 ± 419 mg CH4 m−2 min−1, 0.15 ± 0.15 mg N2O m−2 min−1 and 1103.82 ± 1194 mg CO2 m−2 min−1 at the Mbellewa dumpsite. Emissions as high as 1784 mg CH4 m−2 min−1, 2.3 mg N2O m−2 min−1 and 5448 mg CO2 m−2 min−1 were measured from both dumpsites. Huge variations observed in emissions between the different zones on the waste surface were likely a result of the heterogeneous nature of the waste, different stages in waste decomposition and different environmental conditions within the waste. Management activities that disturb waste, such as spreading and compressing potentially increase gas emissions, while covering waste with a layer of soil potentially mitigate gas emissions. Recommendations were for dumpsites to be upgraded to sanitary landfills, and biogas production from such landfills should be exploited to reduce CH4 emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Dumpsites; Fluxes; Greenhouse gases; Landfill; Municipal solid waste","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Fluxes; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Biogas production; Dumpsites; Emission measurement; Environmental conditions; Gas emission rates; Management activities; Static flux chamber; Waste decompositions; Municipal solid waste; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; methane; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; landfill; municipal solid waste; waste management; Article; Cameroon; carbon footprint; climate change; decomposition; landfill; municipal solid waste; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; soil property; solid waste management; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; solid waste; waste disposal facility; Cameroon; Cameroon; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042601502

It is thus necessary to develop a model which evaluates the trade-off between economic and environmental influences prior to a policy implementation. Recent studies have proved the effectiveness of input–output linear programming model in identifying the optimal solutions when different climate policies are considered. However, analyzing sectoral linkage to give priority sectors and then finding optimal solutions through reducing pollution from these sectors, which help avoid the economic losses from low-polluting sectors, have not been figured out in previous works. This study first uses input–output an (IO) analysis to provide a measure of structural interdependence among economic sectors and present priority sectors. An IO optimization model is then developed for minimizing the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in order to identify strategies for GHG intensity reduction in Vietnam, focusing on the priority sectors. In addition, the effect of GHG emissions on human health using the disability adjusted life years (DALY) is further evaluated. Six scenarios are considered to identify the potentials of highest GHG intensity reduction that can be obtained by the year 2020. These scenarios encompass BAU, the consideration of different GDP growth rates, differentiated economic sector growth, economic restructure, and the adaptation of lower-pollution technology implementation for the priority sectors. Each scenario quantifies sectoral final demand, sectoral gross domestic output, sectoral GHG emissions, GHG intensity, and DALY. The linkage analysis results indicate that agriculture, fishery and forestry, transport and communication, personal, community and household, manufacturing of non-metallic mineral products, and mining and quarrying are priority sectors. The optimization solutions present that the best strategy is by taking advantages of identified measures. The best solution obtains 20.3% reduction in GHG intensity compared to baseline. These obtained results become the useful suggestions for decision makers and environmental management in designing successful environmental regulations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate policy; DALY; Greenhouse gas emissions; Input–output analysis; Linear programming; Optimization problem","climate change; economic growth; emission; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; linear programing; optimization; trade-off; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050828750

The selected problem for algorithm implementation is a bounded and non-linear optimization problem. In the present paper, it has been tried to reduce the production costs, as well as the polluting gases emitted while generating energy. The proposed algorithm is based on multi-objective optimization algorithm of Genetic Algorithm, which is a meta-heuristic algorithm. In this paper, an idea is suggested to improve the efficiency of the multi-objective optimization algorithm. After implementation and comparing the results obtained for the multi-objective standard algorithm with the previous works, it was observed that the proposed algorithm can obtain better results. To investigate the results, a 3-generator system with and without considering the losses was used. However, in each state, 3 different demands for energy was considered and the algorithm was implemented on this system.

They also account for 1.81% of the total bricks produced in the South Asian region. Little is known about their emissions, which are consequently not represented in regional/global emission inventories. This study compared emissions from seven brick kilns. Four were Fixed Chimney Bull's Trench Kilns (FCBTKs) and three were Induced-Draught Zigzag Kilns (IDZKs). The concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), black carbon (BC), and particulate matter (PM) with a diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) were measured. The respective emission factors (EFs) were estimated using the carbon mass balance method. The average fuel-based EF for CO2, SO2, PM2.5, and BC were estimated as 1633 ± 134, 22 ± 22, 3.8 ± 2.6 and 0.6 ± 0.2 g per kg, respectively, for all FCBTKs. Those for IDZKs were 1981 ± 232, 24 ± 22, 3.1 ± 1, and 0.4 ± 0.2 g per kg, respectively. Overall, the study found that converting the technology from straight-line kilns to zigzag kilns can reduce PM2.5 emissions by ~20% and BC emissions by ~30%, based on emission factor estimates of per kilogram of fuel. While considering per kilogram of fired brick, emission reductions were approximately 40% for PM2.5 and 55% for BC, but this definitely depends on proper stacking and firing procedures. © 2019 by the authors.

In-plane fibre orientation is measured using a Radon-transform method applied to local 2D images extracted from the 3D dataset formed from a 2D scan of pulse-echo responses. The ability to align these local 2D images to the plies in the region being assessed makes this technique suitable even in laminates where out-of-plane ply wrinkling is present.

The study integrates the global responses to mounting concentrations at three levels – climatic, cropping and economic – to determine the deviations in crop production and irrigation water requirements from a ‘no climate change’ socioeconomic development storyline. The biophysical effects are considered comprehensively for eight crop classes by taking into account alterations both to rainfed and irrigation yields, and to irrigation water intensities. These changes in crop growing conditions are explored in the 2004–2050 timeframe across two concentrations pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP 8.5) with the inclusion of the CO 2 fertilisation effect. The economic responses are determined through a global water CGE model (RESCU-Water) comprising a bottom-up representation of crop systems. Changes in climatic conditions reduce crop output and depress the global water demand for irrigated crops in spite of an increase in irrigation water intensities. Discrepancies in crop production impacts between tropical and temperate regions increase with CO 2 concentration levels.

Milos Island is chosen as a representative island of the Cyclades complex in the Aegean Sea. Future climate change conditions are analyzed using the high-resolution simulations (grid size 0.11 ? × 0.11?) of the Regional Climate Model ALADIN 5.2 from Centre National de Recherche Meteorologiques, Meteo France (CNRM). The climate simulations concern the future periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 against the reference period 1961-1990, under two Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Based on regional climate simulations, the tourism potential can be described in a meaningful and simple way by applying the Climate-Tourism-Information-Scheme (CTIS), which depicts detailed climate information that could be used by tourists to foresee the thermal comfort, aesthetic, and physical conditions for planning their vacations. More specifically, the thermal climate component is interpreted by the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET), which is one of the most popular physiological thermal indices based on the human energy balance. The findings of the analysis could be used by stakeholders and the tourism industry in decision-making regarding the destination of Milos for tourism planning and touristic infrastructure development. © 2019 by the authors.

REDD+ is however, initiated from outside these communities and often enters a landscape characterized by power asymmetries. This paper documents a case-study from Kondoa, Tanzania and finds that even when local people seem to be generally in control of decision making, one may seriously question if there is true empowerment and real citizen control. The paper explores local participation in the various stages of establishing REDD+; i.e., deciding whether to participate, demarcating land and formalizing ownership, deciding on land use plans/by-laws and on the benefit sharing mechanisms. Results reveal that participation may not lead to empowerment and genuine control if the structures and processes of participation reinforce the underlying power differentials among the actors. The study further shows how the broader governance structure spanning from the international to the local level influences REDD+ processes at the local level, and recommends that global and national policy should account for the various forms of power of the actors operating at different levels. © 2018","Africa; Land use planning; Participation; Payments; Power; REDD+ policy; Tanzania","Behavioral research; Decision making; Deforestation; Gold; Africa; Land Use Planning; Participation; Payments; Power; Tanzania; Land use; Africa; Decision Making; Deforestation; Gold; Power; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057015662

In this work, the interfacial behavior of the pure methane-, ethane-, and propane-water, and the ternary 90:7:3 mol. % gas mixture of (methane + ethane + propane)-water were studied with molecular dynamics simulations. The interfacial tension, γ, and z-density profiles for the gases and water from simulations of the gas-water systems were determined at the temperatures of 275.15 and 298.15 K, and pressures up to 10 MPa for methane and up to near the experimental saturation pressures of ethane and propane. The goal is to accurately calculate the interfacial tension for the hydrocarbon/water systems and to analyze the molecular behaviors at the interfaces which lead to the observed trends. At the same hydrostatic gas phase pressure, propane, ethane, and methane reduce the gas-water interfacial tension in that order. The local density of the gas molecules at the interface is enhanced relative to the bulk gas, and it was determined that about 13%-20%, 33%-40%, and 54%-59% of the gas molecules in the simulation congregated at the interfaces for the CH 4 -, C 2 H 6 -, and C 3 H 8 -water systems, respectively, at the different simulated hydrostatic pressure ranges. For all gases in the pressure range studied, a complete monolayer of gas had not formed at the water interface. Furthermore, a dynamic equilibrium with fast exchange between molecules at the interface and in the gas phase was observed. For the gas mixture, deviations were observed between total calculated interfacial tension, γ mix , and the ""ideal mixture"" value, ςx i γ i,pure , calculated from the interfacial tensions of the pure gases, where x i is the mole fraction of each substance in the simulation.

However, a significant increase in production of biofuels might potentially be realized at the expense of overusing natural resources, particularly land and water. Understanding the tradeoffs between the impacts on land and water arises as a critical issue in the development of biofuels. This energy-water-land nexus might be particularly important for Brazil, which currently is the world's second largest producer and the largest exporter of biofuels. Furthermore, Brazil itself has set up its own Intended Nationally Determined Contribution agenda with a significant growth of biofuel production (18%) by 2030. Most studies on environmental impacts of biofuel production have either focused on land use or water use, but very few studies assessed both. Using an environmentally extended multiregional input-output (MRIO) approach, this study analyzes the current water-land nexus of bioenergy production in Brazil by quantifying the distribution of tradeoffs and synergies between land and water use for bioethanol production and its environmental consequences across Brazilian states. Our results show a clear tradeoff of water and land impacts and significant differences between irrigated and rainfed ethanol production. When including water and land scarcity in the analysis, the results are significantly different, uncovering very different tradeoffs and synergies between bioethanol producer and consumer states that could inform the expansion of bioenergy in Brazil. Compared to other crops, sugarcane has a higher comparative advantage relative to land than to water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Brazil; Land-water nexus; Multi-regional input-output analysis","Biofuels; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Land use; Bio-ethanol production; Bioenergy productions; Brazil; Climate change mitigation; Comparative advantage; Environmental consequences; Input output analysis; Input output model; Bioethanol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060895661

Around 60 percent of low-income households on the South African Highveld rely on solid fuels to meet their energy needs (cooking, water heating and space heating, especially in winter), despite being electrified. The aim of this research is to optimise energy use mix in a typical low-income household on the Highveld for least cost, lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and lowest particulate matter (with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm - PM10) emissions. The study employs secondary data from Eskom's air quality offsets pilot project in KwaZamokuhle and other studies on energy use patterns. The energy requirements and constraints for an insulated, formal house are expressed as linear programming problems. The solutions reveal that using coal for cooking, space and water heating, and electricity for lighting and appliances, is the least cost option. However, for lowest CO2 and PM10 emissions, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is most suitable for cooking, space heating and water heating, and electricity is preferred for lighting and appliances. These findings suggest that policies and initiatives that encourage LPG and electricity use should improve air quality in low-income communities and aid in climate change mitigation, but will not be sustainable unless the LPG or electricity is affordable for households. © 2019 cape peninsula university of technology.","Domestic energy; Electrification; Energy consumption; Household air pollution; Low-income household","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy utilization; Fuels; Gas emissions; Lighting; Linear programming; Space heating; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Domestic energy; Electrification; Linear programming problem; Liquid petroleum gasses (LPG); Low incomes; Low-income communities; Liquefied petroleum gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068408746

However, information on growth and ecosystem services of urban trees under changed climate conditions are rare for most species. This study investigated the intra-annual growth patterns of two common but physiologically contrasting urban tree species: small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Although meteorological variables at the study site in the outer city center of Munich, Germany for the year 2016 were similar to the long-term average climate (1961–1990) different growth patterns were found. This was mainly influenced by species characteristics (water use efficiency, wood anatomy) leading to different transpiration rates and reaction patterns to drought stress. Moreover, species’ drought reactions compared to past years were analyzed in detail with a retrospective dendrochronological approach. Distinct species patterns were identified, highlighting the greater drought tolerance and recovery of R. pseudoacacia compared to T. cordata. These results show that under a drier and warmer climate T. cordata can provide more canopy air cooling for short periods of time due to high transpiration, albeit this is at the expense of great water demands and following growth declines under water shortage. Contrary, R. pseudoacacia proved to be a more suitable and adapted species at sites with less water availability due to better water use efficiency, even at the cost of low canopy transpiration though higher soil moisture and latent heat exchange from the soil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Drought; Robinia pseudoacacia; Tilia cordata; Transpiration; Urban tree growth; Water use efficiency","Agronomy; Drought; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Forestry; Lime; Physiology; Reaction rates; Soil moisture; Transpiration; Water supply; Canopy transpirations; Latent heat exchanges; Meteorological variables; Robinia pseudo-acacia; Tilia cordata; Transpiration rates; Urban trees; Water use efficiency; Urban growth; annual variation; climate conditions; climate effect; deciduous tree; dendrochronology; drought stress; ecosystem service; growth; microclimate; tolerance; transpiration; tree planting; urban climate; water use efficiency; Bavaria; Germany; Munich; Robinia pseudoacacia; Tilia cordata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057770355

Therefore, it is not surprising that research efforts have been directed towards developing efficient treatment technologies including various physical–chemical processes. In this paper we present a thermo-chemical degradation method (pyrolysis) to produce biochar. The large part of work is devoted to understand the pyrolysis processes using on-line analysis of thermal parameters and chemical composition. The originality of our work resides in the on-line analysis in the form of temperature measurements during individual pyrolysis cycles as well as the whole pyrolysis process, accompanied with on-line measurements of component concentrations during the whole pyrolysis process. On-line and ex-post analysis of gas phase composition provides important information about environmental impacts of the pyrolyzing process. The concentration profiles of CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , H 2 and NO X were measured at four locations within the pilot system with a high sampling frequency (every 8 s) during whole pyrolysis process. In terms of the general aspects and possible future application of pyrolysis and its products we propose a novel method capable to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in pyrolysis gas. The average CO 2 removal efficiency during the whole pyrolysis process was as high as 65%. The final product is solid proteinoid. The pyrolysis process decrease the amont of waste to 10% of input amount of material.

But while the contribution to mitigation has been analyzed extensively in the literature, the impact on development has seldomly been quantified empirically. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the impacts of CDM projects on local employment. We use a dynamic panel regression model across Brazilian municipalities for the period 2004–2014 to estimate cross-sectoral employment effects of two project types: hydro projects and methane avoidance projects. We find that CDM projects have mixed effects on sectoral employment. Municipalities with hydro projects show a positive impact on commerce and a negative on agricultural employment. In a similar way, these effects have also been identified in municipalities with methane avoidance projects, as well as positive effects in the service and the construction sector. Regardless of project type, the sectoral employment effects are found to be small and transitory, i.e. these took place immediately or within the first, second or third year after the registration of the project, corresponding to the construction phase and early years of operation. Revenues from Certified Emission Reductions (CER) seem to have no or a very small positive impact on sectoral employment, and no significant impact is found for the CER price fall in 2012. © 2018 The Authors","CER Crisis; Clean Development Mechanism; Dynamic Panel Model; Employment Generation; Hydro and Methane Avoidance Projects; Renewable Energy","alternative energy; cleanup; emission control; employment generation; environmental economics; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; mitigation; panel data; project management; sustainable development; testing method; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056637467

This requires national level planning, monitoring and reporting and methods for effective global-scale adaptation tracking. However, unlike mitigation, where clear targets and goals have been agreed, adaptation is a process with varied and changing goals and risk context. Assessing adaptation plans and strategies can provide valuable insights into ongoing adaptation policy, because the plans give good indications of priorities and institutional thinking. To assess how adaptation planning aligns to the Paris Agreement, this paper used Article 7 of the agreement to develop criteria and applied these to assess national adaptation plans and strategies available in English from 36 least developed, 8 developing and 10 developed countries. The results suggest that adaptation planning aligned to the Paris Agreement can help bring a different focus to development pathways that promotes synergies rather than trade-offs between environmental, social and economic goals. Importantly, tracking adaptation planning can help ensure the continued mobilisation of the parties, guide adaptation planning nationally and locally, and support global-scale consistency in planning and action. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation planning; Climate change adaptation; Climate change policy; National adaptation plans; Paris agreement","article; climate change; developed country; France; human; human experiment; thinking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056707386

Carbon species are involved in diverse Earth processes, ranging from sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous petrology to the long-term viability of life at the Earth’s surface. Volcanoes, and their associated magmatic systems, represent the interface through which carbon is transferred from the deep Earth to the surface. Thus, quantifying the CO2 budget of volcanic systems is necessary for understanding the deep carbon cycle and, concomitantly, the CO2 budget of the near surface, including the atmosphere. In this review, Kilauea volcano (Hawaii) is used as a case study to illustrate simple calculations that can account for processes that affect the amount and distribution of CO2 in this relatively well-studied volcanic system. These processes include methods to estimate the concentration of CO2 in a melt derived by partial melting of a source material, enrichment of CO2 in the melt during fractional crystallization, exsolution of CO2 from a fluid-saturated melt, trapping and post-entrapment modification of melt inclusions, and outgassing from the volcanic edifice. Our goal in this review is to provide straightforward example calculations that can be used to derive first-order estimates regarding processes that control the CO2 budgets of magmas and that can be incorporated into global carbon cycle models. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Volcanoes; Deep carbon cycles; Fractional crystallization; Global carbon cycle; Long-term viability; Magmatic systems; Pedagogical approach; Volcanic edifice; Volcanic systems; Budget control; atmospheric modeling; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); estimation method; magma; melt; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kilauea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063354073

Moreover, we aim to determine if some of these instruments could impair the normal histological diagnosis of these lesions. Material and Methods: We included 130 consecutive surgical samples of 80 females and 50 males (mean age of 53.82±16.55) with a histological diagnosis of an oral benign fibrous-epithelial hyperplasias. The samples were categorized into 6 groups according to the type of instrument used: CO2 laser group, diode laser group, Er:YAG laser group, Nd:YAG laser group, electrosurgical scalpel group and cold scalpel group. Histological instrument-induced changes were microscopic evaluated and related with clinical and pathological variables. Results: The instrument with highest tissue damage extension (TDE) was the electrosurgical scalpel (1002.2μm±434.92), followed by diode laser (913.73 μm±322.45), Nd:YAG (899.83μm±327.75), CO2 laser (538.37μm±170.50), Er:YAG laser (166.47μm±123.85), and at last with fewer alterations the cold scalpel group (2.36μm±7.27) (P < 0.001). The most regular incision was observed in CO2 laser group, followed by Er:YAG laser, Nd:YAG laser, electrosurgical scalpel and diode laser group with the less regular incision using cold scalpel as comparison (P < 0.001). A correlation was found between the incision score and TDE (P < 0.001). Regarding histological diagnosis, no case showed any limitation of diagnosis related with the use of any instrument evaluated. Conclusions: Our results suggest that lasers can be used for the excision of oral benign fibrous-epithelial hyperplasias, without hispathological diagnosis limitations, as long as the physical properties of each laser are known and respected. Er:YAG laser have shown to be a laser with few tissue damage extension and with good incision regularity, been a possible instrument of choice for the surgical removal of these lesions. © Medicina Oral S.

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Fugitive methane (CH4) emissions from landfills are significant global sources of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere; thus, reducing them would be a beneficial way of overall greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. In Europe, landfill owners have to report their annual CH4 emissions, so direct measurements are therefore important for (1) evaluating and improving currently applied CH4 emission models, (2) reporting annual CH4 emissions and (3) quantifying CH4 mitigation initiatives. This paper aims at providing an overview of currently available methodologies used to measure fugitive CH4 emissions escaping from landfills. The measurement methodologies are described briefly, and the advantages and limitations of the different techniques are discussed with reference to published literature on the subject. Examples are given of individual published studies using different methodologies and studies comparing three or more methodologies. This review suggests that accurate, whole-site CH4 emission quantifications are best done using methods measuring downwind of the landfill, such as tracer gas dispersion and differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL). Combining aerial CH4 concentration measurements from aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles with wind field measurements offers a great future potential for improved and cost-efficient integrated landfill CH4 emission quantification. However, these methods are difficult to apply for longer time periods, so in order to measure temporal CH4 emission changes, e.g. due to the effect of changes in atmospheric conditions (pressure, wind and precipitation), a measurement method that is able to measure continuously is required. Such a method could be eddy covariance or static mass balance, although these procedures are challenged by topography and inhomogeneous spatial emission patterns, and as such they can underestimate emissions significantly. Surface flux chambers have been used widely, but they are likely to underestimate emission rates, due to the heterogeneous nature of most landfill covers resulting in sporadic and localised CH4 emission hotspots being the dominant emission routes. Furthermore, emissions from wells, vents, etc. are not captured by surface flux chambers. The significance of any underestimation depends highly on the configuration of individual landfills, their size and emission patterns. © 2019","DIAL; Eddy covariance; Landfill gas; Mass balance; Qualitative methane reconnaissance techniques; Radial plume mapping; Surface flux chambers; Tracer gas dispersion","Antennas; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lithium compounds; Methane; Surface measurement; DIAL; Eddy covariance; Landfill gas; Mass balance; Qualitative methane reconnaissance techniques; Radial plume mappings; Surface flux; Tracer gas; Land fill; methane; methane; concentration (composition); emission inventory; gas flow; landfill; mass balance; methane; qualitative analysis; tracer; wind field; absorption; air pollution; air pressure; aircraft; analytic method; atmosphere; concentration (parameter); cost effectiveness analysis; dispersion; gas; intermethod comparison; landfill; measurement accuracy; methodology; precipitation; priority journal; Review; soil; topography; wind; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; Europe; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Europe; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal Facilities",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059694368

However, open problems exist in quantifying electromagnetic field fluctuations in these media, complicating typical approaches for modeling photonic characteristics. Here, we address this issue by linking the identifying traits of hyperbolic response to a coupling between longitudinal and transverse fields that cannot occur in isotropic media. This description allows us to formulate a gauge theoretic description of the influence of hyperbolic response on electromagnetic fluctuations without explicitly imposing a characteristic size (model of nonlocality) - leading to formally bounded expressions so long as material absorption is included. We then apply this framework to two exemplary areas: the optical sum rule for modified spontaneous emission enhancement in a general uniaxial medium and thermal electromagnetic field fluctuations in hexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide. We find that while the sum rule is satisfied, it does not constrain the enhancement of light-matter interactions in either case. We also show that both hexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide possess broad spectral regions where the magnitude of electromagnetic field fluctuations are over 120 times larger, and over 800 times larger along specific angular directions, than they are in vacuum. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Boron nitride; Electromagnetic fields; III-V semiconductors; Nitrides; Topological insulators; Van der Waals forces; Characteristic size; Electromagnetic fluctuations; Hexagonal boron nitride; Hyperbolic dispersion; Hyperbolic response; Light-matter interactions; Material absorption; Spontaneous emission enhancement; Bismuth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063300149

However, the GFDM has some disadvantages such as Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and implementation complexities. It's not possible to obtain a reliable communication with GFDM signal which has more severe effects on interferences and noises. To eliminate interference in communication system local DGT algorithms were used with proposed new type of prototype filtering. The proposed filtering will have separate filters for odd subcarriers and even subcarriers respectively. It introduces the orthogonality conditions which will be used to get rid of interferences in the communication systems.

We find that, although India is well on track to meet its NDC pledges, these targets were extremely modest given previous context. Furthermore, there is considerable uncertainty around India’s energy policy post 2030 and if current plans for energy futures materialise, the Paris Agreement’s 2 degrees goal will be almost certainly unachievable. India’s role in international climate politics has shifted from obstructionism to leadership particularly following the announcement of withdrawal by the United States from the Paris Agreement, but analysis reveals that India’s ‘hard’ actions on the domestic front are inconsistent with its ‘soft’ actions in the international climate policy arena. Going forward, India is likely to face increasing calls for stronger mitigation action and we suggest that this gap can be bridged by strengthening the links between India’s foreign policy ambitions, international climate commitments, and domestic energy realities. Key policy insights India’s NDC pledges on carbon intensity and share of non-fossil fuel capacity are relatively modest given domestic context and offer plenty of room to increase ambition of action. India’s ‘soft’ leadership in global climate policy can be matched by ‘hard’ commitments by bringing NDC pledges in line with domestic policy realities. There is significant uncertainty around future plans for coal power in India which have the potential to exceed the remaining global carbon budget for 2 degrees. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coal power; India; nationally determined contribution (NDC); renewable energy; UNFCCC","alternative energy; coal; energy policy; environmental policy; future prospect; global climate; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050677509

Based on carbon felt/organic–inorganic talc like hybrid (TLH), the electrodes were successfully prepared by a simple one-step sol–gel procedure at room temperature, from aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, magnesium and iron(III) hexahydrated chlorides, carbon felt, and ethanol. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. It was shown that the order of carbon felt addition to the prepared solution is a key point to form a thin and homogeneous TLH layer at the surface of the carbon fibers. Also, composites having different Fe/Mg molar ratios can be obtained. The composite containing 100 wt % Fe was successfully tested as an electrode for the electro-Fenton process, because 98% degradation yield was obtained after 4 h of electrolysis. These results show that Fenton's reaction can be achieved with immobilized iron and H 2 O 2 produced at the cathode, which can account for the better degradation yield as compared with 70.5% obtained during electrolysis with a nonmodified cathode under the same operating conditions. Consequently, the use of such a material as an electrode for the electro-Fenton process was proven to merit further studies and, notably, to be used for the processing of industrial pharmaceutical effluents. © 2019 Académie des sciences","Carbon felt electrode; Composite material; Electro-fenton process; Layered organic–inorganic hybrid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061804065

This paper considers distributed generation as a main part to design a microgrid and the resources management is defined in a period through proposed dynamic economic dispatch approach. The inputs are obtained by the model predictive control algorithm considering variations of both pattern of consumption and generation systems capacity, including conventional and renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the proposed approach considers a stimulus program to customers involving a demand restriction and the costs of regeneration of the pollutants produced by conventional generation systems. The dispatch strategy seeks to reduce to the minimum the fuel cost of conventional generators, the energy transactions, the regeneration of polluted emissions and, finally, includes the benefit in electricity demand reduction satisfying all restrictions through mathematical programming strategy.

Brazil is among the world's largest producers of these two commodities, with the western region of Paraná accounting for a significant fraction of this production. To industrialize this raw material requires a large amount of energy, and much of this demand is supplied by eucalyptus biomass in the form of woodchips originating from distant regions, which increases the cost of production. The Livestock-Forestry Integration (LFI) system, which is encouraged by the national government program of Low Carbon Agriculture (LCA), is a eucalyptus production system that is growing in Brazil. In the Western region of Paraná, there is widespread availability of pasture areas which could be used to produce eucalyptus in this type of system, and meet the biomass demand of agroindustries. The objective of this work was to explore the expansion of eucalyptus plantations under an LFI scenario for agroindustries in Western Paraná, Brazil. In addition to estimating the area with the potential for expansion of agriculture by means of Landsat-8 satellite images, digital elevation models integrated with the Geographic Information System geoprocessing and the software ArcGIS were used. It was found that conversion of 4.24% of the pasture areas into LFI would meet the current demand for woodchips of the agroindustries that slaughter poultry and swine in Western Paraná. Using 8.04% would satisfy the demand until 2025. It was verified that there are 3972.10 km2 available for expansion of agriculture in the region.

SSVs provide ICEs with the functionality of turning the engine off during traffic halts and restarting it without intervention by the driver. This strategy reduces fuel consumption, especially in dense urban traffic areas, and contributes to emissions reduction to meet green emissions targets. The most widely adopted SSV system has a mechanical interface to connect the electric starter motor to the ICE, which requires increased robustness compared with standard starting motors. This requirement allows the motor to withstand a higher number of engine start cycles compared with a standard starting motor. Nevertheless, it is a critical problem for wider adoption of SSVs. As SSV systems usually are based on the conventional starting system, its durability and noise remains a critical issue to be addressed by automakers. The typical pinion–ring gear interface uses intermittent gear meshing to form a transient coupling interface. The research reported here presents the development of an innovative mechanical interface for starting systems, called the permanent coupling (PC)-type interface, which reduces noise and increases durability compared with the existing design. The results obtained by a functional prototype of the PC-type mechanical interface confirm the feasibility of the proposed concept. The methodology is based on a product development process integrated with lumped-parameter modeling and virtual simulation aimed at reducing failures during prototype testing. The new mechanical interface was proven to be a good candidate for increasing the use of SSVs in the automotive market. © 2019, Society of Automotive Engineers of China (SAE-China).","Internal combustion engines; Lumped-parameter simulation; Mechanical interface; Starting systems; Stop–start vehicles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091845676

With increasing pressure of degradation and deforestation, these forests have been prioritized for conservation and carbon offset through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanisms. We provide the first regional assessment of forest structure and aboveground biomass using measurements from a combination of ground tree inventories and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar). More than 80,000 ha of lidar samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling to provide a regionally unbiased quantification of forest structure of Chocó across gradients of vegetation structure, disturbance and elevation. We developed a model to convert measurements of vertical structure of forests into aboveground biomass (AGB) for terra firme, wetlands, and mangrove forests. We used the Random Forest machine learning model and a formal uncertainty analysis to map forest height and AGB at 1-ha spatial resolution for the entire pacific coastal region using spaceborne data, extending from the coast to higher elevation of Andean forests. Results: Upland Chocó forests have a mean canopy height of 21.8 m and AGB of 233.0 Mg/ha, while wetland forests are characterized by a lower height and AGB (13.5 m and 117.5 Mg/a). Mangroves have a lower mean height than upland forests (16.5 m), but have a similar AGB as upland forests (229.9 Mg/ha) due to their high wood density. Within the terra firme forest class, intact forests have the highest AGB (244.3 ± 34.8 Mg/ha) followed by degraded and secondary forests with 212.57 ± 62.40 Mg/ha of biomass. Forest degradation varies in biomass loss from small-scale selective logging and firewood harvesting to large-scale tree removals for gold mining, settlements, and illegal logging. Our findings suggest that the forest degradation has already caused the loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon. Conclusions: Our assessment of carbon stocks and forest degradation can be used as a reference for reporting on the state of the Chocó forests to REDD+ projects and to encourage restoration efforts through conservation and climate mitigation policies. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biomass; Forest degradation; Forest height; Lidar; Random forest; REDD+; Remote sensing; Tropical forest; Wood density","aboveground biomass; algorithm; density; disturbance; elevation; environmental degradation; environmental policy; forest inventory; height; human activity; lidar; remote sensing; stand structure; tropical forest; vegetation structure; wood; Andes; Choco; Colombia; Pacific Coast [Colombia]; Pacific Coast [South America]; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063401822

Walls of guard cells are strong yet flexible because they open and close the pore by changing shape over the substomatal cavity. Pectins are necessary for wall flexibility and proper stomata functioning. This study investigates the differences in pectin composition in guard cells of two taxa that represent key lineages of plants with stomata: Arabidopsis, an angiosperm with diurnal stomatal activity, and Phaeoceros, a bryophyte that lacks active stomatal movement. Methods: Using immunolocalization techniques in transmission electron microscopy, this study describes and compares the localization of pectin molecule epitopes essential to stomata function in guard cell walls of Arabidopsis and Phaeoceros. Key Results: In Arabidopsis, unesterified homogalacturonans very strongly localize throughout guard cell walls and are interspersed with arabinan pectins, while methyl-esterified homogalacturonans are restricted to the exterior of the wall, the ledges and the junction with adjacent epidermal cells. In contrast, arabinans are absent in Phaeoceros, and both unesterified and methyl-esterified homogalacturonans localize throughout guard cell walls. Conclusions: Arabinans and unesterified homogalacturonans are required for wall flexibility, which is consistent with active regulation of pore opening in Arabidopsis stomata. In contrast, the lack of arabinans and high levels of methyl-esterified homogalacturonans in guard cell walls of Phaeoceros are congruent with the inability of hornwort stomata to open and close with environmental change. Comparisons across groups demonstrate that variations in guard cell wall composition reflect different physiological activity of stomata in land plants. © 2018 The Author(s).","Arabidopsis; arabinans; cell walls; guard cell; hornwort; immunolocalization; pectins; Phaeoceros; stomata","biochemical composition; bryophyte; carbon dioxide; cell component; herb; immune response; physiology; polymer; polysaccharide; sporophyte; stomata; stomatal conductance; Arabidopsis; bryophytes; Embryophyta; Magnoliophyta; Phaeoceros; Spermatophyta; pectin; polymer; Anthocerotophyta; Arabidopsis; cell wall; chemistry; physiology; plant stoma; transmission electron microscopy; ultrastructure; Anthocerotophyta; Arabidopsis; Cell Wall; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Pectins; Plant Stomata; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062908427

This study proposed simple turning by loader in common garage-type digester without commonly used mixer or percolation system (simplified SS-AD). In simplified-SS-AD, turning is conducted in open condition. Thus, oxidation of anaerobic sludge during turning would influence digestion performance. Therefore, in this study, the effect of turning wastes by mixing during digestion on a simplified SS-AD fed with rice straw and pig urine was investigated. Four different mixing frequency levels—no mixing (M0) and mixing once a day (M-1/1), once every 3 days (M-1/3) and once a week (M-1/7)—were conducted. Methane yields of M0, M-1/3 and M-1/7 were comparable with each other. Methane yield and lag period of M-1/1 were approximately 61% and 155% of M0 (351.2 mL/g VS and 4.7 days), respectively. Furthermore, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of acetate accumulated in the digestate of M-1/1 was comparable to the difference in the COD of methane production between M-1/1 and the other treatments. Mixing every day also resulted in a higher oxidation-reduction potential and carbon dioxide content. These findings suggest that methanogenesis was inhibited in M-1/1 by frequent mixing in the atmosphere. Net energy analysis of SS-AD plant operation showed that M0 can obtain the highest net energy gain, whereas net energy production of M-1/7 was reduced by rewarming after mixing. Therefore, no mixing is the most effective approach for the proposed simplified process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mixing frequency; Organic matter degradation; Oxidation-reduction potential; Simplified solid-state anaerobic digestion","Agricultural wastes; Carbon dioxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Mammals; Mass transfer; Methane; Mixing; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Sludge digestion; Solvents; Digestion performance; Effective approaches; Mixing frequency; Net energy analysis; Organic matter degradations; Oxidation reduction potential; Percolation systems; Solid-state anaerobic digestions; Anaerobic digestion; acetic acid; biogas; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; biofuel; methane; anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; energy balance; mixing; redox potential; solid waste; thermophilic bacterium; waste treatment; agricultural waste; anaerobic digestion; Article; atmospheric transport; bioenergy; calculation; chemical oxygen demand; energy balance; energy yield; environmental impact; gas mixing; methanogenesis; organic waste; oxidation reduction potential; pH; pig; priority journal; sewage treatment plant; solid state; agriculture; anaerobic growth; animal; bioreactor; sewage; Suidae; Agriculture; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Methane; Sewage; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061337802

The multiple linear regression model was applied to determine the relationship between local officials’ characteristics and total carbon emissions and carbon emissions from different sectors. The results indicated that local officials’ promotion source, tenure and age significantly influenced the total carbon emission.

In 2016, severe PM2.5 pollution (PM2.5 &gt; 250 μg/m3) lasted over 6 days and affected over 23 million people. A major challenge in dealing with this issue is the uncertainty regarding the influence of individual meteorological factors to the overall PM2.5 concentration in Beijing. Thus, applying an empirical regression method to long-term ground-based PM2.5 data and meteorological sounding measurements, we attempted to analyze the influence of individual meteorological factors on PM2.5 pollution during winters in Beijing. We found that horizontal dilution and vertical aggregation plays a major role in PM2.5 pollution during the winter of 2016. The impact of horizontal wind on PM2.5 concentration in Beijing was mainly from its dilution, the dilution of northerly wind contributed 27.8% in 2016, far below its contribution in 2015 (32.2%). The contribution from the growing vertical aggregation observed in 2016 was mainly the result of both the lower height of the planetary boundary layer and the greater depth of the temperature inversion. The dilution of the planetary boundary layer height contributed 9.8% to PM2.5 pollution in 2016, 5.4% lower than that in 2017. Compared with the temperature difference of the inversion layer, the temperature inversion depth better reflects the aggregated impact of temperature inversions to PM2.5, which was 10.9% in 2015, and the ratio rose to 14.3% in 2016. Relative humidity is also an important impacting factor, which contributed 41.0%, far higher than the ratio in 2017 (26.7%). Such results imply that we should focus on not only local emission control, but also horizontal atmospheric transport and meteorological conditions in order to provide a more accurate analysis of pollution mechanisms, conductive to air pollution governance in Beijing. © 2018","Air pollution in Asia; Horizontal wind; Planetary boundary layer height; Relative humidity; Temperature inversion","Air pollution; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Climatology; Dilution; Emission control; Regression analysis; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Horizontal winds; Impact of temperatures; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Planetary boundary layers; Temperature differences; Temperature inversions; Atmospheric movements; accuracy assessment; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; meteorology; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution incidence; pollution monitoring; quantitative analysis; relative humidity; winter; air pollution control; article; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; China; dilution; height; human; humidity; meteorology; winter; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057605973

Due to their high commercial value, several illegal practices of removal and commercialization have led to the verge of extinction. This study aimed to develop protocols for in vitro conservation under slow growth and acclimatization of species of the subfamily Epidendroideae (Orchidaceae), from the state of Sergipe, Brazil. Two experiments were conducted: the first one tested four concentrations of MS (MURASHIGE and SKOOG, 1962) (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), three orchid species (Catasetum macrocarpum, Oeceoclades maculata, and Polystachya estrellensis), and two temperatures (18 and 25ºC); the second one tested three combinations of carbon sources and osmotic regulators (20 g L -1 sucrose; 10 g L -1 sucrose + 5 g L -1 de mannitol; 10 g L -1 sucrose + 5 g L -1 sorbitol) and the same three species and two temperatures. For the in vitro conservation of C. macrocarpum, O. maculata, and P. estrellensis over 450 days, the use of 25% of MS salts or 20 g.L -1 sucrose at 25ºC is recommended. C. macrocarpum seedlings were acclimatized using sand + shredded pine bark + worm castings at a ratio of 2:2:1 (w:w:w).

Despite the evidence regarding the importance of soil for provision of local and global ecosystem services, such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, soil remains an under-investigated and undermined aspect of the environment. Here we evaluate to what extent soil indicators are taken into account in restoration. We focused on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly fragmented biome and a global biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a systematic literature review and we showed that the majority (59%) of the studies on restoration did not consider any soil indicator. Studies that demonstrated the importance of soil indicators most commonly reported soil pH (71%, n = 44), followed by potassium content (66%, n = 41) and phosphorus (64.5%, n = 40), while the least reported indicator was water retention (6.5%, n = 4). Only 40% of the retrieved studies included information about reference sites or project baseline information. We complement our literature review with a case study on restoration in two areas of the Atlantic Forest. We found a relation between soil indicators such as soil organic matter, nitrogen, sodium and sand content, and aboveground indicators, confirming a necessity to include soil screening in restoration. Moreover, we found that prior to restoration none of these soil indicators were analyzed. This study highlights the gap that exists in soil data in restoration in studies on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We urge scientists and practitioners to include basic soil analysis to maximize the successful outcomes of restoration. © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration","Atlantic Forest; forest landscape restoration; gap analysis; restoration; soil–restoration relationship; systematic review","biodiversity; ecosystem service; forest dynamics; gap dynamics; literature review; restoration ecology; soil quality; soil remediation; Atlantic Forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053546685

This framework is based on five important accountability mechanisms: Clear responsibilities and mandates, Transparency, Political oversight, Citizen control and Checks and sanctions. For illustration purposes, the proposed framework is applied to the case of a Dutch local adaptation governance arrangement. The application shows that the five proposed mechanisms and their operationalizations offer a valid assessment of the accountability of such arrangements. It also raises some challenges, such as the tensions between accountability and flexibility, legitimacy and effectiveness; the potentially important roles of trust and of the political skills of central actor(s) in the arrangement in raising accountability, and the potential need to distinguish between arrangements for policy planning and for service delivery. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

A deep energy transition to low-carbon economies is needed in order to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The article aims at analysing the integrated legal regulation of climate change and energy policies at the global and regional scales. The authors examine the climate and energy-related issues in different international treaties, soft-law instruments, including reports and other documents of international intergovernmental organizations, European Union official documents and legislation, voluntary non-state actors’ commitments, as well as international and national judicial practice. The European Union law on climate change and energy is the most comprehensive and integrated among all legal models of tackling the problem of energy-climate policy regulation and may form the basis for enhanced future action at the global level. Some insight was made into legal regulation of the topic in the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China as the biggest greenhouse gases emitters. Energy and climate policies at the global, regional and national levels must be integrated and interlinked in order to attain sustainable development and Paris goals.

Angus steers (1.5 head/ha) in New South Wales, Australia, grazing for 238 days/year, and Enterprise 2. British x Charolais steers (1.0 head/ha) in California, USA, grazing for 148 days/year. Simulation effects of 3 supplements with potential to reduce enteric methane (CH4) emissions were evaluated: (1) nitrate (NO3¯), (2) lipid, and (3) NO3¯ + lipid. All supplementation effects were evaluated against a baseline simulation (i.e., no supplement). Results on beef production, rumen products, GHG emissions, and enterprise gross margins are reported. Simulations indicated that supplementing steers with lipid alone relative to the baseline in Enterprises 1 and 2: increased final live weight (LW) by 68 and 25 kg, decreased emissions intensity (EI) by 69 and 49 g CH4/kg live weight gain (LWG), and decreased total GHG by 0.08 and 0.04 t CO2-e/ha/year, respectively.

In this study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) wastewater was obtained from continuous liquefaction experiments in plug flow reactor and two strategies were evaluated to recycle both phosphorous and nitrogen for the growth of Scenedesmus sp. AMDD. The first strategy involved using HTL wastewater as a source of nitrogen while minimizing the algae growth inhibitors present in wastewater using hydrothermal gasification and activated carbon adsorption. The second strategy focused on recovering nitrogen as ammonia and phosphorous as struvite from HTL wastewater and recycling only the nutrients thereby decoupling the HTL wastewater and most inhibitors from nutrient recycle process. Water samples obtained from these two strategies were analyzed using various techniques (elemental analysis, gas chromatography, and hydrogen NMR) and potential growth inhibitors were identified as nitrogen containing heteroaromatics. The second approach relied solely on activated carbon treatment to remove these heteroaromatics. Although comparable growth rates were obtained using the first approach after strong dilution, algae growth and biomass yields obtained using the latter approach was much more robust as indicated by less variability, similar rates and biomass yields as compared to the synthetic medium. Apparent nitrogen and phosphorous removal rates for this case were > 99% and 68 ± 5.7%, respectively. This approach of decoupling nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients from HTL water offers a flexible, reliable, and scalable process for recycling nutrients without the inhibitors in HTL water and an important step towards the commercial production of algae for biofuels. © 2019","Algae; Biofuels; Growth inhibitors; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Nutrient recycle; Struvite",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060081752

This paradigm focuses on the environmental impacts of travel and the imperative for climate change mitigation, however the specific outcomes of transport in terms of trip type and purpose are not robustly conceptualised, with limited intellectual foundations to understand the ethical considerations of transport service provision. This paper critically considers transport strategies recently developed for London's Night Time Economy, including policy discourse and technical approaches that shape of transport services provision at night. The case study evaluates the spatiotemporal dimensions of equity. Analysis of policy discourses revealed how night time transport are conceived as an instrumental means to grow the ‘Night Time Economy’ drawing from the conventional wisdom linking accessibility improvements with economic expansion. This strategy viewed ‘London at night’ as a vehicle for economic development, focusing on the consumption-side of the economy and improving individuals’ access to entertainment and recreation. Policy discourse recognised the existence of night-time workers in sectors outside arts and recreation, however, attempts to broaden the ‘Night Time Economy’ agenda to accommodate the travel needs of night-time workers were lost through the narrow selection of accessibility metrics used in transport planning practice. This case demonstrates a missed opportunity to improve transport equity across spatial and temporal dimensions, as night-time workers face severe accessibility barriers, often relying on low-frequency bus services that have inadequate service coverage across Greater London. Scrutinising socio-spatial and temporal dimensions of transport provision can advance more systematic critical perspectives on transport equity by integrating a variety of distributional issues and linking more closely to the practical barriers faced by night-time workers to access transport. © 2019","Equity; Night time economy; Transport","Climate change; Economics; Environmental impact; Accessibility barriers; Climate change mitigation; Critical perspectives; Equity; Ethical considerations; Night time; Spatio-temporal dimensions; Transport; Urban transportation; accessibility; climate change; environmental impact; equity; sustainability; transportation policy; urban transport; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061315784

Notably, smallholder dairying is increasing in terms of number of farmers, animals and area of coverage. Milk yields per cow are, however, not according to breed potential, while both pure and crossbred dairy cows are kept. The increased dairy sector also translates into increased volume of feeds consumed, and subsequently more manure and energy outputs. Dairying is associated with GHG emissions that also relate to how efficient a system is. The FAO (2016) report on GHG emissions from the dairy sector states that the entire livestock food chain contributes 18% of total global anthropogenic GHG emissions (±26 %) and that 4% of this is estimated to come from the global dairy sector. This study aims at assessing GHG emissions in the Malawi smallholder dairy sector associated with feeding practices and analyzing their effectiveness in terms of impacting productivity of different breeds and genotypes. The goal is to come up with recommendations for feeding practices that are cost effective, and that will increase dairy productivity while substantially reducing the dairy carbon foot print and increasing household income and food security. The study was undertaken under the small holder dairy production programme and enhanced breeding practices, a component promoted by the Capacity Building for Managing Climate Change (CABMACC) Programme under the project “Reducing dairy carbon foot-print through breeding and feeding based technologies for improved productivity” (REDCAP). REDCAP is a project within CABMACC that has been in operation from 2015 to 2018. The project was designed to evaluate feeding and breeding technologies for optimal dairy productivity and reduced carbon emissions with focus on smallholder farmers in drought prone areas. The data on the national herd in Malawi, the REDCAP baseline and the REDCAP intermediate results indicate that enteric gases are the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions followed by manure and energy use. The share by gases in total emissions was carbon dioxide 21%, methane 44% and nitrous oxide 35%. The lower GHG emissions per unit of milk protein from the REDCAP intermediate results probably reflect the better feeding practices exemplified by greater use of concentrates and forage trees. © 2019 Livestock Research for Rural Development.

Among others, emissions produced by electricity generation plants and industries were significantly lowered. Ultralow (&lt;15 ppm) sulfur fuels were introduced for road vehicles, nonroad, rail, and maritime transport. New heavy-duty diesel trucks have been equipped with particle traps and NOx controls. Residual oil (No. 6) for space heating and for any other purpose was replaced with cleaner No. 2 and No. 4 oils. Chemical speciation of PM2.5 has been measured since 2005 at eight sites across the New York State. A prior study has identified and apportioned the major sources of PM2.5 across the State using receptor modelling (positive matrix factorization). This present study aims to investigate the long-term trends of those source-apportioned PM2.5 mass contributions from 2005 to 2016 at the eight sites: two rural sites (Pinnacle and Whiteface), three medium sized cities (Buffalo, Albany, Rochester), and three sites in the New York City metropolitan area (Bronx, Manhattan and Queens). Negative trends from 2005 to 2016 were detected across the state for secondary sulfate (from −0.19 μg/m3/y in Rochester to −0.36 μg/m3/y at BRO and QUE) and secondary nitrate (from −0.02 μg/m3/y at the rural sites to approximately −0.2 μg/m3/y at BRO and MAN). Spark-ignition vehicles were the only source type experiencing upward annual trends at all urban sites with slopes ranging from 0.02 μg/m3/y (ROC, not statistically significant) to ∼0.2 μg/m3/y (Albany, Bronx, Manhattan). Other sources exhibited different trends among the sites. The relationships of source contributions with emissions inventories were explored with regression analysis.

A better understanding of the connections between land take, changes in complex LULC patterns and ecosystem services is still needed. Especially needed are forward-looking analyses that can support spatial planning in the face of targets like “no net land take,” as set in Europe. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the possible consequences of alternative pathways of demographic and urban development, in terms of land take and ecosystem services supply. Using the Lisbon Metropolitan Area in Portugal as case study, four contrasting scenarios for 2030 were developed that cover major determinants of land take (with a focus on residential development) and priority ecosystem services for the region, as well as deal with climate regulation, recreation and food production. Our findings suggest that the effects of urban development on land take are positive for a “compact city” and negative for an “urban sprawl” pattern, even for opposite demographic developments (growth versus decline). However, each pattern can have both positive and negative effects on the supply of ecosystem services. Hence, tensions can exist between the “compact city” model of urban development and the provision of ecosystem services to urban dwellers, especially across planning levels. We argue that the way land take is defined can influence the outcome of this kind of assessment, depending on which LULC dataset is used to support it. Exploring the approach developed in this research with different stakeholders while adopting more extreme scenario assumptions can provide additional insights on the topic. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Compact city; Ecosystem services; Land take; Scenarios; Urban sprawl; Urbanization","demography; ecosystem service; land use change; metropolitan area; urban development; urban sprawl; urbanization; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058155660

This study is concerned with decomposition of organic matter in the soil profile of tropical peatland under oil palm plantation. For 2 years, CO2 fluxes were measured from the soil surface (CO2-efflux) and from the surface where peat was removed to the depths of 10, 30 and 50 cm (CO2 efflux potential/CO2-EP). CO2-EP is a potential estimation of organic matter decomposition from subsoil. Groundwater level, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured as soil environmental factors. The annual CO2 efflux was 139 mg m–2 h–1 while CO2-EP increased with depth which were 1032, 1209, 2304 mg m–2 h–1 from 10, 30, 50 cm depths, respectively. CO2 efflux did not significantly correlated with soil environmental factors. CO2-EP had a significant negative correlation with groundwater level and soil moisture at depths of 30 cm and 50 cm. There are significant correlations among CO2 released from 0, 10, 30, and 50 cm depths. These results indicated that the formation of CO2 in the deeper peat contributes greatly to the emission of CO2, and that keeping the groundwater level at a high level will greatly contribute to the suppression of CO2 emissions from peatland. The subsoil of cultivated peatland is considered to be vulnerable, and its exploitation should be avoided. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Closed chamber method; CO2 efflux; CO2-EP; Mature oil palm plantation; Peat profile","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Groundwater; Palm oil; Peat; Soil moisture; Tropics; Wetlands; Closed-chamber method; CO2 efflux; CO2-EP; Environmental factors; Mature oil; Oil palm plantations; Organic matter decomposition; Potential estimation; Carbon dioxide; agrometeorology; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; crop plant; decomposition; manure; peatland; plantation; soil moisture; soil organic matter; subsoil; tropical region; Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055743703

This includes the effect that periodic variations in the reboiler heat duty have on the performance of the capture plant and the effect of implementing a control strategy. The mapping of the operation of the steel mill reveals numerous variations on an hourly basis that are important for the design and operation of the capture plant, including decreases in the blast furnace gas (BFG) flow to 0% on approximately 10 occasions per year and variations of ±30 MW in the available heat more than 40 times per year. The simulations show that the capture unit responds very differently depending on the season, with a generally slower response during winter operation due to a lower level of circulation of the solvent. The capture unit shows also non-linearity in its response to changes in heat load - the deviation from the steady-state value is more pronounced when the heat is increased than when it is decreased. Thus, the simulation results indicate that implementing CO2 capture with chemical absorption in an integrated steel mill requires flexible operation of the capture plant. Dynamic simulations over a two-week period with historical (hourly) boundaries demonstrate that the capture process can operate in the presence of the steel mill variations. Implementation of a decentralized control strategy increases the amount of captured CO2 by 1.2%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; Flexibility; MEA; Partial capture; Process dynamics; Process modeling; Steel mill","Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Iron and steel plants; Design and operations; Dynamic process simulation; Flexibility; Integrated steel mills; Partial capture; Process dynamics; Process Modeling; Steady-state values; Carbon capture; absorption; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; decentralization; emission control; performance assessment; power plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060114791

However, not all bipolar subjects experience psychosis during the course of their illness, and this difference often guides assessment and pharmacological treatment. The aim of the present study is to elucidate, for the first time, the FDG uptake dysfunctions associated with psychosis in BD patients with and without a history of past psychotic symptoms, through a positron emission tomography (PET) approach. Methods: Fifty BD patients with lifetime psychotic symptoms, 40 BD patients without lifetime psychotic symptoms and 27 healthy controls (HC) were recruited and underwent an 18F-FDG-PET session. Results: Compared to HC, BD subjects shared common FDG uptake deficits in several brain areas, including insula, inferior temporal gyrus and middle occipital gyrus. Moreover, we found that BD patients with a history of past psychotic symptoms had a unique FDG uptake alteration in the right fusiform gyrus compared to both BD patients without lifetime psychotic symptoms and HC (all P < 0.01, cFWE corrected). Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that FDG uptake alterations in brain regions involved in emotion regulation are a key feature of BD, regardless the presence of past psychosis. Finally, we demonstrated that the FDG uptake reduction in fusiform gyrus is associated with the presence of past psychotic symptoms in BD, ultimately leading towards the idea that the fusiform gyrus might be considered a putative biomarker of psychosis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The engine test results indicated that using ethanol-gasoline blended fuels, NOx and HC emissions decrease drastically as a result of the leaning effect caused by the ethanol addition. Results showed that while increasing the coolant temperature of the engine with ethanol proportion in blended fuel, NOx and HC emissions increases as compared to gasoline. The results obtained on engine operating parameters at 2500 rpm, i.e. NOx and HC have presented graphically with respect to the engine coolant temperature at different engine loads.

Climate change is expected to influence many of these hazards. Thus, climate-related risks over South Asia make disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) key policy goals. Recently there is an increasing consensus that DRR including CCA should be embedded in development planning. Disaster risk reduction including CCA has progressively gained importance in global governance. Across South Asia, however, such integration is only in a preliminary stage. This review was to assess the existing status and scope of DRR including CCA in development projects across South Asia, so that an effective and achievable deliberation may be made to regional policymakers. A total of 371 projects relevant to CCA and DRR were reviewed. The project inventory was diverse in nature with respect to location, scale, sectoral focus, and strategic importance. Bangladesh, India, and Bhutan were observed to be proactive in implementing DRR- and CCA-related projects. Meta-analysis of the project inventory suggests an urgent need for an individual and collaborative convergence of processes for DRR and CCA through policies, plans, strategies, and programs. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; SAARC; South Asia","adaptive management; climate change; development project; disaster management; hydrometeorology; policy making; risk assessment; Bangladesh; Bhutan; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060769452

The qualitative screening of phyto-sources confirmed the presence of tannins in ~ 80% of the samples. Similarly, most of the phyto-samples were also possesses flavanoids (66%) and terpenoids (94%); however, none of the samples consist saponins or phlobatannins. The highest tannins concentration was reported in Terminalia chebula (245 g/kg DM), Zanthoxylum alatum (219 g/kg DM) and Punica granatum (207 g/kg DM). Phyto-sources such as Pittosporum eriocarpum, Prunusdomestica and Berberis lycium contain condensed and hydrolysable tannins in nearly equal proportions and comparatively produce lesser methane than non-tanniniferous phyto-sources sources or phyto-sources which possess either condensed or hydrolysable tannins. The study established that entodinomorphs were most vulnerable protozoa to tanniniferous phyto-sources. The attenuation of tannins impact through polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) addition revealed a substantial increase in total volatile fatty acids (up to 23%) and ammonia nitrogen (up to 50%). It can be inferred from the study that Prunus domestica, Berberis lycium and Terminalia chebula due to their methane mitigation potential can be incorporated in animal feed for reducing methane emission. The present study unequivocally demonstrated that tannins-containing phyto-sources could be of great interest in the development of novel anti-methanogenic feed additives. However, the optimization of level of inclusion for the selected phyto-sources in animals diet should be studied. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Methane mitigation; Phyto-sources; Plant secondary metabolites; Rumen; Tannins","Additives; Agriculture; Ammonia; Animals; Methane; Screening; Tannins; Volatile fatty acids; Ammonia nitrogen; Methane emissions; Methane mitigation; Methane reduction; Prunus domestica; Qualitative screening; Terminalia chebula; Total volatile fatty acids; Flavonoids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082968396

Two areas were selected for analysis - Piaski Pomorskie and Jasien, located in northern Poland, at the back of the Pomeranian phase of the Vistulian glaciation. The aim of the research was to determine the role of denudation processes in the landform transformation of the young-glacial areas, manifested in their cutting and creation of, among others, erosional-denudational valleys, and to compare their geomorphological features. The research included field work (recognition of the geological structure, levelling measurements) and laboratory work (grain size analysis, organic matter content, age determination of the deposits). The valleys from both areas vary in size, but have a similar structure of deposits on their bottoms and at the outlets. Within the bottoms of the valleys, the erosively dissected fossil surfaces of the fluvioglacial substrate are visible or there is an erosional pavement. Slope deposits were found in all the valleys, mainly in the form of massive sand or sand and silt series. Their youngest, topmost part lies on organic sediments dated to 81 (95.4%) 253 cal. AD and 1024 (95.4%) 1224 cal. AD. The most distinct difference in the structure of the valleys of both research fields is the presence of boulder levels only in the Jasien area. This may suggest that the genesis of boulder covers depends not only on climatic and plant conditions, which were similar in both areas, but also on the geological structure and morphometry of the valleys. The obtained results indicate that the valley development was dominated by linear erosion in the Bølling and Allerød, mass movements mainly in the cold stage of the late Vistulian and slopewash, which were especially strong in prehistoric and historic times. The differentiation in the size of valleys only to some extent affects their geological structure and processes that accompanied their evolution. © 2019 Authors.","Erosional-denudational valleys; Holocene; Landform transformation; Late glacial; Northern Poland; Young-glacial area","boulder; denudation; erosion; glaciation; Holocene; landform evolution; Last Glacial; valley; Pomerania; Clidemia hirta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067998188

This article assesses sustainable biomass export potential from Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, Ukraine, and the United States by applying a number of sustainability criteria. Only biomass types with the highest potential are selected, to take advantage of economies of scale, e.g. pulpwood, wood waste, and residues in the United States, and agricultural residues in Ukraine. This study found that, except for the United States, pellet markets in the sourcing regions are largely undeveloped. The export potential depends strongly on pellet mill capacity and assumed growth rates in the pellet industry. Results show that the United States, Ukraine, Indonesia, and Brazil offer the highest biomass export potential. In the Business As Usual 2030 scenario, up to 204 PJ could potentially be mobilized; in the High Export scenario this could increase to 1423 PJ, with 89% of the potential being available for costs ranging from 6.4 to 15 €/GJ. These potentials meet the European Commission requirements for a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions set in the Renewable Energy Directive. The total export potentials do not reflect the net possible import potentials to the European Union, as biomass could be imported to other countries where there is a demand for it, where less strict sustainability requirements are applied, and which are proximate to the sourcing regions, notably South Korea, Japan, and China. © 2018 The Authors.

The increase in energy consumption has led to higher electrical energy costs. Energy utilization from renewable sources is an effective method of power generation with lesser environmental impacts. Thus, the more usage of non-conventional energy such as solar helps in reducing the electrical energy cost in the building and also reduces carbon footprints in the atmosphere. Energy Management Controller (EMC) in buildings introduces a sophisticated method for monitoring and controlling buildings energy requirements. This paper proposes to minimize the cost of electrical energy by optimally scheduling the appliances in the residential building. The appliances are scheduled so as to work during the off-peak hours when the tariff is comparatively low. The controller schedules the appliances during the considerable hours of operation after checking the availability of the grid, solar and battery energy. The Energy Management Controller provides an excellent energy efficient and environmental friendly buildings. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy Management Controller (EMC); photo voltaic (PV) panel; smart grid; State Of Charge (SOC); tariff","Battery management systems; Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Controllers; Domestic appliances; Electromagnetic compatibility; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Housing; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Management controller; Photovoltaics; Smart grid; State of charge; tariff; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078993017

However, their rate performance is not well pleasing, which greatly impedes their broad practical applications. Herein, three-dimensional porous carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide fibers were prepared by a nonsolvent-induced rapid phase separation method followed by hydrazine vapor reduction. Benefitting from their three-dimensional porous structure, large specific surface area, and high conductivity, the fabricated SC exhibits a high volume capacitance of 54.9 F cm -3 and high energy and power densities (4.9 mW h cm -3 and 15.5 W cm -3 , respectively). Remarkably, the SC works well at a high scan rate of 50 V s -1 and shows a fast frequency response with a short time constant of 78 ms. Furthermore, the fiber-shaped SC also exhibits very stable electrochemical performances when it is subjected to mechanical bending and succeeding straightening process, indicating its great potential application in flexible electronic devices. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","flexible supercapacitors; graphene fiber; high rate; rapid phase separation; wet spinning","Carbon nanotubes; Fibers; Frequency response; Graphene; Nitrogen compounds; Porous materials; Spinning (fibers); Supercapacitor; Yarn; All-solid-state supercapacitors; Electrochemical performance; Flexible electronic devices; High rate; Large specific surface areas; Mechanical bending; Straightening process; Wet spinning; Phase separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062362386

The simplified version of Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) in SWAT was originally designed for temperate regions and naturally based on temperature to simulate growth cycles of vegetation. However, tropical or subtropical vegetation growth is mainly controlled by rainfall. Due to this limitation, current SWAT simulations in tropics and subtropics have been facing a series of problems on vegetation dormancy, water balance and sediment yield. Therefore, we proposed an approach to enhance the modelling of SWAT vegetation dynamics with remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), to finally increase the applicability of SWAT in tropical or subtropical areas. Spatially and temporally continuous LAI products (1 day, 500 m) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations were integrated into SWAT to replace the LAI simulated by built-in EPIC module. Two advanced filter algorithms were employed to derive a downscaled LAI (30 m) to keep a consistent spatial scale with the size of Hydrological Response Units (HRU) and open data (i.e. SRTM, 30 m), and the source code of the plant growth module were correspondingly modified to incorporate the downscaled LAI into SWAT. To examine the performance of our proposed approach, a case study was conducted in a representative middle-scale (6384 km 2 ) subtropical watershed of Meichuan basin, China, and detailed analysis was performed to investigate its ecohydrological effects, such as streamflow, sediment yield and LAI dynamics from 2001 to 2014. Model performances were compared among three scenarios: (1) original SWAT, (2) SWAT with a corrected plant dormancy function, and (3) modified SWAT after integration of MODIS LAI (our proposed method). Results showed that the modified SWAT took advantage of downscaled MODIS LAI and produced more reasonable seasonal curves of vegetation cover factor (C) of plants than the original model. Correspondingly, the modified SWAT substantially improved streamflow and sediment simulations. The findings demonstrated that SWAT model can be a useful tool for simulating ecohydrological process for subtropical ecosystems when integrated with our proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Integration; LAI; Modified SWAT; MODIS; Subtropics; Vegetation growth","Ecology; Environmental protection; Integration; Open Data; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sediments; Stream flow; Tropics; Environmental policy; Hydrological response unit; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Modified SWAT; MODIS; Soil and water assessment tool; Subtropics; Vegetation growth; Vegetation; biomass; dormancy; growth response; integrated approach; interception; leaf area index; MODIS; remote sensing; soil and water assessment tool; soil erosion; streamflow; subtropical region; vegetation cover; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060989490

To unravel the photoredox reaction mechanisms of these types of BPs and AQs in aqueous environments, we have utilized a combination of time-resolved spectroscopy techniques such as femtosecond transient absorption, nanosecond transient absorption, and nanosecond time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy to detect and characterize the electronic absorption and vibrational spectra of the intermediates and transient species from the femtosecond to microsecond time region after they are generated in the photoredox reactions. With the assistance of density functional theory calculations to simulate the electronic absorption and Raman spectra, the structural and kinetic information on the key reactive intermediates is described. Furthermore, the reaction pathways were calculated by finding the transition states connecting with the reactant and product complexes to better understand the photoredox reaction mechanism. In this Account, we summarize some of our time-resolved spectroscopic observations and characterization of water-assisted photoredox reactions of selected BPs and AQs. In the strong hydrogen-donor solvent isopropanol, the commonly studied photoreduction reaction for aromatic carbonyls via an intermolecular hydrogen atom tranfer process was observed for BPs and AQs. The photoredox reactions for the investigated BPs and AQs in aqueous environments occur on the triplet excited-state surface. Under moderately acidic aqueous conditions, the photoredox reactions for BPs and AQs are triggered by a proton transfer (PT) pathway. In neutral aqueous solutions, AQs may also undergo proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) leading to the photoredox reaction, while BPs generate the ketyl radical species. Both BPs and AQs prefer the photohydration reaction in high-proton-concentration aqueous solutions (pH 0). The PT and PCET processes were found to offer more possibilities for the aromatic carbonyl compounds to lead to new photochemical reactions like the unusual photoredox reactions associated with BPs and AQs described here. Clear characterization of the photophysical pathways and the photochemical reactions of representative aromatic carbonyl compounds in aqueous environments not only provides fundamental information to better understand the photochemistry of carbonyl-containing compounds but also will facilitate the development of applications of these systems, like photochemical synthesis, drugs, and photolabile protecting groups. In addition, the importance of water molecules in the photochemical reactions of interest here may also lead to further understanding of how water influences the photochemistry of related carbonyl-containing compounds in aqueous environments.

Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) data is now being used to allow vehicles to cooperate better with current and future environments, such as traffic conditions, signal timing, and terrain information. This study proposes an eco-drive algorithm for vehicle fuel consumption optimization on rolling terrains, which frequently causes additional fuel waste due to the inefficient transformation between kinetic and potential energy. The algorithm using the Relaxed Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (RPMP) is computationally efficient and applicable in real time. While similar algorithms have proven effective in simulations with many assumptions, it is necessary to test these algorithms in the field to better understand the algorithm performance and thus make enhancements to optimally control vehicles for eco-drive. Therefore, this study further tested and verified the newly developed algorithms on an innovative CAV platform and quantified the fuel saving benefits of eco-drive. The proposed eco-drive system is compared against conventional constant speed cruise control on a total of 7 road segments over 47 miles. Experimental data shows that more than 20 percent of fuel consumption can be saved. Detailed analysis through linear models also reveal the main geometrical contributors to the eco-drive fuel savings. This finding can provide a rough estimate of the fuel saving potential of given roadways and help state departments of transportation to identify roadways where eco-drive should be implemented. The algorithm and the experiment can also support original equipment manufacturers in developing and marketing this technology to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Connected automated vehicles; Eco-drive; Field experiment; Rolling terrain","Automation; Automobile manufacture; Fuel economy; Fuels; Potential energy; Solid wastes; Automated vehicles; Computationally efficient; Field experiment; Fuel consumption optimizations; Original equipment manufacturers; Pontryagin's minimum principles; State departments of transportations; Vehicle fuel efficiencies; Digital storage; algorithm; automation; experiment; fuel consumption; optimization; terrain; Chicken anemia virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060282670

Here we report a seed-mediated approach to the facile synthesis of Au@Cu core-shell nanocubes with hexadecylamine and Cl- serving as capping agents toward the {100} facets of Cu and glucose as a reducing agent. The large (12%) lattice mismatch between Cu and Au led to the localized epitaxial growth of Cu shells on the Au seeds and the formation of nanocubes with randomly distributed Au cores. Compared to the same synthesis in the absence of Au seeds, the reduction of Cu(II) ions was greatly accelerated in the presence of Au seeds because of the autocatalytic surface reduction. It was also found that the structure and morphology of the products were highly dependent on the concentration of Cu(II) precursor in the reaction solution. Nanoplates rather than nanocubes were obtained when the concentration of Cu(II) precursor was reduced down to a certain level. By variation of the reaction time and/or the amount of Au seeds, the size of the Au@Cu nanocubes could be tuned in a range of 20-30 nm. The as-synthesized core-shell nanocubes exhibited a strong localized surface plasmon resonance peak at 581 nm, and the resonance was dominated by absorption rather than scattering. It is expected that the Au@Cu nanocubes with uniform and controllable sizes will find use in a variety of applications such as plasmonics and catalysis. © Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.","copper nanocubes; core-shell nanocrystals; lattice mismatch; plasmonics; seed-mediated growth","Catalysis; Electrolytic reduction; Gold; Lattice mismatch; Morphology; Plasmonics; Shells (structures); Catalytic materials; Core-Shell Nanocrystals; Electrochemical reductions; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Nanocubes; Randomly distributed; Seed mediated growth; Structure and morphology; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078390320

A continuous O3 pollution event was captured during 4- 11 August, with the maximum hourly O3 mixing ratio reaching 154.1 ppbv. Model simulation indicated that local photochemical formation and regional transport contributed 14:0±2:3 and 18:7±4:0 ppbv h-1, respectively, to the increase in O3 during 09:00-15:00 LT (local time) in this event. For local O3 formation, the calculated OH reactivities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) were comparable between O3 episodes and non-episodes (p &gt; 0:05), so was the OH reactivity of nitrogen oxides (NOx ). However, the ratio of OH reactivity of VOCs and CO to that of NOx increased from 2:0±0:4 s-1 s1 during nonepisodes to 3:7±0:7 s-1 s1 during O3 episodes, which resulted in the change in the O3 formation mechanism from the VOC-limited regime before the O3 pollution event to the transitional regime during the event. Correspondingly, the simulated local O3 production rate during the event (maximum: 21.3 ppbv h-1) was markedly higher than that before the event (p &lt; 0:05) (maximum: 16.9 ppbv h-1). Given that gasoline and diesel exhaust made large contributions to the abundance of O3 precursors and the O3 production rate, constraint on vehicular emissions is the most effective strategy to control O3 pollution in Jinan. The NCP has been confirmed as a source region of tropospheric O3, where the shift in regimes controlling O3 formation like the case presented in this study can be expected across the entire region, due to the substantial reductions of NOx emissions in recent years. © 2019 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); nitrogen oxides; oxygen isotope; seasonal variation; source apportionment; urban pollution; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062718342

It also requires facing the prospect that the loss and damage resulting from climate disasters will not be avoided through adaptation alone, that there will be extensive uncompensated losses, and that millions of climate displaced people may be on the move. The Paris Agreement is the international community’s attempt to deal with these challenges. Yet, this article claims that the Agreement, which sets the parameters for the way forward, is a largely neoliberal document that undermines the corrective and distributive ideals of climate justice. Relying on the capabilities approach and a modified version of Amartya Sen’s The Idea of Justice, this article teases out the ‘clash of civilizations’ between neoliberalism and climate justice. It sets out the concerns about neoliberalism in the climate change space and proceeds to interrogate the claim that the Paris Agreement is a neoliberal document. Essentially, climate justice demands state-based responses, developed through democratic deliberation and participation, to ensure the survival, functioning and flourishing of humans and non-humans. Neoliberalism, meanwhile, posits that government is too large and complex and that regulatory activities unnecessarily disrupt the efficient operation of the market economy. Furthermore, libertarian ideas of justice undermine climate justice principles as the valorization of market mechanisms, private property rights and private sector actors remove the issues from political contention and democratic participation. Ultimately, I question whether any justice-based normative meta-consensus or discursive meta-consensus, such as the Talanoa Dialogue, might be found in the Paris Agreement to disrupt the international neoliberal agenda. © 2019 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.","Climate justice; Deliberative democracy; Neoliberalism; Paris Agreement; The capabilities approach; The Talanoa Dialogue; The temperature goal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065704114

Process-based farming system models are widely used to predict SOC dynamics in agricultural soils, but their application at regional scales is largely limited by computational requirements, data availability, and uncertainties in model predictions. Here we present an approach of combining a farming system model and a simplified surrogate model that emulates and mimics the behaviour of complex process-based models to predict SOC change (∆SOC) and its uncertainty in Australian dryland cropping regions under anticipated climate change. We first calibrated and validated the farming system model APSIM for simulating ∆SOC (0–30 cm soil) using data from 90 farming-system trials at 28 sites across the study regions. Next we conducted a comprehensive simulation across the region using the validated APSIM model to predict ∆SOC over the period 2009–2070. Then simple surrogate models were developed based on the APSIM outputs. The surrogate models were able to explain &gt;96% of the variation in APSIM-predicted ∆SOC. Last the surrogate models were applied across the regions at the resolution of 1 km. In our simulations, Australian dryland cropping soils under farmers’ common management practices and future climate conditions were a net carbon source (0.66 Mg C ha−1 with the 95% confidence interval ranging from −5.79 to 8.38 Mg C ha−1) during the 62-year period. Across the regions, simulated ∆SOC exhibited great spatial variability ranging from −108.8 to 9.89 Mg C ha−1 at the resolution of 1 km, showing significant (P &lt; 0.05) negative correlation with baseline SOC level, temperature and rainfall, and positive correlation with pasture frequency (the duration of pasture in the rotation divided by the whole duration of the rotation) and nitrogen application rate. The uncertainty in ∆SOC and the underlying drivers were also assessed. This study presented a novel approach to efficiently predict future SOC dynamics and their uncertainty at fine resolutions, facilitating the development of site-specific management strategies for soil carbon sequestration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural soil; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Cropping system; Uncertainty; Upscaling","Agriculture; Climate models; Forecasting; Fuel additives; Magnesium; Organic carbon; Rotation; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural soils; Carbon sequestration; Cropping systems; Uncertainty; Upscaling; Climate change; agricultural land; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; climate change; cropping practice; dryland farming; farming system; management practice; mapping method; soil carbon; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; upscaling; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053829821

The bacterial communities in two paddy fields, which were distinguished by the natural fertility level, were utilized in this study. Each field held two control plots and two nitrogen-fertilized ones. The microbial communities mainly differed in their relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi between the two fields. However, they were very similar in the α-diversity and enzymatic functions, as well as their resistances indexes in response to the nitrogen fertilizers. Redundancy analysis indicated that phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium contents significantly explained the variability of the communities in the two fields total potassium (TK) plus nitrogen level and TK alone significantly explained the variation of the microbial communities in the high yield field and the low yield, respectively. Network analysis data showed that the microbial community in the high-yield field possessed a higher connectivity, which might facilitate recruiting more microbes that were predicted to drive organic matter decomposition, sulfate/iron reduction, nitrogen retention, and methane oxidation at the mature stage. The use of nitrogen fertilizer in the low yield field would help to recruit microbial functions similar to those in the high-yield at the stage.

Porewater chloride was found to be strongly correlated with total organic carbon (TOC), carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios, and porewater geochemistry (sulfate, pH, ammonium, and dissolved methane levels). Furthermore, a higher plant biomass, larger iron oxides pool, and lower sulfide levels were observed in the oligohaline wetlands. The contribution of microbial sulfate reduction to AOCM increased from 16% to 67%. In contrast, the contribution of microbial iron reduction and methane production declined from 52% to 22% and 12% to 2%, respectively, along the increasing salinity gradient. No consistent changes were found in the total AOCM rates. The rates of methane production were primarily controlled by the C:N ratios and concentrations of porewater ammonium and amorphous iron oxides, while the microbial sulfate and iron reduction rates were mainly controlled by belowground biomass, water content, and concentrations of porewater chloride and sulfate. Our findings provide insight into the potential consequences of modest saltwater intrusion; these may not alter the rates of AOCM in the Min River Estuary, but could change the dominant AOCM pathway from microbial iron reduction to sulfate reduction and accelerate sulfidic effects in this historically freshwater wetland ecosystem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic organic carbon mineralization; Methane production; Microbial iron reduction; Microbial sulfate reduction; Salinity gradient; Tidal wetland","Chlorine compounds; Estuaries; Iron oxides; Methane; Mineralogy; Salt water intrusion; Sulfur compounds; Tropics; Water; Wetlands; Carbon mineralization; Iron reduction; Methane production; Salinity gradients; Sulfate reduction; Tidal wetlands; Organic carbon; anoxic conditions; estuarine environment; geochemistry; intertidal environment; methane; microbial activity; mineralization; organic carbon; reduction; salinity; subtropical region; wetland; China; Fujian; Minjiang Estuary; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050752991

This paper focusses on public buildings as part of a public asset. Design/methodology/approach: As an archipelagic country, Indonesia is very vulnerable to sea-level rise as a result of climate change. The outcomes of a qualitative analysis of interviews with relevant stakeholders were used for the development of the CCA framework in an Indonesian context. Findings: The study identified that the integration of CCA in PAM in Indonesia requires the incorporation of nine key elements. These are as follows: recognition of climate change; risk management and insurance schemes for assets; integrated asset management and planning; asset use and knowledge; reliable, accessible and understandable data set on climate change; leadership, government commitment and incentives; involvement of research and private entities; community engagement; and coordination of relevant agencies. Research limitations/implications: This paper informed only the key elements required on the development of framework which integrate CCA in PAM. Practical implications: The integration of CCA to a PAM framework will support the development of policies and procedures for better-informed decisions. Social implications: The framework increases opportunities for stakeholders and community engagement in policy development and decision making in relation to CCA for public assets. Originality/value: This paper synthesises CCA and PAM using knowledge from the three levels of governments in Australia and Indonesia. CCA and PAM groups work separately in Indonesia and integration will reduce climate change risks and improve decision making in PAM. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asset management; Australia; Climate change adaptation; Indonesia; Public asset; Risk management","Asset management; Buildings; Decision making; Integration; Risk management; Sea level; Australia; Climate change adaptation; Climate change risks; Community engagement; Design/methodology/approach; Indonesia; Public assets; Qualitative analysis; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058080816

Carbon monoxide (CO) is one key product during electroreduction of CO 2 ; however, this reduction process suffers from tardy kinetics due to low local concentration of CO 2 on a catalyst's surface and low density of active sites. Herein, presented is a combination of experimental and theoretical validation of a Ni porphyrin-based covalent triazine framework (NiPor-CTF) with atomically dispersed NiN 4 centers as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The high density and atomically distributed NiN 4 centers are confirmed by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. As a result, NiPor-CTF exhibits high selectivity toward CO 2 RR with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90% over the range from −0.6 to −0.9 V for CO conversion and achieves a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 97% at −0.9 V with a high current density of 52.9 mA cm −2 , as well as good long-term stability. Further calculation by the density functional theory method reveals that the kinetic energy barriers decreasing for *CO 2 transition to *COOH on NiN 4 active sites boosts the performance. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Two-view mammography and ultrasound form the mainstay of breast imaging and are essential components of the triple assessment. Digital mammography is rapidly replacing analogue mammography, and recent advances such as digital tomosynthesis add a third dimension to conventional 2D mammographic images. The versatility of ultrasound allows assessment of the breast and axilla as well as accurately targeted interventions, from the simple diagnostic core biopsy to preoperative tumour localization. It also guides large volume biopsies and excision of certain benign lesions, which in some cases can obviate surgical excision. Newer ultrasound techniques being applied to the breast and axilla include elastography and the use of intradermal microbubbles to guide the radiologist to the sentinel axillary node. Breast MRI is a powerful modality in assessing breast cancer. It can provide accurate information on size and multifocality of lesions, particularly those that are mammographically challenging such as lobular cancers, and it is also used to assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and guide surgical management. CT scans, and in selected cases Positron Emission Tomography, play important roles in the assessment of metastatic disease. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Breast biopsy; breast imaging; breast MRI; mammography; tomosynthesis; ultrasound","axilla; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer screening; computer assisted radiography; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; digital breast tomosynthesis; echomammography; human; mammography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; Review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061837294

The continuous photoelectron injection from TiO 2 stabilizes the free carrier density and leads to strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of WO 3− x , resulting in strong light absorption in the visible and near-infrared region. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation of TiO 2 -MCs/WO 3− x -NWs is attributed to plasmonic hot electrons excited on WO 3− x -NWs under visible light irradiation. However, utilization of injected photoelectrons on WO 3− x -NWs has low efficiency for hydrogen generation and a co-catalyst (Pt) is necessary. TiO 2 -MCs/WO 3− x -NWs are used as co-catalyst free plasmonic photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, which exhibit much higher activity (16.3 µmol g −1 h −1 ) and selectivity (83%) than TiO 2 -MCs (3.5 µmol g −1 h −1 , 42%) and WO 3− x -NWs (8.0 µmol g −1 h −1 , 64%) for methane generation under UV–vis light irradiation.

Many governments aim to encourage the uptake of EVs in cities, because urban areas are well suited to EV driving ranges and stand to benefit hugely from reduced local emissions. In the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC), where clean renewable electricity sourcing makes EV deployment an attractive proposition, over a quarter of residents live in Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs), most of which are not equipped with EV charging infrastructure. In a related study, Lopez-Behar et al. (accepted) explored the challenges and decision-making processes involved in the installation of EV charging infrastructure in MURBs in BC, from the perspective of different stakeholders. Here, we build on those findings to map out and analyze feedback loops within this system using a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD). We then present potential demand-focused policy interventions to address the issues raised by our modelling results, grouped into three categories: financial/fiscal, regulatory and information/awareness measures. Financial/fiscal policy measures include creating incentives for EV owners and extending them to the building owners, and programs to incentivize and provide financial aid for building owners to develop building retrofit plans. Regulatory policy measures include addressing the rights and obligations of the stakeholders and making mandatory the installation of charging stations in new MURBs. Information/awareness policy measures include expanding the existing guidelines and informing the development of a long-term EV charging infrastructure plan. Our policy recommendations are designed to inform the interventions of municipal and provincial governments in BC, but could also be relevant to many urban EV markets worldwide. © 2018","Alternative fuel vehicles; Causal Loop Diagrams; EV policy; Stakeholder analysis","Decision making; Electric vehicles; Finance; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Alternative fuel vehicles; Causal loop diagrams; Charging infrastructures; Decision making process; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Ev charging infrastructures; Policy recommendations; Stakeholder analysis; Charging (batteries); alternative energy; decision making; electric vehicle; guideline; infrastructural development; policy approach; regulatory framework; residential location; stakeholder; transportation infrastructure; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057437142

From 7300 to 6300 cal yr BP, the forest was composed primarily of Populus, and fire was common, indicating warm, dry conditions. From 6300 to 3000 cal yr BP, Populus declined as Pinus and Picea increased in abundance and fire became less frequent, suggesting a shift to cooler, wetter conditions. From 3000 cal yr BP to present, modern-day forests composed of Pinus and Abies developed, and from 1650 cal yr BP to present, fires increased. We utilized the modern climate-analogue approach to explain the potential synoptic climatological processes associated with regional fire. The results indicate that years with high fire occurrence experience positive 500 mb height anomalies centered over the Great Basin, with anomalous southerly component of flow delivering dry air into the region and with associated sinking motions to further suppress precipitation. It is possible that such conditions became more common over the last 1650 cal yr BP, supporting an increase in fire despite the shift to more mesic conditions. © 2018 University of Washington.

Two scenarios are considered for the analysis: (i) business as usual (BAU, 2015 energy system configuration), and (ii) national energy strategy (SEN, configuration prospected in 2030). The results show how the intervention produces positive net effects on the primary energy balance of the energy sector only when sustained by adequate shares of renewables, as in the SEN (−1.5 TWh∙y−1); otherwise, increased operation of fossil-fuel plants offsets gas savings (BAU, +2 TWh∙y−1). Nonetheless, feedbacks on other productive sectors entail additional energy consumption and emissions, thus counterpoising positive effects obtained within the energy sector even in the SEN scenario.

Much degraded land may be targeted for large-scale forest restoration, yet challenges include costs, a shortage of regeneration material and the need for restored forests to serve as a resource for communities. To ensure ecosystem function for the future, forest restoration programs must: (1) learn from the past; (2) integrate ecological knowledge; (3) advance regeneration techniques and systems; (4) overcome biotic and abiotic disturbances and (5) adapt for future forest landscapes. Historical forest conditions, while site-specific, may help to identify the processes that leave long-term legacies in current forests and to understand tree migration biology/population dynamics and their relationship with climate change. Ecological theory around plant–plant interactions has shown the importance of negative (competition) and positive (facilitation) interactions for restoration, which will become more relevant with increasing drought due to climate change. Selective animal browsing influences plant–plant interactions and challenges restoration efforts to establish species-rich forests; an integrated approach is needed to simultaneously manage ungulate populations, landscape carrying capacity and browse-tolerant regeneration.

Cockrell Jr. Hall, Austin, TX  78712-1076, United States","Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) have gained significant public interest as a possible less expensive, safer and more efficient version of today's transportation networking companies (TNCs) and taxis. One way to expand on the possible benefits of an SAV fleet is through electric vehicles (EVs), which tend to be more energy efficient, more reliable, quicker, and may reduce system-wide emissions when coupled with renewable power. EVs are quickly becoming more financially viable as the price of these vehicles drops and charging infrastructure is appearing in more and more locations across the world. EVs are disadvantaged by their relatively short range and long recharge times, so it is important to understand how these factors will affect an electrified SAV (SAEV) fleet in terms of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), vehicle productivity, and response times. Perhaps the most important factor to consider before implementation is cost, since it is quite unlikely that a fleet operator will elect to use an EV fleet when a gasoline fleet is more profitable. This study makes in-depth estimates of the cost of this SAEV fleet based on vehicle purchasing costs, vehicle maintenance, batteries, electricity, charger construction (including land acquisition and paving), charger maintenance, insurance, registration and general administrative costs. These costs are estimated at low-, high- and mid-cost scenarios, where mid-cost is the most expected. This study performed a simulation of SAEVs across the Austin, Texas 6-county region under 6 different fleet scenarios to assess what factors make the fleet the most profitable and provide the best customer experience. The simulation process features thoughtful charging strategies, dynamic ridesharing, mode choice, and a multi-step search algorithm. Results showed that for all metrics studied, the gasoline hybrid-electric (HEV) fleet performed better than EV fleets, while remaining more profitable, providing response times of 4.5 min compared to 5.5 min. The HEV fleet is the more profitable option until the cost of gasoline exceeds $10 per gallon or the cost of a long-range EV falls below $16,000 through subsidies. Of all the EVs studied, the long-range fast-charging scenario not only provides the best service in terms of all metrics studied, but is by far the most profitable. Even though EVs may not be financially advantageous in the near term, the environmental benefits could be substantial; EVs have the potential to provide zero-carbon transportation when coupled with a renewable power grid. Gasoline vehicles have no such potential. Environmentalism tends to have little effect on financial decisions, but a carbon tax could change that perspective. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Autonomous vehicles; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Fast charging (Batteries); Gasoline; Hybrid vehicles; Profitability; Vehicle performance; Charging infrastructures; Charging strategies; Customer experience; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental benefits; Financial decisions; Vehicle maintenance; Vehicle-miles traveled; Fleet operations; algorithm; autonomy; computer simulation; cost analysis; electric vehicle; environmentalism; maintenance; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061058859

Specifically, agriculture has increasingly become a key sector for adaptation and mitigation initiatives that address climate change and help ensure food security for a growing global population. Climate change and agricultural outcomes influence our ability to reach targets for at least seven of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. By 2015, 103 nations had committed themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, while 102 countries had prioritized agriculture in their adaptation agenda. Adaptation and mitigation actions within agriculture still receive insufficient support across scales, from local to international level. This paper reviews a series of climate change adaptation and mitigation options that can support increased production, production efficiency and greater food security for 9 billion people by 2050. Climate-smart agriculture can help foster synergies between productivity, adaptation, and mitigation, although trade-offs may be equally apparent. This study highlights the importance of identifying and exploiting those synergies in the context of Nationally Determined Contributions. Finally, the paper points out that keeping global warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 requires going beyond the agriculture sector and exploring possibilities with respect to reduced emissions from deforestation, food loss, and waste, as well as from rethinking human diets. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate-smart agriculture; Family farms; Food systems; Greenhouse gas emissions; Mitigation; Small farms","adaptive management; agriculture; climate change; emission; family farm; food security; greenhouse gas; mitigation; prioritization; sustainable development; trade-off",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062880631

We used T2Well software—a coupled wellbore–reservoir simulator—to build a “wellbore–reservoir” coupled model with a “three-spot” well pattern (one injection and two production wells). We simulated several fixed flow rate cases in which water or CO2 is injected. The objectives of our present work are (1) to investigate the fluid flow and thermal processes of water circulating at well bottoms, wellbores, and wellheads; (2) to identify the changing parameters at all physical fields; (3) to understand the influence of injection rates on heat extraction; and (4) to measure the maximum heat extraction capacity of the Guide area. Water extracts more heat than CO2 at the same flow rate. However, water consumes more pressure in reservoir, and its pressure decreases more quickly as the flow rate increases. In contrast, CO2 is in a sense a better working fluid. CO2 consumes less pressure when it flows and can circulate automatically due to the siphon phenomenon. In this way, a lower injection pressure is required in a higher CO2 flow rate case. The density of CO2 is sensitive to both temperature and pressure and vice versa. Inside a wellbore, such interactions are extremely complicated. When the fluid rate is slow, a system could operate for 30 years and remain stable, and there is only a small decrease in temperature. However, with higher flow rate scenarios—namely 50, 75, and 100 kg/s—the reservoir will exhibit greater heat loss. The reservoir’s production temperature and extraction efficiency will drop dramatically. Therefore, for the Guide area, if a “three-spot” well pattern is used for geothermal extraction either with water or CO2 as the working fluid, the most appropriate flow rate is 50 kg/s. © The Author(s) 2018.","Guide basin; hot dry rock; injection rate; optimal design; thermal process","Boreholes; Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Flow rate; Fluids; Geothermal fields; Geothermal wells; Injection (oil wells); Oil field equipment; Water injection; Guide basin; Hot dry rock; Injection rates; Optimal design; Thermal process; Extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062651469

However, most previous studies on estimating CO2 emissions have only considered the effects of socioeconomic driving factors while disregarding the contributions of urban spatial structures (with the exception of those of urban expansion) to carbon abatement. Therefore, this study presented a model that integrates system dynamics, cellular automata and support vector regression to evaluate the impacts of different socioeconomic developments and urban spatial structures on the CO2 emissions of Guangzhou city. In the integrated model, system dynamics was used to model the developments of socioeconomic variables including urban land-use demand. An artificial neural network cellular automata model based on patch simulation strategy was then built to simulate the urban spatial structures, which were further quantified by landscape metrics. Using both socioeconomic variables and landscape metrics, a support vector regression with polynomial kernel function was finally employed to predict CO2 emissions. Through comparisons drawn between the simulated results and actual data, the integrated model coupling socioeconomic factors and urban spatial structures was demonstrated to be an effective tool for accurately simulating CO2 emissions. Furthermore, scenario simulations derived from the integrated model showed that the scenario of executing moderate population and economic growth, more technological investment, and the compact development of urban spatial pattern constitutes the best development mode for Guangzhou to balance economic growth and CO2 emissions reduction. From these findings, it is suggested that the government should not only develop a series of socioeconomic policies on carbon mitigation but also construct an ideal urban structure of compact and multiple-nuclei development through urban planning and spatial optimization for building a low-carbon city. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular automata; CO2 emissions; Scenario simulation; Socioeconomic development; Urban spatial structure","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cellular automata; Cellular neural networks; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Investments; Land use; Polynomial regression; Population statistics; Robots; Support vector regression; System theory; Cellular automata modeling; CO2 emissions; Low-carbon development; Scenario simulations; Simulation strategies; Socio-economic development; Socio-economic factor; Urban spatial structures; Urban growth; abatement cost; carbon emission; cellular automaton; economic growth; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental impact; government; policy making; scenario analysis; simulation; socioeconomic conditions; spatial analysis; urban area; urban planning; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060524620

This process has accelerated greatly since 2014 and, combined with operational adjustments related to overcapacity, has reduced the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and particulate matter (PM). Yet the quantitative understanding of ULE benefits is poor. Using detailed emissions data from 38 units at 17 power plants, corresponding to 10 combinations of ULE technologies representative of the Chinese power sector, we show that emissions factors for NO x , SO 2 , and PM are up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower after ULE retrofitting. The effectiveness in cutting emissions shows a large spread across the various ULE technology combinations, providing an opportunity to choose the most efficient, economically viable technology (or a combination of technologies) in the future. The temporal variations in emissions at hourly resolution reveal the effects of power plant load on emissions, an increasingly important factor given that power plants are not operated at full capacity. These data will be useful in efforts to understand the evolving state of air quality in China and can also provide a basis for benchmarking state-of-the-art air pollution control equipment globally. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Benchmarking; Coal; Fossil fuel power plants; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Sulfur dioxide; Coal-fired power plant; Control technologies; Economically viable; Orders of magnitude; Particulate Matter; Technology deployment; Temporal variation; Ultralow emissions; Air pollution control equipment; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; coal; air quality; atmospheric pollution; benchmarking; coal-fired power plant; emission inventory; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollution control; power plant; sulfur dioxide; technology; temporal variation; air pollution control; Article; China; circadian rhythm; electric power plant; particulate matter; waste component removal; air pollutant; air pollution; electric power plant; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Coal; Particulate Matter; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062076831

Expanding urbanization not only changes the spatial distribution of areas of ecosystem service demand but it also changes the potential functions of ecosystem services. It is necessary to undertake a quantitative analysis of historical changes in land use/land cover in the context of the urban land sprawl to better understand existing relationships between ecological services and land use/land cover change. The methodology for this study was derived from an established knowledge base on the importance of land use/land cover types for the supply of each of nine identified ecosystem services extracted from a review of the literature. We selected the Pearl River Delta as the object of our study and used a land-use dataset entailing a resolution of 100 m to analyze the land use/land cover change trends and the values of ecosystem services in this region from 1990 to 2015. Furthermore, we compiled a summary of changes in the values of ecosystem services caused by changes in land use/land cover. We found that the change trend of land use/land cover in the Pearl River Delta, which is dominated by forests, reflected a highly dynamic context. Construction land increased from 2909.77 km2 to 7486.89 km2 over the study period. The total value of ecosystem services increased by 4.5 × 1021 seJ during the period 1990–2015. Individual ecosystem services that contributed the greatest value were hydrological regulation, climate regulation, and soil formation and retention.

Residue quality and management strategies are two important factors regulating decomposition process and SOC mineralization and greenhouse gas emission. In this study, a microcosm experiment in field condition was conducted on a silty loam (a Black soil) in Northeast China to investigate stover decomposition and soil CO2 emission characteristics as influenced by different crop cultivars and stover field incorporation methods. Stover from two popular maize cultivars Xianyu335 (XY) and Liangyu99 (LY) were applied in two modes (soil surface application vs soil incorporation) at a rate of 11 t ha−1, and CO2 efflux was monitored during the decomposition duration of 144 days. The structural transformation of carbon functional groups in maize stover were evaluated using solid state 13C-CPMAS NMR and elemental analysis techniques. Results showed that up to 71.7%∼86.9% (weight basis) of C and N in soil-incorporated stover was decomposed during the study period, which was significantly greater than the losses (32.8%∼55.3%) of C or N from the surface-applied stover for both maize cultivars; decomposition rates of main C functional groups were significantly higher in soil incorporation (71.1%∼88.8%) than in surface application (20.9%∼60.2%) systems. The concentrations of SOC, total N, available N, and microbial biomass C and N in soil were also higher with stover incorporation than surface application. Stover incorporation resulted in a notably lower CO2 emission rate and accumulative CO2 efflux (53.9–55.4 mol m−2) during the stover decomposition compared with surface application (57.4–67.0 mol m−2). Between the two maize cultivars, the LY stover showed a higher decomposition rate and greater capacity for SOC sequestration when incorporated into soil. The LY stover induced higher (16.8%) CO2 emission than XY when applied on soil surface, but no significant difference was found between the two cultivars when incorporated into soil. The results suggested that cultivar selection and stover management strategies have great potential in reducing soil CO2 emission while improving soil biochemical properties. Incorporating the LY stover into soil rather than surface mulching could enhance SOC sequestration and reduce CO2 emission. © 2019","13C-NMR; Black soil; Carbon sequestration; CO2 emission; Maize cultivar; Stover management","carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; crop residue; cultivar; decomposition; maize; microcosm; Mollisol; soil carbon; strategic approach; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; crop; cultivar; decomposition; elemental analysis; microbial biomass; microcosm; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; pH; plant residue; soil chemistry; solid state; surface property; agriculture; carbon sequestration; China; maize; soil; China; Zea mays; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060030975

How plant pH varies and is regulated at large scales remain unclear. Here we explore the biogeography of foliar pH and the potential drivers. Location: East–west transect of northern China with increasing aridity westward. Time period: 2016–2017. Major taxa: Spermatophytes. Methods: We analysed foliar pH of plants from 22 sites across northern China, and investigated its spatial pattern and relationships with climate, soil, and plant functional type (PFT). Results: Foliar pH was generally acidic (5.33 ±.04) in northern China, showing distinct geographical variability: foliar pH decreased significantly westward at an average rate of 0.25 units per 10° longitude. Climate, soil and PFT explained 11, 17 and 59% of the variance in foliar pH, respectively. Foliar pH decreased (about 0.16) with mean annual precipitation (per 100 mm), soil stress coefficient (per 10%) and aridity index (per 0.14), but increased with mean annual temperature (per 2 °C). Across PFTs, herbs exhibited higher foliar pH than woody plants (6.0 vs. 4.9); gymnosperms relative to angiosperms had lower foliar pH (3.7 vs. 5.6); and monocotyledons showed higher foliar pH compared with dicotyledons (6.0 vs. 5.5). Main conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the evident pattern of foliar pH over a large spatial scale. Foliar pH is higher in warm-arid northwestern relative to cold-humid northeastern China and in later- than earlier-evolved plants. Similar to leaf mineral elements, foliar-pH biogeography is shaped by the joint effects of climate, soil and PFT; PFT and moisture are the most influential factors. Our findings provide a new impetus for understanding functional biogeography, and lay the groundwork for research on the linkage of foliar pH to ecological functions and macroevolutionary implications. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aridity index; climate; foliar pH; functional trait; macroevolution; plant functional type; soil property; trait/functional biogeography; water availability","angiosperm; aridity; biogeography; nutrient cycling; pH; physiology; precipitation (climatology); China; Dicotyledoneae; Gymnospermae; Liliopsida; Magnoliophyta; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059148794

These homegardens are usually composed of farm houses, trees, bamboos, and small patches of land for flowers, fruits and vegetables. Over the Western Sichuan Plain’s area of approximately 18,800 km2, there were more than 200,000 homegardens, accommodating 72.5% of the region’s rural population. As a unique local, cultural, and ecological resource, homegardens continuously support peasant households with provisioning, regulation, and landscape ecosystem services. This study combined low height remote sensing used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography, field investigation, and instrument monitoring. We try to identify the composition and structural characteristics of homegardens, as well as climatic regulation effects of the different types of homegardens. Temperature data were collected both for summer (June to August 2016) and winter (December 2016 to February 2017). The result shows that: (1) the average area of homegardens was 0.67ha (sizes ranging from 0.16ha to 1.24ha), and with vegetation coverage 43.5%-76.9% (including 310 plant species). (2)In comparision with outside the homegardens, the average temperature inside the homegardens was significantly lower in summer (approximately 0.31 °C -0.90°C). Although, the lowest summer temperature was differentiatee in between 13:30-16:00. Especially, the thermal effects of the home gardens were ranged from 2.00°C-2.65°C at high temperatures (≥30°C).

In this context, carbon mineralization, which is a thermodynamically downhill route for the accelerated conversion of CO 2 to water-insoluble and stable calcium and magnesium carbonates, is a sustainable approach for permanently storing CO 2 . However, one of the challenges with carbon mineralization has been the need for higher concentrations of CO 2 to accelerate the formation of calcium and magnesium carbonates. In this study, we propose a direct integrated approach in which amine-bearing solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), and alkaline Ca-bearing solids, such as calcium oxide and calcium silicate, are reacted in a slurry reaction system in two modes. These two modes involve in situ changes in the aqueous chemistry to facilitate the capture of CO 2 using MEA and the release of CO 2 into the aqueous phase to produce higher conversions of calcium carbonate. In the first mode, continuous CO 2 flow at 1 atm is provided such that MEA in the aqueous phase captures CO 2 and supplies the captured carbon-bearing species for reaction with dissolved calcium. In the second mode, MEA pre-loaded with CO 2 was introduced into the system without a continuous supply of CO 2 . Complete conversion of calcium oxide to calcium carbonate was achieved using both modes. Further, the extent of carbon mineralization achieved with calcium silicate was 36% in mode 1 as opposed to 20% in mode 2 at 50 °C for a reaction time of 3 h. These data suggested that amine-bearing solvents undergo continuous looping between the CO 2 -loaded and release states, which facilitate the accelerated conversion of calcium-bearing oxides and silicates to calcium carbonate. The formation of calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide phases was noted when less than complete conversions of calcium oxide were achieved. Calcium carbonate was the only phase formed on the complete conversion of calcium oxide and the carbon mineralization of carbon dioxide. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkalinity; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Digital storage; Ethanolamines; Hydrated lime; Integrated control; Lime; Mineralogy; Silicates; Aqueous chemistry; Calcium and magnesium carbonates; Carbon bearing; Carbon mineralization; Integrated approach; Monoethanolamine; Reaction system; Sustainable energy; Calcium silicate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054657397

Moreover, the analysis of the combustion and emission characteristics of a diesel/natural gas dual fuel engine are performed in this paper with the introduction of the diesel/natural gas dual fuel injection model into the CFD code. The result reveals that the developed gas fuel injection model is capable to predicate the penetrations of the natural gas injection. For the dual fuel engine with simultaneous reduction of NOx and soot, the optimized diesel injection timing is at −15.2 °CA ATDC, the gas injection timing is around −6.0 °CA ATDC, and the circumferential offset angle between the diesel and natural gas nozzle hole is around 8.8°. The lowest ISFC condition is achieved when the injection interval between the diesel and natural gas is 1.38 °CA.

The historical diffusion pattern of solar power in China is consistent with other energy generation approaches, which emphasizes the function of energy supply. Given that the electricity system in China is experiencing a low-carbon transition, the new installed capacity should be located in regions with an urgent need for carbon reduction, as well as good life-cycle performance. Therefore, indicators of carbon dioxide emissions and the carbon intensity of electricity consumption are employed to analyze the provincial demand for renewable power. Additionally, the life-cycle performance of solar power is assessed, grounded in the concepts of energy return on energy and carbon investments. On this basis, a comprehensive ranking of the provinces of China is provided. By considering carbon intensity as an indicator to assess the lifecycle performance of solar power, the results show that the distributed photovoltaics are suitable for installation in Shandong (1.06) and Jiangsu (0.98), which basically match the current layout, while some adjustments to the future distribution of centralized photovoltaic systems in China should be made, where Qinghai (0.45) and Ningxia (0.58) are not suitable as possible locations for newly installed capacity.

However, the high cost, low reserves, and poor stability of noble-metal-based catalysts have hindered the large-scale development of renewable energy. Owing to their low cost, earth abundance, high activity, and excellent stability, carbon-based metal-free catalysts (CMFCs) are promising alternatives to precious-metal-based catalysts. Although many synthetic methods based on solution, surface/interface, solid state, and noncovalent chemistries have been developed for producing numerous CMFCs with diverse structures and functionalities, there is still a lack of effective approaches to precisely control the structures of active sites. Therefore, novel chemical approaches are needed for the development of highly active and durable CMFCs that are capable of replacing precious-metal catalysts for large-scale applications. Herein, a comprehensive and critical review on chemical approaches to CMFCs is given by summarizing important advancements, current challenges, and future perspectives in this emerging field. Through such a critical review, our understanding of CMFCs and the associated synthetic processes will be significantly increased. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We summarize the potential biomass yield evaluated as cellulosic ethanol bioenergy production, and combine the life cycle analysis with a mass balance approach to estimate the energetic, environmental, and economic performance of a CW biofuel system. The results showed that the annual aboveground biomass yield of a CW in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China, averaged 37,813 kg ha−1year−1as the by-product of treating waste N, which is about one order of magnitude larger than traditional biofuel production systems. The biomass yield in the Zhoushan CW system had life cycle environment benefits of 8.8 Mg (1 Mg = 106g) CO2equivalent ha−1year−1of greenhouse gas emission reduction. The CW in Zhoushan had a net energy gain of 249.9 GJ (1 GJ = 109J) ha−1year−1while the wastewater treatment plant (WTP) consumes 7442.5 GJ ha−1year−1. Moreover, the CW reduced greenhouse gas emissions to 2714 times less than that of the WTP. The CW also provided various ecosystem services, such as regional climate regulation and habitat conservation. We suggest that the potential use of a CW as biofuel production and carbon sequestration via nitrogen-negative input can be explored more widely in the future. View Full-Text. © 2019 by the authors.

How CO 2 propagates from the emission sites into surrounding environments (ocean and atmosphere), and its effects on seawater carbonate chemistry, have never been studied from a mechanistic perspective. Here, we combine experimental and modeling approaches to investigate the carbonate chemistry of a shallow-water hydrothermal field offshore Kueishantao Islet, NE Taiwan. A simple Si-based mixing model is used to trace hydrothermal fluid mixing with seawater along convection pathways. The estimated vent fluid component in the near-vent region is generally &lt;1%. We further employed a modified bubble-plume model to examine gas bubble-aqueous phase interaction. We explain the dissolved inorganic carbon characteristics of the vertical plume as a synergistic interaction between CO 2 gas dissolution and fluid entrainment. The bubble-plume model provides a conservative estimate of the flushing time (tens of minutes) for water in the near-vent region. The acidic, dissolved inorganic carbon-rich water in the lateral buoyant plume readily releases CO 2 , but mixing with seawater rapidly quenches its degassing potential, so that hydrothermal carbon is retained in the ocean. Ebullition, governed by initial bubble size distribution, is the key mechanism for vent CO 2 to exit the seawater carbonate system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bubble-plume model; Carbonate chemistry; CO 2 vents; Shallow-water hydrothermal field","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbonate; dissolved inorganic carbon; hydrothermal fluid; hydrothermal vent; island; seawater; shallow water; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061434998

Typically, quantum emitters operate in the weak-coupling regime where the bandwidth of the emission spectrum is simply proportional to their decay rates. However, we introduce a first-order correction to the emission spectrum, demonstrating that its bandwidth is also directly affected by the dispersion properties of the reactive interactions of the quantum emitter with its environment. This correction is particularly important in the intermediate region bridging the weak and strong coupling regimes. As an example of the applicability of this theory, we study the behaviour of a quantum emitter decaying through a coupled two-cavity system. Our results suggests that this setup could be utilized for the design of efficient, but narrowband single-photon sources. © 2019 European Association on Antennas and Propagation.","antenna theory; quantum emitters; quantum optics; reactive power","Antennas; Bandwidth; Decay (organic); Electric fields; Elementary particle sources; Emission spectroscopy; Photons; Quantum optics; Reactive power; Antenna theory; Classical electromagnetic theory; Dispersion properties; Emission spectrums; Quantum emitters; Single-photon source; Strong-coupling regime; Weak-coupling regime; Particle beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068433884

In this study, subsurface transport of P to groundwater and its environmental risk across different land uses was investigated in a karstic springs basin, Florida, USA. Eleven sites including 5 agricultural sites, 5 urban, and 1 pine plantation were selected. Boreholes were drilled to collect soils from surface, vadose zone, and aquifer at 0.6 m depth intervals. Water-extractable P (WSP), Mehlich 3-P, Al, and Fe, soil P storage capacity (SPSC), and P sorption isotherm parameters were obtained for soils from selected depths. We found that agricultural sites particularly horse farms, and urban sites with golf courses and septic tanks showed high risk of P leaching with TP concentrations in the groundwater above the numeric criteria for streams in the north central Florida (0.3 mg L−1). Besides land use which reflected P loadings in the surface soils, significant positive correlations of P sorption maximum (Smax) with M3-Fe, Al, and organic matter, and the precipitation of P by calcium bicarbonate, imply the mechanism regulating soil P attenuation in vadose and saturated zones, respectively. Negative SPSC values were significantly negatively correlated with WSP in all the zones, suggesting the applicability of SPSC in deep soils. Moreover, high TP concentration was observed in the groundwater at one site where the SPSC value changed from positive in the surface soils to negative in the subsoils, indicating that an additive SPSC value to water table would be more robust for evaluating the potential of P leaching before moving down to the limestone area. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Golf course; Groundwater; Horse farm; Limestone; Phosphorus sorption; Soil phosphorus storage capacity","Aquifers; Eutrophication; Farms; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Land use; Leaching; Lime; Limestone; Recreational facilities; River pollution; Soils; Sorption; Sports; Springs (water); Surface waters; Urban growth; Waterworks; Anthropogenic activity; Golf course; Groundwater contamination; Phosphorus sorption; Positive correlations; Soil phosphorus; Subsurface transport; Water eutrophication; Soil pollution; aquifer; environmental risk; eutrophication; golf course; groundwater pollution; human activity; karst; land use change; limestone; phosphorus; soil depth; spring (hydrology); subsoil; surface water; vadose zone; water table; Florida [United States]; United States; Equidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057407916

However, as the energy consumption and air pollutant emissions in Chinese cities have very significant regional characteristics, individual governance measures are necessary. This study used 2013 to 2016 energy consumption data from 31 Chinese cities to evaluate the dynamic efficiency of the urban environments. Labor, fixed assets, and energy consumption were taken as the inputs, gross domestic product (GDP) was taken as the output, and particulate matter (PM2.5) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were taken as the carry-over variable indicators. Using a meta-frontier dynamic DEA model, the 31 cities were classified into high-income and upper-middle-income cities, the overall 2013–2016 energy consumption and air pollutant efficiency scores were analyzed, and improvements and changes were recommended to increase the efficiencies. Large differences were found in the energy consumption and air pollution emissions efficiency scores and the needed improvements, with the hig-income cities performing better overall than the upper-middle-income cities. While there have been some significant improvements in SO2 emissions, PM2.5 improvements have been far slower. Therefore, in most cities, more control measures are needed to control PM2.5 emissions. However, in addition to improving PM2.5 in the upper-middle-income cities, SO2treatments are also needed. Implications: There are big differences in the expectation of improvement of the two pollutants in all cities. In many Western cities, the expectation of PM2.5 improvement in the past years has not been reduced, but has been expanding. This shows that the central government has unified the air pollution control policies and the existing air pollution control measures formulated and implemented by the local governments. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Air pollution; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Public policy; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant emission; Central government; Dynamic efficiency; Energy consumption datum; Gross domestic products; Pollution emissions; Regional characteristics; Urban environments; Air pollution control; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; energy conservation; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; procedures; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Conservation of Energy Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057578842

Despite increasing evidence for effects of biodiversity (species diversity, functional diversity and functional dominance), stand structural attributes, stand age and environmental conditions (climate and topography) on tree carbon storage, the relative importance of these drivers at large scale is poorly understood. It is also still unclear whether biodiversity effects on tree carbon storage work through niche complementarity (i.e. increased tree carbon storage due to interspecific resource partitioning) or through the mass-ratio effect (tree carbon storage regulated by dominant traits within communities). Here we analyze tree carbon storage and its drivers using data of 480 plots sampled across subtropical forests in China. We use multiple regression models to test the relative effects of biodiversity, stand structural attributes, stand age and environmental conditions on tree carbon storage, and use a partial least squares path model to test how these variables directly and/or indirectly affect tree carbon storage. Our results show that tree carbon storage is most strongly affected by stand age, followed by climate, biodiversity and stand structural attributes. Stand age and climate had both direct and indirect (through species diversity, functional dominance and stand structural attributes) effects. We find that tree carbon storage correlates with both species diversity and functional dominance after stand age and environmental drivers are accounted for. Our results suggest that niche complementarity and the mass-ratio effect, not necessarily mutually exclusive, both play a role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. Our results further indicate that biodiversity conservation might be an effective way for enhancing tree carbon storage in natural, species-rich forest ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity-ecosystem function; Environmental conditions; Mass-ratio effect; Niche complementarity; Stand age; Stand structure","Biodiversity; Conservation; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Least squares approximations; Regression analysis; Tropics; Ecosystem functions; Environmental conditions; Mass ratio; Niche complementarity; Stand age; Stand structures; Forestry; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; complementarity; dominance; ecosystem function; forest ecosystem; least squares method; niche partitioning; stand structure; subtropical region; tree; tropical forest; article; carbon storage; China; climate; conservation biology; driver; forest; human; multiple regression; partial least squares regression; species diversity; structure activity relation; biodiversity; biomass; carbon sequestration; metabolism; multivariate analysis; tree; China; carbon; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Forests; Multivariate Analysis; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056459429

The variation of national total and per capita fossil-energy carbon footprints is analyzed and compared, and global overall changes of nonuniform distribution of national fossil-energy carbon footprints are analyzed via application of the gravity model, which provides a methodology to present the trend of overall changes of a certain attribute in the non-uniform geographical distribution problem. The target years for calculation and analysis of fossil-energy carbon footprints are from 1997 to 2016. The results show that the majority of developed countries present decrease while most of developing countries present increase both in the total and per capita fossil-energy carbon footprint during the twenty years, and serious polarization is found in the rankings of the twenty-year average of both total and per capita fossil-energy carbon footprint, with the maximum value being respectively 486 and 583 times of the minimum value. And both the global total and per capita fossil-energy carbon footprint barycenter, which are introduced according to the gravity model, generally move toward southeast during 1997–2016 with different change range, proving an uneven growth of the fossil-energy carbon footprints worldwide. And the global distribution of fossil-energy carbon footprints has become more nonuniform in value.

Phytoplankton species differ in stoichiometric and fatty acids composition, and this may result in phytoplankton-mediated effect on zooplankton at elevated CO2 and temperature. Beyond the isolated analysis of CO2 or temperature effect, few studies have assessed zooplankton growth under the phytoplankton-mediated effects of elevated CO2 and temperature. In this study, three algal species (green alga, diatom, cyanobacteria) were fed on zooplankton Daphnia magna, under the conditions of CO2 concentrations of ambient (390 ppm) and elevated (1000 ppm) levels and temperatures at 20, 25 and 30 °C. Elevated CO2 increased the algal biomass, while it reduced the phosphorus (P) and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs) to carbon (C) ratios. Elevated temperature decreased the P/C ratios in all algal cultures and ω3 PUFAs/C ratios in the diatom and the cyanobacteria cultures. Phytoplankton-mediated effect of elevated CO2 reduced the growth of zooplankton fed on the green and the mixed three algae culture. The stimulation of zooplankton fed on the diatom and the cyanobacteria by elevated temperature can be offset by decreasing food P and ω3 PUFAs contents. The combined effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on the growth of daphnids were mainly mediated by ω3 PUFAs/C ratios in the phytoplankton. Rising temperature as a combined direct and indirectly phytoplankton-mediated effect on zooplankton may be able to ameliorate the negative effects of elevated CO2. The results indicated that the combined effects of increased CO2 and temperature increased the fatty acid content of the green alga but not the other algae. This study highlighted that climate change with simultaneously increasing temperature and CO2 may entangle the carbon transfer in freshwater planktonic communities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Algae; Climate change; Ecotoxicology; Food chain; Stoichiometry; Zooplankton","Algae; Beryllium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Phytoplankton; Plankton; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Stoichiometry; Temperature; Water; Eco-toxicology; Elevated temperature; Food chain; Increasing temperatures; Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; Phytoplankton species; Phytoplankton zooplanktons; Zooplankton; Climate change; carbon; carbon dioxide; omega 3 fatty acid; phosphorus; carbon dioxide; alga; carbon dioxide; climate change; community dynamics; ecotoxicology; food chain; freshwater ecosystem; phytoplankton; stoichiometry; zooplankton; Article; biomass; climate change; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cyanobacterium; Daphnia magna; diatom; freshwater environment; green alga; growth rate; Japan; lipid composition; nonhuman; phytoplankton; priority journal; stoichiometry; temperature; zooplankton; animal; food chain; growth, development and aging; heat; lake; physiology; phytoplankton; species difference; zooplankton; algae; Bacillariophyta; Chlorophyta; Cyanobacteria; Daphnia magna; Daphniidae; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Food Chain; Hot Temperature; Japan; Lakes; Phytoplankton; Species Specificity; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058776069

Most of the trace metals (V, Cr, Mn, As, Cd and Pb) decreased more than 40% due to the emission regulations during APEC, while the crustal elements decreased considerably (4-45%). Relative to the daytime, trace metals increased during the nighttime at both sites before the APEC summit, but no significant difference was observed during the APEC summit, suggesting suppressed emissions from anthropogenic activities. Five sources (dust, traffic exhaust, industrial sources, coal and oil combustion and biomass burning) were resolved using positive matrix factorization (PMF), which were collectively decreased by 30.7% at the urban site and 14.4% at the suburban site during the APEC summit. Coal and oil combustion regulations were the most effective for reducing the trace elements concentrations (urban site: 63.1%; suburban site: 52.0%), followed by measures to reduce traffic exhaust (52.8%) at the urban site and measures to reduce biomass burning (37.7%) at the suburban site.

The fundamental way to prevent global warming is by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Achieving this has become a key concern for all countries. The logarithmic mean divisia index model was constructed to decompose the total carbon emission increment. Carbon finance effect was divided into green credit effect and carbon trading effect to analyze the impact of carbon finance on carbon emissions. The results showed that the total carbon emission reduction value caused by green credit effect from 2010 to 2016 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was 66193.96 million tons, and the added value of carbon emission caused by carbon trading effect was 80266.68 million tons. There are regional differences in the effects of carbon finance on carbon emissions in these regions. It can be concluded that to a certain extent, green credit can reduce carbon emissions, and carbon trading can increase carbon emissions. Using the gradual expansion of carbon finance trading and market mechanism of carbon finance to solve the problem of carbon emission can improve the efficiency of carbon emission reduction. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Carbon finance effect; Carbon trading; Green credit; Logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; credit provision; decomposition analysis; environmental economics; global warming; market conditions; pollution tax; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062921710

In this study, a bottom-up approach of county level emission inventory from open straw burning was developed. A 1 km resolution inventories for Jiangsu province, Eastern China, was established as a case study. In order to increase temporal-spatial resolution, county level, seasonal data and local parameters were preferentially used. Per capita disposable income of rural residents was used to adjust burning proportion for different cities. Emissions during summer-harvest and autumn-harvest seasons were calculated separately. The inventory was further allocated based on both MODIS fire product and land use data of cropland. Total emissions of SO 2 , NOx, THC, NH 3 , OC, BC and primary PM 2.5 from open straw burning in 2015 were 3.72, 15.25, 43.52, 2.65, 16.08, 2.08 and 44.70 Gg, respectively. From 2010 to 2015, provincial emissions decreased by 50.7% in average, and the difference between southern and northern Jiangsu has been even enlarged. Autumn-harvest crop straw contributed 63%–67% to NH 3 , OC and PM 2.5 , while summer-harvest crop straw contributed 60% to BC.

Compared to a large number of records regarding these processes in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), detailed information of these processes in the zone above the SMTZ is still required. In this study, a short sediment core DS16 (330 cm) collected from the methane hydrate-bearing Dongsha area, Northern of the South China Sea, was examined by geochemical and microbial methods. Pore water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) had an increasing trend with the increasing depth of the sediment, while the value of δ 13 C-DIC showed a decreasing pattern. The high concentrations of DIC (up to 32.88 mM) and relatively negative δ 13 C-DIC (down to −30.07‰) indicated the occurrence of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) to some extant above the SMTZ in this region. The variation of concentration profiles of H 2 S (3.69–12.71 mmol/L) and Fe(III) indicated active S and Fe redox reactions occurred in this zone. Notably, both of the decreasing trends of sulfate and Fe(III) correlated well with those of δ 13 C-DIC, indicating AOM and organic materials coupled with both sulfate and Fe(III) reduction. Moreover, high-throughput sequencing data showed that a number of archaea (ANME-1) and bacteria (Sulfurovum and Shewanella), which are potential methane-, S- and Fe-metabolic related microorganisms, were detected in these sediments. In addition, the functional genes related to sulfate reduction, sulfur oxidation, and Fe uptake were also detected based on metagenomics analysis. Among them, with the depth increase and Fe(III) concentration decrease, the gene related to Fe 3+ uptake mechanism decreased, while the gene related to siderophore uptake mechanism remained constant or even slightly increased. Thus, we propose that bacteria acquired Fe(III) via Fe(III) uptake proteins and siderophore uptake proteins in the Fe-deficient environments for reduction, which then might support the occurrence of Fe-AOM. By integrating these data, we suggest the occurrence of active biogeochemical CH 4 -S-Fe cycling in the zone above the SMTZ under high methane flux. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Biogeochemical cycle; Fe(III) reduction; Methane hydrate-bearing sediments; South China Sea; Sulfate-methane transition zone","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Gas hydrates; Genes; Hydration; Methane; Oxidation; Proteins; Redox reactions; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Biogeochemical cycle; Fe reductions; Methane hydrates; South China sea; Sulfate-methane transitions; Iron compounds; biogeochemical cycle; dissolved inorganic carbon; gas hydrate; iron; marine sediment; methane; oxidation; reduction; sediment core; siderophore; sulfate; sulfur; transition zone; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Shewanella; Sulfurovum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062421174

In this study, the health and economic benefits associated with PM2.5 reductions in PRD during 2013–2015 were estimated using the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) software. To create reliable gridded PM2.5 surfaces for BenMAP-CE calculations, a data fusion tool which incorporates the accuracy of monitoring data and the spatial coverage of predictions from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model has been developed. The population-weighted average PM2.5 concentration over PRD was predicted to decline by 24%. PM2.5-related mortality was estimated to decrease by more than 3800 due to decreases in stroke (48%), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (35%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (10%), and lung cancer (LC) (7%). A 13% reduction in PM2.5-related premature deaths from these four causes yielded a large economic benefit of about 1300 million US dollars.

However, warming responses of critical microbial parameters such as carbon use efficiency (CUE) and biomass turnover (rB) are not well understood. Here, we determine these parameters using a probabilistic inversion approach that integrates a microbial-enzyme model with 22 years of carbon cycling measurements at Harvard Forest. We find that increasing temperature reduces CUE but increases rB, and that two decades of soil warming increases the temperature sensitivities of CUE and rB. These temperature sensitivities, which are derived from decades-long field observations, contrast with values obtained from short-term laboratory experiments. We also show that long-term soil C flux and pool changes in response to warming are more dependent on the temperature sensitivity of CUE than that of rB. Using the inversion-derived parameters, we project that chronic soil warming at Harvard Forest over six decades will result in soil C gain of <1.0% on average (1st and 3rd quartiles: 3.0% loss and 10.5% gain) in the surface mineral horizon. Our results demonstrate that estimates of temperature sensitivity of microbial CUE and rB can be obtained and evaluated rigorously by integrating multidecadal datasets. This approach can potentially be applied in broader spatiotemporal scales to improve long-term projections of soil C feedbacks to climate warming. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon use efficiency (CUE); data-model integration; Harvard forest; microbial biomass turnover (rB); soil warming; temperature sensitivity","carbon flux; forest soil; microbial activity; probability; soil carbon; soil temperature; warming; Harvard Forest; Massachusetts; United States; carbon; biomass; carbon cycle; chemistry; forest; greenhouse effect; metabolism; microbiology; soil; temperature; theoretical model; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Forests; Global Warming; Models, Theoretical; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058385738

The Portable Emission Measurement System was applied to the calibration of emission factors calculated by the model to improve the accuracy of emission predictions. The prediction of emission trends sets three different scenarios: baseline scenarios (BAS), emission reduction standard scenario (ERS), and emission reduction standard and replacement by electric vehicle scenario (ERS and REV). The gray model was used to predict the number of heavy-duty diesel passenger buses in the three scenarios and combined with the calibrated emission factors to predict the emission trends under different scenarios. Results show that the ERS will reduce CO, CO2, NOX, and PM emissions by approximately 23%, 12%, 23%, and 46% respectively, in 2025 compared with BAS.

This study uses a FVC scheme in which FVC is derived from leaf area index and a remotely sensed clumping index. The performance of the new scheme (SMFVC) is evaluated against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and in situ soil temperature observations, together with two other FVC schemes, a general FVC scheme (CTL) based on land cover map and a climatology-based FVC scheme (RSFVC) that uses long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of MODIS. The three FVC schemes were implemented in the Common Land Model (CoLM) and applied in the Tibetan Plateau using the same forcing data and default parameters. Our results demonstrate that FVC schemes have significant influence on the CoLM performance: (1) the RSFVC and SMFVC schemes significantly reduce the LST biases found in CTL, particularly in grassland and during summer; (2) soil temperature evaluation by in situ observations from three networks on the Tibetan Plateau corroborates the LST results; and (3) the improvements are mainly related to representing temporal (seasonal) variability and subgrid heterogeneity of FVC, which improves surface albedo and surface energy balance. In other words, by including more vegetation characteristics, such as using a clumping index, land surface models may better simulate surface vegetation condition and further better represent the land surface energy budget over the Tibetan Plateau. ©2019.

The wind fields also play an important role in the dispersion of air pollutants from the traffic emissions. However, the effects of different regional wind fields on the diffusion patterns of traffic-emitted fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in urban areas are still unclear and lack quantified measurements. To provide guidance to urban planning and design, as well as urban governance and management, it is especially important to identify the extent to which wind fields affect the diffusion of traffic-emitted particles. To understand the effect, field measurements and numerical simulations were conducted in this study. The field measurements mainly focused on collecting three-dimensional (3D) distributions of concentrations of traffic-emitted particles in a student dormitory zone at a university using instrumented unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The collected PM2.5 measurements were used to verify and calibrate numerical models. Then, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to track the progress of pollutant dispersion and evaluate its relationship to urban forms. The effects of different wind directions (northwest and southeast) on the distribution and deposition of the traffic-emitted particles in the residential area were studied under different wind velocity conditions (1 m s−1, 5 m s−1 and 20 m s−1). As efficient observation platforms, the UAVs employed in the study allowed the capture of the 3D variations in the distributions of atmospheric pollutants in urban areas. The result provides a better understanding of the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants in a specific urban built environment under different wind fields, which can support urban governance and planning and design practice leading to effective mitigation of traffic-induced air pollution in urban areas. © 2018","CFD; Three-dimensional distribution; Traffic emission; UAV; Urban air quality; Wind","Air quality; Antennas; Computational fluid dynamics; Housing; Numerical models; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wind; Atmospheric pollutants; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Threedimensional (3-d); Traffic emissions; Traffic induced air pollution; Urban air quality; Urban residential areas; Urban planning; air quality; atmospheric pollution; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (composition); dispersion; particulate matter; traffic emission; unmanned vehicle; urban area; wind field",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048311903

The continent still struggles with issues that relate to energy poverty and overall access, as there are indicators that a large majority still have no access to modern, affordable and reliable energy services. The major constraints are identified as inadequate or unavailable financing, invalid or non-existent policies and largely unstable political environments. The SE4ALL mandate in accordance with the Paris Agreement stipulates the need for effective climate change policy, the imperative for improved energy efficiency and the need for inclusion. A dynamic approach is therefore required to provide energy access to the most vulnerable, especially in the rural and urban slums of sub-Saharan Africa. This paper suggests that blockchain technology is potentially that medium and therefore assesses the current advancements, challenges and its potential application within the regional energy context using the diffusion of innovation theory. The results suggest alternative platforms such as Iota being deployed in the near term, due to a lack of requisite network infrastructure and the financial handicap of the region. However, the emphasis on innovative and disruptive business models for harnessing renewable energy sources towards improved energy efficiency and overall socio-economic development, remains. The key is in the adoption of technology that is tailored specifically, towards a sustainable energy future for sub-Saharan Africa. © 2019 IEEE.","Africa; blockchain; energy; energy efficiency; sustainable development","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy efficiency; Finance; Renewable energy resources; Climate change policies; Diffusion of innovation theory; Dynamic approaches; Network infrastructure; Reliable energy services; Renewable energy source; Socio-economic development; Sustainable energy; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083079364

However, the lack of a long-term (millennial) perspective on tree line shifts in the Pyrenees prevents understanding the underlying ecosystem dynamics and processes. We combine multiproxy palaeoecological analyses (fossil pollen, spores, conifer stomata, plant macrofossils, and ordination) from an outstanding ice cave deposit located in the alpine belt c. 200 m above current tree line (Armeña-A294 Ice Cave, 2,238 m a.s.l.), to assess for the first time in the Pyrenees, tree line dynamics, and ecosystem resilience to climate changes 5,700–2,200 (cal.) years ago. The tree line ecotone was located at the cave altitude from 5,700 to 4,650 cal year bp, when vegetation consisted of open Pinus uncinata Ramond ex DC and Betula spp. Woodlands and timberline were very close to the site. Subsequently, tree line slightly raised and timberline reached the ice cave altitude, exceeding its today's uppermost limit by c. 300–400 m during more than four centuries (4,650 and 4,200 cal year bp) at the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum. After 4,200 cal year bp, alpine tundra communities dominated by Dryas octopetala L. expanded while tree line descended, most likely as a consequence of the Neoglacial cooling. Prehistoric livestock raising likely reinforced climate cooling impacts at 3,450–3,250 cal year bp. Finally, a tree line ecotone developed around the cave that was on its turn replaced by alpine communities during the past 2,000 years. Synthesis. The long-term Pyrenean tree line ecotone sensitivity suggests that rising temperatures will trigger future P. uncinata and Betula expansions to higher elevations, replacing arctic–alpine plant species. Climate change is causing the rapid melting of the cave ice; rescue investigations would be urgently needed to exploit its unique ecological information. © 2018 The Authors.

However, global change and local perturbations are expected to modify peatland plant communities, leading to a shift from Sphagnum mosses to vascular plants. Most studies have focused on the direct effects of modification in plant communities or of global change (such as climate warming, N fertilization) in peatlands without considering interactions between these disturbances that may alter peatlands’ C function. We set up a mesocosm experiment to investigate how Greenhouse Gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) fluxes, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved N (TN) contents are affected by a shift from Sphagnum mosses to Molinia caerulea dominated peatlands combined with N fertilization. Increasing N deposition did not alter the C fluxes (CO2 exchanges, CH4 emissions) or DOC content. The lack of N effect on the C cycle seems due to the capacity of Sphagnum to efficiently immobilize N. Nevertheless, N supply increased the N2O emissions, which were also controlled by the plant communities with the presence of Molinia caerulea reducing N2O emissions in the Sphagnum mesocosms. Our study highlights the role of the vegetation composition on the C and N fluxes in peatlands and their responses to the N deposition. Future research should now consider the climate change in interaction to plants community modifications due to their controls of peatland sensitivity to environmental conditions. © 2018","CO2 and CH4; Graminoid; N2O; Peatland; Plant community composition; Sphagnum moss","Carbon dioxide; Deposition; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen fertilizers; Organic carbon; Wetlands; CO2 and CH4; Graminoid; Peatland; Plant communities; Sphagnum moss; Climate change; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; community composition; fertilization (reproduction); mesocosm; moss; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen dioxide; plant community; Bryophyta; Molinia; Molinia caerulea; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta; fertilizer; nitrogen; carbon cycle; chemistry; drug effect; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; Poaceae; Sphagnopsida; Carbon Cycle; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrogen Fixation; Poaceae; Sphagnopsida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055626560

Being poikilohydric organisms, they do not actively control their internal water content and need a humid environment to activate their metabolism. Therefore, studying water relationships of nonvascular cryptogams is crucial to understand both their diversity patterns and their functions in the ecosystems. We present the BtM datalogger, a low-cost open-source platform for the study of the water content of nonvascular cryptogams. The datalogger is designed to measure ambient temperature, humidity, and conductance from up to eight samples simultaneously. We provide a design for a printed circuit board (PCB), a detailed protocol to assemble the components, and the required source code. All this makes the assembly of the BtM datalogger accessible to any research group, even to those without previous specialized knowledge. Therefore, the design presented here has the potential to help popularize the use of this type of device among ecologists and field biologists.",,"water; cost; devices; economics; electrical equipment; environmental monitoring; humidity; lichen (organism); metabolism; moss; temperature; Bryophyta; Costs and Cost Analysis; Electrical Equipment and Supplies; Environmental Monitoring; Humidity; Lichens; Temperature; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064490333

Cork oak is a Mediterranean species with a large distribution in Portugal from which cork is extracted in a sustainable way and mainly used as the raw material for cork stoppers and insulating materials. To study the response of cork oak to drought and the effect of phellogen age on that response we examined cork growth from a 30-year chronology of trees from 12 sites in the main Portuguese cork oak production area. For the first time in cork, a components resilience study was performed. The research confirmed that drought reduces cork growth and provided extra knowledge on the responses of cork oak to drought: more severe droughts correspond to higher decrease of cork growth and more trees affected but to greater recovery performance. Moreover, cork oak is very tolerant and resilient to extreme droughts. Nevertheless, there are other factors that affect cork growth during and after drought, namely site, tree and the age of the phellogen. In fact, in the first 2 years and in the last 2 years of the production cycle the effects of drought on growth are more pronounced than in the middle of the cycle. The age of the phellogen is significant in the recovery, resistance and resilience but not in the relative resilience. The most noticeable differences occurred in the recovery for phellogen under 3 years (17% lower than that for phellogen with 3 to 6 years of age). Moreover, under drought conditions, there is a strong evidence that forest managers should enlarge debarking rotations, namely if drought occurs in the first 2 years of the production cycle and/or establish new cork oak stands in more humid areas, namely, in higher latitudes than the actual species distribution area. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Dendrochronology; Dendroecology; Pointer years; Quercus suber; Resilience components","climate change; climate effect; deciduous forest; dendrochronology; dendroecology; drought; ecosystem resilience; extreme event; forest management; growth; humid environment; latitude; tree ring; Portugal; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058052944

Of note, population density is higher, and vehicles encounter greater restrictions. Moreover, air pollution from fossil fuel combustion is more severe. As tailpipe emissions are becoming costly to both corporations and the environment, researchers are increasingly exploring more appealing transportation options. Electric bicycles have become an important mode of transportation in some countries in the past decade. Electric bicycles and automobiles have their respective merits and demerits when used to provide courier services. E-bikes in particular can ply their trade in densely packed areas that are off-limits to cars and trucks. This paper focuses on (1) developing a truck-bike mixture model to reduce operating costs for an existing truck-only service by replacing some of the trucks with bicycles, and (2) exploring the resulting effects in terms of reducing overall carbon emissions. Data from one of the major courier companies in South Korea were utilized. The problem was tackled as a heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem using simulated annealing because the actual size of the problem cannot be solved directly with a mathematical approach. The most effective fleet mix was found for the company's case. Effects on operating costs and reduced emissions were analyzed for 15 different scenarios with varying demands and off-limits areas. Computational results revealed that the new model is viable from economic and sustainability standpoints. They indicated that costs decrease to varying degrees in all scenarios, and that carbon emissions also decrease by around 10% regardless of the selected scenario. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Courier services; Electric bicycle; Truck delivery","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; electric vehicle; emission control; infrastructure; population density; simulated annealing; suburban area; sustainability; traffic emission; urban area; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062834301

The purpose of this study was to investigate impacts of future climate change on the species richness of land vertebrates, and to assess critical areas that might be continuously threatened by climate change in order to maintain high species richness in South Korea. The Climate Change Severity Index (CCSI) was calculated based on representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios to determine the climatic space (also known as comfort zone) of species and ecosystems under historic and future climate conditions. Regions with high species richness were then identified using survey results of species abundance and distribution. Finally, we identified critical areas with high CCSI values and high levels of species richness. These are areas where species and ecosystems are threatened the most by climate change. The number of critical areas is predicted to increase towards the late 2000s, and this increase is greater under RCP 8.5 than under RCP 4.5. Furthermore, the number of critical areas will increase more in coastal and wide plain areas than in inland mountainous areas.

In this study, we investigated the autogenic (e.g., topography) and allogenic (fire and climate) factors triggering paludification in different geomorphological contexts (glaciolacustrine silty-clayey and fluvioglacial deposits) within the Québec black spruce (Picea mariana)-moss boreal forest. Paleoecological analyses were conducted along three toposequences varying from a forest on mineral soil to forested and semi-open peatlands. Plant macrofossil and charcoal analyses were performed on basal peat sections (≤50 cm) and thick forest humus (<40 cm) to reconstruct local vegetation dynamics and fire history involved in the paludification process. Results show that primary paludification started in small topographic depressions after land emergence ca. 8000 cal yr BP within rich fens. Lateral peatland expansion and secondary paludification into adjacent forests occurred between ca. 5100 and 2300 cal yr BP and resulted from low-severity fires during a climatic deterioration. Fires that reduced or eliminated entirely the organic layer promoted the establishment of Sphagnum in microdepressions. Paludification resulted in the decline of some coniferous species such as Abies balsamea and Pinus banksiana. The paleoecological approach along toposequences allowed us to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of paludification and its impacts on the vegetation dynamics over the Holocene. © 2018 University of Washington.

Here, we studied the case of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in French cropland at the regional scale from 1852 to 2014 by coupling the GRAFS approach (Generalized Representation of Agro-Food System) with the AMG model (after its authors names: Andriulo, Mary, Guérif). Our results emphasize the role of crop net primary production (NPP) as the main driver of changes in SOC stocks through the input of crop residues. Three distinct phases of NPP were identified: (1) from 1852 to 1950, a slow rise in NPP occurred, which induced a moderate increase of cropland SOC pools (1–2‰ yr−1); (2) from 1950 to 1980, NPP increased considerably, resulting in a much higher rate of SOC accumulation (2–4‰ yr−1); (3) from 1980 to 2014, divergent trajectories were followed according to regions with either a slowdown in NPP growth with moderate increase in SOC stocks (0–2‰ yr−1), or a reversed trend toward declining NPP induced by a reduction of fodder production, replaced by imported feed which led to negative change of cropland SOC stocks. We highlight that these evolutions of carbon dynamics in cropland were closely linked to changes in the French social political context, from the second Empire to the Cold War and the advent of a neo-liberal era. As a whole, for France, we found a rate of C sequestration in the top 30 cm of cropland soils of about 1.7 Mt C yr−1 for the last two decades, less than one fifth of the current fossil-fuel-based CO2 emission rate of the French agricultural sector which exceeds 8 Mt C yr−1. Our study showed that in developed countries like France, where a sharp increase in cropland SOC stocks occurred owing to the modernization of agriculture, this should be considered as a “fossil-fuel-powered carbon sink” which does only partly compensate for the direct emissions through mechanization and fertilizer production that induced it. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","4 per 1000; Agro-food systems; Long-term trajectory; Modelling; Socio-ecological metabolism; Soil carbon dynamic","carbon dioxide; fertilizer; fossil fuel; organic carbon; soil organic matter; Article; biomass production; carbon dynamics; carbon sink; carbon storage; climate change; cropland; developed country; energy metabolism; evapotranspiration; exhaust gas; fluid balance; France; mineralization; plant residue; priority journal; rural area; soil fertility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058975722

Cicer milkvetch provides excellent forage for livestock, but given its large size and ability to fix nitrogen, it is likely to affect other ecosystem services provided by grasslands. We have observed cicer milkvetch in the dry mixed-grass prairie of southern Alberta, Canada. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of cicer milkvetch on forage production, carbon storage and plant community diversity after it colonizes native mixed prairie grasslands and further examine whether these effects increase with cicer milkvetch patch size. We compared the ecosystem functions among plots located within a cicer milkvetch patch, beside a patch and 5 m distant from the patch. The plant, as expected has positive effects on forage quantity and quality, reduced plant species diversity and richness, and altered numerous components of the carbon pool, as well as nitrogen availability. Furthermore, larger patches of cicer milkvetch had lower concentrations of soil carbon and nitrogen, and differentially affected other ecosystem properties. Given the potentially large propagule pressure of non-native legumes from agricultural lands, surrounding native grasslands in North America, and our results demonstrating effects on multiple grassland ecosystem services, further consideration and investigation of non-native legumes in grasslands is warranted. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Diversity; Forage production; Nitrogen; Soil organic carbon","carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; grassland; legume; organic carbon; plant community; prairie; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; species diversity; Alberta; Canada; Astragalus cicer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055996784

The CDFt approach is one from the category of statistical downscaling methods that operates via transformations between statistical distributions. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that such methods provide value overall, much less effort has focused on their performance with regard to values in the tails of distributions. We evaluate the performance of CDFt-generated tail values based on four distinct approaches, two native to CDFt and two of our own creation, in the context of a “Perfect Model” setting in which global climate model output is used as a proxy for both observational and model data. We find that the native CDFt approaches can have sub-optimal performance in the tails, particularly with regard to the maximum value.

The increasing demand for sustainable animal production is driving researchers to explore proper strategies to mitigate ruminal methanogenesis. Since hydrogen is the primary substrate of ruminal methanogenesis, hydrogen metabolism and its associated microbiome in the rumen may closely relate to low- and high-methane phenotypes. Using candidate microbes that can compete with methanogens and redirect hydrogen away from methanogenesis as ruminal methane mitigants are promising avenues for methane mitigation, which can both prevent the adverse effects deriving from chemical additives such as toxicity and resistance, and increase the retention of feed energy. This review describes the ruminal microbial ecosystem and its association with methane production, as well as the effects of interspecies hydrogen transfer on methanogenesis. It provides a scientific perspective on using bacteria that are involved in hydrogen utilization as ruminal modifiers to decrease methanogenesis. This information will be helpful in better understanding the key role of ruminal microbiomes and their relationship with methane production and, therefore, will form the basis of valuable and eco-friendly methane mitigation methods while improving animal productivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","H 2 transfer; H 2 utilizing bacteria; Methane mitigation; Microbial ecosystem; Rumen","Ecosystems; Energy dissipation; Mammals; Methane; Environmental problems; H2 transfer; Hydrogen metabolism; Hydrogen utilization; Interspecies hydrogen transfers; Methane mitigation; Microbial eco system; Rumen; Bacteria; hydrogen; methane; nitrate; nitrite; propionic acid; sulfate; hydrogen; methane; biome; hydrogen; metabolism; methane; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; microorganism; ruminant; stomach content; carbon footprint; ciliate; energy metabolism; fungus; methanogenesis; methanogenic archaeon; nitrate reducing bacterium; nitrite reducing bacterium; nonhuman; priority journal; proton transport; Review; rumen microorganism; sulfate reducing bacterium; thermodynamics; animal; bacterium; fermentation; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; rumen; ruminant; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Animals; Bacteria; Fermentation; Hydrogen; Methane; Microbiota; Rumen; Ruminants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056759859

However, widespread adoption remains elusive, suggesting the need for other measures to accompany dissemination of clean cookstoves. Despite knowledge about health impacts of cookstove smoke and a body of evidence pointing to the efficacy of health education for supporting behaviour change, health messaging is relatively unexplored in the cookstove sector. This paper aims to present findings from action research in Cambodia that investigates how social innovation around positive and negative health messaging influences demand for clean biomass cookstoves. Design/methodology/approach: An action research approach was taken, involving the design and implementation of a health marketing campaign alongside promotion of a clean burning biomass cookstove. Four communes were assigned as intervention communes and a fifth as the control group. Among the four intervention communes, two were provided with positive health messaging and the other two with negative health messaging. The methods included a baseline study of 381 households using structured surveys, roll-out of the health campaign, in-depth interviews with households and sales agents, ten focus group discussions with households and an endline structured survey of all 381 households. Findings: Neither the type (positive/negative) nor the intensity of the health campaigns had a significant impact on stove sales. Sales results show no pattern in either variable, and sales in the control commune were not lower than in communes where health campaigns were used. However, health messaging did increase awareness about health impacts of cooking with traditional biomass burning stoves. For almost all communes, in particular those that received positive-tone messages, an increased awareness of the health impact of cooking with traditional biomass burning stoves was observed. Cookstove price and personal characteristics of individual sales agents were shown to be the strongest factors affecting sales. Research limitations/implications: The study relied on sales agents to deliver pre-assigned health messages. However, some sales agents did not follow instructions in delivering the messages, which made it difficult to compare the efficacy of the different campaign approaches. Due to a delay in the study, the campaign overlapped with the planting season when disposable incomes of famers is typically limited, reducing their ability to purchase a new cookstove. The 10-week duration of the campaign may not have been long enough to see an impact on sales, particularly for a product viewed as expensive for the average consumer. Practical implications: The skill and motivation of individual sales agents can greatly affect cookstove marketing campaigns. The efficacy of individual sales agents appears to have been the strongest factor affecting sales, with the most successful sales agent using a combination of messages, including health information, to convince households to purchase the stoves. This warrants further study; designers of stove promotion campaigns might be able to learn from the behaviour and strategies of highly effective sales agents. Price continues to be an important factor influencing the adoption of clean cookstoves. In Cambodia, the main drivers of cookstove purchase (beside the sales agent) were availability of disposable income, time and fuel saved. Social implications: Health messaging was shown to have minimal effect on cookstove purchase. Indeed, it is clear that cookstove adoption is influenced by multiple factors linked in complex ways. This is a very important finding for public health workers, who need to think more broadly about how they achieve the public health goals associated with cleaner cooking through approaches that do not necessarily focus on individual health goals. Originality/value: Although health messaging has shown promise as an approach for supporting behaviour change in other sectors, it has not been widely studies in the context of clean cookstove adoption. This paper contributes to filling this gap and suggests some lines of enquiry for future research. The study pioneered innovative methods such as action research, use of graphic images and using established local sales agents as means of communicating messages about the health risks of cooking smoke and the benefits of improved cookstoves. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behaviour change communication; Cambodia; Clean cookstoves; Health messaging",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062466806

Despite advances in disaster risk reduction efforts of the country, the twin December storms caused numerous deaths in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. Analysis of these events shows that alerts raised during the Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment (PDRA) for both storms were largely ineffective because they were too broad and general calling for forced evacuations in too many provinces. Repeated multiple and general warnings that usually do not end up in floods or landslides, desensitize people and result in the cry-wolf effect where communities do not respond with urgency when needed. It was unlike the previous execution of PDRA from 2014 to early 2017 by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), which averted mass loss of lives in many severely impacted areas because of hazard-specific, area-focused and time-bound warnings. PDRA must reinstate specific calls, where mayors of communities are informed by phone hours in advance of imminent danger to prompt and ensure immediate action. Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction information using probabilistic (multi-scenario) hazard maps is also necessary for an effective early warning system to elicit appropriate response from the community. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Methods of early warning through the PDRA of the National Disaster Mitigation and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Philippines during tropical storm Urduja and Typhoon Vinta were assessed in this study and compared to the previous PDRA system from 2014 to early 2017. Findings: It was found out that the numerous casualties were due to inadequate warning issued during the approach of the tropical cyclones. During an impending hazard, warnings must be accurate, reliable, understandable and timely. Despite the availability of maps that identified safe zones for different communities, warnings raised during the PDRA for both tropical cyclones were deemed too general calling for evacuations of whole provinces. As such, not all communities were evacuated in a timely manner because of failure in the key elements of an effective early warning system. Originality/value: To avoid future disasters from happening, it is recommended that the PDRA reinstate its hazards-specific, area-focused and time-bound warnings. Similarly, to increase the resilience of communities, more work on mainstreaming of Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk and Vulnerability Reduction systems for communities must be done as well. Learning from the lessons of these previous disasters will enable communities, their leaders and every stakeholder, not to repeat the same mistakes in the future. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Disaster and emergency management; Disasters; Early warning systems; Hazards; Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment; Risk perception; Tropical storm Urduja; Tropical storm Vinta",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055960982

Despite considerable evidence demonstrating the global ski industry is in the early stages of a climate-induced transition, global research on ski industry stakeholder perspectives shows varied levels of climate risk awareness, a focus on future vulnerability, and limited engagement in adaptation. Within North America, research has focussed on the physical climatic impacts to ski operations and possible skier responses, yet there lacks insight into industry perceptions on current and future climate vulnerability. This study fills this important knowledge gap using a Delphi survey to engage 52 leaders from across the continent in a dialogue on strategic climate responsiveness. Results demonstrate North American ski industry leaders’ climate risk perceptions range widely, and opinions diverge over if or how to respond at both an industry and destination scale. Simultaneously, industry experts believe mountain tourists increasingly value nature-based activities, place-bound products, and corporate responsibility. Analysing industry leaders’ responses through Enlightened Stakeholder theory highlights how aligning supply-side environmental management with demand-side tourist experiences may create opportunities for new partnerships, innovations, policies, and strategies needed to achieve climate-resilient and sustainable futures. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; resilience; ski industry; Sustainable tourism; transformations","climate change; Delphi analysis; ecotourism; mountain region; perception; stakeholder; survey; sustainability; tourist destination; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064564815

Information on spatially explicit source contributions is needed to develop efficient and cost-effective CH4 emission reduction and mitigation strategies to addresses near-term climate change. This study collected long-term ambient CH4 measurements at Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) in Los Angeles, California, to estimate the annual CH4 emissions from the portion of Los Angeles County that is within the South Coast Air Basin (SCLA). The measurement-based CH4 emission estimates for SCLA ranged from 3.95 to 4.89 million metric tons (MMT) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year between 2012 and 2016. Source apportionment of CH4, CO, CO2, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measurements were used to evaluate source categories that contributed to ambient CH4 mixing ratio enhancements (ΔCH4) at SCLA between 2014 and 2016. Results suggested ΔCH4 contributions of 56-79% from natural gas sources, 7-31% from landfills, and 4-15% from transportation sources. The SCLA-specific CH4 emission estimate made using a research grade gridded CH4 emission inventory suggested contributions of 47% from natural gas sources and 50% from landfills. Subsequent airborne measurements determined that CH4 emissions from two major CH4 sources in SCLA were significantly smaller in magnitude than previously thought. This study highlights the importance of studying the variabilities of CH4 emissions across California for policy makers and stakeholders alike. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Land fill; Methane; Mixing; Natural gas; Volatile organic compounds; Airborne measurements; Atmospheric methanes; Emission inventories; Emission inventory estimates; Natural gas sources; Source apportionment; Source contributions; South Coast Air basins; Natural gas transportation; carbon dioxide; methane; natural gas; petroleum derivative; volatile organic compound; carbon dioxide; climate change; emission inventory; estimation method; landfill; methane; mixing ratio; natural gas; policy making; pollutant source; resource availability; source apportionment; strategic approach; air temperature; Article; combustion; decomposition; landfill; measurement; molecular weight; oxidation; seasonal variation; soil moisture; soil temperature; traffic and transport; waste water management; air pollutant; California; environmental monitoring; California; Los Angeles County; South Coast Air Basin; United States; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Los Angeles; Methane; Natural Gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063148840

However, the magnitude of carbon stocks and the rate of carbon accumulation (CAR) vary geographically due to a large variation of local factors. In order to better understand the blue carbon sink of mangrove ecosystems, we measured organic carbon stocks, sources and accumulation rates in three Indonesian mangrove ecosystems with different environmental settings and conditions; (i) a degraded estuarine mangrove forest in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Central Java, (ii) an undegraded estuarine mangrove forest in Berau region, East Kalimantan, and (iii) a pristine marine mangrove forest on Kongsi Island, Thousand Islands, Jakarta. In general, C org stocks were higher in estuarine than in marine mangroves, although a large variation was observed among the estuarine mangroves. The mean total C org stock in Berau (615 ± 181 Mg C ha −1 ) is twice as high as that in SAL (298 ± 181 Mg C ha −1 ). However, the Segara Anakan Lagoon displayed large within-system variation with a much higher C org stock in the eastern (483 ± 124 Mg C ha −1 ) than in the central lagoon (167 ± 36 Mg C ha −1 ). The predominant accumulation of autochthonous mangrove organic matter likely contributed to the higher C org stocks in Berau and the eastern SAL. Interestingly, the CAR distribution pattern in SAL is opposite to that of its C org stocks. The central SAL that receives high sediment inputs from the hinterland has a much higher CAR than the eastern SAL (658 ± 311 g C m −2 yr −1 and 194 ± 46 g C m −2 yr −1 , respectively), while Berau has one of the highest CAR (1722 ± 183 g C m −2 yr −1 ) ever measured. It appears that these large differences are driven by the environmental setting and conditions, mainly sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics, landform, and vegetation conditions. It is inferred that quantifying carbon accumulation in sediments is a useful tool in estimating the present-day carbon storage of mangrove ecosystems. This is a precondition for taking measures under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) schemes. © 2019 The Authors","Blue carbon; Carbon stock; Mangrove; Organic carbon accumulation; Stable carbon isotope","accumulation rate; autochthon; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; coastal lagoon; mangrove; organic carbon; organic matter; stable isotope; Central Java; East Kalimantan; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Jakarta; Java; Segara Anakan Lagoon; Sunda Isles; Thousand Islands [West Java]; West Java; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059869275

Abiotic and biotic stresses are very important factors affecting PGP in agriculture. A vast number of microbial communities play an important role in abiotic stress tolerance. The PGP methylotrophic microbes have been reported well enough to mitigate different types of biotic and abiotic stresses. The abiotic stress tolerance was well documented by several methylotrophic bacterial communities such as Hyphomicrobium, Methylarcula, Methylobacillus, Methylobacterium, Methylocapsa, Methylocella, Methyloferula, Methylohalomonas, Methylomonas, Methylophilus, Methylopila, Methylosinus, Methylotenera, Methylovirgula and Methylovorus. The abiotic stress tolerance ability of different methylotrophs and their colonization in different parts of plants under severe low temperature, high temperature, drought and salt stress conditions have been investigated in various studies. The methylotrophic communities help in proliferation of plant directly through solubilization of phosphorus, potassium and zinc, production of phytohormones viz., auxins and cytokinins; production of Fe-chelating compound, biological nitrogen fixation and ACC-deaminase activities or indirectly through productions of ammonia, siderophores and secondary metabolites. The auxin and cytokinin secreted by methylotrophs influence seed germination and plant root growth and help plants to endure water stress. On the plant surface, the abundant methylotrophs exude osmo-protectants such as sugars and alcohols which ultimately help to protect the plants from desiccation and excessive radiations. The utilisation of these potent methylotrophic strains may facilitate proper crop production, PGP by ameliorating abiotic stresses. © 2019, Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","Abiotic stress; Biodiversity; Methylotrophs; Plant growth promotion; PPFMs (Pink Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs)",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062629401

We examine the relationship between drought events and population dynamics using a stylized hydrology-demography model that has been calibrated to simulate plausible feedbacks for the population decline of the Ancient Maya of Central America. We employ a deterministic and a stochastic approach. We find that the impact of drought increases abruptly once a critical threshold of population density is exceeded. The critical threshold depends on the intensity and duration of the drought as well as on the level of technology adopted by society, the extent of markets and societal behavior. The simulations show that, for a society to be as food secure post-climate change as they are pre-climate change, strategies would have to be adopted to not only increase the region's capacity to provide sufficient resources for its growing population, but also to buffer the impact of a drier climate on productivity. This study provides suggestions on how technological, societal and economic development can modify the system to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the human population. © 2018 The Authors","Climate change; Drought; Population-resource model; Socio-hydrology; Virtual water; Vulnerability","climate change; climate effect; demography; drought; economic development; exploration; population decline; population growth; population modeling; stochasticity; threshold; vulnerability; Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056160108

Statistical data collected from 14 countries with a population greater than 100 million inhabitants was used, where the EU is considered as a country. The period from 1990 to 2015 is covered, however divided in two parts, 1990-2005 when conditions were not favourable for renewable energy because the price of fossil fuels and policy support for renewable energy were low, and 2005-2015 when these conditions improved. Theoretical analyses show that the high price of fossil fuels, policy support and cost-effective technologies can explain the fast growth of modern renewable energy during 2005-2015; however, they only partially account for its slower growth during 1990-2005. An additional explanation might be that the innovators generate qualities due to renewable energy use, which are expressed on the markets as value addition of energy services. The statistical analysis of energy services during 1990-2005 shows that the European Union (EU) led in renewable energy compared to the United States (US), Japan and other countries, which was driven by the social initiatives that fostered new firms in the electricity and gas business. A statistical analysis of energy services in the US and EU during 2005-2015 reveals that their value added has grown on an annual average of 2.0% and 2.8%, respectively, which denotes an annual increase of 3 billion and 6 billion US dollars in the 2005 value (USD2005). This valorisation of energy services has invoked further innovations in distributed energy systems and energy storage. A further statistical analysis of the 14 largest countries by population confirms a valorisation of energy services due to modern renewable energy where the emission reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a side-effect. Extrapolation of the average growth rates from the period 1990 to 2015 to the period 2015 to 2040, without any change but a substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy, demonstrates that global income would grow fourfold and energy consumption twofold along with a 100 times larger modern renewable energy and CO2 reduction to 46% of the 2015 level. When those average growth rates of renewable energy decrease linear to 25% in 2040, the global modern renewable energy grows tenfold and CO2 reduces to 82% of the 2015 level. The implication of this statistical study on large countries shows that higher value energy services for households are often based on distributed renewable energy and that such an addition of value generates a CO2 emission reduction as a side effect which can be enhanced by pricing CO2 or obstructed by policy support for the vested interests. This study indicated that the valorisation of energy services will generate a growth of income, energy consumption and renewable energy along with a far-reaching emission reduction of CO2 if policies do foster sustainable innovations. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon dioxide; Energy consumption; Energy efficiency; Energy services; Value added","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Population statistics; Average growth rate; CO2 emission reduction; Cost-effective technology; Distributed energy systems; Electricity and gas; Energy services; Renewable energy use; Value added; Geothermal energy; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; electricity; emission control; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; energy resource; energy storage; energy use; European Union; fossil fuel; geothermal energy; growth rate; solar power; wind power; Japan; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063303312

As the use of LIDs for climate adaptation increases, practitioners need more knowledge on LID performance in future climates for successful planning and implementation. In this study, temporal downscaling of regional climate projections for three cities in Norway is performed, using the concept of scale invariance to downscale the distribution of extreme precipitation from daily to sub-daily timescales. From this, local-scale intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for future precipitation were obtained. Using climate projections of daily temporal resolution as input to water balance models and the obtained IDF relationships as input to event-based models allowed for assessing the retention capacity, peak flow reduction potential and pollution control of three different types of LIDs: green roofs, bioretention cells, and detention basins. The downscaling resulted in large local variations in presumed increase of both precipitation amount and intensity, contradicting current design recommendations in Norway. Countrywide, a decrease in the overall LID performance was found, although some positive effects of temperature rises were detected. The study illustrated the importance of evapotranspiration- and infiltration-based processes in future stormwater management and how coupling of LID structures in series can significantly reduce required detention volumes. © 2019 by the authors.","Bioretention cell; Climate adaptation; Detention basin; GPD; Green roof; LID; POT; Scale invariance; Temporal downscaling","adaptive management; climate change; downscaling; environmental planning; future prospect; implementation process; performance assessment; roof; runoff; scale effect; stormwater; temporal analysis; urbanization; variance analysis; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062834098

Previous management strategies, coupled with climate change, have led to widespread invasion by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis; bluegrass) in the Northern Great Plains, United States. Bluegrass invasions are expected to have detrimental impacts on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provided by rangelands. Yet none have investigated how bluegrass invasions influence pollinator populations, which are a prominent conservation concern and provide ecosystem services. We measured the impact of bluegrass invasion on mixed-grass prairie forb and butterfly communities. Obligate grassland butterflies, those that rely on grasslands, decreased as bluegrass cover increased, including the threatened Hesperia dacotae. Conversely, the abundance of facultative grassland butterflies, those found in grasslands but not fully dependent on them for their life history, increased as bluegrass increased. Moreover, plant species diversity and flowering forb species richness decreased as bluegrass cover increased. Overall, bluegrass invasion led to butterfly and plant community simplification, signaling a loss of biodiversity and potentially ecosystem services. Our research is the first to quantify how grassland butterflies and the floral resources they depend on are negatively impacted by bluegrass invasion. Resource managers should adopt management strategies that reduce bluegrass cover and improve nectar and host resources for obligate grassland butterflies. Management choices that removed disturbance regimes inherent to the Northern Great Plains (i.e., fire and grazing) led to bluegrass dominance in the region. Therefore, restoring disturbance regimes may be one way to reduce bluegrass and benefit pollinator populations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","grassland butterflies; Hesperia dacotae; mixed-grass prairie; Poa pratensis; pollinators; Speyeria idalia","abundance; biodiversity; biological invasion; butterfly; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; grass; grassland; habitat conservation; invasive species; plant community; pollinator; prairie; Great Plains; Kentucky; United States; Hesperia dacotae; Papilionoidea; Poa; Poa pratensis; Speyeria idalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056289008

For surfacing, tungsten-bearing powder wire (types H and E in the IIW classification) is produced in the laboratory. The fillers employed are KR-1 silicon powder (State Standard GOST 2169–69); MR-0 manganese powder (State Standard GOST 6008–82); PKhA-1M chromium powder (Technical Specifications TU 14-1-1474–75); VEL-1 vanadium (Technical Specifications TU 48-0533–71); PNK-1L5 nickel (State Standard GOST 9722–97); PAP-1 aluminum (State Standard GOST 5494–95); PVT tungsten (Technical Specifications TU 48-19-72–92); and PZhV-1 iron powder (State Standard GOST 0489–96). In some wire, tungsten powder is replaced by KSh-4 tungsten concentrate (State Standard GOST 213–83), produced by OAO GK AIR. The carbon-bearing reducing agent employed is gas-purification dust from aluminum production. Its composition is as follows: 21.00–43.27 wt % Al2O3, 18–27 wt % F, 8–13 wt % Na2O, 0.4–6.0 wt % K2O, 0.7–2.1 wt % CaO, 0.50–2.48 wt % SiO2, 2.1–2.3 wt % Fe2O3; 12.5–28.2 wt % Ctot; 0.03–0.90 wt % MnO, 0.04–0.90 wt % MgO, 0.09–0.46 wt % S, and 0.10–0.18 wt % P. The wire (diameter 5 mm) is produced on laboratory equipment. An ASAW 1250 system is used for surfacing, in the following conditions: Is = 400–450 A; Uarc = 32–36 V; Vs = 24–30 m/h. In surfacing, five metal layers are applied, under a layer of AN-26S flux and flux based on slag from silicomanganese production. The chemical composition of the applied metal is determined, and metallographic data are obtained: the size of the former austenite grain, the size of the martensite needles, and the content of nonmetallic inclusions are determined. Wear tests are conducted, and the hardness and microhardness are measured. The use of tungsten concentrate instead of tungsten powder in surfacing is shown to be possible in principle. The degree of tungsten extraction is calculated. For type-H wire, the replacement of tungsten powder by tungsten concentrate does not increase the content of nonmetallic inclusions in the metal layers applied; the primary austenite grain size is decreased. For type-E wire, the use of tungsten concentrate tends to decrease the primary austenite grain size and the size of the martensite needles and also increases the microhardness of martensite within the applied layer. The replacement of tungsten powder by tungsten concentrate in class-H wire considerably increases the hardness and wear resistance of the applied layer. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.","direct reduction; hardness; metal structure; metallographic analysis; microhardness; nonmetallic inclusions; powder wire; surfacing; tungsten concentrate; wear rate","Air purification; Alumina; Aluminum; Aluminum oxide; Austenite; Grain size and shape; Hard facing; Hardness; Hematite; Laboratories; Magnesia; Manganese oxide; Martensite; Microhardness; Needles; Powder metals; Silica; Silicon oxides; Slags; Sodium compounds; Specifications; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Wire; Direct Reduction; Metal structures; Metallographic analysis; Non-metallic inclusions; Wear rates; Tungsten compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069429216

This work aims at exploring the operationalization in life cycle assessment (LCA) of spatially differentiated models for toxic emissions into freshwater. We analyse and compare the variability of fate and exposure factors at high resolution with aggregated factors at different levels of lower resolution. Methods: We developed a spatially resolved fate and exposure characterization model and factors for toxic emissions into freshwater with global coverage at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution, extending a global hydrological model to account for removal processes, namely chemical and biological degradation, sedimentation, and volatilization. We analysed the variation in fate and exposure factors for water ingestion, identifying the main factors of influence. We then developed archetypes for ecosystems and human fate and exposure. Using a case study of emissions of arsenic from red mud disposal as a waste from alumina production, we tested practical solutions to apply spatial characterization factors aggregated at different resolution in LCA, comparing archetype-based with region-based approaches. Results and discussion: World maps show up to 5 orders of magnitude variation for chemical fate in fresh water across all 0.5° × 0.5° grid cells and up to 15 orders of magnitude for human intake fractions. The freshwater residence time to the sea and the equivalent depth—over all downstream cells—were the most influential landscape parameters. They were used to define four freshwater landscape archetypes. These archetypes capture variation in fate well, better than country or continent-aggregated values, but are not able to reflect variation in intake fraction. The case study on arsenic from alumina production shows that the determination of industry-specific weighted average represents a pragmatic way to account for sector-specific location of emissions. The population-weighted approach is primarily applicable for emissions that are related to population density, such as household emissions. Conclusions: The developed global freshwater model demonstrates large spatial variations in fate and exposure. Archetypes for fate in fresh water provide substantial reductions in variability compared to country or continental averages, but are more difficult to apply to LCA than rural or urban archetypes for air emissions. The 0.5° × 0.5° grid model and the fate archetypes may also be used in the context of ecological scenarios to identify hotspots. In practice, population-weighted and sector-specific average characterization factors may represent the most operational way to account for specific distribution patterns of toxic emissions in LCA. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chemical fate; Ecotoxicity; Freshwater; Global modeling; Human toxicity; Intake fractions; Life cycle assessment; Spatial differentiation","aluminum oxide; arsenic; drinking water; fresh water; Article; bioremediation; controlled study; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental change; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental impact; health impact assessment; landscape; life cycle assessment; physical chemistry; population density; priority journal; sedimentation rate; sensitivity analysis; spatial analysis; surface water hydrology; toxic emission; volatilization; waste disposal; water quality; water residence time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049003238

Matrix acidization in carbonate reservoirs is a widely practiced technique in the product enhancement of the oil and gas reservoir. A wormhole, i.e. a flow channel with high porosity, is generated during reactive dissolution of carbonates by the action of the injected acid. In the wormhole forming process, the porosity changes non-uniformly in space, and it even becomes close to unity in the central regions of a wormhole. The Darcy–Brinkman–Forchheimer model accounts for both the porous media and clear fluid area, so it can be used to model wormhole propagation perfectly. This model, however, strongly depends on porosity. Therefore, the time schemes for solving the evolutionary equation of porosity have a significant effect on accuracy and stability of the numerical simulation for wormhole propagation. We propose a semi-analytic time scheme, which solves the porosity equation analytically at each time step for given acid concentration. The proposed numerical method can improve the accuracy and stability of numerical simulation significantly. For theoretical analysis of the proposed time scheme for the wormhole simulation, we first reconstruct the analytical functions of porosity to analyze the time error of the porosity, and on the basis of error estimates of porosity, we employ a coupled analysis approach to achieve the estimates of pressure, velocity and solute concentration.

Aircraft deployment poses a challenging operating environment for instruments measuring climatologically relevant gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate the successful adaption of a commercially available continuous wave quantum cascade laser (QCL) and interband cascade laser (ICL) based spectrometer for airborne in situ trace gas measurements with a local to regional focus. The instrument measures methane, ethane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and water vapor simultaneously, with high 1s-1σ precision (740ppt, 205ppt, 460ppb, 2.2ppb, 137ppt and 16ppm, respectively) and high frequency (2Hz). We estimate a total 1s-1σ uncertainty of 1.85ppb, 1.6ppb, 1.0ppm, 7.0ppb and 0.8ppb in CH4, C2H6, CO2, CO and N2O, respectively. The instrument enables simultaneous and continuous observations for all targeted species. Frequent calibration allows for a measurement duty cycle ≥90%. Custom retrieval software has been implemented and instrument performance is reported for a first field deployment during NASA's Atmospheric Carbon and Transport-America (ACT-America) campaign in fall 2017 over the eastern and central USA. This includes an inter-instrumental comparison with a calibrated cavity ring-down greenhouse gas analyzer (operated by NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, USA) and periodic flask samples analyzed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We demonstrate good agreement of the QCL-and ICL-based instrument to these concurrent observations within the combined measurement uncertainty after correcting for a constant bias. We find that precise knowledge of the δ13C of the working standards and the sampled air is needed to enhance CO2 compatibility when operating on the 2227.604ĝ'1 13C16O2 absorption line. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"airborne survey; calibration; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; ethane; in situ measurement; instrumentation; laser method; methane; nitrous oxide; NOAA satellite; performance assessment; quantum mechanics; spectrometer; trace gas; uncertainty analysis; Hampton; United States; Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063195542

The term agnostic adaptation has emerged to refer to actions that address climate change’s effects without acknowledging its existence or human causes. Although prevalent, agnostic adaptation has yet to be the focus of significant empirical research. Most studies of climate silence and denial examine the absence of action rather than its paradoxical presence. This article, by contrast, explores how action and silence coexist and even serve to reinforce each other. It draws on fieldwork in Staten Island, New York City’s most politically conservative and only predominantly white borough, where residents mobilized after Hurricane Sandy in favor of government buyouts of their damaged homes that would pay them to relocate rather than rebuild in place. The areas that received buyouts have been lauded from afar as exemplary sites of community-led climate adaptation in one of its most radical forms, managed retreat. On the ground, however, those who participated in the push for retreat were largely silent on the topic of climate change, which was not seen as politically enabling or efficacious to discuss. Agnostic adaptation minimized conflict, made for more tractable claims, and maintained relations of power but in so doing offered protection to only a select few. These findings point to the practical effects of climate silence as it exists in relation to climate talk, both of which share omissions, erasures, and forms of agnosticism that narrow the space for transformative action. © 2019, © 2019 by American Association of Geographers.","adaptation; climate change; denial; disaster; environmental politics","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; environmental politics; governance approach; power relations; theoretical study; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; Staten Island [New York]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061641095

These programs address an obtrusive legacy of industrial capitalism: its built environments shed energy and emissions when they fall into disrepair. Political ecology and economy have been slow to engage retrofitting, an absence that is conspicuous as these fields take on planetary repair as a conceptual provocation and turn in mainstream conservation. This paper explores US retrofitting as a distinctive material repair practice, one born as an energy poverty program amid the scarcity fears of the 1970s Energy Crisis but seeing a renaissance today as a program for green capitalist growth. I interrogate two economies of repair now emerging around retrofitting, energy market and cleantech aspirations to make energy efficiency a resource and articulated efforts to sell retrofits as new green value for real estate development and investment. Such urban revaluation efforts join an expanding array of green gentrification schemes today. Paradoxically, even as would-be green entrepreneurs are drawn to these seemingly intangible and “clean” forms of waste and value-in-waiting, retrofitting presents intransigent materialities. Its decarbonization ambitions demand not just profit-generating urban repair today but large-scale urban maintenance into the future. This need confronts longstanding efforts to render US cities and built environments flexible to recurrent creative destruction in service of ongoing economic growth. Such logics of de/revaluation and essential disposability permit concurrent US programs for gentrification and urban abandonment today. However, decarbonization requires a more substantial confrontation with capitalist ruination-as-usual. © The Author(s) 2018.","green gentrification; green growth; planetary repair; political ecology/economy; Retrofitting","capitalism; conceptual framework; energy efficiency; environmental politics; gentrification; growth rate; political economy; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053309842

Two diagnostics are employed: (1) time-resolved in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and (2) spatiotemporally resolved in situ rotational Raman spectroscopy. Experiments are conducted within a pressure range of 1.3–6.7 mbar and a current range of 10–50 mA. In the afterglow, the rate of exponential decay from the asymmetric stretch temperature (T3) to the rotational temperature (Trot) is found to be only dependent on Trot, in the conditions under study. The decay rate rT 3- Trot follows the relation rT 3- Trot = 388 s-1 exp ( T rot 154 - 273 K K ). Pressure and varying concentrations of CO and (presumably) atomic oxygen did not show to be of significant influence. In the active part of the discharge the excitation of T3 showed to be positively related to current and negatively to pressure. However, the contribution of current to vibrational excitation is ambiguous: the conversion of CO2 and therefore the fraction of CO in the discharge, is found to be strongly dependent on the current, with a conversion factor of 0.05–0.18 for 10–50 mA, while CO can contribute to the excitation through near-resonant collisions. A clear relation between the elevation of T3 and the dissociation of CO2 could not be confirmed, though conversion peaks are observed in the near afterglow, which motivate future experiments on vibrational ladder-climbing directly after termination of the discharge. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd","Carbon dioxide plasma; Dissociation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Glow discharge; Raman spectroscopy; Vibrational excitation","Decay (organic); Dissociation; Excited states; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Glow discharges; Raman spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide plasma; Conversion factor; Current range; Exponential decays; Pressure ranges; Pulsed glow discharge; Rotational temperature; Vibrational excitation; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066263209

These rivers’ existence is a challenge to models of planetary climate evolution. We report results indicating that, for a given catchment area, rivers on Mars were wider than rivers on Earth today. We use the scale (width and wavelength) of Mars paleo-rivers as a proxy for past runoff production. Using multiple methods, we infer that intense runoff production of &gt;(3–20) kg/m 2 per day persisted until &lt;3 billion years (Ga) ago and probably &lt;1 Ga ago, and was globally distributed. Therefore, the intense runoff production inferred from the results of the Mars Science Laboratory rover was not a short-lived or local anomaly. Rather, precipitation-fed runoff production was globally distributed, was intense, and persisted intermittently over &gt;1 Ga. Our improved history of Mars’ river runoff places new constraints on the unknown mechanism that caused wet climates on Mars.

Demographic compensation among life-history stages has the potential to buffer populations from decline, but alternatively, compounding negative effects can lead to accelerated population decline and extinction. In montane ecosystems of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, increasing temperatures are resulting in a transition from snow-dominated to rain-dominated precipitation events, reducing snowpack. For ectotherms such as amphibians, warmer winters can reduce the frequency of critical minimum temperatures and increase the length of summer growing seasons, benefiting post-metamorphic stages, but may also increase metabolic costs during winter months, which could decrease survival. Lower snowpack levels also result in wetlands that dry sooner or more frequently in the summer, increasing larval desiccation risk. To evaluate how these challenges and opportunities compound within a species’ life history, we collected demographic data on Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) in Olympic National Park in Washington state to parameterize stage-based stochastic matrix population models under current and future (A1B, 2040s, and 2080s) environmental conditions. We estimated the proportion of reproductive effort lost each year due to drying using watershed-specific hydrologic models, and coupled this with an analysis that relates 15 yr of R. cascadae abundance data with a suite of climate variables. We estimated the current population growth (λs) to be 0.97 (95% CI 0.84–1.13), but predict that λs will decline under continued climate warming, resulting in a 62% chance of extinction by the 2080s because of compounding negative effects on early and late life history stages. By the 2080s, our models predict that larval mortality will increase by 17% as a result of increased pond drying, and adult survival will decrease by 7% as winter length and summer precipitation continue to decrease. We find that reduced larval survival drives initial declines in the 2040s, but further declines in the 2080s are compounded by decreases in adult survival. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for compounding or compensatory effects within different life history stages to exacerbate or buffer the effects of climate change on population growth rates through time. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","amphibians; climate change; extinction risk; hydrology; montane ecosystems; population modeling","amphibian; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; extinction risk; frog; hydrology; life history; mountain environment; mountain region; population decline; population growth; population modeling; population viability analysis; reproductive effort; snowpack; survival; temperature; Olympic National Park; Pacific Northwest; United States; Washington [United States]; Amphibia; Rana cascadae; snow; animal; climate change; ecosystem; season; Washington; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Seasons; Snow; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062276981

The balance between the water available from the source catchments and the demand of the cities has become precarious during recent years because of an increasing population and the runoff variability caused by climate change. In this study, a first-order estimate of the future water supply and demand for the El Alto system, the most rapidly growing area in La Paz and El Alto, was obtained for the first time based on a demographic analysis and runoff projection, and effective measures for adapting to water shortage were examined. The water demand in 2036 is expected to increase by 15–53% compared to that of 2011, depending on the scenario for the water loss in the supply system and population estimates, while the projected water supply shows frequent reductions because of the climate variability and decreasing glacial meltwater. Thus, the water transfer from a neighboring system (the Achachicala system) will be indispensable to sustain the supply that cannot be covered by releases from Tuni Lake. Nevertheless, the El Alto system will likely face a serious water shortage after the mid-2020s for the most conservative scenario of demand increase, while large uncertainty was found for the balance of supply and demand, depending on the scenarios for population growth, improvement of water loss, and climate variability and trend. For supply side management, the extended diversion of runoff into Tuni Lake, water transfer from the Achachicala system, and transfer of runoff from the Taypichaca catchment will be effective in securing the water supply under various uncertain conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Andes; Climate change; La Paz and El Alto; Population growth; Water scarcity; Water supply and demand","climate change; mountain region; population growth; security; water demand; water management; water resource; water supply; Andes; Bolivia; El Alto; La Paz [Bolivia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062539372

Few studies, however, have investigated how the media portrays climate change impacts on human health. This review, therefore, presents a quantitative spatiotemporal analysis of Canadian newspaper coverage of climate change impacts on health between 2005 and 2015. Using the ProQuest® and Eureka® databases, a multiphase systematic review strategy was employed to identify relevant English and French articles from two national and six regional high-circulation newspapers. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from 145 articles and analyzed to characterize the range, extent, and nature of climate-health newspaper coverage in Canada and to compare these characteristics by region and over time. Coverage varied by region, with the highest proportion of climate-health coverage in Northern Territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut). Over time, there was a decreasing publication frequency trend. Almost all articles described negative climate change impacts on health, with a predominant focus on infectious and chronic noninfectious diseases; however, less than half of the articles discussed climate change solutions. These trends suggest that current media coverage might not drive widespread public support for policies and actions needed to protect against projected climate-health risks. Consequently, as climate change continues to challenge human health, increasing media emphasis on climate change impacts on human health, as well as a shift toward enabling and empowering climate change communication, in which viable mitigation and adaptation options are emphasized, could help to spur action to reduce climate change health risks. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Digital storage; Health; Health risks; Newsprint; Public risks; Climate change impact; Media coverage; Newspaper review; Northern territories; Public support; Qualitative data; Spatiotemporal analysis; Systematic Review; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; health impact; literature review; media role; public health; trend analysis; Canada; Nunavut; Yukon Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060340452

Here, we investigate the effects of the GHG threshold under the RFS on projected GHG savings from two corn stover-based biofuel supply chain systems in the United States Midwest. The analysis is based on a techno-economic framework that minimizes ethanol selling price. The GHG threshold lowers the lifecycle GHG of ethanol: 34.39 ± 4.92 gCO2 MJ-1 in the RFS-compliant system and 46.30 ± 10.05 gCO2 MJ-1 in the non RFS-compliant system. However, hypothetical biorefinery systems complying with the RFS will not process the more GHG-intensive corn stover, and thus much less biofuel will be produced compared to the non RFS-compliant system. Thus, taken as a whole, the non RFS-compliant system would achieve more GHG savings than an RFS-compliant system: 10.7 TgCO2 year-1 in the non RFS-compliant system compared with 4.4 TgCO2 year-1 in the RFS-compliant system. These results suggest that the current RFS GHG reduction threshold may not be the most efficient way to carry out the purposes of the Energy Security and Independence Act in the corn stover-based biofuel system: relaxing the threshold could actually increase the overall GHG savings from corn stover-based biofuels. Therefore, the LCFS-type regulatory approach is recommended for the corn stover-based cellulosic biofuel system under the RFS program. In addition, our calculation of the GHG balance for stover-based biofuel accounts for SOC losses, while the current RFS estimates do not include effects on SOC. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Cellulosic ethanol; Energy security; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Biofuel supply chains; Cellulosic biofuels; GHG reductions; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Low carbon fuels; Renewable fuels; Selling prices; Techno-economics; Biofuels; alcohol; biofuel; carbon; cellulose; alternative fuel; biofuel; cellulose; crop residue; emission control; greenhouse gas; regulatory approach; savings; act; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost; energy; greenhouse gas; renewable energy; standard; United States; California; greenhouse effect; maize; California; Midwest; United States; Zea mays; Biofuels; California; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062373180

Despite recent declines, PTB rates remain high in the United States. Growing research suggests a possible relationship between a mother's exposure to common air pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and PTB of her baby. Many policy actions to reduce exposure to common air pollutants require benefit-cost analysis (BCA), and it's possible that PTB will need to be included in BCA in the future. However, an estimate of the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid PTB risk is not available, and a comprehensive alternative valuation of the health benefits of reducing pollutant-related PTB currently does not exist. This paper demonstrates an approach to assess potential economic benefits of reducing PTB resulting from environmental exposures when an estimate of WTP to avoid PTB risk is unavailable. We utilized a recent meta-analysis, county-level air quality data and county-level PTB prevalence data to estimate the potential health and economic benefits of a reduction in air pollution-related PTB, with PM2.5 as our case study pollutant. Using this method, a simulated nationwide 10% decrease from 2008 PM2.5 levels resulted in an estimated reduction of 5016 PTBs and benefits of at least $339 million, potentially reaching over one billion dollars when considering later-life effects of PTB. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Benefits; PM2.5; Preterm birth","birth rate; disease prevalence; economic analysis; health risk; infant mortality; maternal health; morbidity; particle size; particulate matter; pollution exposure; research work; willingness to pay; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; asthma; concentration (parameters); diabetes mellitus; economic evaluation; environmental exposure; female; female fertility; human; maternal exposure; particle size; particulate matter; population; premature labor; prevalence; priority journal; air pollutant; economics; maternal exposure; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; prevention and control; United States; NTN Nation; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058676640

Recently, SULEV and EURO-6 emission standard were applied to the gasoline and diesel vehicles in Korea, respectively. Therefore, emission characteristics on passenger car using gasoline including HEV and diesel fuel according to the various test modes were conducted in this study. In order to this investigation, exhaust emission characteristics of gasoline and diesel vehicles were measured and analyzed by using chassis dynamometer (Chassis dynamometer 48?compact 2WD, AVL) and emission analyzer (MEXA-7000 series, Horiba). Test vehicles were selected the 3 domestic models of a car in Korea. For analysis on emission characteristics according to driving cycles including certification mode, NEDC, FTP-75 and WLTP modes was applied. From these results, it can be shown that all test vehicle models meet the emission standard. In the diesel vehicles, NOx emission in FTP-75 and WLTP mode dramatically increased compared to NEDC mode. CO2 emission of gasoline vehicles have higher level than that of diesel vehicles. Also, CO2 emissions shows large value that of WLTP, FTP-75 and NEDC in order. © 2019 SAE International.

The information field acts in the form of indistinguishable quanta of “social energy” analogue to photons. The massive flow of information acts as a laser pump. In this framework, an information selection process by agents under constant pressure of massive repeated information leads to collective “resonance” effects in analogy with laser cavity and stimulated emission. In order to make operational parallels between physical lasers and the information laser we identify the essential features of laser operation.

Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowner participation is crucial for increasing carbon stocks in the southern United States forests. Carbon sequestration is a relatively new practice, so NIPF landowners are expected to have varied adoption responses depending on their different internal (socioeconomic, financial, and forest structure factors) and external (environmental, governmental policy, and market factors) environments. This study identified major obstacles for NIPF participation in carbon sequestration and grouped landowners into adoption categories with respect to carbon sequestration using the diffusion of innovations model. Principal component analysis was used to identify five major obstacles to participation in carbon sequestration programs: revenue implications, forest characteristics, owner preferences, normative reasons, and understanding. NIPF landowners were grouped into three adoption categories: adopters (18%), majority (60%) and laggards (22%). The adopters, compared to the other categories, were richer, more educated, relatively younger, and owned larger landholdings. These results provide a valuable insight about the adoption behavior of NIPF landowners with respect to climate change mitigation programs in the southern United States. Program planners and outreach professionals should consider these NIPF landowner adoption categories and the role of peer landowners in promoting new programs and policies for developing effective mitigation strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Cluster analysis; Diffusion of innovations; Nonindustrial private forest; Principal component analysis","Carbon capture; Climate change; Cluster analysis; Diffusion; Economics; Principal component analysis; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Diffusion of innovations; Forest carbon sequestration; Governmental policies; Mitigation strategy; Nonindustrial private forest landowners; Nonindustrial private forests; Forestry; Carbon; Chelation; Computer Programs; Diffusion; Economics; Forestry; Forests; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057778833

This area has become one of the main focuses for a wide range of scientific communities, and a large number of articles have been published that reported GHG emissions from the electricity sector using different approaches. Even though some review articles have been published on particular GHG emissions approaches, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), studies that investigated overall approaches are much rarer. A scoping review of these GHG emissions accounting approaches has thus been conducted in this study to explore their limitations and indicate possible future scope. From the review, it was found that the majority of the studies considered the LCA approach to investigate GHG emissions from electricity systems. Although the time-varying carbon intensity approach has potential features, it has received less attention. Furthermore, this review has highlighted some issues that need to be addressed by any new or existing approach that would deal with GHG emissions accounting in the near future.

Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) have energy intensive operations that consume a lot of electricity as compared to other municipality buildings. WWTPs emits high greenhouse gases (GHG) such as methane, carbon dioxide (CO2), which are very harmful to both human and environment. Among other GHG emitted, methane is the most harmful gas on both human and environment, it is highly flammable, but it is a good source of energy. Consequently, to reduce conventional energy consumption and GHG emissions, WWTPs can be used to generate electricity from its harmful biogas wastes (methane) in order to complement their energy consumption. This project, therefore, proposes to design a co-generation plant known as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. This will generate heat (Thermal energy) and clean renewable power (electrical energy) using biogas (methane) from WWTPs. The heat generated will be used in the treatment processes, while the electricity will complement energy consumption of the plant, thereby reducing the operation cost and GHG emission. It is expected that the electricity consumption of the WWTPs will be reduced by 25-40% of the total energy consumption.

Several approaches have been used to reduce Typha dominance and restore invaded wetlands, but long-term studies assessing benefits of these restoration efforts are limited. A previous study demonstrated that aboveground harvesting of Typha × glauca stems and litter reduced Typha dominance 2 years post-treatment in a Great Lakes coastal wetland. In the current study, we extended monitoring of experimental aboveground Typha harvest to 4 years post-treatment and added assessments of treatment effects on soil nutrients, carbon emissions, and microbial community composition. Aboveground harvest treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in Typha litter cover that persisted for 4 years, increased soil temperature, and increased abundance of the native plant genus Carex. However, aboveground harvest treatment did not significantly reduce Typha abundance, nor did it have significant effects on soil nutrient concentrations, carbon fluxes, or the taxonomic composition of soil microbial communities. We did observe differences in bacterial community composition between plots based on time since Typha invasion, which may indicate some legacy effects of Typha invasion. At the scale of this experiment (4 × 4 m plots), our results indicate that a single aboveground removal of Typha × glauca is not sufficient to restore a heavily invaded freshwater wetland ecosystem, and that periodic harvesting of Typha stems and litter may be required to maintain native plant abundance. © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration","bacteria; community; invasive species; restoration; Typha × glauca; wetland","bacterium; community composition; community dynamics; experimental study; harvesting; invasive species; restoration ecology; wetland; Bacteria (microorganisms); Carex; Typha; Typha glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052644640

Tanzania is currently developing the capacity to enter into a carbon monitoring REDD+ regime. In this context spatially representative soil carbon datasets and accurate predictive maps are important for determining the soil organic carbon pool. The main objective of this study was to model and map the SOC stock for the 0–30-cm soil layer to provide baseline information for REDD+ purposes. Topsoil data of over 1400 locations spread throughout Tanzania from the National Forest Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA), were used, supplemented by two legacy datasets, to calibrate simple kriging with varying local means models. Maps of SOC concentrations (g kg−1) were generated for the 0–10-cm, 10–20-cm, 20–30-cm, 0–30-cm layers, and maps of bulk density and SOC stock (kg m−2) for the 0–30-cm layer. Two approaches for modelling SOC stocks were considered here: the calculate-then-model (CTM) approach and the model-then-calculate approach (MTC). The spatial predictions were validated by means of 10-fold cross-validation. Uncertainty associated to the estimated SOC stocks was quantified through conditional Gaussian simulation. Estimates of SOC stocks for the main land cover classes are provided. Environmental covariates related to soil and terrain proved to be the strongest predictors for all properties modelled. The mean predicted SOC stock for the 0–30-cm layer was 4.1 kg m−2 (CTM approach) translating to a total national stock of 3.6 Pg. The MTC approach gave similar results. The largest stocks are found in forest and grassland ecosystems, while woodlands and bushlands contain two thirds of the total SOC stock. The root mean squared error for the 0–30-cm layer was 1.8 kg m−2, and the R2-value was 0.51. The R2-value of SOC concentration for the 0–30-cm layer was 0.60 and that of bulk density 0.56. The R2-values of the predicted SOC concentrations for the 10-cm layers vary between 0.46 and 0.54. The 95% confidence interval of the predicted average SOC stock is 4.01–4.15 kg m−2, and that of the national total SOC stock 3.54–3.65 Pg. Uncertainty associated with SOC concentration had the largest contribution to SOC stock uncertainty. These findings have relevance for the ongoing REDD+ readiness process in Tanzania by supplementing the previous knowledge of significant carbon pools. The soil organic carbon pool makes up a relatively large proportion of carbon in Tanzania and is therefore an important carbon pool to consider alongside the ones related to the woody biomass. Going forward, the soil organic carbon data can potentially be used in the determination of reference emission levels and the future monitoring, reporting and verification of organic carbon pools. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bulk density; Geostatistics; SOC stock; Soil organic carbon; Spatial prediction; Uncertainty","Deforestation; Ecosystems; Lakes; Mean square error; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Bulk density; Geo-statistics; Soil organic carbon; Spatial prediction; Uncertainty; Organic carbon; bulk density; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); geostatistics; mapping method; organic carbon; prediction; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; topsoil; uncertainty analysis; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053431983

Targeting mitigation measures based on mapping of cultivated organic soils would reduce these emissions and increase sustainability of agriculture. Different georeferenced datasets were combined to study the area trend and describe current agricultural use of organic soils. The area was also mapped regionally into classes based on intensity of cultivation and organic layer depth, and an example allocation of potential mitigation measures was made at the country scale. The area and proportion of cultivated organic soils have increased in Finland since 1990 but the clearance rate has decreased in recent years. More than half of the area retains a peat layer deeper than 0.6 m indicating long-lasting mitigation potential with measures capable of slowing peat decomposition. Sixty-five percent of the cultivated organic soil area was not considered a priority area for radical management changes, for various reasons, but there are 85,000 ha of field with more realistic potential for GHG mitigation. The mapping method was found to be a practical tool for depicting the GHG mitigation potential of cultivated organic soils. Significant reductions in agricultural GHG emissions can be expected with implementation of the suggested mitigation measures. © 2019, © 2019 Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke).

The information system includes environmental and economic data, linkages between land use activities, their co-benefits, inputs to the economy and benefits for human well-being. Forest management was used as an example of application of the accounting framework because it has the greatest climate change mitigation potential of all land use activities. A case study developing carbon accounts for a forest region in south-eastern Australia demonstrated the mitigation benefits of long-term carbon storage and sequestration in native forests. Using environmental-economic accounts helped identify policy and market instruments required to value ecosystem services of carbon storage and sequestration by applying a potential market price for carbon. We identified benefits of native forest protection as a carbon abatement activity, and compared this value to that of current forest management for timber harvesting that reduces carbon stocks. Both land uses provided similar economic contributions (approximately $12 million yr −1 , using a minimal carbon price), but native forest protection has additional co-benefits of improving water yield, tourism, recreation and biodiversity conservation. The accounts determine values of land use activities in physical and monetary metrics, and link these to beneficiaries of ecosystem services, so that maximum benefits for public good are identified. Quantifying ecosystem services of carbon storage (protecting stocks) and sequestration (increasing flows) in a native forest region, by applying a potential market price, broadens the policy options for mitigation activities. Adopting a comprehensive accounting system, and changing some of the definitions and rules under the Paris Agreement and national emissions reduction policies and markets, would allow the mitigation benefit of protecting native forests to be realised. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon accounting; Carbon storage and sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Environmental-economic accounting; Forest management","accounting; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; combustion; comparative study; conservation biology; decomposition; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental protection; forest management; harvesting; land use; logging; plantation; priority journal; recreation; tourism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056574818

Inappropriate cultivation practices (i.e. excessive tillage and application of herbicides, the absence of organic amendments, the burning of pruning residues in situ) lead, in combination with the Mediterranean climate, to the depletion of soil organic matter, erosion, desertification and degradation of water resources. Strategies based on changes in the land management (e.g. cover crops and green manure, restriction of tillage, recycling of agricultural wastes and pruning residues), have been reported to enhance soil structure, increase soil fertility, decrease soil erosion, increase the C stored in soil, and reduce atmospheric CO2. This chapter highlights soil management techniques that could promote the conservation of the productive olive grove system and thus contribute to the sustainability of the natural resources. During olive tree growth and olive oil production a large quantity of plant residues and mill wastes are produced. The implementation of alternative olive cultivation techniques (reduced/no tillage, plant residue and weed management, tree pruning, etc.) has not been systematically tested under the prevailing conditions of the Mediterranean olive forest. Although there are multiple specific studies taking into account specific practices in selected regions, a holistic approach for the Mediterranean olive groves has not yet been known. The design, the development and the adoption of an integrated soil management system in olive groves, adjustable to local soil climatic conditions is proposed, among further research priorities. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Cover crops; Olive; Residue management; Soil management; Tillage",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072179698

Our stellar wind models incorporate surface stellar magnetic field maps at the epochs 2013 June/July, 2014 September, and 2015 July as boundary conditions. We find that the mass-loss rate, angular momentum loss rate, and open magnetic flux of HD189733 vary by 9 per cent, 40 per cent, and 19 per cent over these three epochs. Solving the equations of radiative transfer, we find that from 10 MHz-100 GHz the stellar wind emits fluxes in the range of 10 -3 -5 μJy, and becomes optically thin above 10 GHz. Our planetary radio emission model uses the radiometric Bode's law, and neglects the presence of a planetary atmosphere. For assumed planetary magnetic fields of 1-10 G, we estimate that the planet emits at frequencies of 2-25 MHz, with peak flux densities of 102 mJy. We find that the planet orbits through regions of the stellar wind that are optically thick to the emitted frequency from the planet. As a result, unattenuated planetary radio emission can only propagate out of the system and reach the observer for 67 per cent of the orbit for a 10 G planetary field, corresponding to when the planet is approaching and leaving primary transit. We also find that the plasma frequency of the stellar wind is too high to allow propagation of the planetary radio emission below 21 MHz. This means a planetary field of at least 8 G is required to produce detectable radio emission. © 2019 The Author(s).","MHD-stars: Individual (HD189733)-stars: Low-mass-stars: Planetary systems; outflows; stars: Winds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064112096

The microorganisms were isolated from soil, and their adhesion behavior on hydroxyapatite (HA), carbon-coated HA (Carbon), poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC), and polyurethane (PU) pellets was investigated. The total metabolic activity on and adherence of microorganisms to the tested materials were in the following order: HA > Carbon > PVC > PU. This order was consistent with the extent of hydrophilicity of the materials. Morphological examination and polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of microorganisms adhered to the materials revealed that the activities and states of microorganisms were affected by the composition of the pellets.

Moreover, an economic evaluation was also addressed using life cycle cost (LCC) approach. Emissions associated with electricity production for operating the WWTPs, emissions from the treated effluent and hazardous heavy metals emissions have been identified as the main contributors to the overall environmental impact. Among the WWTPs considered, soil biotechnology (SBT) obtained the lowest environmental impact in all the evaluated impact categories, except for eutrophication potential. While the aerated lagoons (AL) system presented the worst results due to the high electricity and chemicals consumption. Moreover, the results obtained from the evaluation of benefit from treated effluent reuse clearly indicate that there is a drop in the toxicity potential when the rate of effluent reuse is increased. On the other hand, the present worth of SBT was estimated to be Rs. 40 million/millions of litres per day (MLD) which is the highest as compared to other technologies. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is the second highest (Rs. 24.7 million/MLD), which is mainly contributed by civil, electro-mechanical and membrane cost.

High exposure levels may result in various adverse health outcomes. Laboratories, which are indoor environments carefully designed for specific purposes, may contain high levels of bioaerosols, which may threaten worker’s health, and contaminate experimental results. This study investigated the levels of bioaerosols (i.e., culturable fungi and bacteria, and fungal spores) in laboratories in the Bangkok metropolitan area. Air samples were collected from 14 Class I and one Class II laboratories by using a single-stage impactor and a VersaTrap spore trap cassette. Colonies were counted after 72 h and 48 h of incubation for culturable fungi and bacteria, respectively. Culturable fungi and fungal spores were identified based on their morphological characteristics. Associations between bioaerosols and indoor air parameters and laboratory characteristics were evaluated. The concentrations (mean ± SD) of culturable bacteria, culturable fungi, and fungal spores were 87.0 ± 97.8 CFU/m3, 294.9 ± 376.1 CFU/m3, and 771.8 ± 545.3 spores/m3, respectively. Aspergillus/Penicillium, ascospores, and Cladosporium were common fungal spore taxa in the laboratories. Culturable fungi significantly increased with the number of staff and visible molds, whereas water leaks and culturable fungi significantly increased fungal spore concentrations. Culturable bacteria were positively associated with the numbers of trash bins and − 80 °C freezers. Although bioaerosol concentrations were considerably lower in the studied laboratories, proper indoor air management is still suggested in order to reduce emissions and exposure. This can help workers avoid adverse health outcomes and reduce the chance of experimental contamination. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Bacteria; Bioaerosols; Fungal spore; Fungi; Indoor air quality; Laboratory","water; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; ascospore; Aspergillus; bacterium; bacterium culture; bioaerosol; Cladosporium; clinical laboratory; colony forming unit; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cross-sectional study; fungus; fungus culture; fungus identification; fungus spore; mold; nonhuman; Penicillium; priority journal; Thailand; worker",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053448833

In the paper conceptual system, that consists of allothermal wood gasifier, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), internal combustion piston engine (ICE) and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for waste heat recovery, is proposed. Configuration of such systems is nowadays possible due to availability individual small-scale energy conversion technologies that can be integrated into complex structures. In the studied case the anode exhaust gas of the syngas fired SOFC module, that still contains combustible gases, is considered a secondary fuel for a bottoming ICE. The ORC cycle module is driven by the heat recovered from process gas coolers as well as from SOFC cathode and ICE exhaust gases. The system has been theoretically evaluated in terms of energy conversion efficiency and profitability using thermodynamic and economic analysis. Relevant robust mathematical models of key components have been developed. Through the modelling the most important performance parameters are addressed. Electric power of the sample system is below 1 MW what makes it suitable for utilisation of locally available biomass. Simulations revealed potentially high value of the net biomass energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 37%–40% depending on the ORC cycle configuration. Financial analysis revealed positive values of profitability indices at current level of market prices. The results are compared with a real biomass-fired ORC cogeneration project. The system also addresses issues related to external effects of the project, such as global emission reduction and primary energy savings. © 2019","Biomass; Combined cycles; Fuel cells; Gasification; Internal combustion engines; ORC","Biomass; Cogeneration plants; Conversion efficiency; Economic analysis; Electrodes; Emission control; Energy conservation; Exhaust gases; Fuel cells; Gasification; Ice; Internal combustion engines; Molecular biology; Profitability; Rankine cycle; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Waste incineration; Biomass Gasification; Combined cycle; Energy conversion technologies; Internal combustion; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Performance parameters; Primary energy savings; Technological solution; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); biomass; biotechnology; cogeneration; conceptual framework; engine; exhaust emission; fuel cell; numerical model; operations technology; power plant; solid; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061432801

In June 2015, Hawaii became the first state in the United States to adopt a 100% RPS. Through understanding the conditions that gave rise to Hawaii’s RPS, policy actors will be better informed as they navigate policy processes in other states and jurisdictions. This study uses Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) to explore the policy process that led to Hawaii’s 100% RPS.

In order to reduce the ecological impact of the data center Greenhouse Gas (GhG) emissions, this paper addresses the problem as a whole, by proposing a global mathematical formulation, based on the joint optimization of the Virtual Machine (VM) placement and their related traffics, along with a workload consolidation method and a cooling maximization technique that considers the dynamic behavior of the cooling fans. As the Virtual Machine Placement Problem (VMPP) is classified as an NP-hard problem, with the addition of the traffic embedding, the problem becomes more complex and stays NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a hybrid approach, for solving such problem and find good feasible solutions in a polynomial time. The results obtained from comparing with the exact method and other reference approaches help in assessing the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, as the carbon footprint costs are relatively close to the lower bound, with an average gap of about 3 percent, and found within a reasonable amount of time. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Carbon footprint; cloud computing; hybrid heuristics; iterated local search; optimization; tabu search","Cloud computing; Computational complexity; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Network security; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Problem solving; Tabu search; Virtual addresses; Virtual machine; Computing environments; Ecological impacts; Hybrid heuristics; Iterated local search; Joint optimization; Mathematical formulation; Virtual machine placements; Workload consolidation; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064248183

Although soil microbiota facilitate organic P turnover and inorganic P mobilization, their role in carbon-phosphorus coupled processes remains poorly understood. To advance this topic, soils collected from four sites representing highly weathered tropical soils in the El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico were incubated with exogenous PO4 3− under controlled laboratory conditions. P amendment increased CO2 respiration by 14–23% relative to control incubations for soils sampled from all but the site with the greatest total and bioavailable soil P. Metatranscriptomics revealed an increase in the relative transcription of genes involved in cell growth and uptake of other nutrients in response to P amendment. A new methodology to normalize gene expression by population-level relative (DNA) abundance revealed that the pattern of increased transcription of cell growth and division genes with P amendment was community-wide. Soil communities responsive to P amendment possessed a greater relative abundance of α-glucosyl polysaccharide biosynthesis genes, suggestive of enhanced C storage under P-limiting conditions. Phosphorylase genes governing the degradation of α-glucosyl polysaccharides were also more abundant and increased in relative transcription with P amendment, indicating a shift from energy storage towards growth. Conversely, microbial communities in soils nonresponsive to P amendment were found to have metabolisms tuned for the phosphorolysis of labile plant-derived substrates, such as β-glucosyl polysaccharides. Collectively, our results provided quantitative estimates of increased soil respiration upon alleviation of P constraints and elucidated several underlying ecological and molecular mechanisms involved in this response. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Enzyme activities; Metagenomics; Metatranscriptomics; Microbial ecology; Phosphorus limitation; Soil respiration; Tropical ecosystem","Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Cell growth; Ecosystems; Enzyme activity; Forestry; Growth kinetics; Phosphorus; Polysaccharides; Population statistics; Transcription; Tropics; Metagenomics; Metatranscriptomics; Microbial ecology; Phosphorus limitation; Soil respiration; Tropical ecosystems; Soils; enzyme activity; forest soil; genomics; microbial ecology; nutrient limitation; phosphate; population growth; soil respiration; tropical environment; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057754335

The formulation of the carbon emission right allocation scheme is important for policy-makers. Many researchers have studied the problem of carbon emission right allocation by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. However, the existing literature using traditional models consider each Decision-Making Unit (DMU) as a ""black box"" without taking the internal structure into account, but in fact, it is more accurate for formulating the scheme when considering the inner operation of DMUs. This paper investigates the allocation plan of carbon emission right among each province in China from 2007-2016 based on a two-stage DEA model. The results indicate that, first, there is no space for carbon emission in the north, northeast, and northwest from 2007-2016, while in the southern regions, it always exists. In addition, the carbon emission permits of the southern and eastern regions are increasing, but in the southwestern regions, the carbon emission space barely fluctuated during this decade. Second, the potential of carbon emission reduction of each region tends to be stable after 2014, and in the north and northwest, it fluctuated greatly from 2007-2016. Besides, the northwest region has had the potential of emission reduction since 2010, while it also exists in the northern region after 2014. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission allocation; Data envelopment analysis; Two-stage network","carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; decision making; emission control; environmental planning; literature review; network analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062832636

The results indicate that, spatially, maximum C 4 abundance during the LGM was in South China; while maximum C 4 abundance occurred in the Chinese Loess Plateau in North China during the early and mid-Holocene. Temporally, in North China, C 4 plant abundance initially increased since the LGM, reached a maximum during the early and mid-Holocene and then decreased; however, the opposite trend occurred in South China. Combined with a physiological-process model used to study the sensitivity of C 3 and C 4 plants to changes in climate and atmospheric pCO 2 in different regions, our results reveal that temperature was the dominant factor driving C 4 plant expansion in North China, whereas atmospheric pCO 2 and precipitation were the main factors controlling C 4 plant abundance in South China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric pCO 2; BIOME4; Carbon isotopes; Holocene; Temperature","abundance; biome; C4 plant; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; climate change; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; paleosol; precipitation (climatology); soil organic matter; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059823087

This paper investigates the effects of pelelith (P) combined with dicyandiamide (DCD) on gaseous emissions and the fungal community diversity during sewage sludge (SS) composting. Results showed that the P and P + DCD treatments decreased the cumulative gaseous emissions by 41% and 22% for NH3, 21% and 34% for N2O, and 31.5% and 33.0% for CH4, respectively. The evolution of the fungal community analysis showed that Ascomycota and unclassified fungi dominated during the thermophilic stage, while only Ascomycota was the dominant fungal phylum during the maturity stage, composing 62%, 66%, and 73% of the total fungal community in the control, P, and P + DCD, respectively. The P and P + DCD significantly increased the fungal community richness at the genus level. Fungal community abundance was found to be significantly related to temperature, pH, organic matter, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen, which also influence the gaseous emissions during SS composting. It suggested that the combined addition of pelelith and dicyandiamide (DCD) was an effective method for reducing the emissions of NH3 and greenhouse gases during SS composting. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Composting; Dicyandiamide; Fungal community; Greenhouse gases; NH3; Pelelith","abundance; ammonia; chemical compound; compost; composting; fungus; greenhouse gas; sludge; species diversity; species richness; temperature effect; Ascomycota; unclassified Fungi; coordination compound; dicyandiamido; guanidine derivative; nitrogen; analysis; chemistry; composting; greenhouse gas; microbiology; mycobiome; pollution; prevention and control; sewage; temperature; Composting; Coordination Complexes; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Gases; Guanidines; Mycobiome; Nitrogen; Sewage; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061184457

This new global climate deal responds to a more fragmented and multipolar world signified by the rise of major economies in the South. This paper examines the geopolitical landscape in which the Paris Agreement is enacted and implemented. We conduct a discursive analysis of the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by parties to the Paris Agreement. We ask what policy discourses emerge in these national climate plans, which states cluster around them and how they compare to UNFCCC annex, geographical location, income group, and negotiation coalitions. Our findings suggest that liberal environmentalism retains a strong hold over the political imagination in the post-Paris landscape. However, we see points of diffraction and tensions that might give rise to conflict. While liberal environmentalism is only challenged in Nationally Determined Contributions from the global South, we conclude that conventional geopolitical patterns only partly explain the formation of discourse coalitions. In the Paris Agreement's implementation stage discursive struggles are likely to become increasingly prominent.

To address the future population increase, local governments develop new planning scenarios to increase the density in certain areas that can accommodate the growth. However, the potential threat to human health and pedestrian comfort will be exacerbated, if planning professionals exclude climatic conscious urban design in their practices. Increasing numbers of the hot days and frequent occurrence of heatwave events cause a serious threat to human life. This study investigates the effect of the future structural plans on pedestrian thermal comfort through numerical simulation using City North, Melbourne as a case study. The effect of street design towards the development of a comfortable microclimate at street level for pedestrians is investigated. To provide knowledge readily interpretable from the planning perspective, the existing and future scenarios for different street profiles are modelled and the consequences of microclimatic parameters and thermal comfort are assessed. A three-dimensional numerical modelling system, ENVI-met was used for the simulation. A clear reduction of average daytime temperature (T), mean radiant temperature (MRT) and Physiological Equivalent Temperatures (PET) were observed across the study area after implementing the ‘Plan Melbourne’ strategies. The outcomes of this study will assist urban planners in developing policies which can effectively decrease the vulnerability to the heat stress at the pedestrian level. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ENVI-met; pedestrian thermal comfort; shading; street design; Urban planning","Health risks; Numerical models; Population statistics; Thermal comfort; ENVI-met; Mean radiant temperature; Number of peoples; Pedestrian comfort; Physiological equivalent temperatures; Potential threats; shading; Street design; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057556672

Despite the promise of improved cookstoves to reduce these impacts, adoption rates are relatively low. Using a 2-wave sample of 144 households from the baseline and first midline of an ongoing 4-year randomized controlled trial in Rwanda, we analyze the drivers and associations of early adoption of a household energy intervention marketed by a private sector firm. Households sign an annual contract to purchase sustainably produced biomass pellets and lease a fan micro-gasification cookstove with verified emissions reductions in laboratory settings. Using difference-in-differences and fixed effects estimation techniques, we examine the association between take-up of the improved cooking system and household fuel expenditures, health outcomes, and time use for primary cooks. Thirty percent of households adopted the pellet and improved cookstove system. Adopting households had more assets, lower per capita total expenditures and cooking fuel expenditures, and higher per capita hygiene expenditures. Households with married household heads and female cooks were significantly more likely to adopt. Adjusting for confounders, we find significant reduction in primary cooks’ systolic blood pressure, self-reported prevalence of shortness of breath, an indicator of respiratory illness, time spent cooking, and household expenditures on charcoal. Our findings have implications for marketing of future clean fuel and improved cookstove programs in urban settings or where stoves and fuel are purchased.

Mazandaran province has 378,000 ha of rangelands with high plant species richness and diversity due to its climate conditions but plants distribution is at risk because of non-principle management, land use change and as a result changing environmental factors. Vegetation management strategies can be guided by models that predict plant species distribution based on governing environmental variables. This is especially useful for the dominant species that determine ecosystem processes. In fact, modelling algorithm in each SDM determines its suitability for different ecosystems. Our aim was to compare the predictive power of a number of SDMs and to evaluate the importance of a range of environmental variables as predictors in the context of semi-arid rangeland vegetation. The selected study area, the Sarkhas rangelands (northern Iran, 36°10′ 42˝ N - 51°19′ 11˝ E), covers approximately 4358.9 ha of Mazandaran province.

The Planck data releases have provided the community with submillimetre and full-sky radio observations at unprecedented resolutions. We make use of the Planck 353, 545, and 857 GHz maps alongside the IRAS 3000 GHz map. These maps contain information on the cosmic microwave background (CMB), cosmic infrared background (CIB), extragalactic point sources, and diffuse thermal dust emission. Aims. We aim to determine the modified black-body (MBB) model parameters of thermal dust emission in total intensity and produce all-sky maps of pure thermal dust, having separated this Galactic component from the CMB and CIB. Methods. This separation is completed using a new, sparsity-based, parametric method, Parameter Recovery Exploiting Model Informed Sparse Estimates (premise). The method is comprised of three main stages: 1) filtering the raw data to reduce the effect of the CIB on the MBB fit; 2) fitting an MBB model to the filtered data across super-pixels of various sizes determined by the algorithm itself; and 3) refining these super-pixel estimates into full-resolution maps of the MBB parameters. Results. We present our maps of MBB temperature, spectral index, and optical depth at 5 arcmin resolution and compare our estimates to those of GNILC and to the two-step MBB fit presented by the Planck Collaboration in 2013. Conclusions. By exploiting sparsity we avoid the need for smoothing, enabling us to produce the first full-resolution MBB parameter maps from intensity measurements of thermal dust emission. We consider the premise parameter estimates to be competitive with the existing state-of-the-art solutions, outperforming these methods within low signal-to-noise regions as we account for the CIB without removing thermal dust emission through oversmoothing. © 2019 M.

Studies have therefore been directed to polymers which have biodegradability with characteristics similar to traditional plastics. Poly-β-hydroxy-buty (PHB) is a member of the polyhydroxyalkonates family that is manufactured by many bacterial isolates as a compound within cells and store energy under certain conditions relaying on increasing the carbon source and reducing other nutrients such as nitrogen. The use of biodegradable polymers has been increasing in recent years, specifically in the field of medical applications as these materials not only serve the desired purpose, where it can be disposed of by the body due to their biodegradable nature. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Dw7 local isolate was identified as PHB producing isolate in a previous study. Different polymer properties were studied. The contribution of A. niger to the microbial degradation of PHB film in soil was studied too. To evaluate the activity of this isolate, the clear zone around the colonies was measured; it was established by recording 7 mm of clear zone around the fungal colonies in 7 days of incubation at 30°C. The results showed 100% of degradation after 40 days indicating the high loss in PHB content in the soil as an open system. Antibacterial activity test was accomplished using disk diffusion method against gram positive and negative bacteria. The results showed that antibacterial compounds of PHB extracted by hypochlorite solution and chloroform are active against selected bacterial isolates which demonstrated inhibition zone ranging between 8-40 mm as a sign of antibacterial efficacy. © 2019, World Research Association.

The model minimises the full cost of supplying electricity from a combination of solar photovoltaic, battery storage, a natural gas fuelled reciprocating engine generator and network delivered electricity, while satisfying several technical and environmental constraints. This includes the use of demand response, historical local solar irradiance and demand traces, constraints on solar photovoltaic, battery and engine performance, full electricity and natural gas tariffs, and the option to participate in the wholesale electricity market. The model is first applied to a school in Victoria, Australia as a case study. It is found that the optimal hybrid plant configuration depends strongly on the choice of greenhouse gas abatement target, electricity and natural gas tariffs, particularly tariffs with demand charges and the option to export electricity to the network grid. The school can also benefit from demand response, where savings result not only from the avoided network delivered electricity cost but also avoided hybrid plant capital investment and operation. Importantly, whilst demand response impacts the hybrid plant configuration it does not displace the optimality of hybrid power plants in distribution networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Abatement; Demand charge; Demand response; Hybrid plant; LCOE; Optimisation","Costs; Dust abatement; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric network parameters; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Demand charge; Demand response; Hybrid plants; LCOE; Optimisations; Investments; alternative energy; cost analysis; demand analysis; electricity; engine; equipment; greenhouse gas; natural gas; operations technology; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power plant; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060485156

Therefore, an increased understanding of lubricated contacts becomes important where oil viscosity-pressure and compressibility-pressure behavior have been shown to influence the film thickness and pressure distribution in elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) contacts, further influencing the durability. In this work, a finite line EHL contact is analyzed with focus on the oil compressibility-pressure and viscosity-pressure response, comparing two oils with relatively different behavior and its influence on subsurface stress concentrations in the contacting bodies. Results indicate that increased pressure gradients and pressure spikes, and therefore increased localized stress concentrations, can be expected for stiffer, less compressible oils, which under transient loading conditions not only affect the outlet but also the edges of the roller. © Copyright 2019 by ASME.","elastohydrodynamic lubrication; finite line contacts; subsurface stress; transient loading","Automotive industry; Compressibility; Costs; Durability; Stress analysis; Stress concentration; Viscosity; Elastohydrodynamic lubrications (EHL); Finite line contact; Lubricated contacts; Oil compressibility; Pressure response; Subsurface stress; Transient loading; Viscosity pressure; Elastohydrodynamic lubrication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057759100

The APRT in the PRD region was defined as the total period for which an air parcel stays within the PRD region. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to calculate the hourly APRT in 2012, 2014, and 2015 based on forward trajectories from 16,720 starting locations. The seasonal APRT results revealed that long APRT was mainly distributed in southern PRD in the summer half year, but in northeastern PRD in the winter half year. This is related to the prevailing wind directions in the summer and winter monsoons. Moreover, the comparison of APRT in different years revealed that the dispersion condition was relatively poor in fall in 2012 and throughout 2014 but was relatively favorable in 2015, which also corresponded to the pollutant concentrations. The APRT calculated from regional air pollution days indicated that the emission reduction strategy should be implemented in the key areas, namely the eastern and central Guangzhou, western Huizou, and the border between Foshan and Jiangmen, and the construction of new factories should not be allowed in these areas. Compared to the APRT, which was investigated to trace the air pollution source, population exposure to air parcels (PEAP) was investigated to orient the influence of path-and-time-weighted sources to population. Consequently, a high PEAP was found to be distributed mainly in the central Guangzhou and Shenzhen and scattered in other urban areas. © 2018","Air parcel residence time; Air pollution prevention and control; HYSPLIT; Pearl River Delta region; Population exposure to air parcel","Air pollution; Emission control; Gems; Rivers; Air parcels; Air pollution prevention; HYSPLIT; Pearl River Delta region; Residence time; River pollution; atmospheric pollution; emission control; monsoon; pollution control; pollution exposure; pollution policy; residence time; wind direction; air pollution; article; human; pollutant; population exposure; retention time; river; summer; urban area; winter; China; Foshan; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Jiangmen; Shenzhen; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058807058

Across the globe, and even within cities, the health burden of air pollution is not equally shared by citizens. Despite being the region suffering from the most severe air pollution, studies examining the inequity of the burdens of air pollution in Asia are limited. We aim to fill in this gap by analyzing the relationship between PM2.5 pollution and residents’ socioeconomic characteristics in Beijing, the icon city for PM2.5 pollution. Our results show that household income and education were negatively correlated with ambient air quality (r = −0.62; p &lt; 0.05 and r = −0.73; p &lt; 0.01 respectively) in 2014. We found in Beijing air quality is worse where residents have less income and lower education rates and are less capable to protect themselves from the potential health risk. To counter the effects of air pollution in Beijing, air filtration has been shown to be an effective means to reduce, at least, indoor PM2.5 levels. We illustrate through a simple scenario analysis that air filtration can reduce exposure (26–79%) to a similar extent as the structural mitigation programs (e.g. closing coal factories) achieved in recent years (53%). We argue government intervention is needed to convey the benefit of air filtration to the socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air filtration; Air pollution; Beijing; Environmental justice; Human health; PM2.5","Air pollution; Air quality; Economic and social effects; Health; Health risks; Plant shutdowns; Air filtration; Beijing; Environmental justice; Human health; PM2.5; Air filters; atmospheric pollution; environmental justice; filtration; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; socioeconomic conditions; adult; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; breathing; China; education; female; filtration; government; health hazard; household income; human; human experiment; justice; male; resident; air pollution; analysis; China; environmental exposure; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; prevention and control; socioeconomics; toxicity; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Beijing; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058191564

Although several research efforts have been conducted to set up a consistent and holistic framework of net-zero building standards, the differences in policies and codes related to net-zero buildings and their impacts are not yet fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate how rapidly the building stock can be transformed into net-zero energy buildings (NZEs). The focus is not technical or based on economic constraints but instead on the potential impact of energy efficiency policies. In response, this paper first presents an overview of the current status of codes and policies related to net-zero building development worldwide. Second, this paper compares and explains the major differences in building energy codes among regions; three countries are used as examples to demonstrate the different approaches. The three countries, which are located on three different continents, are the USA, Germany, and China. Lastly, three prototype buildings are modeled—with similar climate zone classifications as the above-mentioned three countries—based on each country’s respective building energy codes. The prototypes are analyzed against a baseline, with and without the impact of building codes and policies. The preliminary results indicate that, currently, China has few stringent building code requirements; however, due to the wider acceptable indoor thermal environmental range, China has higher potential than the USA to achieve the net-zero goal. Additionally, policies in the building sector have had a substantial positive impact on the reduction of energy and carbon emissions in China. In comparison, Germany has slightly higher potential to achieve the net-zero goal than the other two countries, whereas the USA, without a positive energy policy, will underperform in the near future, compared to most countries worldwide.

Recovering waste heat from diesel generators can reduce cost and satisfy the concurrent need for electricity, district heating or cooling on a remote island. This study investigates the optimization design of a district cooling system (DCS) on a remote island by the dynamic programming method. In a case study on Green Island, the waste heat from the diesel power plant can be recovered to drive an absorption chiller that satisfies the peak cooling load of 756 kW. The objective function of the optimization design includes the capital cost and the running cost during the period of the life cycle. The dynamic programming method is adopted to minimize the objective function, and the constraint involves the conservation of energy between the chiller and the chilled water storage tank. The results showed that a 510 kW absorption chiller and a storage tank capacity of 1978 kW-h achieved the optimization of the DCS. The averaged energy conservation rate was about 75.7%. Moreover, the electricity consumption and CO2 emission were reduced by 955.8 MWh and 675 tons per year, respectively. Based on the difference in the electricity prices of electric utility companies, the investment in the DCS is expected to have a four-year payback period. These optimization results are based on an evaluation of energetic, economic and environmental effects, which are also suitable for any kind of regions without direct access to interconnected electrical networks. © 2019","Chilled water storage; District cooling system; Dynamic programming method; Power plants on a remote island; Waste heat recovery","Cooling systems; Costs; District heating; Dynamic programming; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Investments; Life cycle; Refrigerators; Tanks (containers); Thermoelectric equipment; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Chilled water; District cooling system; Dynamic programming methods; Electrical power generation; Electricity-consumption; Energy conservation rates; Environmental constraints; Remote islands; Absorption cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060465170

However, PM emission standards for power plants vary widely. To explore if the current levels of these standards are sufficiently stringent in a simple cost-benefit framework, we compared the health benefits (avoided monetized health costs) with the control costs of tightening PM emission standards for coal-fired power plants in Northeast (NE) Brazil, where ambient PM concentrations are below World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. We considered three Brazilian PM10 (PMx refers to PM with a diameter under x micrometers) emission standards and a stricter U.S. EPA standard for recent power plants. Our integrated methodology simulates hourly electricity grid dispatch from utility-scale power plants, disperses the resulting PM2.5, and estimates selected human health impacts from PM2.5 exposure using the latest integrated exposure-response model. Since the emissions inventories required to model secondary PM are not available in our study area, we modeled only primary PM so our benefit estimates are conservative. We found that tightening existing PM10 emission standards yields health benefits that are over 60 times greater than emissions control costs in all the scenarios we considered. The monetary value of avoided hospital admissions alone is at least four times as large as the corresponding control costs. These results provide strong arguments for considering tightening PM emission standards for coal-fired power plants worldwide, including in regions that meet WHO guidelines and in developing countries. © 2019","Air quality; Coal power plants; Electricity grid dispatch; Emission standards; Energy policy; Health impacts; Particulate matter; Pollution control costs","Air pollution control; Air quality; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Cost benefit analysis; Developing countries; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Health; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Quality control; Coal power plants; Electricity grids; Emission standard; Health impact; Particulate Matter; Electric load dispatching; air quality; coal-fired power plant; developing world; emission inventory; energy policy; health impact; particulate matter; pollution control; air quality; article; Brazil; coal power; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; death; developing country; electric power plant; electricity; hospital admission; human; particulate matter; pollution control; practice guideline; World Health Organization; air pollutant; air pollution; Brazil; chemistry; economics; legislation and jurisprudence; particulate matter; prevention and control; Brazil; coal; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Brazil; Coal; Humans; Particulate Matter; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060294909

To effectively control PM2.5 in the region, a comprehensive understanding of source contribution and PM2.5 responses to various emission species is critical. We applied the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System together with the high-order decoupled direct method, to simulate air quality and PM2.5 sensitivity and examined PM2.5 responses to emission species in the PRD region in the four seasons of 2010. We employed a concentration-response function to quantify the resultant number of premature mortalities attributable to outdoor PM2.5. We estimated that local and transboundary air pollution (TAP) contributed 27% and 73%, respectively, of the region's PM2.5. In absolute terms, the largest impacts from local and TAP occurred in winter. With respect to relative contributions among the different sources, regional TAP (between cities in the region) (R-TAP) and local contributions had the largest effect in summer, whereas superregional TAP (from outside of the region) contributed the most in fall and winter. Outdoor PM2.5 pollution caused 20 160 (95% confidence interval: 5100-39 310) premature mortalities every year in the PRD region. Averaging among cities, 50%, 20%, and 30% of these deaths were attributable to S-TAP, R-TAP, and local contributions, respectively. Precursor gas emissions (i.e. NH3, volatile organic compounds, SO2, and NOx) affect PM2.5 level in a nonlinear manner; thus, individual pollutant control strategies are less effective for improving PM2.5 pollution than an integrated strategy. On the basis of our findings, we recommend that controls for multiple emission species should be implemented to control PM2.5 pollution in the region. © 2019 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study is to explore farmers' decision-making processes regarding low-carbon production and to provide a reference for the targeted support policies of low-carbon agriculture. The data was derived from a household survey of 442 rice farmers conducted in Jiangsu Province, China in 2017. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using questionnaires, and local interviewers were used in order to maximize the reliability of the results. The theoretical basis for our analysis was an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB).We applied a structural equation model (SEM) to investigate the correlations among farmers' decision-making processes regarding low-carbon production and observable characteristics. Furthermore, we explored the differences in adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture among different groups of farmers based on production scale and region, respectively. The results indicate that attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and contract farming participation are significantly positively correlated with farmers' intention toward low-carbon production, and that farmers' low-carbon production intention and contract farming participation have significant positive correlations with their behavior regarding low-carbon production. A subsample analysis shows that the subjective norm for farmers with a small production scale is more strongly correlated with their adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture than that it is for farmers with a large production scale. Additionally, in less developed regions, farmers' attitude is more strongly correlated with their adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture than it is for farmers in developed regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Contract participation; Farmers' adoption decisions; Low-carbon production; Structural equation model; Sustainability; Theory of planned behavior","agricultural management; agricultural policy; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; climate change; contract farming; correlation; decision making; farmers attitude; household survey; local participation; numerical model; planning theory; questionnaire survey; sustainability; technology adoption; China; Jiangsu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062817583

Transformative climate governance enables climate mitigation and adaptation while purposefully steering societies towards low-carbon, resilient and sustainable objectives. The framework provides a systematic analytical tool for understanding and supporting the already ongoing changes of the climate governance landscape towards more experimental approaches that include multi-scale, cross-sectoral and public-private collaborations. It distinguishes between different types of capacities needed to address transformation dynamics, including responding to disturbances (stewarding capacity), phasing-out drivers of path dependency (unlocking capacity), creating and embedding novelties (transformative capacity) and coordinating multi-actor processes (orchestrating capacity). Our case study of climate governance in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrates how the framework helps to map the activities by which multiple actors create new types of conditions for transformative climate governance, assess the effectiveness of the capacities and identify capacity gaps. Transformative and orchestrating capacities in Rotterdam emerged through the creation of space and informal networks for strategic and operational innovation, which also propelled new types of governance arrangements and structures. Both capacities support stewarding and unlocking by integrating and mainstreaming different goals, connecting actors to each other for the development of solutions and mediating interests. Key challenges across capacities remain because of limited mainstreaming of long-term and integrated thinking into institutional and regulatory frameworks. As the ongoing changes in climate governance open up multiple questions about actor roles, effective governance processes, legitimacy and how effective climate governance in the context of transformations can be supported, we invite future research to apply the capacities framework to explore these questions. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate change; Governance agency; Governance capacity; Orchestrating capacity; Resilience; Sustainability transformation; Transformative capacity; Transformativeclimate governance; Urban governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045280438

Vegetation shifts such as shrub encroachment may alter the soil microbial community and result in changes in important biogeochemical processes, although few studies have examined this in subtropical marshes. Here, we used in-situ litter decomposition experiments, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and laboratory assays on soil respiration, extracellular enzyme activity, and denitrification potential to determine differences in C storage and nitrogen (N) cycling between willow-encroached and non-encroached plots in two subtropical marshes (Moccasin Island and Lake Apopka, FL, USA). In both regions, encroached (willow or adjacent marsh) and non-encroached plots had distinctively different microbial communities, which were correlated with soil temperature and nutrient content. Greater enzyme activity, denitrification, and CO 2 production were observed in willow and/or adjacent marsh plots compared to control marsh plots at Moccasin Island. Conversely, lower enzyme activity, denitrification, and CO 2 production were detected in willow and/or adjacent marsh plots compared to control marsh plots at Lake Apopka. Despite differences in the response of biogeochemical processes and microbial community structure in the two study regions, in-situ decomposition rates were halved in willow litter compared to herbaceous litter in both regions, which was correlated with greater recalcitrant lignin content in willow litter. Ultimately, greater short-term litter C storage was observed in both study regions, but soil N cycling changes differed by region, potentially due to unique site characteristics such as hydroperiod and nutrient availability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Decomposition; Microbial; Nitrogen; Shrub-encroachment","Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Denitrification; Enzyme activity; Forestry; Lakes; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Polymerase chain reaction; Soils; Tropics; Water quality; Denitrification potential; Extracellular enzyme activity; Microbial; Microbial community structures; Physico-chemical gradients; Quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Shrub encroachments; Soil microbial community compositions; Wetlands; biogeochemistry; carbon sequestration; community composition; decomposition; denitrification; environmental gradient; marsh; microbial community; nitrogen; physicochemical property; shrub; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil respiration; subtropical region; wetland; Carbon Dioxide; Forestry; Lakes; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Florida [United States]; Lake Apopka; United States; Salix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059305354

The International Drought Experiment (IDE) is investigating the impact of severe drought on terrestrial vegetation by experimentally reducing precipitation at dozens of sites. Here we implement the IDE precipitation reduction protocol using the Community Land Model (CLM). Though many model results suggest that carbon fertilization will outpace drought-caused reduction of terrestrial carbon uptake, uncertainty is large. We therefore configure CLM to consider carbon cycling impacts of reduced moisture availability without intertwining the effects of carbon fertilization or phenological changes. California hosts a number of IDE sites and a wide range of topography, climate, and biomes. CMIP5 predictions suggest 21st century California will experience droughts in excess of the 1000-year climatological record for both frequency and magnitude. CLM suggests that some regions, including much of Northern California, may experience a steeper decline in gross primary productivity (GPP) during 21st century severe droughts than during 20th century severe droughts. Vegetation in Northern California experiences virtually all of this GPP reduction during the dry season, with little wet season GPP reduction even during severe drought. Southern California vegetation experiences soil moisture GPP limitation at virtually all times, increasing substantially with drought severity. Southern California should experience a more pronounced shift in GPP seasonality and decline in magnitude relative to Northern California during droughts. Some parts of every vegetated continent see changes to drought response and seasonality similar to Southern California. Our CLM results provide drought impacts that forthcoming IDE field observations may test, can help to spatially upscale site-based IDE observations of drought impact, and provide CLM's prediction of reduced precipitation impacts per unit leaf area index. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CLM; Community Land Model; Drought; GPP; IDE; International Drought Experiment","anthropogenic effect; carbon cycle; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; drought; field method; hydrological cycle; leaf area index; net primary production; observational method; phenology; precipitation (climatology); terrestrial environment; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; vegetation cover; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059297789

German legal regulations explicitly demand networking between hospice and palliative care providers. However, there is little research on models of cooperation and the building and development of hospice and palliative care networks. Research-based recommendations for network building and advancement are lacking. Objective: The study aim was to develop empirical recommendations for the building of new and advancement of existing hospice and palliative care networks in Bavaria, Germany. Methods: The project utilized a qualitative approach. The research project was structured in six sequential phases: 1) semi-structured individual interviews on status quo of networks, 2) a workshop including a focus group to develop definitions of key terms and prioritize major network themes, 3) semi-structured face-to-face interviews on factors enabling and inhibiting cooperation, 4) drafting of a recommendation for regional hospice and palliative care networks, 5) an online consensus survey questionnaire to rate relevance and feasibility of the draft recommendation and an internal consensus meeting to revise the draft, and 6) an expert workshop to develop examples of realization. Coordinators and chairpersons of 12 hospice and palliative care networks constitute the study population for study phases 1 to 3, 5, and 6. Network representatives partook in one (n = 6), two (n = 6), three (n = 4), four (n = 2), or all five (n = 1) of the study phases 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Further experts participated in one (n = 10) or both (n = 1) of the phases 5 and 6. Results: Recommendations were drafted for six thematic fields: (i) missions and aims, (ii) roles and responsibilities, (iii) coordination, (iv) communication and information channels, (v) public visibility, and (vi) funding. The whole set of recommendations was rated by 90% of the participants to be fully or somewhat important for network building and development. A total of 22 recommendations was approved. Conclusions: The call for establishing and developing standards for hospice and palliative care networks was situated within the current policy climate of Germany and the broader international community. The present recommendations can aid implementation of this request and have a strong relevance for practice. © 2018","Germany; Grounded Theory; health services research; palliative care; qualitative research; recommendations","adult; article; climate; clinical article; consensus; controlled study; coordination; feasibility study; female; funding; Germany; grounded theory; health care delivery; health services research; hospice; human; human experiment; interview; male; palliative therapy; qualitative research; questionnaire; responsibility; visibility; cooperation; Germany; health care delivery; hospice; hospice care; public relations; qualitative research; Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care; Germany; Hospice Care; Hospices; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Palliative Care; Qualitative Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058958401

We construct a Hotelling-like model where electricity may be produced by three perfectly substitutable sources: an abundant dirty resource (coal), a non-renewable less polluting resource (shale gas), and an abundant clean resource (solar). The resources differ by their carbon contents and their unit costs. Shale gas extraction’s technology (fracking) generates local damages. Fixed costs must be paid to develop shale gas and to deploy the clean resource on a large scale. Climate policy takes the form of a carbon budget. We show that, at the optimum, a more stringent climate policy does not always go together with an increase of the quantity of shale gas extracted, and that banning shale gas extraction most often leads to bring forward the development of the clean resource, but not always. We calibrate the model for Europe in order to determine whether shale gas should be extracted and in which amount, and to evaluate the effects of a moratorium on shale gas use. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Energy transition; Global warming; Non-renewable resources; Shale gas","Budget control; Carbon; Coal deposits; Extraction; Gases; Global warming; Shale gas; Carbon content; Climate policy; Energy transitions; Gas development; Gas extractions; Local damage; Non-renewable; Non-renewable resource; Shale; carbon emission; cost analysis; electricity; emission inventory; energy conservation; energy efficiency; environmental policy; extraction method; global warming; resource management; shale gas; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041494508

The results show that the impact on the property market of the public's response to the negative impact of cyclones is more marked than its response to the negative impact of beach erosion. The relative non-responsiveness to beach erosion can be seen as a product of both local government intervention strategies and the recreational and aesthetic attractions of beaches.

This article examines the key drivers behind China’s 2011 decision to opt for ETS as a GHG mitigating policy tool and what lay behind the choice of the system’s design features. Given the existence of the frontrunner EU ETS and that market mechanisms have spread across the world in recent years, we analyze the role played by policy diffusion in the decision to launch an ETS and in the subsequent design process, seen in relation to domestic drivers. The article investigates policy developments culminating in the 2011 carbon market announcement, and the reasons these design elements were chosen for the pilot schemes and the national market in the period 2011–2017. The article contributes to our understanding of policy diffusion at different stages of policy development in China, by revealing which diffusion mechanism is more prevalent at different stages. We find first that overall domestic conditions and drivers had the most consistent impact on policy decisions to establish a carbon market and on the selected sectors. However, a second key finding is that the role of policy diffusion varied over time, with such diffusion, in the form of ideational impact, playing the most important role early on, providing a powerful inducement for China to go for a carbon market. Third, sophisticated learning from international projects took place in the pilots, allowing China to adapt policies and design features to match local conditions. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization","climate change; energy; environment; national governance","climate change; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; policy analysis; policy approach; policy development; policy making; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060569555

The results indicate that the CMCC-CMS and MPI-ESM-MR show higher skill than the other 7 models in simulating spatial pattern and its decadal change of climate zones over China. The simulation results for FGOALS-g2 and INM-CM4 both show relatively lower skill than the other 7 models. Meanwhile, the performance of multi-model ensemble in simulating climate zones over China is obviously better than the simulated result of any single model. So, it is a good way to simulate climate zones by multi-model ensemble to reduce some uncertainty of climate models. However, it is crucial to select appropriate ensemble members. Compared with 1960–2005, the climatic zones in China have an obvious trend of northward shift in 2021–2100. The range of southern sub-tropical belt expands to the most areas in the south of Yangtze River under RCP4.5 emission scenarios, and further extends to the north areas of Yangtze River with a maximum of 2–6° of latitude under RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Middle sub-tropical belt shifts gradually to the areas between Yellow River and north areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Northern sub-tropical belt shifts northward to southeastern North China. Warm extra-tropical belt extends to the most of Northeast China, most of central Inner Mongolia, and northern Xinjiang under RCP8.5 emission scenarios. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate zone; CMIP5; DT10; Evaluation of climate model; Projection","air temperature; climate modeling; CMIP; computer simulation; decadal variation; ensemble forecasting; regional climate; China; Mongolia; Xinjiang Uygur; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053244757

Over the last few decades, glaciers have generally shrunk across the globe due to climate warming. In order to understand the current state of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains, we compiled a new inventory of glaciers in the region using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images acquired in 2015, and identified 2748 glaciers that covered an area of 1539.30 ± 49.50 km2 with an ice volume of 81.69 ± 7.40 km3, among which the Shule River basin occupied the largest portion of glaciers (24.8% in number, 32.3% in area, and 35.6% in ice volume). In comparison to previous inventories, glacier area was found to shrink by 396.89 km2 (20.5%) in total, and 109 glaciers with an area of 8.94 km2 disappeared over the period from the 1960s to 2015. This situation was primarily caused by the increase in air temperature, and also related with the size of glacier and some local topographic parameters. In addition, the change of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains showed a distinct spatial pattern, i.e., their shrinking rate was large in the east and small in the west. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate factors; Glacier changes; The Qilian Mountains","Air temperature; Climate factors; Glacier change; NorthWest China; Operational land imager; Qilian mountains; Shrinking rates; Spatial patterns; Landforms; glacial hydrology; glacier dynamics; ice mechanics; Landsat; satellite imagery; sea ice; sustainable development; topographic effect; China; Gansu; Hexi Corridor; Qilian Mountains; Shule Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065012084

The establishment of affordable, effective and truly sustainable waste management is a key point for the development of urban areas. However, as a renewable energy, the cost-benefit of supporting and the environmental performance for waste incineration power are seldom discussed. This paper discusses the current situation of waste incineration power industry in China and analyzes the required subsidies and emission reductions. The results show that waste incineration power needs relatively less financial support and perform well on emission reduction. Main obstacles to the development of waste incineration have also been investigated from the perspective of government, enterprises and local residents. Lastly, some suggestions are offered on how to tackle these issues. For instance: more regulation on waste classification; to integrate the informal workers into formal municipal waste management system; to communicate more effectively to the public to dispel general misunderstanding; application of the waste heat from cogeneration plants to local heat supply or central heat supply system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emission reduction, China; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Subsidy","Cogeneration plants; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Environmental management; Human resource management; Municipal solid waste; Waste heat; Waste management; Economic development; Emission reduction; Environmental performance; Heat supply systems; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Subsidy; Sustainable waste management; Waste classification; Waste incineration; assessment method; economic development; emission control; incineration; municipal solid waste; subsidy system; waste management; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057106667

Quantitative simulations of the paleoclimate have consistently failed to agree with information from plant and animal fossils and climate sensitive sediments. The ‘cold continental interior paradox’ (first described by DeConto et al. in Barrera E, Johnson C (eds) Evolution of the Cretaceous Ocean/climate system, vol 332. Geological Society of America Special Paper, Boulder, pp 391–406, 1999), has been an enigma, with extensive continental interiors, especially in northeast Asia, modeled as below freezing in spite of plant and other evidence to the contrary. We reconsider the paleoelevations of specific areas, particularly along the northeastern Siberian continental margin, where paleofloras indeed indicate higher temperatures than suggested by current climate models. Evidence for significant masses of ice on land during even the otherwise warmest times of the Cretaceous is solved by reinterpretation of the δ18O record of fossil plankton. The signal interpreted as an increase in ice volume on land is the same as the signal for an increase in the volume of groundwater reservoirs on land. The problem of a warm Arctic, where fossil floras indicate that they never experienced freezing conditions in winter, could not be solved by numerical simulations using higher CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations. We propose a solution by assuming that paleoelevations were less than today and that there were much more extensive wetlands (lakes, meandering rivers, swamps, bogs) on the continents than previously assumed. Using ~ 8 × CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations and assuming 50–75% water surfaces providing water vapor as a supplementary greenhouse gas on the continents reduces the meridional temperature gradients. Under these conditions the equatorial to polar region temperature gradients produce conditions compatible with fossil and sedimentological evidence. © 2018, Geologische Vereinigung e.V.

The reservoirs were selected because of their historical importance as oil producers and their potential as targets for CO2 use for enhanced oil recovery and associated geological storage. The porositypermeability transforms generated in this study have coefficients of determination that are nearly double those in the published literature. Methods applying other information (e.g., lithofacies type and reservoir depth) to improve the transforms are also discussed. Ultimately, it was determined that although subdividing the Clinton Sandstone data by geologically similar areas constrained the porosity and permeability values, the data for most areas were too limited to yield robust correlations. Thus, the range of possible outcomes should be determined using the transform derived from all available data. The Copper Ridge values were largely not constrained when subdivided by depth.

Design/methodology/approach: The findings are based on 12 qualitative interviews taken from two case studies, and the results are explained in relation to the multilevel network framework and environmental psychology. Findings: Multilevel networks can promote learning and identification of specific actions in connection with climate change adaptation. The aim should be to establish interdisciplinarity, with participants from at least two authority levels. Representatives should be in positions that enable them to introduce acquired knowledge to the organization and influence its application. A network requires organizational commitment, during the initial phase and throughout the follow-up process. Municipal leaders (mayors) must be aware of the network, act as signatories to relevant documents, and be familiar with participating representatives. Commitment to knowledge application within the organization also requires that participants understand where and how to work strategically to convert new ideas into action. Practical implications: This paper presents practical and research-based guidelines for the management of climate change adaptation networks at municipal, county and national authority levels. Originality/value: This paper combines political science and environmental psychology perspectives as a means of analysing network achievements. A psychological approach may help to promote a greater understanding of why and how network knowledge is transferred. © 2018, Åshild Lappegard Hauge, Gro Sandkjær Hanssen and Cecilie Flyen.","Climate adaptation; Multilevel; Municipalities; Networks","adaptive management; climate change; environmental management; network analysis; psychology; questionnaire survey; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052471122

Current greenhouse gas emission trends point to much more substantial warming, with possible increases of 4 °C or more in the long-term. This Special Issue describes findings from the IMPRESSIONS project which advanced the understanding of impacts of high-end climate change (defined as global mean temperatures > 2 °C above pre-industrial levels) and potential solutions for reducing these impacts through adaptation, mitigation and transformative actions. With stakeholders, the project developed a set of integrated climate and socio-economic scenarios and applied these to multi-sectoral impact models in five case studies: Hungary, Scotland, Iberia, Europe as a whole and Central Asia. This showed that benefits in some regions and sectors, such as increasing forest productivity in northern Europe, are offset by detrimental effects in others, such as severe water scarcity, heat stress and loss of productivity in southern Europe and parts of central and eastern Europe, and widespread flood damage. Adaptation and mitigation pathways were generated with stakeholders to address these impacts and identify integrated and transformative solutions. These highlighted the importance of shifting to sustainable lifestyles, good governance for sustainability and climate resilience, and new forms of integrated and sustainable resource management. The stakeholder-led approach of IMPRESSIONS ensured that the research was driven by the priorities of decision-makers, enabling significant co-learning and the identification of robust, innovative and effective solutions for addressing high-end climate change. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; High-end climate change; Impacts; Mitigation; Models; Pathways; Scenarios; Socio-economic change; Transformation",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063014130

The results indicate that for passenger vehicles, the target of GHG emissions abatement generally synergizes with the targets of petroleum security enhancement, urban air quality improvement, and transport cost reduction but conflicts with the targets of rare metal conservation and transport well-being improvement. When the co-benefits and risks are taken into consideration, the design of the GHG emissions abatement scheme becomes more complicated.

While the potential for solar PV in the residential and commercial sectors has been widely studied, the potential in educational buildings is largely unknown. Educational institutions account for 11% of total US building electricity consumption and 14% of building floorspace. These buildings also contribute to approximately 4% of total US CO2 emissions, thus playing a potentially important role in climate mitigation strategies. We estimate the electricity use for 132k educational institutions across the US and estimate electricity generation, greenhouse gas and health damaging air emissions reductions, and private and social costs and benefits that would result from adopting rooftop solar PV. We find that solar PV in US educational institutions could provide 100 TWh of electricity services annually, meeting 75% of these buildings' current electricity consumption. We estimate the highest generation potential in Texas, California, and Florida with K-12 public educational institutions comprising the bulk of that generation. The provision of electricity services from rooftop solar PV on educational institutions could reduce health, environmental, and climate change damages by roughly $4 billion per year (assuming a social cost of carbon of $40/ton and value of statistical life of $10M in 2018 USD). Two key findings from this study are that: (i) the private costs of solar for educational institutions still exceed the private benefits from reduced electricity consumption across the entire country (unless a third party operation model is used, in which case some locations can have net-benefits), and (ii) with the exceptions of California and New York, the social health, environmental and climate change benefits exceed the levels of current incentives provided by the state and retail subsidies. © 2019 The Author(s).

Studies have shown that plant diversity plays an important role in ecosystem functioning. However, the effects of plant species diversity on CH4 and N2O emissions under high ammonium (NH4 +-N) loading rates remain unclear. In this study, a microcosm experiment simulating vertical constructed wetlands supplied with high NH4 +-N water levels was established. The treatments included four species richness levels (1, 2, 3, 4) and 15 species compositions. There was no significant relationship between species richness and N2O emissions. However, N2O emissions were significantly reduced by specific plant species composition. Notably, the communities with the presence of Rumex japonicus L. reduced N2O emissions by 62% compared to communities without this species. This reduction in N2O emissions may have been a result of decreased N concentrations and increased plant biomass. CH4 emissions did not respond to plant species richness or species identity. Overall, plant species identity surpassed species richness in lowering N2O emissions from constructed wetlands with high NH4 +-N water. The results also suggest that communities with R. japonicus could achieve higher N removal and lower greenhouse gas emissions than other wetland species. © 2018","Ecosystem functioning; Methane; Nitrogen removal; Nitrous oxide; Plant species richness; Species identity","Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Water levels; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Ecosystem functioning; Microcosm experiments; Nitrous oxide; Plant species composition; Plant species diversity; Plant species richness; Species identity; Gas emissions; ammonium; constructed wetland; ecosystem function; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; methane; microcosm; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; plant; species diversity; species richness; Rumex japonicus; ammonium derivative; methane; nitrous oxide; biodiversity; biomass; chemistry; greenhouse gas; metabolism; plant; wetland; Ammonium Compounds; Biodiversity; Biomass; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Plants; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053610958

We address this question through statistical models of adaptation policy actors’ assessments of access to scientific/technical information as well as their perceptions of cooperation and procedural fairness across numerous adaptation decision-making processes operating in the Lake Victoria region, East Africa. We measured actors’ collaborative interactions as well as their participation in task forces, steering committees, and other policy forums that have emerged in response to the challenges of building adaptive capacity to the effects of climate change in the region. Because information access, cooperation, and procedural fairness are shaped by social processes, we tested how the performance of policy forums varied according to different measures of social capital. Specifically, we distinguished between bridging social capital (the value of relationships that span or broker between distinct subgroups) and bonding social capital (which results from frequent interaction or from clustered relationships within subgroups). We found that measures of bridging social capital had a positive effect on actors’ assessments of their access to information in policy forums, but a negative effect on their perceptions of cooperation and procedural fairness in forums. In contrast, measures of bonding social capital had a positive effect on cooperation and procedural fairness, but no effect on information access. Taken together, our results suggest that different forms of social capital have separate—and potentially opposing—effects on distinct measures of the performance of adaptation policy forums. The relative importance of each performance measure, which may vary from one policy forum to another, should guide efforts to encourage different forms of social capital across the numerous decision-making processes that comprise regional climate change adaptation governance systems. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Decision making; Information retrieval; Public policy; Adaptation decisions; Bonding social capitals; Bridging social capitals; Climate change adaptation; Collaborative interaction; Decision making process; Lake victoria regions; Regional climate changes; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; governance approach; perception; regional climate; social capital; East Africa; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061255073

These discussions often ignore other markets, such as marine transport, which collectively would also need to show a reduction in demand if oil consumption were to reach an inflection point. We explore the outlook for marine bunkers, a niche market that accounts, depending on estimates, for up to 7% of the demand barrel. We focus on the possible impact of new environmental restrictions that aim to drastically reduce sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships as of January 2020, placing them against the background of past innovations that have been reshaping ships’ fuel consumption patterns and assessing their likely impact on future innovation in the sector. We conclude that the rules might paradoxically end up slowing down what might have otherwise been a more rapid transition of the shipping market away from traditional bunker fuels. The rules will, however, adversely affect simple refineries and producers of heavy, sour crude oil grades, whose prices are sometimes indexed to that of high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Emissions; Fuel switching; IMO; Marine transport","Air quality; Commerce; Crude oil; Particulate emissions; Ships; Consumption patterns; Environmental restriction; Fuel switching; Future innovations; High sulfur fuels; Marine transport; Passenger vehicles; Rapid transitions; Fuels; air quality; fuel consumption; oil; shipping; standard (regulation); sulfur; traffic emission; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057077126

In the context of this paper, EFTs can be defined as solutions for the use of land resources aiming the increasing of goods for meeting the changing human needs and with neutral or positive environmental impact. Changes in the political regime have always had a visible impact on the EFTs issue in Romania. EFTs has gone through several major phases. The political impact on EFTs implementation mainly affected sustainable land management (SLM) and to a small extent, at the end of the communist era and partly during the capitalist period, climate change mitigation. Throughout history, the political factor has dominated and influenced the capacity of the EFTs implementation process in responding to socio-economic stimuli. In addition, quality of life, rural-urban and urban-rural migrations, poverty, education level, and climate change adaptation have had impacts on the status of EFTs according to governance and political reflections. The agrarian reforms from the last two centuries, based on socio-economic demands, have strongly influenced the capacity to implement EFTs both positively and negatively. However, the cultural factor was least affected by political and socio-economic changes as a stability factor in ensuring continued implementation of the EFTs. Currently, there is a strong need to reconsider EFTs as sustainability tools for Romanian agriculture that can cope with climate change and sustainable land management (SLM) demands. This paper presents a brief history of EFTs in Romania and their benefits in achieving SLM equilibrium, describing the impacts of political decisions, socio-economic measures, and cultural features on implementing ETFs policies. © 2018","Environmental friendly techniques; Historical evolution; Political changes; Romanian traditions; Socio-economic measures","Environmental impact; History; Land use; Sustainable development; Environmental-friendly; Historical evolutions; Political changes; Romanians; Socio-economics; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; cultural tradition; environmental impact; implementation process; land management; policy implementation; political change; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; agricultural worker; article; climate change; cultural factor; education; environmental impact; human; human experiment; human needs; politics; poverty; quality of life; Romania; stimulus; Romania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056471487

Sediment transport and deposition in highly dynamic and vulnerable coastal regions becomes especially relevant in terms of the natural adaption capacity of intertidal and supratidal areas to global sea-level rise. We have developed a network of eight autonomously operating turbidity measuring stations in an island-like salt marsh area (Hallig Langeness) in the tidal flats of the North-Frisian Wadden Sea. Using this system we got first insights about the availability of suspended particulate matter (SPM). In order to obtain the best possible estimation of the SPM concentrations in our study area, each measuring station has been individually calibrated considering the local conditions by using sediment collected by self-built sediment accumulators which are installed next to the respective measuring station. With this method we have investigated the availability of SPM and its spatial and temporal distribution during several spring and winter months. The results indicate strong and systematic SPM variability between individual stations ranging on average from 0.04 to 0.56 g/l. Control factors include installation altitude, the proximity to tidal channels, the positive influence on SPM availability by adjacent land reclamation areas or the negative influence on SPM availability due to a shielded position between two spur dykes. Further results show a strong increase of the SPM concentration under harsh weather conditions and inundation events whereby strong winds alone are not sufficient for a significant SPM increase. Instead, the combination of suitable wind direction, its strength and duration play a major role. The increase in SPM concentrations under harsh weather conditions tends to be highest at stations with less protection against the open water. Our new extensive network of turbidity measurements also allows for detecting areas with predominantly low SPM availabilities, the so-called low spots. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Hallig; Inundation; Langeness; Storm surge; Suspended particulate matter; Turbidity","assessment method; concentration (composition); deposition; land reclamation; marine environment; measurement method; network analysis; saltmarsh; sea level change; sediment transport; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; suspended load; suspended particulate matter; tidal flat; turbidity; vulnerability; Atlantic Ocean; Frisian Islands; North Frisian Islands; North Sea; Wadden Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062284309

Two general scientific approaches have been taken to estimate spatiotemporally explicit urban FFCO2 fluxes, referred to here as “downscaling” and “bottom-up.” Bottom-up approaches can specifically characterize the CO2-emitting infrastructure in cities but are labor-intensive to build and currently available in few U.S. cities. Downscaling approaches, often available globally, require proxy information to allocate or distribute emissions resulting in additional uncertainty. We present a comparison of a downscaled FFCO2 emission data product (Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC)) to a bottom-up estimate (Hestia) in four U.S. urban areas in an effort to better isolate and understand differences between the approaches. We find whole-city differences ranging from −1.5% (Los Angeles Basin) to +20.8% (Salt Lake City). At the 1 km × 1 km spatial scale, comparisons reveal a low-emission limit in ODIAC driven by saturation of the nighttime light spatial proxy. At this resolution, the median difference between the two approaches ranged from 47 to 84% depending upon city with correlations ranging from 0.34 to 0.68. The largest discrepancies were found for large point sources and the on-road sector, suggesting that downscaled FFCO2 data products could be improved by incorporating independent large point-source estimates and estimating on-road sources with a relevant spatial surrogate. Progressively coarsening the spatial resolution improves agreement but greater than approximately 25 km2, there were diminishing returns to agreement suggesting a practical resolution when using downscaled approaches. ©2019.

Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species-richness–biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species-richness–biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species-richness–biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species-richness–biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species-richness–biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration. © The Authors.

A key component of plasmonic materials in conventional semiconductors is the wide band gap of oxide thin films. Although transparent electronic materials have been developed for visible and near-infrared wavelengths, systems incorporating mid-infrared and far-infrared spectra are difficult to achieve. In this study, hydrated magnesium-carbon films, a new type of non-oxide transparent conductive thin films with a magnesium hydroxide structure, were generated using the three-step method. After annealing treatment, larger crystals in the thin films typically exhibited superior film resistivity, with conductivity values of approximately 8.63 × 10−3 Ω m. Due to the free electron concentration was not more than 1020 cm−3, the films demonstrated excellent optical properties, with plasma wavelength values of approximately 8 μm for infrared transmittance above 70%. After annealing, due to the Moss-Burstein (M-B) effect, the visible light transmittance was greater than 85% and the optical bandgap shifted towards the blue region. In addition, the influences of the sputtering power of the carbon target on the properties of hydrated magnesium-carbon film were also discussed in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical properties; Hydrated magnesium-carbon films; Magnetron sputtering; Transparent conductive films","Annealing; Conductive films; Electric properties; Electrons; Energy gap; Hydration; Infrared devices; Magnesium compounds; Magnetron sputtering; Optical films; Optical properties; Optoelectronic devices; Oxide films; Thin films; Wide band gap semiconductors; Far infrared spectrum; Free electron concentration; Infrared transmittance; Transparent conductive films; Transparent conductive thin films; Transparent electronics; Visible and near infrared; Visible light transmittances; Carbon films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056624866

Existing environmental management framework, which holds county-level governments accountable for the quality of environment within their individual jurisdiction, does not cope effectively with air pollution control. Fragmentation resulted from this jurisdictional regulation model creates responsibility conflicts, causes free-rider problems, and increases cooperation costs. In short, it is inefficient and ineffective. We consider the situation to be a tragedy of the regulatory anti-commons. Using a spatial regression design, we examine the relationship between air quality and jurisdictional fragmentation. The results show that jurisdictional density – the number of regulatory units per km2 within a prefecture-level city – has a significantly negative effect on air quality, which means jurisdictional fragmentation raises the likelihood of a tragedy of the regulatory anti-commons. Our analysis both provides a new lens to the study of environmental governance in China and provides an empirical case to the anti-commons literature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control; Jurisdictional density; Jurisdictional management; Regulatory anti-commons","Air quality; Environmental management; Quality control; Cooperation costs; Environmental governances; Free-rider problem; Pollution regulation; Regulation models; Regulatory anti-commons; Regulatory units; Spatial regression; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058391962

Public transportation has received increasing attention as emissions- friendly transport options, but whether the urban rail transit system has a significant effect on curbing air pollution has been unclear, and there is a lack of explicit case studies in mainland China. Therefore, the effects of the opening of the Beijing Metro on air pollutants emissions in Beijing were quantified through a regression discontinuity design. Beijing has seen a brisk growth in its rail transit infrastructure and a downward trend of air pollution index since 2005. The regression results show that the operation of the rail transit system was observed to have a significant effect on reducing most of the air pollutants concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO) but had little effect on ozone pollution. The results obtained were highly robust across a variety of tests.

The U.S. bioeconomy emerged in the early 2000s as a result of the societal pursuit of energy independence and security, greenhouse gas emission mitigation and sustainable development. Founded on biotechnologies and stimulated by federal policies, the U.S. bioeconomy has been growing rapidly over the past decade. Intensive research and development endeavors have been carried out to explore advanced technologies for efficient biomass production, conversion, and valorization, through which numerous biotechnological innovations have been achieved to realize the commercial, cost-effective production of diverse transportation biofuels and high-value domestic bioproducts from various biomass feedstocks. The bioenergy products currently commercialized in the U.S. include bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bioheat and biopower; the commercialized bioproducts extend to biopolymers, biochemicals, biopharmaceuticals and bioadhesives. In 2017, more than 65.4 billion liters of biofuels and 2500 certified bioproducts were produced, creating 4 million job opportunities and sharing 2.5% of the U.S. economy. Commercial production of cellulosic ethanol, renewable diesel, green jet fuel and other advanced biofuels remains at the demonstration stage and needs further improvement in cost-competitiveness. Envisioning a Billion-Ton-Bioeconomy by 2030, the U.S. federal government has been implementing strategic activities to realize the goal. High costs of delivered biomass feedstock, immature biomass refinery technologies, lack of cost-comparative bioproducts, and low fossil fuel prices have been identified as the major constraints to a strong U.S. bioeconomy.

To reveal the effect of high demand-side electrification rates on the transmission grid and electricity supply-side a case-study analysis for the German market is performed. A reference scenario with low demand-side electrification and low grid congestion is compared to high demand-side electrification scenarios with two different shares of renewable electricity production of total electrical load: “Elec61” and “Elec75.” The analysis shows that an increase of the electrical load from ~500 TWh to ~760 TWh leads to heightened stress for the transmission grid and therefore more curtailment in both electrification scenarios. In Elec61, which exhibits the same share of renewable electricity production as the reference scenario, the integration of 19 TWh of flexible power-to-heat in district heating networks reduces the market driven curtailment of renewable feed-in, highlighting the value of flexible electrical loads for the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Although a drastic increase of installed renewable electricity production capacity occurs in Elec61 (+109 GW) and Elec75 (+178 GW) compared to the reference scenario, fossil fueled power plants are still being dispatched frequently in times of high electrical load and low renewable energy feed. In the examined scenarios, deep decarbonization through electrification was not possible because the decrease of the CO 2 -coefficient of power generation resulting from an increase in the installed capacity of variable renewable energy sources was insufficient.

The emission of road dust re-suspension significantly varies based on amount of silt deposited on the road, type of road (paved and unpaved road, concrete material of the paved road), number and types of vehicles movement. The chemical reagent such as calcium magnesium acetate, magnesium chloride and calcium chloride are reported to significantly reduce the PM emissions from road dust in developed countries. Therefore, the efficacy of these chemicals in reducing the road dust from the urban road in developing countries needs to be evaluated along with the cost–benefit analysis and comparison with the conventional approach of dust control (road cleaning and washing).

An extensive farm survey of 150 farms was designed. From study area, three districts, namely, Chitral, D.I. Khan, and Peshawar, were selected through multistage sampling process. Yield simulation from Crop model DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agro Technology Transfer) was used for socio-economic impact assessment. Future climate scenarios were generated by selecting five GCMs from latest CMIP5 family with two RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, at two carbon concentrations of 499 ppm and 571 ppm, respectively. Yield simulations were analyzed for each GCM. Results of crop model revealed that wheat yield will increase in district Chitral, while in D.I. Khan and Peshawar, yields would be reduced due to climate change. For socio-economic impact assessment, TOA-MD (Trade-Off Analysis for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment) version 6 was used. Climate change impacts on poverty, net farm returns, and per capita income were calculated for different scenarios. The analysis was carried out on per-farm basis. The economic model results revealed that climate change has negative impact on wheat producers in D.I. Khan and Peshawar while making wheat producers better off in Chitral. The number of losers ranged from 54 to 66.21% and 50 to 61.99% in D.I. Khan and Peshawar, respectively. Losers are the farmers who would be economically worse off under perturbed climate. With current climate, the observed poverty rate would be 34 to 49 in D.I. Khan while 21.26 to 34.03 in Peshawar.

Here, we inventoried 488 NAC members in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Using the recent release of the wheat genome (IWGS RefSeq v1.0), we studied duplication events focusing on genomic regions from 4B-4D-5A chromosomes as an example of the family expansion and neofunctionalization of TaNAC members. Differentially expressed TaNAC genes in organs and in response to abiotic stresses were identified using publicly available RNAseq data. Expression profiling of 23 selected candidate TaNAC genes was studied in leaf and grain from two bread wheat genotypes at two developmental stages in field drought conditions and revealed insights into their specific and/or overlapping expression patterns. This study showed that, of the 23 TaNAC genes, seven have a leaf-specific expression and five have a grain-specific expression. In addition, the grain-specific genes profiles in response to drought depend on the genotype. These genes may be considered as potential candidates for further functional validation and could present an interest for crop improvement programs in response to climate change. Globally, the present study provides new insights into evolution, divergence and functional analysis of NAC gene family in bread wheat. © 2019 Guérin et al.

Development of microbial communities and seepage dynamics driving the precipitation of authigenic carbonates remains poorly constrained, even though the source of methane-rich fluids, formation of Fe-rich carbonates, and the potential driving forces were previously reported. Here, petrologic observations, stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions, mineralogy, and lipid inventories of authigenic carbonates from the northern Okinawa Trough were analyzed. The carbonate minerals were comprised predominantly of aragonite, high-magnesium calcite, and siderite. The presence of molecular fossils diagnostic for anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) with pronounced 13C depletions (as low as −134‰), together with highly negative δ13Ccarb values (as low as −55.8‰), suggest that the carbonates precipitated from anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with microbial methane as the predominant carbon source. The difference between measured and calculated δ18Ocarb values (based on 0‰ of sea water δ18O vs V-SMOW) was higher than +3‰ in one of the carbonates (GGD16), reflecting an origin from gas hydrate dissociation. Most of the carbonates revealed δ18O offsets between measured and calculated values within +3‰ or a lower measured δ18O than calculated value, suggesting a mixture of methane-derived carbonates (low δ13C/high δ18O) and detrital origin carbonates (high δ13C/low δ18O). Biomarker patterns varied significantly among samples. A suite of 13C-depleted biomarkers indicated the predominance of an ANME-1 assemblage for all samples, suggesting carbonates formed at low to medium methane flux. The predominance of ANME-1, abundant detrital minerals, and allochthonous biomarkers, as well as low carbonate contents indicate that most samples formed at greater depth within the sediment column. Only one carbonate sample in this study is interpreted to have precipitated at relatively shallower depth, as indicated by the occurrence of crocetane, dominance of aragonite, and higher overall carbonate content. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Authigenic carbonates; Cold seeps; Lipid biomarkers; Methane seepage intensities; The Okinawa trough","Biomarkers; Calcite; Carbon; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Gas hydrates; Methane; Microorganisms; Seawater; Seepage; Sulfur compounds; Underwater mineralogy; Authigenic carbonates; Cold seeps; Lipid biomarkers; Methane seepages; Okinawa Trough; Iron compounds; authigenic mineral; biomarker; carbonate rock; cold seep; hydrocarbon seep; lipid; methane; seepage; East China Sea; Okinawa Trough; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058524027

While the public health workforce is concerned about climate change, local health department (LHD) administrators have reported insufficient knowledge and resources to address climate change. Minigrants from state to LHDs have been used to promote a variety of local public health initiatives. Objective: To describe the minigrant approach used by state health departments implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework, to highlight successes of this approach in promoting climate change preparedness at LHDs, and to describe challenges encountered. Design: Cross-sectional survey and discussion. Intervention: State-level recipients of CDC funding issued minigrants to local public health entities to promote climate change preparedness, adaptation, and resilience. Main Outcome Measures: The amount of funding, number of LHDs funded per state, goals, selection process, evaluation process, outcomes, successes, and challenges of the minigrant programs. Results: Six state-level recipients of CDC funding for BRACE framework implementation awarded minigrants ranging from $7700 to $28 500 per year to 44 unique local jurisdictions. Common goals of the minigrants included capacity building, forging partnerships with entities outside of health departments, incorporating climate change information into existing programs, and developing adaptation plans. Recipients of minigrants reported increases in knowledge, engagement with diverse stakeholders, and the incorporation of climate change content into existing programs. Challenges included addressing climate change in regions where the topic is politically sensitive, as well as the uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of local projects beyond the term of minigrant support. Conclusions: Minigrants can increase local public health capacity to address climate change. Jurisdictions that wish to utilize minigrant mechanisms to promote climate change adaptation and preparedness at the local level may benefit from the experience of the 6 states and 44 local health programs described. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

These wild and weedy cousins are valuable as a resource for adapting our food, forage, industrial and other crops to climate change. Many wild plant species are also directly used, especially for revegetation, and as medicinal and ornamental plants. North America is rich in these wild plant genetic resources. This book is a valuable reference that describes the important crop wild relatives and wild utilized species found in Canada, the United States and Mexico. The book highlights efforts taken by these countries to conserve and use wild resources and provides essential information on best practices for collecting and conserving them. Numerous maps using up-to-date information and methods illustrate the distribution of important species, and supplement detailed description on the potential value these resources have to agriculture, as well as their conservation statuses and needs. There is broad recognition of the urgent need to conserve plant diversity; however, a small fraction of wild species is distinguished by their potential to support agricultural production. Many of these species are common, even weedy, and are easily overshadowed by rare or endangered plants. Nevertheless, because of their genetic proximity to agriculturally important crops or direct use, they deserve to be recognized, celebrated, conserved, and made available to support food and agricultural security. This comprehensive two-volume reference will be valuable for students and scientists interested in economic botany, and for practitioners at all levels tasked with conserving plant biodiversity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

While organic amendments are predominantly applied to croplands, their application is increasingly proposed on relatively arid rangelands that do not typically receive fertilizers or other inputs, creating unique concerns for outcomes such as native plant diversity and water quality. To maximize environmental benefits and minimize potential harms, we must understand how soil, water, and plant communities respond to particular amendments and site conditions. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 92 studies in which organic amendments had been added to arid, semiarid, or Mediterranean rangelands. We found that organic amendments, on average, provide some environmental benefits (increased soil carbon, soil water holding capacity, aboveground net primary productivity, and plant tissue nitrogen; decreased runoff quantity), as well as some environmental harms (increased concentrations of soil lead, runoff nitrate, and runoff phosphorus; increased soil CO 2 emissions). Published data were inadequate to fully assess impacts to native plant communities. In our models, adding higher amounts of amendment benefitted four outcomes and harmed two outcomes, whereas adding amendments with higher nitrogen concentrations benefitted two outcomes and harmed four outcomes. This suggests that trade-offs among outcomes are inevitable; however, applying low-N amendments was consistent with both maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. Short study time frames (median 1–2 years), limited geographic scope, and, for some outcomes, few published studies limit longer-term inferences from these models. Nevertheless, they provide a starting point to develop site-specific amendment application strategies aimed toward realizing the potential of this practice to contribute to climate change mitigation while minimizing negative impacts on other environmental goals. © 2018 The Authors.

Measurements of radiocarbon (14C) in methane (CH4) may provide a method for identifying regional CH4 emissions from fossil versus biogenic sources because adding 14C-free fossil carbon reduces the 14C/C ratio (Δ14CH4) in atmospheric CH4 much more than biogenic carbon does. We describe an approach for estimating fossil and biogenic CH4 at regional scales using atmospheric Δ14CH4 observations. As a case study to demonstrate expected Δ14CH4 and Δ14CH4-CH4 relationships, we simulate and compare Δ14CH4 at a network of sites in California using two gridded CH4 emissions estimates (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, EDGAR, and Gridded Environmental Protection Agency, GEPA) and the CarbonTracker-Lagrange model for 2014, and for 2030 under business-as-usual and mitigation scenarios. The fossil fraction of CH4 (F) is closely linked with the simulated Δ14CH4-CH4 slope and differences of 2–21% in median F are found for EDGAR versus GEPA in 2014, and 7–10% for business-as-usual and mitigation scenarios in 2030. Differences of 10% in F for &gt;200 ppb of added CH4 produce differences of &gt;10‰ in Δ14CH4, which are likely detectable from regular observations. Nuclear power plant 14CH4 emissions generally have small simulated median influences on Δ14CH4 (0–7‰), but under certain atmospheric conditions they can be much stronger (&gt;30‰) suggesting they must be considered in applications of Δ14CH4 in California. This study suggests that atmospheric Δ14CH4 measurements could provide powerful constraints on regional CH4 emissions, complementary to other monitoring techniques. © 2019.

This paper applies the method to travel to school data, and assesses health and carbon benefits based on nationwide scenarios of cycling uptake. Methods: The 2011 National School Census provides origin-destination data for all state-funded schools in England (N = 7,442,532 children aged 2–18 in 21,443 schools). Using this dataset, we modelled propensity to cycle as a function of route distance and hilliness between home and school. We generated scenarios, including ‘Go Dutch’ – in which English children were as likely to cycle as Dutch children, accounting for trip distance and hilliness. We estimated changes in the level of cycling, walking, and driving, and associated impacts on physical activity and carbon emissions. Results: In 2011, 1.8% of children cycled to school (1.0% in primary school, 2.7% in secondary school). If Dutch levels of cycling were reached, under the Go Dutch scenario, this would rise to 41.0%, a 22-fold increase. This is larger than the 6-fold increase in Go Dutch for adult commuting. This would increase total physical activity among pupils by 57%, and reduce transport-related carbon emissions by 81 kilotonnes/year. These impacts would be substantially larger in secondary schools than primary schools (a 96% vs. 9% increase in physical activity, respectively). Conclusion: Cycling to school is uncommon in England compared with other Northern European countries. Trip distances and hilliness alone cannot explain the difference, suggesting substantial unmet potential.

In this work, all-alkynyl-protected [Ag74(C≡CPh)44](NO3)2 cluster (Ag cluster) with a well-defined structure was firstly intercalated in α-zirconium phosphate (α-ZrP) through ion-exchange. Then the atomically precise Ag cluster can be immobilized robustly in the support by a sequential process of carbonization, calcination and reduction. The supported Ag cluster showed the relatively high catalytic activity (TOF=222.9-445.8 h−1) and excellent recyclability for hydrogenation of a variety of nitroaromatics, as well as the compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds even if the loading of Ag was as low as 0.72 wt.%. Zirconium pyrophosphate acts as not only a stabilizer of Ag cluster through a spatial confinement, but also an adsorption site for nitroaromatics. The residual carbon arisen from thermal decomposition of all-alkynyl ligand coordinating on Ag cluster exerted an important role in protecting Ag cluster from sintering. As a result, the intercalation of Ag cluster in the interlayer region is a promising strategy for extending their potential applications in catalysis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ag nanocluster; Carbonization; Hydrogenation of nitroaromatics; Intercalation; Zirconium phosphate","Carbon; Carbonization; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Decomposition; Hydrogenation; Intercalation; Ion exchange; Nanoclusters; Phosphates; Sintering; Ag nanoclusters; Carbon-carbon double bonds; Interlayer regions; Nitro-aromatics; Sequential process; Spatial confinement; Well-defined structures; Zirconium phosphate; Zirconium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060734543

Despite their own vulnerability, women are often responsible for caring for close relatives, extended families and friends during hazardous and traumatic events (whether its famine, floods, drought or forced displacements). Based on experience and knowledge it is believed that women are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than men, primarily as they constitute the majority of the world's poor and are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change. The paper proposes a gender sensitive vulnerable assessment framework that is scaffolded by three key concepts: exposure, temporality and resource base. Because the study is grounded in the Capability Approach Framework it captures multi-dimensionality and intangible goods which are emotions such as fear, anger, shock or shame. It seeks to better understand the differentiated responses of men and women to climate variations and stress such as extreme heat, cold, droughts or floods in a specific site, Lambani, in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The main aim is to understand different responses of men and women to climate change in order to design and populate a vulnerability assessment (VA) framework. In order to do so the Capability Approach (CA) is applied as a theoretical frame with its lens on diversity and social justice. The CA thus provides an expanded notion of human well-being that taps into the emotional life of women and men in Lambani. © 2019 Institute for Human Geography.","Capability Approach; climate change; emotions; gender; Limpopo Province; resilience; social justice; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106685284

Two prominent health risks are poor air quality and physical inactivity. We aim to review the literature and state the best practices for clean air and active transportation in urban areas. Recent Findings: Cities have been targeting reductions in air pollution and physical inactivity to improve population health. Oslo, Paris, and Madrid plan on banning cars from their city centers to mitigate climate change, reduce vehicle emissions, and increase walking and cycling. Urban streets are being redesigned to accommodate and integrate various modes of transportation to ensure individuals can become actively mobile and healthy. Investments in pedestrian, cycling, and public transport infrastructure and services can both improve air quality and support active transportation. Emerging technologies like electric and autonomous vehicles are being developed and may reduce air pollution but have limited impact on physical activity. Green spaces too can mitigate air pollution and encourage physical activity. Summary: Clean air and active transportation overlap considerably as they are both functions of mobility. The best practices of clean air and active transportation have produced impressive results, which are improved when enacted simultaneously in integrated policy packages. Further research is needed in middle- and low-income countries, using measurements from real-world interventions, tracing air pollution back to the sources responsible, and holistically addressing the entire spectrum of exposures and health outcomes related to transportation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Active transportation; Air pollution; Best practices; Cities; Clean air; Physical activity; Public health","air pollution; city; climate change; cycling; exercise; exhaust gas; human; legislation and jurisprudence; motor vehicle; prevention and control; procedures; traffic and transport; urban population; walking; Air Pollution; Bicycling; Cities; Climate Change; Exercise; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Transportation; Urban Population; Vehicle Emissions; Walking",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062999718

Climatic variables have been the most commonly used environmental data in transfer zone development, even though soils are also a primary selective force on plants. We assessed the importance of including soils in seed transfer zones using Bromus marginatus, a native grass used for restoration and revegetation in the western United States, as an example. Seeds were collected from 64 populations across Montana and Idaho and grown in a common garden for two years. We assessed among-population variation based on 11 traits related to germination rate, plant size, vigor, inflorescence number, survival, and carbon isotope discrimination (∆13), and used this variation to develop seed transfer zone maps using two approaches: (1) a conventional approach, using only climatic variables (climate only) and (2) an expanded approach that included soils and climatic variables (soils + climate). The most influential drivers of trait variation were factors related to soil water availability: soil order, available water content (AWC), and organic carbon levels. Populations from areas with andic soils, which have high soil AWC and soil organic carbon, had low germination, limited first-year survival, low ∆13, and small seeds. Growing season length and winter temperatures were also predictive of trait variation. In comparison to climate-only models, soils + climate models explained 11% more variance (120% relative increase) for ∆13 and an average of 4.5% more (27% relative increase) for growth traits and survival. The transfer zone map developed using soils + climate differed from the climate-only map in both spatial pattern of ecotypic variation and number of transfer zones; the soils + climate map had more zones and a higher proportion of small (&lt;4 km2) transfer zone patches, while the climate-only map had more large patches &gt;37 km2. Including soils in transfer zone development may identify adaptive trait variation that is obscured by large-scale differences in climate and could improve plant materials used for ecosystem management. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","Andisols; genecology; mountain brome; restoration; seed transfer zones; soils; water use efficiency","Andisol; carbon isotope; climate conditions; environmental restoration; grass; native species; revegetation; seed; soil; soil water; transfer zone; water use efficiency; Idaho; Montana; United States; Bromus; Bromus marginatus; Bromus; ecosystem; Montana; plant seed; soil; Bromus; Ecosystem; Montana; Seeds; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062258717

This study investigates the energy production of five energy hubs in a smart energy network set up for minimizing the energy cost and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions under different technology scenarios at a Canadian community. The energy hubs present twenty Canadian buildings’ archetypes: sixteen single residential buildings, primary school, quick service restaurant, office, and supermarket. The hubs are interconnected by thermal and electricity grid and are sharing the locally generated energy to meet the demand loads. Three scenarios, each employing different energy technologies at hubs level were developed and investigated. The performance results were compared to a reference case. A complex optimization model was developed to minimize the energy consumption and environmental impact. The results showed that integrating different residential and commercial buildings with associated generation technologies in smart energy network allows energy sharing among them, enhancing overall efficiency and reducing energy and emissions costs. The study also showed that with this approach an electrical storage capacity of 25% of average electrical load had the lowest energy cost and environmental impact.

In all simulation cases, CO2 is injected from the top of the fracture in a fracture-matrix block system and displaces oil toward the bottom of the block. Our numerical models provide comprehensive sensitivity analyses that are proved to be important for the upscaling of CO2 injection from lab to reservoir scale. In addition, we address the scale dependency of the diffusion mechanism in a large matrix-fracture domain. In our earlier studies, we have conducted a significant number of reservoir-condition CO2 flood experiments by employing fractured core systems and North Sea reservoir oil. Our experimental and numerical studies are proved to be useful to investigate the complex physical phenomena affecting the efficiency of CO2 injection in oil recovery from a fracture reservoir. The height of the core plugs used in our experiments varies from 7 to 28 cm while the fracture spacing varies between ∼4 cm and 12 cm. In all cases, we find the important role of diffusion mechanism in increasing oil recovery in a fracture-matrix system at the lab scale. However, the field matrix block size is often 1-to-2 orders of magnitude larger than that in the lab scale. Recovery mechanisms are significantly affected by the matrix dimension. For instance, the impact of diffusion mechanism on oil recovery may alter with the size of the matrix block and the fracture spacing. This highlights the importance of upscaling from lab to the field scale that is addressed in this study. We employ a compositional reservoir simulation with a developed equation of state (EOS) to model CO2 injection in a fracture-matrix system at reservoir conditions. In all the numerical simulations, the single-porosity (SP) model consists of a single axial fracture with a typical fracture aperture of 1 mm. The SP model also contains a single matrix block that feeds the producer through fracture next to it. The dimension of the fracture-matrix block varies in the SP models to account for the scale dependency of the results. In our modeling framework, we assume a network of open fractures that are homogenously distributed in the reservoir and links the oil in the matrix to the production wells. We initialize the matrix with the North-Sea-Chalk-Field (NSCF) live oil and the fracture with the injected gas (CO2). The whole displacement process is operated at the constant reservoir conditions of 3750 psia and 110 °C, representing typical NSCF reservoir conditions. Prior to conducting simulations, we successfully tune EOS parameters against the extensive PVT data, sampled from a specific fractured NSCF reservoir. The tuned EOS model assures the proper estimation of the complex phase and volumetric properties for CO2 and oil mixtures at reservoir conditions. In addition, the multi-component diffusion coefficients that are tuned using experimental data are employed as input parameters for the compositional simulations. We study the effect of several key parameters on oil recovery; e.g. matrix block size, fracture spacing, CO2 injection rate, density difference, vaporization and the diffusion. The results show that the mass transport is mainly dominated by diffusion in the lab scale which is not the case for the large matrix block size. Finally, we test the accuracy of the dual-porosity (DP) model against the SP model at various displacement conditions. Results show that when diffusion and vaporization are significant the DP model fails to predict the results of the SP reservoir model. Our findings are an important step towards modeling the tertiary-CO2 flooding in an actual fracture-chalk system. We also provide some important inputs that are necessary for upscaling tertiary-CF from a lab-scale into a field-scale reservoir model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Diffusion; Equation of state (EOS); Sea-water flooding; Single-fracture/matrix system; Tertiary-CF","Carbon dioxide; Complex networks; Diffusion; Equations of state; Floods; Fracture; Laboratories; Limestone; Matrix algebra; Numerical models; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Porosity; Reservoirs (water); Seawater; Sensitivity analysis; Vaporization; Volumetric analysis; Compositional Reservoir; Compositional simulations; Equation of state; Experimental and numerical studies; Fracture-matrix systems; Fractured oil reservoirs; Multi-component diffusion; Single fracture; Offshore gas fields",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060340613

In addition, the diffusive dual-fuel combustion applied at high engine load produces considerable soot amounts that should be reduced within the diesel particulate filter (DPF). Based on these facts, this work intends to evaluate the efficiency of a commercial aftertreatment system (DOC + DPF) while operating in dual-mode dual-fuel combustion. Additionally, fundamental studies where developed to understand the impact of the combination of fuels on the exhaust hydrocarbon species. First, the DOC performance was evaluated at steady-state and transient conditions under different operating conditions fulfilling the EUVI NOx and soot limits. In parallel, the different engine-out hydrocarbon species were measured by means of a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) gas analyzer. Finally, the passive and active regeneration processes were assessed by means of different methodologies aiming to evaluate the low NOx-low soot interaction and the capability of the active regeneration in dual-fuel dual-mode (DMDF) operating conditions. The DOC results showed an improper conversion efficiency at low load operating condition, where the exhaust temperature is low. By contrast, the thermal inertia at transient conditions allowed to improve the DOC behavior at low load, reaching DOC-out emissions one order of magnitude lower than those from the steady-state tests. Concerning the DPF, it was demonstrated that the low concentration of NOx and soot produced during the combustion does not lead to sensible changes in the NO2/NOx ratio before and after the DPF, indicating a low level/absence of passive regeneration. In the case of the active regeneration, both conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and DMDF operating conditions can obtain satisfactory reduction in the total soot trapped, being the increase in the exhaust temperature consequence of the HC and CO conversion the supporting mechanism for the active regeneration in the DMDF concept. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aftertreatment; Catalyst; Dual fuel combustion; Emissions; Particulate filter; Speciation","Catalysts; Diesel engines; Dust; Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Passive filters; Soot; After-treatment; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Diesel particulate filters; Different operating conditions; Dual fuel combustion; Particulate filters; Speciation; Steady state and transients; Dual fuel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060889344

The generation of more reduced chemicals, especially multicarbon oxygenate and hydrocarbon products (C2+) with higher energy densities, is highly desirable for industrial applications. However, selective conversion of CO2 to C2+ suffers from a high overpotential, a low reaction rate and low selectivity, and the process is extremely sensitive to the catalyst structure and electrolyte. Here we discuss strategies to achieve high C2+ selectivity through rational design of the catalyst and electrolyte. Current state-of-the-art catalysts, including Cu and Cu–bimetallic catalysts, as well as some alternative materials, are considered. The importance of taking into consideration the dynamic evolution of the catalyst structure and composition are highlighted, focusing on findings extracted from in situ and operando characterizations. Additional theoretical insight into the reaction mechanisms underlying the improved C2+ selectivity of specific catalyst geometries and compositions in synergy with a well-chosen electrolyte are also provided. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",,"Carbon dioxide; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Industrial chemicals; Product design; Alternative materials; Anthropogenic carbon; Bimetallic catalysts; Catalyst structures; Higher energy density; Hydrocarbon product; Reaction mechanism; Renewable energies; Catalyst selectivity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062605147

The assembly-induced emission starts from the structural diffraction of CNC, whose wavelength is adjusted into the ultraviolet (UV) region for hiding information under natural light. The small diameter (≈10 nm) of CNCs then promotes the resonance between the vertically assembled CNCs and the UV light, leading to a strong blue emission with an emitting quantum efficiency as high as 13.90%. By introducing the vertical-assembly film with a specific pattern into paper materials, an anti-counterfeiting image is obtained under a UV radiation.

Upstream and Technical Services, San Donato Milanese, MI  20097, Italy","The transition from the Middle to Late Ordovician cold climate to the Silurian greenhouse phase was marked by major climatic and oceanographic changes. The vast epereic sea that during the early Paleozoic extended over the Baltic Plate for hundreds of kilometres recorded the dynamic processes that characterized this important climatic evolution. This shallow epicontinental sea experienced phases of hypoxic conditions for millions of years during the Silurian favouring the sedimentation of organic-rich deposits. A continuous core drilled in the Silurian fine-grained succession of the Baltic Basin was studied integrating sedimentological, palynological and geochemical data. The succession, deposited in a restricted environment in low-energy settings, recorded three long-term variations in bottom-water redox conditions. Our data highlight a direct control of long-term climatic changes on oceanic redox cycles. Phases of cool and dry climate with reduced runoff alternated with periods of warmer and humid conditions with higher runoff and fluvial discharge. During warmer and more humid climatic phases, the presence of a stable pycnocline hampered deep-water renewal efficiency, and together with increased nutrients led by enhanced weathering and runoff favoured the onset of anoxic bottom-water conditions. Cooler and drier intervals favoured instead a weaker and less stable pycnocline that, coupled with more oligotrophic conditions, drove the formation of oxic bottom-waters. The variation through time in water salinity and temperature influenced both the type of organic matter in the surface waters as well as its preservation along the water column. In fact, the extended residence time at the stable pycnocline during the anoxic phases led to the degradation of the organic matter and limited its accumulation at the sediment-water interface. The waning of the latest Ordovician cooling to the Silurian greenhouse climate was characterized by the progressive alternation of cool phases and warmer periods. The effect of this dynamic climatic instability on the redox state of the Baltica epicontinental sea protracted over millions of years up to the middle Silurian. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anoxia; Black shale; Epereic sea; Major and trace element geochemistry; Organic matter; Paleozoic","anoxic conditions; black shale; climate; climate variation; geochemical survey; hypoxic conditions; inland sea; Ordovician; organic matter; Paleozoic; palynology; pycnocline; residence time; sedimentary sequence; Silurian; trace element; Baltic Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059143338

However, these studies are rarely conducted for a long enough time to observe succession and competitive dynamics in a community context, limiting inferences for long-lived species. Furthermore, the genetic basis of local adaptation and genetic associations with climate has rarely been identified. Here, we report on a long-term (6-year) experiment conducted under natural conditions focused on Andropogon gerardii, the dominant grass of the North American Great Plains tallgrass ecosystem. We focus on this foundation grass that comprises 80% of tallgrass prairie biomass and is widely used in 20,000 km 2 of restoration. Specifically, we asked the following questions: (a) Whether ecotypes are locally adapted to regional climate in realistic ecological communities. (b) Does adaptive genetic variation underpin divergent phenotypes across the climate gradient? (c) Is there evidence of local adaptation if the plants are exposed to competition among ecotypes in mixed ecotype plots? Finally, (d) are local adaptation and genetic divergence related to climate? Reciprocal gardens were planted with 3 regional ecotypes (originating from dry, mesic, wet climate sources) of Andropogon gerardii across a precipitation gradient (500–1,200 mm/year) in the US Great Plains. We demonstrate local adaptation and differentiation of ecotypes in wet and dry environments. Surprisingly, the apparent generalist mesic ecotype performed comparably under all rainfall conditions. Ecotype performance was underpinned by differences in neutral diversity and candidate genes corroborating strong differences among ecotypes. Ecotype differentiation was related to climate, primarily rainfall. Without long-term studies, wrong conclusions would have been reached based on the first two years. Further, restoring prairies with climate-matched ecotypes is critical to future ecology, conservation, and sustainability under climate change. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Andropogon gerardii; climate change; ecotypes; experimental selection; genetic variation; intraspecific variation","adaptation; climate change; competition (ecology); ecotype; experimental study; genetic variation; grass; identification method; interspecific variation; Great Plains; Andropogon gerardii; adaptation; Andropogon; climate change; ecotype; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; grassland; physiology; time factor; United States; Adaptation, Physiological; Andropogon; Climate Change; Ecotype; Genetic Variation; Grassland; Midwestern United States; Selection, Genetic; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059576498

Biogas is the emerging bio-energy in the rural area of the region through biogas development program for potential households. The current biogas digesters are evaluated using onsite data collection in collaboration with the regional biogas program office. The emissions from each stage of the biogas production process are estimated using life cycle approach. The socio-economic benefits from the biogas implementation are addressed considering well-known socio-economic indicators like net present value, payback period, benefit cost ratio, and women's opportunity cost. The results show that there is a huge biogas potential in the region at 223 PJ per annum. Currently, there are about 4500 operational household biogas digesters in the region providing 0.13 PJ per year, only 0.058% of the total theoretical potential. The biogas digesters employed (4500) reduces about 1984 tonnes CO2eq of GHG emissions per year. In addition, other indoor pollutants like CO, NMOC, and PM10 are also reduced at 1517, 108, and 41 tonnes per annum, respectively. The benefit cost ratio of 1.8 and a short payback period (∼2 years) shows that the sector development is promising. The exhaustive utilization of the available cow manure potential will result in women's benefit of about 890,300 US$ per annum.

In particular, the excessive application of chemical fertilizer has led to large emissions of reactive nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, where they become significant components of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. Intercropping has been considered as a sustainable agricultural practice that can reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture, but its potential benefits beyond the farm scale have rarely been examined. Here we develop a new parameterization scheme for belowground mutualistic interactions between intercropped crops in the DeNitificaiton-DeComposition biogeochemical model, which is then used to simulate and quantify the benefits of nationwide adoption of maize-soybean systems in China in terms of gains in crop production, decreases in fertilizer consumption, and reductions in ammonia (NH3) emission. We further examine how such a decline in NH3 emission could lessen the downwind formation of PM2.5 using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. We show that annual mean inorganic PM2.5 concentrations can be reduced by up to 1.5 μg m-3 with the nationwide adoption of maize-soybean intercropping, with a corresponding annual net economic benefit of US$67 billion, of which US$13 billion arises from saved health costs from reduced air pollution. This study demonstrates the economic and environmental values of intercropping systems in dually promoting food security and environmental health, which can serve as a basis for policy consideration as governments and stakeholders explore more sustainable farming options. © 2019 2018 The Author(s).

This article highlights the role of a group of actors whose practices have so far received little attention in the study of climate change governance, namely the public servants who are responsible for the everyday implementation of national climate change policies and associated programmes on the ground. Situated at the frontline of the state and often engaging directly with citizens, these “interface bureaucrats” occupy a complex position in which they must balance their role as representatives of the state with the need to accommodate the pressures, interests and practical challenges associated with everyday policy implementation. In this article we examine how interface bureaucrats in Zambia seek to navigate this role as they go about implementing national climate change adaptation policies in practice, and what this means for the nature and outcome of these interventions. We identify key dilemmas of the interface bureaucrats in our study areas, namely (i) intervening with limited reach, (ii) implementing generic policies, and (iii) managing conflicting interests. We show how they address these dilemmas through highly pragmatic practices involving informal agreements with community members, discretionary adjustments of official policies, and negotiation of contested interventions. As a result, the nature and outcomes of climate change adaptation interventions end up differently from the official policies and the underlying governance interests of the central state.

Application of the K-means clustering method on a historical reconstruction of SIT from 1958 to 2013, produced by an ocean-sea-ice general circulation model, identifies three Arctic SIT clusters or modes of climate variability. These SIT modes have consistent patterns in different calendar months and their discrete time series of occurrences show persistence on intraseasonal to interannual time scales. We use the EC-Earth2.3 coupled climate model to produce five-member 12-month-long monthly forecasts of the NH SIT modes initialized on 1 May and 1 November every year from 1979 to 2010. We use a three-state first-order Markov chain and climatological probability forecasts determined from the historical SIT mode reconstruction as two statistical reference forecasts. The analysis of ranked probability skill scores (RPSSs) relating these three forecast systems shows that the dynamical SIT mode forecasts typically have a higher skill than the Markov chain forecasts, which are overall better than climatological forecasts. The evolution of RPSS in forecast time indicates that the transition from the sea-ice melting season to growing season in the EC-Earth2.3 forecasts, with respect to the Markov chain model, typically leads to the improvement of prediction skill. The reliability diagrams overall show better reliability of the dynamical forecasts than that of the Markov chain model, especially for 1 May start dates, while dynamical forecasts with 1 November start dates are overconfident. The relative operating characteristics (ROC) diagrams confirm this hierarchy of forecast skill among these three forecast systems. Furthermore, ROC diagrams stratified in groups of 3 sequential forecast months show that Arctic SIT mode forecasts initialized on 1 November typically lose resolution with forecast time more slowly than forecasts initialized on 1 May. © 2018, The Author(s).","Arctic; Climate variability; Coupled climate prediction; GCM reconstruction; K-means cluster analysis; Markov chain model; Prediction skill; Reliability and ROC diagrams; RPSS; Sea ice thickness","atmospheric general circulation model; climate prediction; climate variation; climatology; cluster analysis; ice thickness; Markov chain; sea ice; weather forecasting; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049569243

A particular focus is placed on the human security risks associated with the three elements. Recent Findings: Climate change has been perceived as a “threat multiplier,” directly aggravating human security risks, such as food and water insecurity, as well as indirectly contributing to (violent) conflict in regions vulnerable to climate change. In addition to climate change–related environmental risks, such as droughts and floods, land and land use can be affected by climate mitigation and adaptation measures. These include, for instance, large-scale renewable energy plants and relocation efforts. Summary: It is not only important for decision-makers to take climate change impacts into account but also to assess the indirect risks associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. For further research, it is hence promising to explore how conflict-sensitive approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation can be developed. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Conflict; Land use; REDD+; Renewable energy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060951795

The proposed statistical framework is at the nexus of extreme value theory (EVT) and functional data analysis (FDA) and enables computation of probabilities of yet unobserved rare events that are not seen in historical records. Data from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program, which has produced computer model predictions of current and future temperatures across much of North America, are used. The approach allows for the computation of probabilities for heat waves of any pre-specified temporal duration, spatial extent, and overall magnitude.

The role of climate, geology, geomorphology, land-use/cover, hydrogeochemistry, hydraulics, human activities among other features is significant in urban areas. In addition, land-use development has a stronger influence on terrestrial hydrology than climate variability. The need for provision of safe water, sanitation and drainage systems is key elements to consider for the groundwater resources in complex urban environments. In recent years, a new focus has emerged, addressing issues on integrated GIS mapping studies on urban water supply systems, particularly in historical cities. To illustrate that approach the Porto urban area (NW Portugal) was selected.

Samples were collected to study palynological groups, sedimentary facies, and geochemistry analyses (δ 13 C, δ 15 N, TOC, TN, C:N ratio, TS, and C:S ratio), synchronized with four radiocarbon ages. The main result of this research was the mangrove succession, divided into three palynological zones composing two facies association: (1) herbaceous tidal flat and (2) mangrove tidal flat. The first zone between at least ~1815 and ~1629 cal. yr BP was marked by the mangrove absence with marine particulate organic carbon, C 3 terrestrial plants, and macrophytes organic matter influence with δ 13 C values between −26.7‰ and −20‰, δ 15 N values x̅ = 3.5‰ and C:N around 21.8. The second zone between ~1629 and ~853 cal. yr BP was marked by the mangrove establishment represented only by Laguncularia pollen under influence of estuarine organic matter (δ 13 C x̅ = −26.5‰; δ 15 N x̅ = 3.2‰, and C:N around 16.4). The third zone reveals an increase of Laguncularia and presence of Avicennia pollen since ~853 cal. yr BP. Near the surface (&lt;10 cm) occurs Rhizophora pollen, indicating the establishment of this genus during the past decades, under the modern environmental condition (δ 13 C x̅ = −27.02‰; δ 15 N x̅ = 3.12‰, and C:N around 17.42). This mangrove vertical succession may be associated with the low-temperature tolerance, where the sequence Rhizophora, Avicennia, and Laguncularia occurs from the northern to the southern limits of Santa Catarina coast, respectively, reflecting the temperature gradient. Therefore, probably, the establishment of the mangrove assemblage identified along the studied pollen profile was influenced by a temperature increase of air and water during the late-Holocene and, considering the Rhizophora genus, only during the past decades. © The Author(s) 2018.","carbon and nitrogen isotopes; palynology; sedimentary features; South America","carbon isotope; climate change; coastal plain; geochemical survey; mangrove; nitrogen isotope; palynology; particulate organic matter; population dynamics; sediment analysis; soil organic matter; subtropical region; tidal flat; Atlantic Ocean; Brazil; Brazilian Shelf; Santa Catarina; Avicennia; Laguncularia; Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060185187

A mixed methods technique was carried out and desk study was conducted in order to get a full insight into the agricultural practices and the perceptions of gender. A semi-structured questionnaire was developed and an exploration of impacts was made rough in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The study was discerned information about Adaptation practices of the community and obstacles faced by women were also scrutinized. A simple random sampling technique was deployed and sample of 101 respondents. Data was tabulated and graphs were made using Microsoft Excel. Statistical Analysis was carried out using R-software, and variance was determined by using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). A highest variance of about (35.7%) was observed in gender role in decision making i.e., land allocations, proposing inequality in property rights. A high majority of respondents (n=81) perceived changing climatic conditions. Responses of major climatic hazards encountered were also reported and high variance of (49.3%) was observed for loss of livestock and money. Maximum level of illiteracy among the family members of respondents was observed (n=241) suggesting less awareness among the inhabitants.

In order to accept an experiment, CORDEX provides experiment guidelines, specifications of regional domains, and data access and archiving. CORDEX experiments are important to study climate at the regional scale, and at the same time, they also have a very prominent role in providing regional climate data of high quality. Data requirements are intended to cover all the possible needs of stakeholders and scientists working on climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in various scientific communities. The required data and diagnostics are grouped into different levels of frequency and priority, and some of them even have to be provided as statistics (minimum, maximum, mean) over different time periods. Most commonly, scientists need to post-process the raw output of regional climate models, since the latter was not originally designed to meet the specific CORDEX data requirements. This postprocessing procedure includes the computation of diagnostics, statistics, and final homogenization of the data, which is often computationally costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the development of specialized software and/or code is required. The current paper presents the development of a specialized module (version 1.3) for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model capable of outputting the required CORDEX variables. Additional diagnostic variables not required by CORDEX, but of potential interest to the regional climate modeling community, are also included in the module. ""Generic"" definitions of variables are adopted in order to overcome the model and/or physics parameterization dependence of certain diagnostics and variables, thus facilitating a robust comparison among simulations. The module is computationally optimized, and the output is divided into different priority levels following CORDEX specifications (Core, Tier 1, and additional) by selecting pre-compilation flags. This implementation of the module does not add a significant extra cost when running the model; for example, the addition of the Core variables slows the model time step by less than a 5 %. The use of the module reduces the requirements of disk storage by about a 50 %. The module performs neither additional statistics over different periods of time nor homogenization of the output data. © Author(s) 2019.",,"climate change; climate modeling; data acquisition; data interpretation; parameterization; regional climate; software; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063327601

A promising instrument to address this need is biochar – a charcoal made from pyrolyzed organic material. However, it is often unclear how, if at all, biochar improves soil water availability, plant water consumption rates and crop yields. To address this question, we synthesized literature-derived observational data and evaluated the effects of biochar on evapotranspiration using a minimal soil water balance model. Results from the model were interpreted in the Budyko framework to assess how climatic conditions mediate the impacts of biochar on water fluxes. Our analysis of literature-derived observational data showed that while biochar addition generally increases the soil water holding capacity, it can have variable impacts on soil water retention relative to control conditions. Our modelling demonstrated that biochar increases long-term evapotranspiration rates, and therefore plant water availability, by increasing soil water retention capacity – especially in water-limited regions. Biochar amendments generally increased crop yields (75% of the compiled studies) and, in several cases (35% of the compiled studies), biochar amendments simultaneously increased crop yield and water use efficiencies. Hence, while biochar amendments are promising, the potential for variable impact highlights the need for targeted research on how biochar affects the soil-plant-water cycle. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Budyko-framework; Soil water balance model; Soil water retention curves; Soil-plant-water cycle; Water management","biochar; charcoal; unclassified drug; water; biochar; climate; ecosystem resilience; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; harvest; Note; physical chemistry; priority journal; synthesis; water and water related phenomena; water availability; water cycle; water holding capacity; water management; water retention; water storage; water supply; water transport; agriculture; chemistry; crop; physiology; procedures; soil; theoretical model; tropic climate; Agriculture; Charcoal; Crops, Agricultural; Models, Theoretical; Plant Transpiration; Soil; Tropical Climate; Water",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058226236

Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter of the microclimate conditions and can be freely and globally accessed through satellite images. This study explores the relationship between daytime and nighttime Aqua/MODIS LST and the urban morphology defined by local climate zones (LCZ) in accordance with the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) methodology. The vegetation cover from each LCZ was analyzed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Additionally, the geometric and surface properties of LCZs defined by the literature were tested against measured LSTs to explorer if expected correlations between surface properties and surface temperature could be found. The results show a strong negative correlation between LST and both NDVI and EVI. Generally, the LCZ classes with lower vegetation cover presented higher daytime and nighttime LST. Building surface fraction and impervious surfaces presented a positive correlation with nighttime LST and the pervious surface fraction presented a negative correlation with nighttime LST. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Land surface temperature; Local climate zone; MODIS; Vegetation cover; WUDAPT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057156060

Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660 ha) in the agreste of Paraíba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified. © 2018, The Author(s).","agreste; Brazil; ecosystem services valuation; land use land cover; microwatershed; natural resources; urbanisation","aridification; biome; caatinga; climate effect; contingent valuation; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; ecotone; GIS; implementation process; infrastructure planning; land cover; land use change; natural resource; remote sensing; semiarid region; service provision; spatial planning; tropical region; urbanization; water resource; watershed; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Paraiba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048048005

Air pollution abatement scrubbers were placed in different urban areas and in industrial production sites. In particular, the results obtained in one fiberglass production facility showed a reduction in particulate matter of 46.3–99.9% in the size range 0.50–0.00 µm throughout the experimentation period. The aqueous solutions coming from the scrubbers, placed in different sites, were collected, analyzed and treated in order to regenerate the water and make it available for the periodic refilling of the scrubber’s tanks. Coagulation, precipitation, carbon adsorption and Fenton processes were applied in order to design a suitable integrated process able to treat all the samples coming from the scrubbers. The reduction in total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, phenols and chemical oxygen demand was higher than 85% by the Fenton process, demonstrating that water is completely recoverable and reusable. Alternatively, the treated water can be discharged into a surface water body. Based on the results from the experimental campaign, a mobile plant was designed in order to treat such wastewater. Depending on the physicochemical parameters of the wastewater, specific treatments can be chosen and carried out by such mobile plant. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Air pollution; Fenton; Particulate matter; Scrubber; Wastewater","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Chemical oxygen demand; Chemical water treatment; Dissolved oxygen; River pollution; Scrubbers; Solutions; Surface waters; Urban growth; Wastewater; Air pollution abatement; Experimental campaign; Fenton; Industrial production; Particulate Matter; Physicochemical parameters; Total dissolved solids; Total suspended solids; Wastewater treatment; adsorption; aqueous solution; atmospheric pollution; chemical oxygen demand; chemical reaction; coagulation; industrial production; particulate matter; physicochemical property; precipitation (chemistry); purification; reduction; surface water; urban area; urban pollution; wastewater; wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047912755

In this study, we aimed to assess the variations, sources, and lifetime excessive cancer risk (ECR) attributable to PAHs bound to ambient particulate matters with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in metropolitan Beijing, China. We collected 24-hour integrated PM2.5 samples on daily basis between November 2014 and June 2015 across both central heating (cold months) and non-heating (warm months) seasons, and further analyzed the PAH components in these daily PM2.5 samples. Our results showed that total concentrations of PM2.5-bound PAHs varied between (88.6 ± 75.4) ng/m3 in the cold months and (11.0 ± 5.9) ng/m3 in the warm months. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), the carcinogenic marker of PAHs, averaged at 5.7 and 0.4 ng/m3 in the cold and warm months, respectively. Source apportionment analyses illustrated that gasoline, biomass burning, diesel, coal combustion and cooking were the major contributors, accounting for 12.9%, 17.8%, 24.7%, 24.3% and 6.4% of PM2.5-bound PAHs, respectively. The BaP equivalent lifetime ECR from inhalation of PM2.5-bound PAHs was 16.2 cases per million habitants. Our results suggested that ambient particulate reduction from energy reconstruction and adaption of clean fuels would result in reductions PM2.5-bound PAHs and its associated cancer risks. However, as only particulate phased PAHs was analyzed in the present study, the concentration of ambient PAHs could be underestimated. © 2018","Cancer risk assessment; PAHs; PM2.5; Seasonal variation; Sources","Barium compounds; Coal combustion; Diseases; Elementary particle sources; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Particles (particulate matter); Risk assessment; Aerodynamic diameters; Ambient particulate Matter; Cancer risk assessments; Energy reconstruction; PM2.5; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Seasonal variation; Source apportionment; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; cancer; concentration (composition); health risk; PAH; particulate matter; risk assessment; seasonal variation; source apportionment; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air pollutant; analysis; chemically induced; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; human; neoplasm; particulate matter; risk assessment; season; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Beijing; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Neoplasms; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Risk Assessment; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047178962

Accordingly, firewood saving, improved stoves called “Mirt” made of cement and “Gonzie” made of local clay soils were made in 1980s in energy sector of Ethiopia. However, the dissemination of Mirt stove was unknowingly limited and the potential of Gonzie was less known. In this study the two improved cook stoves, Mirt and Gonzie were compared with open stoves in biomass consumption and end use emission at three agro-ecologies (lowland, midland and highland)and corresponding sample peasant associations (PA)or Kebeles (Ener Kola, Daemir and Awed)in Enemorina Ener district (county), Southern Ethiopia in 2017. At hierarchical administrative level, first district energy offices were interviewed about stoves used in PA. Then the next administrative level called PA was selected in turn to select rural households and focus groups, in order to interview about the problems of getting Mirt stoves and to test the potential of local clay soils in making Gonzie stoves. In each PA, 30% of the houses with common cooking condition, about 6 to 21 households; 3–5 pottery workers; and PA representatives were interviewed. Then, Gonzie stoves were manufactured, and biomass consumption was evaluated using controlled cooking test. The results showed that the problems in dissemination of Mirt stoves were the unaffordable cost of stoves, lack of training in using improved stoves and inappropriate size plates. The households in remote lowland and highland PAs had no knowledge about improved stoves. The overall quality of Gonzie stoves of highland and lowland PAs were comparably better than the midland PA. Curing a single Gonzie stoves consumed 1.8 to 2.0 times greater firewood than the daily requirement of a household, but lower than the firewood for other clay based utensils that consume 42 to 75 kg firewood weekly. Gonzie stoves saved 33.9 to 54.2% of the firewood used by open stoves for baking “Injera”. The reduction in end use emission from Gonzie stoves was comparable to Mirt stoves. Therefore, rural households, and local pottery makers should be trained to use and manufacture improved stoves, respectively. In cooking food and curing local clay made utensils improved stoves should be used to save wood and protect fire damage. © 2019","Agro-ecology; Clay soils; Firewood; Pottery workers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065126003

Few studies considered all components of the pelagic MFW in freshwaters and mostly are from temperate regions. We investigated carbon partitioning in the CFC and the MFW in an Amazonian floodplain system and analyzed the strength of interactions among components through structure equation modeling. We hypothesized that (i) MFW contributes highly to total plankton biomass throughout the year; and (ii) all plankton communities increase in biomass during low water, increasing the role of trophic interactions. We collected 30 subsurface samples (nutrients and plankton communities). MFW predominated over CFC in carbon biomass, and plankton components and their interactions changed according to the contrasting water level. Because phosphorus can be a potentially limiting resource for strict primary producers, higher biomass and a more complex MFW occurred during low water. We concluded that hydrology is a key factor shaping biotic interactions during low-water periods, and that MFW plays a key role in floodplain lakes, being potential mixotrophy an important strategy for phytoplankton. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classical food chain; Microbial food web; Mixotrophy; Seasonal interactions; Structural equation modeling","bacterium; biomass allocation; floodplain; food chain; food web; interspecific interaction; lake ecosystem; phosphorus; phytoplankton; seasonality; trophic level; zooplankton; Amazonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059460020

Very few studies have carried out simulations of the dispersion pattern and ground-level concentration of pollutants emitted from real-world gas flares. The limited availability of official data on gas flares from the oil and gas industries makes accurate dispersion calculations difficult. Using ADMS 5 and AERMOD, this study assessed the sensitivity of dispersion and ground-level concentration of pollutants from gas flares in the Niger Delta to prevailing meteorological condition; fuel composition; and flare size. Although, during the non-WAM (West African Monsoon) months (November and March), the simulated ground-level concentrations of pollutants from a single flare are lower, the dispersion of pollutants is towards both the inland and coastal communities. In the WAM months, the ground-level concentrations are higher and are dispersed predominantly over the inland communities. Less buoyant plumes from smaller flares (lower volume flow rates) and/or flaring of fuel with lower heat content results in higher ground-level concentrations in areas closer to the flare. Considering the huge number of flares scattered around the region, a mitigation of the acute local pollution level would be to combine short stacks flaring at lower volume flow rates to enhance the volume flow rate of a single exhaust, and hence, the buoyancy of the plume exiting the stack. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Atmospheric movements; Buoyancy; Gas emissions; Atmospheric pollutants; Coastal communities; Dispersion patterns; Fuel compositions; Ground level concentrations; Meteorological condition; Oil and Gas Industry; West African Monsoon; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dispersion; fuel; gas; meteorology; pollutant source; size; article; flow rate; gas flaring; heat; human; meteorology; Niger; plume; pollutant; simulation; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Niger; Niger Delta; Nigeria; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorology; Niger; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059311230

In this article, the feasibility of providing electricity from a hybrid power system (HPS) comprising diesel/wind/photovoltaic (PV), and battery considering residential, public, and commercial buildings, consuming the largest portion of energy in Iran is investigated. Tehran, Kish Island, and Binalood are the chosen cities in Iran with distinctive geographic and climatic conditions. In order to determine the optimal design and operational planning of the HPS, the hourly electricity demand data is required to be over 8760 hs during a 1-yr study. The required hourly data was calculated by employing Carrier (HAP4.5) software. The economic analysis is performed based on net present cost (NPC), cost of energy (COE), diesel consumption, and renewable fraction for all cases by applying HOMER software. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are carried out to specify the impact of fuel cost on the system by considering two different diesel fuel systems.

Long-term (∼10-year) relationships are analysed to re-assess the “happiness–income paradox” (i.e. Easterlin paradox) which states that changes in national income and happiness are correlated in the short-term, but not in the long-term. We broaden the scope of Easterlin's analysis in two novel ways. First, the evidence for a “health–income” paradox is explored. Second, a parallel analysis using national consumption-based carbon footprints (instead of income) is conducted to explore complementary relationships with both of the wellbeing indicators. We show that countries with declining per capita consumption, measured in terms of either gross domestic product (GDP) or carbon footprint, have significant reductions in average happiness. In contrast, countries with growing per capita consumption have no significant change in happiness. There is no relationship between changes in per capita consumption and health, irrespective of whether GDP or carbon footprint is growing or not. These findings apply to rich and poor countries alike and are robust to the inclusion of other social indicators, such as social support and autonomy. We find that happiness is less sensitive to declines in carbon footprint than declines in GDP, thus lending support to calls for “decoupling” carbon emissions from economic growth. However, observed decoupling trends are insufficient to meet climate targets. If the 2° target is to be met without a decline in wellbeing, then either decoupling must be vastly improved, or happiness levels must be made less sensitive to declining consumption. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Easterlin paradox; Sustainable consumption; Wellbeing","Climate change; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Emission control; Health; Complementary relationship; Easterlin paradox; Gross domestic products; National consumption; Parallel analysis; Percapita consumption; Sustainable consumption; Wellbeing; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059339541

This study proposes information-based ecological network analysis to evaluate the distribution of embodied carbon flows in socio-economic networks. A case study examined the relationship between embodied carbon structure and production-based carbon intensity in China. Results showed that most wealthy provinces were less carbon-intensive with embodied carbon flows being dispersed across the network. This produced a need for decentralized carbon mitigation measures. Less developed regions had higher production-based carbon intensities with most embodied carbon flows aggregated in a few pathways. This indicated that only parts of the economic sector were responsible for large amounts of carbon emissions embodied in products exported to other regions, which would require a centralized decarbonization policy. The proposed information-based ecological network analysis method may help facilitate rational mitigation strategies based on the specific carbon emission structures of various regions. Given the ambitious emission mitigation targets and inequitable regional development situation, our aim is to facilitate the decarbonization of China as well as contribute to rational and equal carbon mitigation policy enactment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon inequality; Decarbonization; Ecological network analysis","Decarbonization; Ecology; Regional planning; Carbon intensity; Carbon mitigation; Carbon mitigation policies; Ecological network analysis; Emission mitigation; Less-developed regions; Mitigation strategy; Regional development; Carbon; carbon emission; emission control; environmental degradation; information; network analysis; pollution policy; regional development; socioeconomic conditions; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059956844

However, the effectiveness of DMPP varies among soils, and this is due to both abiotic (e.g. soil properties) and biotic factors (e.g. ammonia oxidizers and denitrifier communities). Understanding the nature of these effects is necessary to improve the efficacy of DMPP, therefore encouraging wider adoption and environmental benefits. In particular, soil microbial properties associated with variation in efficacy remain largely unknown. In this study four contrasting arable soils (a grey desert soil, an alluvial paddy soil, a loess-formed paddy soil, and a red soil), were characterized based on DMPP inhibition of N 2 O emissions and associated microbial functional guilds. DMPP significantly inhibited nitrification and N 2 O emissions, with an average inhibitory rate ranging from 41.7% in a red soil to 90.0% in a grey desert soil. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) exhibited contrasting response patterns to DMPP addition. Notably, suppression of N 2 O emissions by DMPP only occurred alongside fluctuations in AOB abundance. However, when AOB were inhibited, AOA abundance increased. Soil-dependent response patterns to DMPP were observed for ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in terms of community structure. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) found that abiotic factors, particularly pH, and biological factors such as ammonia oxidizer communities, were closely linked to N 2 O emissions. Our findings provide evidence that: (i) DMPP effectively inhibits nitrification through inhibiting the abundance of AOB across soil types; (ii) releasing AOA from the competition with AOB allows AOA to efficiently grow and multiply, even under high ammonium conditions; and (iii) abiotic factors play a more important role than biotic factors in soil N 2 O emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); Ammonia oxidizing archaea; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Niche differentiation; Nitrous oxide","Agriculture; Ammonia; Bacteria; Denitrification; Ecosystems; Least squares approximations; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Ammonia-oxidizing archaea; Niche differentiation; Nitrous oxide; Soils; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural soil; ammonia; bacterium; community structure; desert soil; differentiation; emission; guild; inhibition; inhibitor; niche; nitrification; nitrous oxide; oxidation; phosphate; prokaryote; soil microorganism; Nitrosomonadales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059321777

There are various measures and regulations to control shipping emissions, among which emission control areas (ECAs) have been recognized as an effective tool to restrict shipping emissions along coastlines. Realizing the serious damage caused by shipping emissions, the Chinese Ministry of Transport announced the establishment of sulfur emission control areas (SECAs) in 2015. However, the low SECA standards have aroused public concern about their effectiveness. This study analyzes the incentives for slow steaming in Chinese SECAs based on the existing research models of speed. A specific route from Shanghai to Los Angeles is chosen and the ship speeds inside and outside the SECA are simulated by minimizing the shipping company’s operating costs. By analyzing the simulated results and comparing different scenarios, it has been found that the current range of SECAs in China cannot induce speed differentiation behaviors. At the same time, a ratio of more than 7% (the ratio of SECA distance to the total round-trip distance) is proposed as effective for designing the SECA boundary.

Scientific evaluation of health losses caused by air pollution can provide decision-making basis for formulation and improvement of pollution reduction policies in the Jing-Jin-Ji region. This paper estimated the adverse effects of particulate matter pollution on health in the Jing-Jin-Ji region in 2016 by using logarithmic linear exposure-response function, and monetized the health effects by adjusting human capital method and disease cost method. The results show non-ignorable health hazards and economic impacts caused by atmospheric particulate pollution. The economic losses relevant to health hazards by PM2.5 in the Jing-Jin-Ji region are 122.40 billion yuan, and those relevant to PM10 are 118.34 billion yuan, accounting for 1.62% and 1.56% of the region’s GDP, respectively. Similar evaluations previously conducted in other countries yielded figures within the same order of magnitude. Considering the difference in economic losses per unit among disease types, the economic losses caused by air pollution in the Jing-Jin-Ji region mainly come from premature deaths. Infants and elderly people are the main victims of particulate matter. Affected by population, pollutant concentration, industrial structure, and other factors, the economic losses of particulate matter pollution in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Baoding are large. In order to reduce health hazards and economic impacts caused by particulate matter pollution, this paper put forward to guide the urban population diversion, reduce the outgoing frequency of susceptible groups such as infants and the elderly in haze weather, adopt high-efficiency particulate matter air purifier indoors, and develop public transportation to reduce motor vehicle exhaust emissions.

These configurations are designed to explore the attributes of each method under different but relevant model usage scenarios including varied spectral order within an element, static regional refinement, and scaling to the largest problem sizes. This analysis is performed within the shallow-water dynamical core option of a full climate model code base to enable a wealth of simulations for study, with the aim of informing solver development within the more complete hydrostatic dynamical core used for climate research. The limitations and benefits to using explicit versus implicit methods, with different parameters and settings, are discussed in light of the trade-offs with Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication and memory and their inherent efficiency bottlenecks. Given the performance behavior across the configurations analyzed here, the recommendation for future work using the implicit solvers is conditional based on scale separation and the stiffness of the problem. For the regionally refined configurations, the implicit method has about the same efficiency as the explicit method, without considering efficiency gains from a preconditioner. The potential for improvement using a preconditioner is greatest for higher spectral order configurations, where more work is shifted to the linear solver.

Quantification of the climatic conditions associated with variation in breeding is essential for understanding reproductive phenology and adaptive responses to a changing climate. We use a novel dataset from Australia to test long-established ideas about which climatic factors may govern avian breeding patterns. We combine ~146 000 breeding observations (first egg-laying dates) from 327 species with daily measures of minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation to examine the responsiveness of bird breeding to local climate conditions. Across five biomes we quantify and compare the difference in temperature and precipitation during each breeding event relative to ‘average’ conditions at each location (i.e. conditions during the one-year period either side of a breeding event). For a smaller subset of species, we examine responses to temperature and precipitation in birds breeding across multiple biomes. These biomes are arrayed along Australia's north to south temperature gradient, and east to west aridity gradient. We found that breeding is non-random in relation to climate. Within biomes, most species breed when temperature, precipitation, or both were distinctly different than the average conditions. Additionally, there is both intra- and inter-specific variation in the climatic conditions under which species lay eggs across aridity and temperature gradients. Breeding in hot and arid regions is in part driven by the lagged effect of previous rainfall, however, hot temperatures are the primary constraint. These findings imply that opportunistic breeding in response to localised climate, independent of day-length cues, may be relatively common in Australian birds. We conclude that breeding is likely closely associated with patterns of vegetation productivity and food resources, and limited by physiological stress resulting particularly from extreme temperature. © 2018 The Authors","breeding phenology; climate niche; egg-laying","arid region; biome; bird; climate change; climate conditions; environmental factor; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; phenology; precipitation (climatology); temperature gradient; Australia; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058232255

OH appears to trace a greater column density than does CO in 8 out of 15 cases containing OH emission detections; the two molecules trace the same column densities for the other 7 cases. OH and CO trace a similar morphology of molecular gas with a nearly one-to-one correspondence. The mass of molecular gas traced by OH in the portion of the survey containing OH emission is 1.7 (+0.6 or -0.2) ×10 4 M o , whereas the corresponding CO detections trace 9.9 (±0.7) ×10 3 M o . We find that for lines observed in absorption, calculations assuming uniform gas and continuum distributions underestimate column density values by one to two orders of magnitude, making them unreliable for our purposes. Modeling of this behavior in terms of OH cloud structure on a scale smaller than telescopic resolution leads us to estimate that the filling factor of OH gas is a few to 10 percent.

Here, we explore incorporation of new dark food chains into human food systems, drawing inspiration from natural ecosystems, the history of single cell protein, and opportunities for new food production through wastewater treatment, microbial protein production, and aquaculture. The envisioned dark food chains rely upon chemoautotrophy in lieu of photosynthesis, with primary production based upon assimilation of CH 4 and CO 2 by methane- and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria. The stoichiometry, kinetics, and thermodynamics of these bacteria are evaluated, and opportunities for recycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water are explored. Because these processes do not require light delivery, high volumetric productivities are possible; because they are exothermic, heat is available for downstream protein processing; because the feedstock gases are cheap, existing pipeline infrastructure could facilitate low-cost energy-efficient delivery in urban environments. Potential life-cycle benefits include: a protein alternative to fishmeal; partial decoupling of animal feed from human food; climate change mitigation due to decreased land use for agriculture; efficient local cycling of carbon and nutrients that offsets the need for energy-intensive fertilizers; and production of high value products, such as the prebiotic polyhydroxybutyrate. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Carbon; Climate change; Costs; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Land use; Proteins; Thermodynamics; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Climate change mitigation; Hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria; Innovative approaches; Pipeline infrastructure; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Resource limitations; Single cell proteins; Volumetric productivity; Life cycle; carbon; cell protein; hydrogen; methane; fertilizer; bacterium; chemoautotrophy; climate change; engineering; food chain; food production; photosynthesis; primary production; protein; agriculture; aquaculture; bacterium; biological mimicry; bioprocess; cave; chemoautotrophy; climate change; dark food chain; energy; food biotechnology; food chain; food industry; food processing; human; kinetics; lake; land use; nonhuman; photosynthesis; protein processing; recycling; Review; solubility; stoichiometry; thermodynamics; waste water management; water cycle; animal; ecosystem; Animalia; Agriculture; Animals; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Food Chain; Humans; Methane",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062103162

The Crown Estate, responsible for licensing development on the sea bed around the UK, has held three rounds of licensing since 2000 for wind developments. Some of the projects in the first two rounds suffered long delays due to uncertainty of project level impacts, particularly cumulative impacts.

Under high-end climate change (HECC), temperatures in Scotland are projected to increase significantly by the end of the twenty-first century. This raises the possibility of future temperatures becoming sufficiently high to support the growth of wine grapes. In this paper, we explore to what extent Scotland might become suitable for wine production under HECC using a climate analogue approach. Specifically, we address the following questions. What are the projected late twenty-first century temperature changes in Scotland? Where in Europe are current climates (based on summer and annual temperatures) similar to those projected for Scotland by the end of the twenty-first century under HECC? Are any of these locations currently wine grape growing regions? The temperature analogues towards the end of the twenty-first century occurred at more southerly latitudes in Europe, with some variability from west to east arising from the influence of continental climates. Temperature analogues alone match with several current wine grape growing regions of Europe, suggesting that future climates in Scotland could support wine production. However, when precipitation and/or lithology and topography are also taken into account, no matches were found with existing European wine grape growing regions. This study demonstrates how the use of climate analogues in combination with other environmental datasets can be useful in understanding future climate change impacts, especially under HECC. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climate analogues; High-end climate change; Scotland; Wine grapes; Wine production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034812993

Given the size of city economies, the economic losses caused by climate-induced extreme weather can be quite significant. Together, the cities of Guangzhou, Mumbai, Shenzen, Tianjin, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata, and Jakarta incurred $1520 million (USD) in annual losses due to coastal flooding in 2005 alone. By 2050, the annual loss incurred as a result of coastal flooding in these cities is projected to increase to $32,079 million. In the light of the projected increase in climate-induced extreme weather events and associated loss, it is important to understand where Asian cities are in terms of climate change adaptation planning and governance. I use publicly available data and information published between 2004 and 2014 to capture urban climate change adaptation activities implemented in Asian cities, their sectoral distribution, and nature. This research finds that Asian cities are at a very early stage of climate change adaptation planning and governance. Countries with a larger number of cities implementing urban adaptation activities are the ones where central governments provide policy directives and support required for urban climate change adaptation planning and governance. There are two major flaws in the way urban climate change adaptation planning and governance is being carried out in Asian cities. First, the majority of urban climate change adaptation activities are concentrated in only one sector-disaster risk management. Second, approximately two thirds of urban climate change adaptation activities are reactive in nature. What cities in Asia need is an optimal mix of proactive and reactive adaptation.

Here, we provide a tool for generating a global baseline of SOC stocks. We used partial least square (PLS) regression and available geographic datasets that describe SOC, climate, organisms, relief, parent material and time. The accuracy of the model was determined by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of predicted SOC against 100 independent measurements. The best predictors were related to primary productivity, climate, topography, biome classification, and soil type. The largest C stocks for the top 1 m were found in boreal forests (254 ± 14.3 t ha −1 ) and tundra (310 ± 15.3 t ha −1 ). Deserts had the lowest C stocks (53.2 ± 6.3 t ha −1 ) and statistically similar C stocks were found for temperate and Mediterranean forests (142 - 221 t ha−1), tropical and subtropical forests (94 - 143 t ha −1 ) and grasslands (99-104 t ha −1 ). Solar radiation, evapotranspiration, and annual mean temperature were negatively correlated with SOC, whereas soil water content was positively correlated with SOC. Our model explained 49% of SOC variability, with RMSD (0.68) representing approximately 14% of observed C stock variance, overestimating extremely low and underestimating extremely high stocks, respectively. Our baseline PLS predictions of SOC stocks can be used for estimating the maximum amount of C that may be sequestered in soils across biomes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Baseline; Climate; Geographic information systems; Global; Pristine ecosystems; Soil organic carbon","baseline survey; boreal forest; carbon sequestration; climate change; estimation method; forest soil; geographical region; global change; Mediterranean environment; organic carbon; pristine environment; regression analysis; soil carbon; temperate forest; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047264134

We previously showed that a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with nuclear localization signal mutation in the matrix (M) protein results in a pathotype change and attenuates viral pathogenicity in chickens. However, little is known about the nuclear localization functions of NDV M protein. In this study, the potential functions of the M protein in the nucleus were investigated. We first demonstrate that nuclear localization of the M protein could not only promote the cytopathogenicity of NDV but also increase viral RNA synthesis and transcription efficiency in DF-1 cells. Using microarray analysis, we found that nuclear localization of the M protein might inhibit host cell transcription, represented by numerous up-regulating genes associated with transcriptional repressor activity and down-regulating genes associated with transcriptional activator activity. The role of representative up-regulated gene prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1) and down-regulated gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in the replication of NDV was then evaluated. The results show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of PROX1 or AHR significantly reduced or increased the viral RNA synthesis and viral replication, respectively, demonstrating the important roles of the expression changes of these genes in NDV replication. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that nuclear localization of NDV M protein promotes virus replication by affecting viral RNA synthesis and transcription and inhibiting host cell transcription, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NDV replication and pathogenesis. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; ataxin 7; cyclin dependent kinase 1; cyclin dependent kinase 2; genomic RNA; green fluorescent protein; histone deacetylase 9; interferon regulatory factor 2; kruppel like factor; lipofectamine; matrix protein; nuclear factor I; polyadenylic acid binding protein; retinoic acid receptor alpha; small interfering RNA; TATA binding protein; transcription factor Ets 2; transcription factor RUNX2; virus RNA; zinc finger E box binding homeobox 2; nuclear matrix protein; virus RNA; animal cell; animal model; Article; cell fractionation; controlled study; cytopathogenic effect; down regulation; embryo; gene expression; gene expression level; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; immunofluorescence test; microarray analysis; mRNA expression level; Newcastle disease; Newcastle disease virus; nonhuman; nuclear localization signal; protein expression level; protein localization; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA synthesis; syncytium; transcription initiation; transcription regulation; UMNSAH/DF-1 cell line; upregulation; virus load; virus replication; virus transcription; Western blotting; animal; cell line; chicken; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiology; protein transport; virology; virus replication; Animals; Cell Line; Chickens; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Newcastle disease virus; Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins; Protein Transport; RNA, Viral; Transcription, Genetic; Virus Replication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063290967

These connections are confined by topography and infrastructure, and respond diversely to stressors such as climate change, population growth, increasing energy and water demands. This study presents an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections (i.e., stream flows, inter-basin water transfers, water withdrawals and return flows) among the 2099 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-8) watersheds across the conterminous United States. The framework is then applied to investigate the potential impacts of changes in climate and water use on regional water availability and water stress (the ratio of demand to supply). Our projections suggest that highly water-stressed areas may expand from 14% to 18% and the stressed population would increase from 19% to 24% by 2070–2099. Climate-change mitigation practices (e.g., energy structure reform, technology innovation) could largely offset these trends by reducing demand and enhancing supply. At the watershed scale, the spatially inhomogeneous responses to future changes suggest that regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations due to the redistribution of water resources and diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies in different source areas. However, the detrimental future changes (e.g., depleting river discharges, larger demands of water withdrawal) may aggravate conflicts over water rights among regions and challenge our current water infrastructure system. This study provides new insights into the critical role of regional water connectivity in water supply security, and highlights the increasing need for integrated monitoring and management of water resources at various spatial levels in a changing world. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Upstream flow; Water connectivity; Water consumption; Water stress; Water transfer","Population statistics; Stream flow; Surface waters; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Climate change mitigation; Inter-basin water transfer; Spatially inhomogeneous; Technology innovation; Upstream flow; Water consumption; Water stress; Water transfers; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; connectivity; infrastructure; mitigation; simulation; streamflow; surface water; water availability; water demand; water management; water resource; water stress; water supply; water use; watershed; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060095901

However, the interaction between air pollution and climate factors remains unknown. Methods: Daily HFMD counts from 2009 through 2012 in Guangdong were collected. We used distributed lag non-linear models to assess the associations of climate factors and air pollution on HFMD cases. The effects of climate factors were stratified by air pollution stratum to examine the interaction effect of air quality index (AQI) and temperature, as well as relative humidity. In addition, we explored the variability across gender groups. Results: We observed associations between HFMD cases and environmental factors, including temperature, relative humidity, and AQI. The highest relative risks (RR) were observed at the middle level of temperature and AQI, and high level of relative humidity. The effects for the interaction between AQI and climate factors on HFMD cases were also statistically observed. Compared with low level temperatures (≤23.5 °C), high level temperatures (>23.5 °C) had a RR of 1.486 (95%CI: 1.469,1.503) on days with “good” air quality (AQI ≤ 46), and RR of 1.013 (95%CI: 1.003,1.023) on days with “moderate” air quality (AQI > 46). For relative humidity, the high level (>77%) had a RR of 1.082 (95%CI: 1.076,1.089) on days with “good” air quality, and RR of 1.039 (95%CI: 1.033,1.046) on days with “moderate” air quality. The associations and the interactions remained robust for males and females. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that climate factors and air pollution imposed lagged and non-linear effects on HFMD epidemics. The effects of climate factors on health potentially vary by AQI. Our study is practical and useful for targeted prevention and control, and provides environmental-based evidence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Climate; Hand, foot, and mouth disease; Interaction effect","Air pollution; Air quality; Association reactions; Epidemiology; Air quality indices; Climate; Climate factors; Environmental factors; Interaction effect; Non-linear model; Nonlinear effect; Prevention and controls; Climate models; air quality; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; climate effect; epidemic; foot and mouth disease; relative humidity; time series analysis; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; Article; China; climate change; controlled study; environmental factor; female; hand foot and mouth disease; human; humidity; male; population research; priority journal; risk factor; time series analysis; trend study; air pollution; chemically induced; hand foot and mouth disease; incidence; urban population; virology; weather; China; Guangdong; Air Pollution; China; Female; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Incidence; Male; Urban Population; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057746202

The results indicate that the incomplete combustion heat loss and NO x emission both increase with semi-coke co-fired ratio. Semi-coke may be injected into the furnace at a different height, which can lead to different thermal efficiency and NO x emission. It is suggested that semi-coke should not be fed from the top or bottom layer burners, since this could give rise to high carbon content respectively in fly ash and bottom slag. In addition, injecting semi-coke from the top burners could significantly increase the NO x emission. Under 1/2 co-firing ratio, the optimal fuel allocation is that feeding semi-coke from the B, D, and E layer burners. The growth in semi-coke particle size could increase the unburned carbon loss and NO x emission. It is highly recommended to reduce the unburned carbon loss under semi-coke co-fired condition by increasing the stoichiometric ratio of primary air for semi-coke. As it is increased from 0.25 to 0.3, the combustion efficiency of the co-fired condition is 99.47%, the same as when only firing bituminous coal, and the NO x emission is about 30% higher. © IMechE 2018.","co-firing; computational fluid dynamics; NO x emission; Pulverized boiler; semi-coke","Bituminous coal; Boiler firing; Carbon; Coal combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; E region; Efficiency; Fly ash; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Slags; Co-firing; Combustion efficiencies; High carbon content; Incomplete combustion; NOx emissions; Semi-coke; Stoichiometric ratio; Tangentially-fired boilers; Coke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049029453

Among them ammonium and nitrate (A&amp;N) aerosols may have a growing impact on regional climate. In this study, their representation in coarse and fine modes has been introduced in the prognostic aerosol scheme of the ALADIN-Climate regional model. This new aerosol scheme is evaluated over Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, using two twin simulations over the period 1979-2016 with and without A&amp;N aerosols. This evaluation is performed at local and regional scales, using surface stations and satellite measurements. Despite an overestimate of the surface nitrate concentration, the model is able to reproduce its spatial pattern including local maxima (Benelux, Po Valley). Concerning the simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD), the inclusion of A&amp;N aerosols significantly reduces the model bias compared to both AERONET stations and satellite data. Our results indicate that A&amp;N aerosols can contribute up to 40 % of the total AOD550 over Europe, with an average of 0.07 (550 nm) over the period 2001-2016. Sensitivity studies suggest that biases still present are related to uncertainties associated with the annual cycle of A&amp;N aerosol precursors (ammonia and nitric acid). The decrease in sulfate aerosol production over Europe since 1980 produces more free ammonia in the atmosphere leading to an increase in A&amp;N concentrations over the studied period. Analyses of the different aerosol trends have shown for the first time to our knowledge that, since 2005 over Europe, A&amp;N AOD550 and A&amp;N shortwave (SW) direct radiative forcing (DRF) are found to be higher than sulfate and organics, making these the species with the highest AOD and the highest DRF. On average over the period 1979-2016, the A&amp;N DRF is found to be about -1.7 W m-2 at the surface and -1.4 W m-2 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in all sky conditions over Europe, with regional maxima located at the surface over the Po Valley (-5 W m-2). Finally, the dimming effect of A&amp;N aerosols is responsible for a cooling of about -0.2°C over Europe (summer), with a maximum of -0.4 °C over the Po Valley. Concerning precipitation, no significant impact of A&amp;N aerosols has been found. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; ammonium; climate effect; climate modeling; concentration (composition); nitrate; radiative transfer; regional climate; spatial distribution; Europe; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Po Valley",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063284402

Hydrogen Lyman continuum emission is greatly enhanced in the impulsive kernels of solar flares, with observations of Lyman lines showing impulsive brightening and both red and blue wing asymmetries, based on the images with low spatial resolution. A spate of proposed instruments will study Lyman emission in more detail from bright, impulsive flare kernels. In support of new instrumentation we aim to apply an improved interpretation of Lyman emission with the hydrodynamic radiative code, HYDRO2GEN, which has already successfully explained Hα emission with large redshifts and sources of white light emission in solar flares. The simulations can interpret the existing observations and propose observations in the forthcoming missions. Methods. A flaring atmosphere is considered to be produced by a 1D hydrodynamic response to injection of an electron beam, defining depth variations of electron and ion kinetic temperatures, densities, and macro-velocities. Radiative responses in this flaring atmosphere affected by the beams with different parameters are simulated using a fully non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) approach for a five-level plus continuum model hydrogen atom with excitation and ionisation by spontaneous, external, and internal diffusive radiation, and by inelastic collisions with thermal and beam electrons. Integral radiative transfer equations for all optically thick transitions are solved using the L2 approximation simultaneously with steady state equations. Results. During a beam injection in the impulsive phase there is a large increase of collisional ionisation and excitation by non-thermal electrons that strongly (by orders of magnitude) increases excitation and the ionisation degree of hydrogen atoms from all atomic levels. These non-thermal collisions combined with plasma heating caused by beam electrons lead to an increase in Lyman line and continuum radiation, which is highly optically thick. During a beam injection phase the Lyman continuum emission is greatly enhanced in a large range of wavelengths resulting in a flattened distribution of Lyman continuum over wavelengths. After the beam is switched off, Lyman continuum emission, because of its large opacity, sustains, for a very long time, the high ionisation degree of the flaring plasma gained during the beam injection. This leads to a long enhancement of hydrogen ionisation, occurrence of white light flares, and an increase of Lyman line emission in cores and wings, whose shapes are moved closer to those from complete redistribution (CRD) in frequencies, and away from the partial ones (PRD) derived in the non-flaring atmospheres. In addition, Lyman line profiles can reflect macro-motions of a flaring atmosphere caused by downward hydrodynamic shocks produced in response to the beam injection reflected in the enhancements of Ly-line red wing emission. These redshifted Ly-line profiles are often followed by the enhancement of Ly-line blue wing emission caused by the chromospheric evaporation. The ratio of the integrated intensities in the Lyα and Lyβ lines is lower for more powerful flares and agrees with reported values from observations, except in the impulsive phase in flaring kernels which were not resolved in previous observations, in which the ratio is even lower. These results can help observers to design the future observations in Lyman lines and continuum emission in flaring atmospheres. © 2019 ESO.","Line: profiles; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; Sun: chromosphere; Sun: flares; Sun: transition region; Sun: UV radiation","Atoms; Chromophores; Collisional plasmas; Continuum mechanics; Electron beams; Electrons; Equations of state; Hydrodynamics; Image enhancement; Impact ionization; Particle beam injection; Red Shift; Thermionic emission; Line: Profiles; Radiation mechanisms: non thermal; Sun: Chromosphere; Sun: flares; Sun:transition region; Sun:UV radiation; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062774686

This has been attributed partially to the overstatement in Article 7 Paragraph 4 of the PaCA that “greater levels of mitigation” reduces the cost of additional adaptation through mitigation Co-benefits. Therefore, the paper explores how Article 7 of the PaCA partially faults the natural synergy between mitigation and adaptation to equally reduce aggregate emission, although mitigation could help reduce adaptation to physical exposure. Co-benefits are non-climate ancillary benefits from emission reduction that is human-centered. Article 7 of the PaCA overtly favors efforts at mitigation compared to adaptation, yet how much mitigation benefits match adaptation cost including human dimension issues remain speculative and also constrained emission leakages. Thus, the sole attribution of avoiding additional adaptation cost to increased mitigation efforts is far from the reality as adaptation could offset its own additional cost through benefits that reduce emissions, and synonymous to mitigation Co-benefits. For example, the adaptation intentions of ecosystem-based adaptation (Eba), urban NEXUS, integrated water resources management (IWRM) and climate smart agriculture (CSA) in aspects of biodiversity conservation, energy redistribution from human activity, water purification and nutrient recycling are also major sources of emission sink. Therefore, the Article 7 of the PaCA could be enhanced by broadening the definition of Co-benefits to reflect the two-way equity-bound efforts at mitigation and adaptation towards reduced emission leakages and additional adaptation cost. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation cost; Developing countries; Global policy; Negotiations; Resilience; SDGs","Biodiversity; Developing countries; Emission control; Environmental protection; Water conservation; Water recycling; Water resources; Adaptation policies; Biodiversity conservation; Energy re distributions; Global policies; Integrated Water Resources Management; Negotiations; Resilience; SDGs; Cost reduction; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; environmental policy; equity; mitigation; negotiation process; sustainable development; agriculture; article; climate; conservation biology; controlled study; developing country; ecosystem; France; human; nutrient; recycling; tight junction; water availability; water management; Agouti paca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057799117

In this review, we discuss how changes in starch metabolism can facilitate adaptive changes in source-sink carbon allocation for protection against environmental stresses. The stress-related roles of starch are described, and published mechanisms by which starch metabolism responds to short- or long-term water deficit, salinity, or extreme temperatures are discussed. Numerous examples of starch metabolism as a stress response are also provided, focusing on studies where carbohydrates and cognate enzymes were assayed in source, sink, or both. We develop a model that integrates these findings with the theoretical and known roles of sugars and starch in various species, tissues, and developmental stages. In this model, localized starch degradation into sugars is vital to the plant cold stress response, with the sugars produced providing osmoprotection. In contrast, high starch accumulation is prominent under salinity stress, and is associated with higher assimilate allocation from source to sink. Our model explains how starch-sugar interconversion can be a convergent point for regulating carbon use in stress tolerance at the whole-plant level. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Drought; Extreme temperatures; Salinity; Source-sink relations; Starch metabolism; T6P/SnRK","carbon; starch; adaptation; carbohydrate metabolism; metabolism; physiological stress; plant; signal transduction; Adaptation, Physiological; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; Plants; Signal Transduction; Starch; Stress, Physiological",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060335449

While there is information on expected impacts of climate change on agriculture and on adaptation measures that could help minimize impacts, information that specifically assess the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate change is very limited. To support adaptation policies targeting smallholders in the region, more information is needed on (a) who the most vulnerable smallholders are and where they are located, (b) what is driving the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate change in target areas and (c) what are the effectiveness, costs and benefits of adaptation measures recommended for smallholder farmers. Funding and programmes need to be set up to fill those gaps and for adaptation to be effectively implemented.

The State of Bihar was selected for assessment because of its vulnerability (a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity). A vulnerability framework was constructed by discussions with national and local-level specialists followed by weightage given by working in the field of climate and health with international exposure. A total of 15 districts were at a high risk of floods and these were considered for detailed analysis using the methodology for human development index as well as other examples in the field of environment. Climate health vulnerability index score were correlated with actual prevalence of flood mortality data of these 15 districts in year 2016. It was found that climate health vulnerability and flood mortality had negative low correlation of -0.25. In contrast for vector-borne diseases (VBD), both pre-flood and post-flood, the morbidity data had a correlation of 0.24 and 0.11 respectively. Possible reasons for a negative correlation for mortality could involve better preparedness by disaster district authorities. However, outbreak control is within the ambit of the health sector where a possible reason for decreased correlation coefficient in the post-flood period could be due to the impact on health facilities itself, thus leading to reduced reporting. © 2018","Decision tools; Disasters; Vector-borne diseases; Vulnerability","climate change; decision making; disaster; disease vector; infectious disease; paradigm shift; public health; vulnerability; Article; bacterial infection; climate change; climate health vulnerability index score; controlled study; correlation coefficient; disease control; environmental decision making; environmental exposure; epidemic; flooding; geographic distribution; health care planning; human; human development; India; infection; methodology; morbidity; mortality; natural disaster; parasitosis; prevalence; virus infection; communicable disease; decision support system; disaster; epidemic; organization and management; prevention and control; public health; Bihar; India; Climate Change; Communicable Diseases; Decision Support Techniques; Disasters; Disease Outbreaks; Floods; Health Planning; Humans; India; Prevalence; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059137108

In the future the impact of air pollution policies may differ, because the major anthropogenic sources of atmospheric aerosols are increasingly located in Asia. In this study numerical experiments evaluating only direct aerosol effects on atmospheric temperatures indicate that, while reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions weaken Arctic warming, direct radiative forcing effects by reductions of anthropogenic aerosol concentrations, additional to those obtained by lower CO2 emissions, can either amplify or diminish it. Interactions between regionally modified radiation in Asia and internal climate variability may differently initiate and sustain atmospheric planetary waves propagating into the Arctic. In a nonlinear manner planetary waves may redistribute atmospheric and oceanic meridional heat fluxes at the high latitudes and either amplify or diminish Arctic warming in 2050. Lower CO2 concentrations might apparently contribute to reduce the interactions between the Arctic system and the lower latitudes, thus reducing the influence of strong air quality measures in Asia on the Arctic amplification of global warming. While past and present air pollution policies could have amplified Arctic warming, in the future the effects from atmospheric pollution reductions are less certain, depending on the future CO2 concentrations, and requiring improved simulations of changing aerosol concentrations and their interactions with clouds in Asia and the Arctic. © 2019 The Author(s).

This will lead to an increased emission level despite the abundant solar energy resources which is a suitable alternative for sustainable energy development in Nigeria. This paper addresses the issue by evaluating the technical and financial viability of deploying domestic Solar Water Heaters (SWH) in the Nigeria households using the RETScreen modelling framework. Performance, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation and financial analyses were performed for six selected cities in the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. Results indicate that a single evacuated tube SWH can produce a maximum solar fraction of 69% for Nigeria's households. The results further suggest that SWH can play a major role towards energy security and GHG emission mitigation in the country. The results of the financial analysis showed that SWH is economically viable in most parts of Nigeria with exception of the south-south geopolitical zone where the R1 category of households in Port Harcourt city still requires financial support for the viability of SWH. This study recommends the increased adoption of policies enhancing the penetration of SWH systems in order to transcend Nigeria towards a low carbon pathway. © 2018 IEEE.","Nigeria; RETScreen; Solar water heater; Techno-economic feasibility","Economics; Energy security; Finance; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Intelligent control; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Water heaters; Ghg emission mitigations; Modelling framework; Nigeria; RETScreen; Solar water heaters (SWH); Solar water heating systems; Sustainable energy development; Techno-economic feasibility; Solar water heaters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064138576

The model builds on China-specific production and environmental information and incorporates sulfidation of nano-silver in urban wastewater treatment systems. We predict that the bulk of nano-silver (>90%), primarily originating from production and consumption of nano-silver products, ends up in sewage treatment plants (STPs, 5.3 t/a), followed by the landfill (4.7 t/a). More than 99% of nano-silver in STPs reacts with sulfide and thus does not appear in effluents. Direct release of nano-silver from production and consumption is identified as the dominant source of nano-silver in the environment, most of which enters surface water (0.71 t/a). As such, regulation of direct emissions from production and consumption of nano-silver products can be of priority for local environmental management. The modeled regional concentrations (modes) of nano-silver are 0.9 ng/L in surface water, 20 ng/kg in soil, 6.9 μg/kg in sediment, and negligible in the air, which agree well with measurements in the modeled region. Based on the modeled concentrations, we calculate that the risk characterization ratio is <1 in the air, surface water and soil, which means that nano-silver currently poses no risk to organisms living in these environmental compartments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Nano-silver; Predicted environmental concentrations; Probabilistic material flow analysis (PMFA); Risk assessment","Effluents; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Risk assessment; Sewage treatment plants; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; Environmental compartment; Environmental information; Environmental occurrence; Material flow analysis; Nano silver; Predicted environmental concentrations; Production and consumption; Risk characterization ratios; Surface waters; silver nanoparticle; surface water; environmental risk; flow modeling; material flow analysis; nanoparticle; probability; risk assessment; silver; air; Article; China; concentration (parameters); effluent; flow measurement; landfill; prediction; priority journal; probabilistic material flow analysis; probability; risk assessment; sediment; volume; waste water management; China; Hunan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059019509

Using an eddy covariance system, we monitored the net ecosystem gas exchange in a 5-ha rainfed switchgrass crop located in the Po River Valley for four consecutive years after land-use change from annual food crops. Switchgrass absorbed 58.2 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 (GPP—gross primary production), of which 24.5 (42%) were fixed by the ecosystem (NEE—net ecosystem exchange). Cumulated NEE was negative (i.e. C sink) even in the establishment year when biomass and canopy photosynthesis are considerably lower compared to the following years. Taking into account the last 3 years only (postestablishment years), mean NEE was −26.9 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 . When discounted of the removed switchgrass biomass, ecosystem CO 2 absorption was still high and corresponded to −8.4 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 . The estimation of the life cycle global warming effect made switchgrass an even greater sink (−12.4 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 ), thanks to the credits obtained with fossil fuels displacement. Water use efficiency (WUE), that is the ratio of NEE to the water used by the crop as the flux of transpiration (ET), corresponded to 1.6 mg C g −1 of H 2 O, meaning that, on average, 170 m 3 of water was needed to fix 1 Mg of CO 2 . Again, considering only the postestablishment years, WUE was 1.7 mg C g −1 of H 2 O. In the end, about half of annual precipitation was used by the crop every year. We conclude that switchgrass can be a valuable crop to capture significant amount of atmospheric CO 2 while preserving water reserves and estimated that its potential large-scale deployment in the Mediterranean could lead to an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction up to 0.33% for the EU. © 2018 The Authors.

Microbes in peatlands play an important role in sustaining the functions of peatlands as a C sink, yet their characteristics in these habitats are poorly understood. This research aimed to elucidate the responses of these complex ecosystems to disturbance by exploring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, nutrient contents, soil microbial communities and the functional interactions between these components in a primary and secondary peat swamp forest in Peninsular Malaysia. GHG measurements using closed chambers, and peat sampling were carried out in both wet and dry seasons. Microbial community phenotypes and nutrient content were determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICSPM) analyses respectively. CO2 emissions in the secondary peat swamp forest were &gt; 50% higher than in the primary forest. CH4 emission rates were ca. 2 mg m−2 h−1 in the primary forest but the secondary forest was a CH4 sink, showing no seasonal variations in GHG emissions. Almost all the nutrient concentrations were significantly lower in the secondary forest, postulated to be due to nutrient leaching via drainage and higher rates of decomposition. Cu and Mo concentrations were negatively correlated with CO2 and CH4 emissions respectively. Microbial community structure was overwhelmingly dominated by bacteria in both forest types, however it was highly sensitive to land-use change and season. Gram-positive and Gram-negative relative abundance were positively correlated with CO2 and CH4 emissions respectively. Drainage related disturbances increased CO2 emissions, by reducing the nutrient content including some with known antimicrobial properties (Cu &amp; Na) and by favouring Gram-positive bacteria over Gram-negative bacteria. These results suggest that the biogeochemistry of secondary peat swamp forest is fundamentally different from that of primary peat swamp forest, and these differences have significant functional impacts on their respective environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Drained and logged peatlands; GHG emissions; Land use change; Microbial community structure; Nutrient content; Pristine tropical peatlands","Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Mass spectrometry; Nutrients; Peat; Phospholipids; Wetlands; GHG emission; Land-use change; Microbial community structures; Nutrient contents; Peat land; Forestry; copper; fatty acid; methane; molybdenum; sodium; carbon dioxide; methane; bacterium; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; community structure; greenhouse gas; microbial community; nutrient; peatland; secondary forest; Article; biogeochemistry; carbon footprint; concentration (parameters); correlational study; decomposition; forest structure; fungus; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; land use; leaching; Malaysia; nonhuman; nutrient availability; peatland; phenotype; population abundance; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil microflora; analysis; chemistry; forest; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; season; soil; tree; tropic climate; wetland; Malaysia; West Malaysia; Negibacteria; Posibacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Forests; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Greenhouse Gases; Malaysia; Methane; Microbiota; Seasons; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Trees; Tropical Climate; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056785060

This paper aims to study the uncertainties associated with emission estimates generated from COPERT(v5.1) outputs through sensitivity analysis of the model input parameters. The input parameters considered in this study are temperature, speed, relative humidity, trip length, and driving style (mileage share). Many of these parameters are not directly measured or country-wide average values are investigated in this study. The uncertainties of the emission estimates were obtained through varying the parameter values, within realistic limits, either individually or considering factor interactions by varying two or more parameters simultaneously. The uncertainties of the emission estimates of certain pollutants (CO, VOC and NMVOC) can be significant from −58% to +76%. Some gases, such as CO 2 show almost no sensitivity to input parameter variations. The results indicate that the COPERT outputs are most sensitive to variations in trip length and speed, both of which are not directly measured. Considering the percentage of urban driving share has a huge effect on the national emission estimates, inventories were separately prepared for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), the largest urban area of Ireland with highest population and vehicle densities. GDA has 48% and 50.37% shares of CO 2 and NOx emissions respectively, compared to the national levels. The consequence of over- or underestimation of emission inventories for Ireland was calculated to be approximately +/− €45million. Considering the major implications of NEI for climate change and other related impacts it is crucial to report the pollutant emission levels appropriately stating uncertainty levels. The findings of this study provide national experts with a methodology to estimate uncertainties of COPERT outputs and to identify the key sources of these uncertainties where policy and emission reduction strategies should be targeted. © 2018","Air pollution; COPERT; Emission inventory; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty modelling","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Parameter estimation; Sensitivity analysis; COPERT; Emission inventories; Emission reduction strategy; Greater dublin areas; National emissions inventories; Pollutant emission; Uncertainty modelling; Vehicular emission; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059591364

The objective of this field study was to evaluate the effects of residue level, residue burning, tillage, and irrigation on macro-aggregate (&gt;250 μm), micro-aggregate (53–250 μm), coarse (&gt;250 μm) and fine POM (53–250 μm), and silt-clay fractions and their associated C and N in the top 10 cm of a highly erodible loessial soil (Glossaquic Fraglossudalf) after 13 years of consistent management in a wheat-soybean, double-crop (WSDC) system in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region of eastern Arkansas. The total aggregated soil fraction was 11.2% greater (P = 0.02) in the no-tillage (NT)-irrigated compared to the average of the other three tillage-irrigation combinations, which did not differ. Averaged over irrigation, burn, and residue-level treatments, the C concentration in the sand-free macro-aggregate fraction was 8.8% less (P &lt; 0.05) under conventional tillage (15.6 g kg−1) than under NT (17.1 g kg−1). Fine POM C and N concentrations within sand-free-adjusted aggregates were 1.9 times greater (P ≤ 0.04) in the burn-low (2.59 and 0.21 g kg−1, respectively) compared to the burn-high treatment (1.35 and 0.11 g kg−1, respectively), while that in the no-burn under either residue level, which did not differ, were intermediate (2.43 and 0.23 g kg−1, respectively). Results showed that alternative management practices, such as NT and non-burning, can contribute to improved soil health and long-term sustainability and the mitigation of climate-change-related greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere by reducing SOM oxidation, microbial respiration, and carbon dioxide emissions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alfisols; Conventional-tillage; Long-term management; No-tillage; Particulate organic matter; Wheat-soybean system","Aggregates; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Organic compounds; Soils; Sustainable development; Water management; Alfisols; Conventional tillage; Long-term management; No tillage; Particulate organic matters; Wheat-soybean system; Soil pollution; Alfisol; crop performance; loess; long-term change; particulate organic matter; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soybean; water management; wheat; zero tillage; Arkansas; Arkansas Delta; Mississippi River; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055738618

The barriers described in the paper include economic, social, governance and information related issues that impede local actions and increase vulnerabilities. Enabling factors such as improving social and human capital, gaining formal recognition and most importantly support from agencies (e.g. local government, civil societies, and community leaders), help overcome some of the barriers or challenges. Hence, local level adaptation measures mainstreamed with local developmental agendas help address some of the structural causes of vulnerability.

These widely contradictory results have resulted in confusion regarding the capability of vegetative barriers to mitigate near-road air pollution, which numerous studies have associated with significant adverse human health effects. Roadside vegetation studies have investigated the impact of many different types and conditions of vegetation barriers and urban forests, including preserved, existing vegetation stands usually consisting of mixtures of trees and shrubs or plantings of individual trees. A study was conducted along a highway with differing vegetation characteristics to identify if and how the changing characteristics affected downwind air quality. The results indicated that roadside vegetation needed to be of sufficient height, thickness, and coverage to achieve downwind air pollutant reductions. A vegetation stand which was highly porous and contained large gaps within the stand structure had increased downwind pollutant concentrations. These field study results were consistent with other studies that the roadside vegetation could lead to reductions in average, downwind pollutant concentrations by as much as 50% when this vegetation was thick with no gaps or openings. However, the presence of highly porous vegetation with gaps resulted in similar or sometimes higher concentrations than measured in a clearing with no vegetation. The combination of air quality and meteorological measurements indicated that the vegetation affects downwind pollutant concentrations through attenuation of meteorological and vehicle-induced turbulence as air passes through the vegetation, enhanced mixing as portions of the traffic pollution plume are blocked and forced over the vegetation, and through particulate deposition onto leaf and branch surfaces. Computational fluid dynamic modeling highlighted that density of the vegetation barrier affects pollutant levels, with a leaf area density of 3.0 m 2  m −3 or higher needed to ensure downwind pollutant reductions for airborne particulate matter. These results show that roadside bushes and trees can be preserved or planted along highways and other localized pollution sources to mitigate air quality and human health impacts near the source if the planting adheres to important characteristics of height, thickness, and density with full coverage from the ground to the top of the canopy. The results also highlight the importance of planting denser vegetation and maintaining the integrity and structure of these vegetation barriers to achieve pollution reductions and not contribute to unintended increases in downwind air pollutant concentrations. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Air quality; Mitigation; Near-road; Roadside vegetation; Traffic","air quality; atmospheric pollution; health impact; particulate matter; public health; road; roadside environment; stand structure; traffic emission; tree; urban forestry; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058076003

The diesel dependency of remote communities has inflated local per capita greenhouse gas emissions and resulted in rising and inconsistent electricity prices that have made community viability reliant on government subsidies. As the diesel generators approach the end of their lifespan replacement, technologies must be considered that will help transition Canadian remote communities from diesel to renewables. Replacing diesel generators with steam reformer and solid oxide fuel cell systems would allow for more efficient diesel generation and would benefit the future implementation of renewable power. A model was generated in Honeywell's UniSim Design Suite to simulate the performance of a diesel fed steam reformer and solid oxide fuel cell system. System operating parameters in the model were optimized to minimize the expected payback period. The system model outputs were compared with expected diesel generator performance for a test case remote community. The test community demonstrated that replacing diesel generators with the proposed steam reformer and solid oxide fuel cell system would result in annual net efficiency improvements of 32%. The efficiency improvement could potentially translate to reductions in carbon dioxide equivalents of over 258 kt and 20-year savings of over $450 million if all diesel-reliant Canadian remote communities switched to steam reformer and solid oxide fuel cell systems. In addition to immediate environmental and economic savings, the improved low load performance of the reformer and fuel cell system would allow for the future integration of renewable energy to create highly efficient diesel-renewable hybrid power plants. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","diesel generator; diesel steam reforming; distributed generation; power system modelling; solid oxide fuel cell","Carbon dioxide; Distributed power generation; Efficiency; Fuel systems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Steam; Steam reforming; Diesel generators; Efficiency improvement; Electricity generation; Government subsidies; Hybrid power plants; Integration of renewable energies; Operating parameters; Power system modelling; Fuel cell power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059695496

Recognizing this problem, the UN Minamata Convention on Mercury was recently adopted, where signatory countries agreed to reduce anthropogenic mercury emissions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the convention, quantitative knowledge on mercury emissions is crucial. So far, bottom-up approaches have successfully been applied to quantify mercury emission-especially for point sources. Distributed sources make up a large share of the emission; however, they are still poorly characterized. Here, we present a top-down approach to estimate mercury emissions based on atmospheric measurements in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. While monitoring the atmospheric mercury concentrations during inversion periods in Zurich, we were able to relate the concentration increase to the mercury emission strength of the city using a box model. By means of this boundary-layer budget approach, we succeeded in narrowing down the emissions of Zurich to range between 41±8kga-1 (upper bound) and 24±8kga-1 (lower bound). Thereby, we could quantify emissions from mixed, diffuse and point-like sources and derive an annual mercury per capita emission of 0.06 to 0.10ga-1. The approach presented here has the potential to support authorities in setting up inventories and to validate emission estimations derived from the commonly applied bottom-up approaches. Furthermore, our method is applicable to other compounds and to a wide range of cities or other areas, where sources or sinks for mercury and other atmospheric pollutants are presumed. © 2019 Author(s).",,"boundary layer; emission; estimation method; mercury (element); point source pollution; urban area; Switzerland; Zurich [Switzerland]; Zurich [Zurich (ADS)]; Mercurialis annua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063549630

Inspired by the spider web, a 3D carbon network (3DCN) with bionic surface is fabricated by using the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) as the precursors. In this strategy, 3D carbon network serves as the matrix for the formation of ZIF-8 nanoparticles.

However, existing studies have primarily focused on the adsorption effect of different plants on atmospheric particulate matter (PM), whereas the effect of green space on PM has not been adequately addressed. In this study, the effect of different urban green space structures and configurations on PM was investigated through the 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model ENVI-met by treating the green space as a whole based on field monitoring, and at the same time, the regulatory effect of green space on PM was examined by integrating information about the forest stand, PM concentration, and meteorological factors. The results show that the green space primarily affected wind speed but had no significant effect on relative humidity, temperature, or wind direction (P > 0.05). The PM concentration was significantly positively correlated with the relative humidity (P < 0.01), significantly negatively correlated with temperature (P < 0.05), but not significantly correlated with wind speed and direction (P > 0.05). Comparison with the measured values reveals that the ENVI-met model well reflected the differences in PM concentrations between different green spaces and the effect of green space on PM. In different green space structures, the uniform-type structure performed rather poorly at purifying PM, the concave-shaped structure performed the best, and the purifying effectiveness of the incremental-type and convex-shaped structure of green space was higher in the rear region than in the front region; in contrast, the degressional-type green space structure was prone to cause aggregation of the PM in the middle region. Broadleaf and broadleaf mixed forests had a better purifying effectiveness on PM than did coniferous forests, mixed coniferous forests, and coniferous broadleaf mixed forests.

The carbon market risks are not good for the formation of rational price signals, making it difficult to guide enterprises on how to make low-carbon technology investments. Such risks also affect the effectiveness and functions of carbon markets, which can lead to the non-achievement of national emission reduction goals.

Insufficient information is available for Saudi Arabia, and emission projections for Brazil and Mexico are subject to considerable uncertainty. The study also presents high-level decarbonisation indicators to better understand the current progress towards meeting the NDCs – Saudi Arabia and South Africa were found to continue increasing both emission intensity per unit GDP and emissions per capita under current policies by 2030 from 2015 levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; G20 economies; National climate and energy policies; NDCs; Paris Agreement","Emission control; Gas emissions; China; Decarbonisation; Emission intensity; Emission projections; European union; G20 economies; NDCs; Republic of Korea; Greenhouse gases; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; G-20 country; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057135443

In the first measurements, TROPOMI was able to measure CO concentrations of the high-pollution event in India of November 2017. In this paper, we studied the extent of the pollution in India, comparing the TROPOMI CO with modeled data from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to identify the most important sources contributing to the high pollution, both at ground level and in the total column. We investigated the period 11-19 November 2017. We found that residential and commercial combustion was a much more important source of CO pollution than the post-monsoon crop burning during this period, which is in contrast to what media suggested and some studies on aerosol emissions found. Also, the high pollution was not limited to Delhi and its direct neighborhood but the accumulation of pollution extended over the whole Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) due to the unfavorable weather conditions in combination with extensive emissions. From the TROPOMI data and WRF simulations, we observed a buildup of CO during 11-14 November and a decline in CO after 15 November. The meteorological conditions, characterized by low wind speeds and shallow atmospheric boundary layers, were most likely the primary explanation for the temporal accumulation and subsequent dispersion of regionally emitted CO in the atmosphere. This emphasizes the important role of atmospheric dynamics in determining the air quality conditions at ground level and in the total column. Due to its rapidly growing population and economy, India is expected to encounter similar pollution events more often in future post-monsoon and winter seasons unless significant policy measures are taken to reduce residential and commercial emissions. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); pollutant source; troposphere; weather forecasting; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063194514

The model lacks algorithms for carbon input estimation and a differentiated consideration of carbon input sequestration from organic amendments commonly used in agriculture. Moreover, it does not consider the higher stability of below-ground crop residues in relation to above-ground crop residues. RothC was combined with two empirical approaches for quantifying carbon inputs from above- and below-ground crop residues and tested on 439 SOC data series from 36 arable long-term field experiments in Central and Northern Europe. Effects of carbon input quality on model fit were quantified with linear mixed models based on the analytical solution of RothC. Model parameters that describe the stability of incoming carbon were calibrated using a multi-site approach and Bayesian calibration. A second calibration study combined the determination of partitioning of incoming carbon into pools with different turnover rates and model responses to temperature and soil water content. With this calibration we showed that the contribution of above-ground residues to SOC is lower than when estimated with default RothC paramerization. We also show that the relative contribution from roots to SOC is higher than that from above-ground residues. Moreover, the degradability of organic amendments was highly variable between amendment categories and increased for all model configurations in the following order: farmyard manure < farmyard compost < sawdust < sewage sludge < peat. The proposed RothC partition coefficients for above-ground residues, roots and several commonly used organic amendments as estimated for this large data set should be useful for other studies in temperate climates. We also show that the analytical solution of RothC is closely related to the much simpler empirical humus balancing approaches used by farm advisory services. This provides opportunities to build bridges between the more process-oriented SOC models used in research and the well established instruments used by the farming community to assess the effects of agricultural management practices on SOC changes. © 2018",,"Agricultural wastes; Calibration; Composting; Crops; Fertilizers; Sewage sludge; Soil moisture; Agricultural management practice; Bayesian calibration; Environmental conditions; Farming communities; Long-term field experiments; Management practices; Partition coefficient; Relative contribution; Organic carbon; agricultural management; arable land; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; crop residue; environmental conditions; numerical model; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil water; temperature effect; trend analysis; Central Europe; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054328300

Host sensitized Ln 3+ emission was found to be present only in CdSe/Eu, CdSe/Tb, ZnS/Eu, ZnS/Tb and ZnS/Yb nanoparticles. In all the cases tuning of emission of the nanoparticles has been observed, irrespective of the presence or absence of host sensitization. The elemental compositions of CdSe and ZnS nanoparticles upon post-synthetic treatment show a remarkable difference. Incorporation of lanthanides in the nanoparticles is evident with significant alteration in the anionic content, and complete cation exchange of either Cd 2+ or Zn 2+ by Ln 3+ has not been detected; as evaluated from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Further evaluation on this comes from considering thermodynamic parameters of inter cation interaction. In cases where the host sensitized Ln 3+ emission have been observed, luminescence lifetime measurements reveal significant protection of Ln 3+ in the nanoparticles. Noticeable difference in photophysical properties for a given Ln 3+ has been realized in the two hosts. The photophysical observations have been rationalized using (i) charge trapping mediated host sensitized dopant emission, (ii) autoionization of excited electrons, and (iii) environment induced photoluminescence quenching. The post-synthetic modification discussed in the present work provides an easy and less synthetically demanding room temperature based protocol to avail lanthanide incorporated (doped) semiconductor nanoparticles that can potentially use the unique emission properties of the lanthanide cations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Host sensitization; Photoluminescence; Post-synthetic modification; Semiconductor nanoparticles; Trivalent lanthanides","Cadmium compounds; Charge trapping; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Nanoparticles; Photoluminescence; Positive ions; Rare earth elements; Selenium compounds; Wide band gap semiconductors; Zinc sulfide; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Host sensitization; Photoluminescence characteristics; Photoluminescence quenching; Post-synthetic treatments; Postsynthetic modification; Semiconductor nanoparticles; Trivalent lanthanides; Sulfur compounds; cadmium selenide; carbene; lanthanide; methanol; nanoparticle; semiconductor nanoparticle; stearic acid derivative; unclassified drug; zinc sulfide; absorption spectroscopy; Article; cation exchange; comparative study; controlled study; crystal structure; dipole; electronic absorption spectroscopy; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; energy transfer; evaluation study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; histogram; host; inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry; oxidation reduction potential; photoluminescence; priority journal; quantum yield; room temperature; sensitization; steady state; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet spectrophotometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060112833

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of environmental stress on the germination of M. urundeuva seeds harvested in different years (2010 to 2013). Seeds were germinated at constant temperatures between 10 to 40 °C, osmotic potentials from 0 to -0.8 MPa (in polyethylene glycol 6000 solutions), and from 0 to -0.5 MPa (in NaCl solutions). The experiment was conducted according to a completely randomized design, with three replicates of 50 seeds, in a factorial scheme (harvest year x stress intensity) for each environmental stress. Germination data were then analysed using thermal, hydro and halo time models, and future germination responses projected according to climate change scenarios. The germination thermal thresholds ranged from 7.4 to 53.3 oC. The germination base osmotic threshold (using polyethylene glycol) was -0.6 MPa and the base osmotic threshold in NaCl was -0.43MPa. Seeds from different harvest years showed distinct tolerance to environmental stresses. The thermal, hydro and halo-time models were efficient to describe the germinative response of seeds, and the climate models allowed to identify the germination responses of M. urundeuva in future climate. According to the models for future climate (RCP 8.5), the reduction of rainfall by 2100 will directly affect seed germination and seedling recruitment of M. urundeuva. © 2019, Associacao Brasileira de Tecnologia de Sementes.

An external shock, like climate change, which may substantially reduce the productivity of workers is therefore a macroeconomic concern. The biophysical impact of higher temperatures on human performance is well documented. Less well understood are the wider effects of higher temperatures on the aggregate productivity of modern, diversified economies, where economic output is produced in contexts ranging from outdoor agriculture to work in air-conditioned buildings. Working conditions are at least to some extent the result of societal choices, which means that the labour productivity effects of heat can be alleviated through careful adaptation. A range of technical, regulatory/infrastructural and behavioural options are available to individuals, businesses and governments. The importance of local contexts prevents a general ranking of the available measures, but many appear cost-effective. Promising options include the optimization of working hours and passive cooling mechanisms. Climate-smart urban planning and adjustments to building design are most suitable to respond to high base temperature, while air conditioning can respond flexibly to short temperature peaks if there is sufficient cheap, reliable and clean electricity. Key policy insights The effect of heat stress on labour productivity is a key economic impact of climate change, which could affect national output and workers’ income. Effective adaptation options exist, such as shifting working hours and cool roofs, but they require policy intervention and forward planning. Strategic interventions, such as climate-smart municipal design, are as important as reactive or project-level adaptations. Adaptation solutions to heat stress are highly context specific and need to be assessed accordingly. For example, shifting working hours could be an effective way of reducing the effect of peak temperatures, but only if there is sufficient flexibility in working patterns. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This is done by measuring the charge storage capacity (CSC) and the maximum injectable charge, which indicate if the electrodes allow accumulation of sufficiently high charges in the charge cycle and are able to provide sufficiently fast discharge to stimulate neurons, respectively. The CSC was determined to 10.9 mC/cm 2 for carbon pillars and 6.4 mC/cm 2 for planar carbon electrodes. These values are comparable with values obtained for state-of-the-art electrode materials applied for retinal stimulation such as iridium oxide (IrO x ). The maximum injectable charge was determined from cyclic voltammograms (CV) with values of 1.0 and 1.7 mC/cm 2 for planar and pillar carbon electrodes, respectively. The measured contact resistance between carbon and n + doped Si confirms that pyrolytic carbon is a possible candidate for integration as a 3D electrode material on photovoltaic silicon retinal implants. The elemental composition of the fabricated pyrolytic carbon pillars was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analysis showed that the Al 2 O 3 passivated sample with fabricated pyrolytic carbon pillars only contained aluminum, oxygen and carbon, indicating a successful pyrolysis process without any unwanted elements. The study shows promising potential for pyrolytic carbon as a material for 3D electrodes in retinal, photovoltaic implants. © 2019 The Author(s)","3D electrodes; Photovoltaic; Pyrolytic carbon; Retinal prosthesis; Sub-retinal stimulation","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon; Electric discharges; Iridium compounds; Ophthalmology; Photovoltaic effects; Prosthetics; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; 3-D electrodes; Photovoltaic; Pyrolytic carbon; Retinal prosthesis; Retinal stimulation; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062156342

However, conventional climate assessment approaches and methods show many limitations if they are to provide robust knowledge and support to the implementation of such solutions in practice. To this end, we define transformative climate science as the open-ended process of producing, structuring, and applying solutions-oriented knowledge to fast-link integrated adaptation and mitigation strategies to sustainable development. In particular, based on our experiences within regional cases in Central Asia, Europe, Iberia, Scotland, and Hungary, we have selected 12 dimensions that scientists and practitioners can use as a checklist to design transformative-oriented climate assessments. While it is possible to talk both about transformative adaptation and transformative mitigation, in this paper, we make the case that societal transformation does not depend on mitigation or adaptation policies and actions, mostly because they are related to sustainability innovations, which are endogenous developments derived from deliberate social learning. © 2018, The Author(s).","High-end climate change; Sustainable development; Transformative solutions and pathways",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041914838

This study was conducted to determine the effect of air pollution on respiratory disease hospital admission in Ahvaz, one of the most polluted cities in the Middle East. Daily information about respiratory disease admissions and air pollutants during 2008–2018 were inquired. Adjusted Quasi-Poisson regression combined with linear distributed lag models were used. There was a significant relation between increased O3 and respiratory hospital admissions for 65–74 year olds, ≥75 year olds, and pyothorax-abscesses of the lung and mediastinum; between increased NO and respiratory hospital admissions for ≥75 year olds, chronic lower respiratory diseases, diseases of upper respiratory tract and respiratory diseases principally affecting the interstitium; between increased NO2 and respiratory hospital admissions for ≥75 year olds; between increased CO and respiratory hospital admissions and between increased SO2 and respiratory hospital admissions for ≥75 year olds. The risk of respiratory hospital admissions increased in both males and females for increase in PM2.5. Ambient O3, NO, NO2 CO and SO2 can increase admission for respiratory diseases on the same day and at short lags in Ahvaz.

Results show that crystallinity and alignment of ZnO NRs lead to good photocatalytic activity in the presence of visible light. The Photoluminescence spectra revealed a decrease in the UV emission, suggesting a reduced recombination of the photo generated carriers. The visible region emission is due to the surface oxygen vacancies. Increase of charge separation rate observed from emission spectra and the vacancy related sub-bands in the absorbance spectra are together responsible for the enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity of ZnO NRs.

Due to the increase in urbanization, industrialization and climate change, availability and requirement scenario of freshwater have been changing. Water availability and water security are becoming more uncertain through changes in temperature and precipitation, shifts in the timing and intensity of the monsoon, increased frequency of extreme events such as droughts and floods and accelerated melting of the Himalayan glaciers resulting in changes in short- and long-term runoff, snow cover and melting. The Brahmaputra River basin is one of the most vulnerable areas in the world as it is subject to the combined effects of glacier melt, extreme monsoon rainfall and sea level rise. For years, the river has been serving as one of the most important freshwater resources for agriculture, irrigation, transportation and electricity and habitat for aquatic organisms in the north-eastern India. People residing along its banks are heavily dependent on the river for their livelihood, thus making them a highly vulnerable riverine community. As climate change is a major concern, we should reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and develop effective management strategy for freshwater resource. Climate change adds uncertainty in controlling core issues of water management due to lack of capacity to address climate change. Therefore to address this problem, we need resilient institutions. At the same time, we need political process, involvement of diverse array of actors and foreign policies of riparian countries for transboundary water management. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Brahmaputra River; Climate change; Sustainable management",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074677594

However, most herbarium-based studies on plant phenology focus on taxa from temperate regions. Here, we explore flowering phenologic responses to climate in the subtropical plant genus Protea (Proteaceae), an iconic group of plants that flower year-round and are endemic to subtropical Africa. Methods: We present a novel, circular sliding window approach to investigate phenological patterns developed for species with year-round flowering. We employ our method to evaluate the extent to which site-to-site and year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation affect flowering dates using a database of 1727 herbarium records of 25 Protea species. We also explore phylogenetic conservatism in flowering phenology. Results: We show that herbarium data combined with our sliding window approach successfully captured independently reported flowering phenology patterns (r = 0.93). Both warmer sites and warmer years were associated with earlier flowering of 3–5 days/°C, whereas precipitation variation had no significant effect on flowering phenology. Although species vary widely in phenological responsiveness, responses are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species tending to shift flowering similarly with increasing temperature. Discussion: Our results point to climate-responsive phenology for this important plant genus and indicate that the subtropical, aseasonally flowering genus Protea has temperature-driven flowering responses that are remarkably similar to those of better-studied northern temperate plant species, suggesting a generality across biomes that has not been described elsewhere. © 2019 Daru et al.

Managed retreat, or planned relocation, is a proactive response prior to catastrophic necessity. Managed retreat has disruptive health, sociocultural, and economic impacts on communities that relocate. Health impacts include mental health, social capital, food security, water supply, sanitation, infectious diseases, injury, and health care access. We searched peer-reviewed and gray literature for reports on small island or coastal communities at various stages of relocation primarily due to sea level rise. We reviewed these reports to identify public health impacts and barriers to relocation. We identified eight relevant small communities in the USA (Alaska, Louisiana, and Washington), Panama, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Affected populations range from 60 to 2700 persons and are predominantly indigenous people who rely on subsistence fishing and agriculture. Few reports directly addressed public health issues. While some relocations were successful, barriers to relocation in other communities include place attachment, potential loss of livelihoods, and lack of funding, suitable land, community consensus, and governance procedures. Further research is needed on the health impacts of managed retreat and how to facilitate population resilience. Studies could include surveillance of health indicators before and after communities relocate due to sea level rise, drought, or other environmental hazards.

This study characterizes in-field emissions of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), and total non-methane hydrocarbons (TNMHC) from residential cooking events with various fuel and stove types from villages in two provinces in China (Tibet and Yunnan) in the Himalayan area. Emissions of PM 2.5 and gas-phase pollutant concentrations were measured directly and corresponding emission factors calculated using the carbon balance approach. Real-time monitoring of indoor PM 2.5 , CO 2 , and CO concentrations was conducted simultaneously. Major factors responsible for emission variance among and between cooking stoves are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.","Cooking stove; Field study; Solid fuel","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Methane; Pollution; Combustion of solid fuels; Field studies; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Gas-phase pollutants; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Non-methane hydrocarbons; Primary energy source; Solid fuels; Stoves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063756345

Differences in climate conditions and the appearance of severe events, like droughts, has a significant imprint on local, regional and global agricultural productivity. The goal of this paper is to present remotely sensed approaches for water availability and requirements in vulnerable agriculture. Earth Observation (EO) data contribute to precision agriculture for efficient crop monitoring and irrigation management. A drought susceptible region considered as vulnerable farming was chosen, in the Thessaly prefecture in Central Greece. Water availability is measured by means of precipitation frequency examination and drought estimation. Crop water requirements are measured by assessing crop evapotranspiration (ET) with the synergistic use of WV-2 satellite images and ground-truth data. The remote-based ETcsat is assessed by utilizing the reference ETo derived from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) methodology, while the meteorological data and Kc are evolved from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). According to the rainfall frequency studies, indicators demonstrate a significant precipitation decrease. The results reveal the importance of water availability estimation for facing agriculture water needs and the necessity for monitoring of drought conditions in a vulnerable Mediterranean area in order to plan an integrated strategy for climate adaptation. Moreover, the conclusions clarify the usefulness of collaborating innovative very high spatial and sperctral resolution EO images along with ground-truth data for crop ET monitoring and also the assimilation into the precision agriculture methodology which is valuable for optimal agricultural production. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Drought; Evapotranspiration; Precision farming; Remote sensing; Vulnerable agriculture; Water availability","Crops; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Frequency estimation; Precision agriculture; Productivity; Agricultural productions; Agricultural productivity; Crop evapotranspiration; Crop water requirements; Food and agriculture organizations; Normalized difference vegetation index; Precision farming; Water availability; Remote sensing; agricultural production; climate conditions; drought; evapotranspiration; precision agriculture; remote sensing; vulnerability; water availability; water use; Greece; Thessaly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059674067

Solar geoengineering has potential to reduce the climate effects of greenhouse gas emissions through albedo modification, yet more research is needed to better understand how these techniques might impact terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we utilize the fully coupled version of the Community Earth System Model to run transient solar geoengineering simulations designed to stabilize radiative forcing starting mid-century, relative to the Representative Concentration Pathway 6 (RCP6) scenario. Using results from 100-year simulations, we analyze model output through the lens of ecosystem-relevant metrics. We find that solar geoengineering improves the conservation outlook under climate change, but there are still potential impacts on terrestrial vegetation. We show that rates of warming and the climate velocity of temperature are minimized globally under solar geoengineering by the end of the century, while trends persist over land in the Northern Hemisphere. Moisture is an additional constraint on vegetation, and in the tropics the climate velocity of precipitation dominates over that of temperature. Shifts in the amplitude of temperature and precipitation seasonal cycles have implications for vegetation phenology. Different metrics for vegetation productivity also show decreases under solar geoengineering relative to RCP6, but could be related to the model parameterization of nutrient cycling. The coupling of water and carbon cycles is found to be an important mechanism for understanding changes in ecosystems under solar geoengineering. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Climate modeling; Solar geoengineering; Terrestrial ecosystems","Atmospheric radiation; Biodiversity; Climate models; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Vegetation; Geoengineering; Model parameterization; Northern Hemispheres; Radiative forcings; Terrestrial ecosystems; Terrestrial vegetation; Vegetation phenology; Vegetation productivity; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; climate modeling; greenhouse gas; Northern Hemisphere; nutrient cycling; phenology; precipitation (climatology); radiative forcing; temperature effect; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061335423

The analysis is carried out for the uniform distribution (UD) and randomly oriented (RO) distribution of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) while the nanoplate and the foundation are considered to be temperature-dependent. Using Hamilton's principle, the governing differential equations are derived based on the Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory and sinusoidal shear deformation theory (SSDT).

We analyze the spatiotemporal variations of the vertical column densities (VCDs) of tropospheric NO2 with the level of urban development across China during the period 2005–2016. Nighttime light (NTL) data are applied as a proxy for urban development to investigate the relationship between NO2 pollution and urban development. Both NO2 column data and NTL data are observed by satellite measurements. The annual mean of NO2 VCDs is presented on a grid basis. The average annual variations of NO2 VCDs and NTL value are detected for all 341 prefectural cities. Two-thirds of the cities reached their peak NO2 pollution level around 2010–2012, and decreased afterward. About 10% of the western cities kept on increasing their NO2 levels until 2016. All cities are classified into four categories with respect to the average annual variations of NO2 /NTL in 2005–2010, and 2011–2016. Approximately 62% of the cities turned the average annual variations of NO2 /NTL from positive to negative. 19% of the cities are in the positive-positive category and 11% of the cities are in the negative-negative category. The remaining 8% of the cities changed their ratios from negative to positive. We summarize the national air pollution regulations, and our results show the effectiveness of the regulations for most eastern China cities.

The rules, agreed at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, set out in clear terms how parties to the Paris Agreement can implement, track and progressively enhance their contributions to tackling climate change. In a promising move, the European Union has resolved to take action to restrict single-use plastic products. A meeting of the European Parliament and Permanent Representatives Committee agreed the Council’s position on a proposal for a new directive which will ban the use of certain single-use plastics for which an alternative exists. This embryonic development has all the hallmarks of becoming law in the very near future. In the UK, the government issued a new Clean Air Strategy in January 2019. The new strategy hit headlines with, in particular, a bold new goal to reduce particulate matter from the burning of wood and coal in open fires and domestic stoves, together with an assault on the emissions of ammonia from farming. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies particulates as the most damaging to humans. It hails the move as a global example for other countries to follow. There have been concerns raised about the lack of teeth in the strategy to enforce limits and restrictions. This welcome strategy comes after the government’s repeated defeat in the courts over its failures on clean air. There have, over the last quarter, been a number of cases that concern fracking.

We explore sources of uncertainty in the representation of aerosol properties using an ensemble of simulations performed at 24-km resolution with WRF-Chem over eastern North America. The sensitivity of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and near-surface fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) to planetary boundary layer (PBL) and aerosol schemes (modal with secondary organic aerosol versus sectional but excluding secondary organic aerosol), as well as different emission inventories (National Emission Inventory [NEI] 2005 versus 2011) is examined. We quantify the spread among ensemble members with respect to the model setup and compute statistical metrics to identify the run configuration that exhibits greatest fidelity relative to observations of aerosol and meteorological properties. Use of the Modal Aerosol Dynamics Model for Europe/Secondary Organic Aerosol Model scheme leads to highest agreement with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer clear-sky AOD observations particularly when the 2005 NEI is used (with either PBL scheme). These members exhibit small negative mean fractional bias over the simulation domain (&lt;2%) and relatively high spatial correlation in summertime mean monthly AOD (&gt;0.5). The aerosol scheme and NEI dominate the ensemble spread in AOD. Near-surface PM2.5 is also dependent on PBL scheme and is best reproduced in runs adopting a sectional approach and emissions for 2011. Thus, WRF-Chem configuration associated with highest agreement with AOD observations is not the same as for PM2.5, possibly reflecting the importance of columnar water vapor in dictating AOD or other unexplored uncertainties linking surface mass concentrations to column optical properties. ©2019.

As power systems increasingly shift towards wind and solar power, these resource changes will increasingly impact power system operations. We assess how power system operations will be affected by climate change impacts on wind and solar resources by generating wind and solar generation profiles for a reference period and five climate change projections. We then run a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to dispatch a high-renewable generator fleet with these profiles. For climate change projections, we use 2041-2050 output from five global climate models (GCMs) for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for Texas, our study system. All five GCMs indicate increased wind generation potential by 1%-4% under climate change in Texas, while three and two GCMs indicate increased and decreased solar generation potential, respectively, by up to 1%. Uneven generation potential changes across time result in greater changes in dispatched generation by fuel type. Notably, nuclear generation decreases across GCMs by up to 7%, largely in low-demand (winter) months when nuclear plants, which have a high minimum stable load, must reduce their generation to avoid overgeneration. Increased wind and/or solar generation result in reduced system CO2 emissions and electricity production costs across four of the five GCMs by 8-16 million tons and $216-516 million, or by 2% and 1%, respectively.

Sustainable governance of Water–Energy–Food (WEF) requires innovative and cross-sectorial systems of provisioning. However, practitioners have often treated WEF as separate domains, while ignoring their interconnectedness. What is missing is an ‘Urban Nexus’ perspective, which assumes that environmental flows of WEF interact and relate to one another in achieving urban sustainable development. This paper contributes to theorizing the urban nexus and to understand its emergence and governance from a more socio-material perspective. It offers a conceptual framework that helps to shed light on the social and material flows shaping connections between the sectors of WEF, and the actors facilitating these connections. The paper suggests that switchers and programmers link and configure the socio-material flows of WEF facilitating the emergence of nexus governance networks and nexus programs. In doing so, the paper provides three examples of cities to test the conceptual framework by analyzing their main challenges and examples around the nexus. It demonstrates that material and social dimensions of WEF might not play an equal role in steering synergies or trade-offs—either material or social flows and their agents can be central in facilitating a nexus or in preventing it to take shape. The paper argues that material-focused methodologies need to be complemented with a social flows analysis that pays attention to the daily practice, policies, ideologies, networks or any kind of socio-cultural meaning shaping WEF provisioning. © 2018, The Author(s).","Environmental flows; Networks; Urban governance; Urban nexus; Water–Energy–Food",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048357722

Carbon catabolite repression, governed by the Crc protein, controls the availability of several enzymes and transporters involved in the assimilation of secondary carbon sources. Yet, the regulation exerted by Crc on redox metabolism of P. aeruginosa (hence, on the overall physiology) had hitherto been unexplored. In this study, we address the intimate connection between carbon catabolite repression and metabolic robustness of P. aeruginosa PAO1. In particular, we explored the interplay between oxidative stress, metabolic rearrangements in central carbon metabolism and the cellular redox state. By adopting a combination of quantitative physiology experiments, multiomic analyses, transcriptional patterns of key genes, measurement of metabolic activities in vitro and direct quantification of redox balances both in the wild-type strain and in an isogenic Δcrc derivative, we demonstrate that Crc orchestrates the overall response of P. aeruginosa to oxidative stress via reshaping of the core metabolic architecture in this bacterium. © 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"bacterial protein; crc protein, Pseudomonas; repressor protein; catabolite repression; gene expression regulation; genetics; oxidative stress; physiology; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Bacterial Proteins; Catabolite Repression; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Oxidative Stress; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Repressor Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058700992

A potential strategy to reduce N2O emissions would be to enhance the activity of N2O reductase (NOS) in the denitrifying microbial community. A survey of existing literature on denitrification in wastewater treatment systems showed that the N2O reducing capacity (VmaxN2O→N2) exceeded the capacity to produce N2O (VmaxNO3→N2O) by a factor of 2–10. This suggests that denitrification can be an effective sink for N2O, potentially scavenging a fraction of the N2O produced by ammonium oxidation or abiotic reactions. We conducted a series of incubation experiments with freshly sampled activated sludge from a wastewater treatment system in Oslo and found that the ratio α = VmaxN2O→N2/VmaxNO3→N2O fluctuated between 2 and 5 in samples taken at intervals over a period of 5 weeks. Adding a cocktail of carbon substrates resulted in increasing rates, but had no significant effect on α. Based on these results – complemented with qPCR and metaproteomic data – we discuss whether the overcapacity to reduce N2O can be ascribed to gene/protein abundance ratios (nosZ/nir), or whether in-cell competition between the reductases for electrons could be of greater importance. © 2018 The Author(s)","Activated sludge; Denitrification; Nitrous oxide; Wastewater treatment","Activated sludge process; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Polymerase chain reaction; Reaction intermediates; Reclamation; Abiotic reactions; Activated sludge; Ammonium oxidation; Carbon substrates; Denitrifying organisms; Microbial communities; Nitrous oxide; Wastewater treatment system; Wastewater treatment; ammonia; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; ammonium derivative; nitrous oxide; activated sludge; ammonium compound; bioremediation; biotechnology; denitrification; emission control; enzyme activity; experimental study; microbial activity; nitrifying bacterium; nitrous oxide; oxidation; polymerase chain reaction; scavenging (chemistry); wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; Article; denitrification; denitrifyer; greenhouse gas; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); respiratory chain; waste water management; sewage; waste water; Norway; Oslo [Norway]; Ammonium Compounds; Denitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Sewage; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059458296

Back trajectories, satellite imagery, and composition differences among particles from scanning electron microscopy revealed a subset of particles with dolomite or calcite that likely came from Asia. Using focused ion-beam tomography and the discrete dipole approximation, we show how small amounts of an iron phase (oxide or carbonate), or in one case soot, affected extinction and scattering compared with particles of neat dolomite or calcite. We show how particles exhibit a range scattering values due to varying orientations of the inclusion phases. Extinction efficiencies for the heterogeneous particles with dolomite (3.47) and calcite (3.36) were 19% to 21% lower than extinction for marine background air particles (3.72). Extinction for the Asian dust was, however, generally higher than for the neat particles. Compared to iron carbonate, the presence of an absorbing iron oxide affected scattering in Asian dust particles even at the low oxide concentrations studied here (0.6% to 8.1%). Scattering efficiency decreased by <1% with a 1% increase in hematite but by 2% to 5% with magnetite. Asian dust scattered light strongly forward, but backscattering was 56% larger than for the marine background air particles. Backscattering in the Asian dust was also larger with magnetite than hematite. Single scattering albedo for Asian dust with hematite, magnetite, or soot averaged 0.96 ± 0.06 ((Formula presented.)) but was as low as 0.72 with a magnetite mass of 5.8%. Published 2019.

The 79 trucks had engine model years ranging from 2008 to 2015 and average (±standard deviation) miles per gallon of 5.5 ± 1.7, which is comparable to other large fleet studies. Engine output work used to overcome various forms of resistance was minimized at vehicle speeds between 54 and 60 mph, which led to best fuel economy. The average gallons-per-brake horsepower-hour (gal/BHP-HR) was 0.058 ± 0.0085. When comparing the gal/BHP-HR per trip speed, higher average trip speeds led to improved fuel economy (lower gal/BHP-HR). In the case of out-of-state line-haul trucks, fuel economy was also dependent on model year. The newer model year out-of-state line-haul truck (2014) had a significant improvement in fuel economy compared with the older model year trucks (2012 and 2013). This could be the result of more stringent CO2 emission standards beginning for model year 2014 trucks under the Phase 1 Greenhouse Gas rule, but data on more vehicles would further corroborate this. The trip-averaged CO2 emissions were calculated for each truck and it was found that some truck groups displayed consistent trip-averaged emissions whereas others displayed high variability despite belonging to the same fleet. Several of the trucks engaged in significant idling, with a median contribution to their CO2 emissions of 4.2%. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,"Carbon dioxide; Engines; Fleet operations; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Trucks; Brake horsepowers; CO2 emissions; Engine modeling; Engine output; Haul trucks; Heavy-duty diesel; Standard deviation; Vehicle speed; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062661311

Second, the article explores the epistemological notions of transdisciplinary education: self-training, hetero-training, eco-training, and onto-training. Third, the article argues that as a result, Educational Sciences of Good Living emerged to (re)design regenerative cultures that face socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene age.

This study examined sense of place as a source of tension in conflicts sparked by two energy proposals. The Bute Inlet run-of-river hydroelectric project would power British Columbia’s remote Central Coast, and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion would transport bitumen from Alberta’s oil sands to tankers for export. Surveys, interviews, and mapping were used to investigate the depth and character of participants’ sense of favorite places and places expected to be affected by the projects, with appreciation, concern, and responsibility for nature as organizing themes. We discovered a regional, nature-centric sense of place on the south coast, and a sense of place among Albertans linked to that province’s oil and gas economy and its reputation as Canada’s chief breadwinner. Ties to natural places were found to underpin environmental advocacy by tapping into deep place connections as well as place connections conveyed through network ideologies and the protests themselves. We outline for consideration key characteristics of a regional sense of place, and offer ways to mitigate place-based economy versus environment conflicts. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","environmental advocacy; natural resource conflict; place-protection; sense of place; regional place identity","Oil sands; Oil tankers; Economy versus environments; environmental advocacy; Environmental conflict; Hydroelectric project; Key characteristics; regional place identity; Resource conflict; Sense of place; Surveys; conflict management; environmentalism; hydroelectric power; oil production; sense of place; Alberta; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061330365

This threatens the equilibrium of the socio-ecosystems where they are located and on which they depend: underground water resources are exploited with a disregard for sustainability; land is reclaimed from wetlands or lagoons; built-up areas, both formal and informal, grow without adequate urban planning. Together, all these forces can result in land surface deformation, subsidence or even uplift, which can increase risk within these already fragile socio-ecosystems. In particular, in the case of land subsidence, the risk of urban flooding can increase significantly, also considering the contribution of sea level rise driven by climate change. Monitoring such fast-changing environments is crucial to be able to identify key risks and plan adaptation responses to mitigate current and future flood risks. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool to monitor land deformation with high precision using relatively low-cost technology, also thanks to the open access data of Sentinel-1, which provides global observations every 6 days at 20-m ground resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate how it is possible to monitor land subsidence in urban coastal areas by means of permanent scatterer interferometry and Sentinel-1, exploiting an automatic procedure based on an integration of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). We present the results of PSI analysis over the cities of Banjul (the Gambia) and Lagos (Nigeria) showing a comparison of results obtained with TerraSAR-X, Constellation of Small Satellites for the Mediterranean Basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) and Environmental Satellite advanced synthetic aperture radar (Envisat-ASAR) data.

Transcriptomic analysis of the wild type strain grown under different combinations of carbon and nitrogen regimes was performed, to identify differentially regulated genes. Carbon metabolism predominates as the most important regulatory signal but for many genes, both carbon and nitrogen metabolisms coordinate regulation. To identify mechanisms coordinating nitrogen and carbon metabolism, we tested the role of AreB, previously identified as a regulator of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism. Deletion of areB has significant phenotypic effects on the utilization of specific carbon sources, confirming its role in the regulation of carbon metabolism. AreB was shown to regulate the expression of areA, tamA, creA, xprG and cpcA regulatory genes suggesting areB has a range of indirect, regulatory effects.

Heavy industries, which consume almost 50% of total energy produced, there is a strong need to implement energy efficiency measures. The electric motor driven systems (EMDS) such as fans, blowers, ventilators, pumps, and compressors are widely used in industries and consume 80% of total industrial electricity. A huge electrical energy saving potential exists with these applications since they frequently come under partial load condition. The optimal flux operation of motors provides significant savings in such conditions, especially in the steady-state. There are two methods, namely, loss model control (LMC) and search control (SC) used for finding an optimal flux value. In this paper, a case study has been performed to analyze the efficiency improvement of motors of an industrial unit by utilizing superior features of LMC and SC techniques together in a novel way. A total of 65 EMDS are being considered as energy-efficiency load points for the detailed investigation of a typical integrated cement-manufacturing unit, located at Durg district, C.G., India. The efficiency improvement validation has been carried out on the MATLAB platform. Significant savings of $2.19 million per annum in energy expenditures, 48,899 tons less per annum of combusted coal and nearly 50,366 tons less greenhouse emissions are estimated at 1 yr. The projected energy use will be in line with “good practice” benchmarks for the sector as well help in “carbon emission reduction target” of state and country. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 672–679, 2019. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","cement manufacturing; efficiency; environment; optimal flux operation; optimization","Blowers; Cement manufacture; Cements; Efficiency; Electric drives; Electric motors; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Induction motors; Manufacture; Optimization; American Institute of Chemical Engineers; Carbon emission reductions; Cement manufacturing; Electrical energy savings; Energy efficient operations; environment; Environmental analysis; optimal flux operation; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057497352

The results show that the upgradation from Euro-III to Euro-VI emission standards for passenger cars could reduce up to 83–90% of CO, 86–92% of HC, 83–84% of CO2 during peak hours and 77% of NOx emissions during off-peak hours. The change of fuel from gasoline to CNG for auto-rickshaw could reduces up to 89% of HC and CO, 32–36% of CO2 during peak hours and 23–56% of NOx emissions during off-peak hours. And, by regulating the frequency of buses, emissions of CO2, CO and HC from both passenger car and auto-rickshaw reduced up to 40–66% during peak hours and NOx up to 40% during off-peak hours. The results, thus, showed that traffic flow management can bring significant emission reductions.

Cheap in fair but old technology and adulterated fuel quality make it emission intensive. Therefore, this study is aiming the emission assessment of most demanding mode of transportation. The study investigated the variation in the emission rate with respect to operating kinetics by real–world on–road emission measurements of driving profile. The video clips screening revealed that owing to smaller size auto–rickshaw negotiates the traffic, smaller streets and weaves through the mixed traffic which increases frequency of wear and tear engine and increases the emission rate. During peak hours up to 80% of time auto–rickshaw operates in speed 6–28 km/h and acceleration -1 to 1 m/s2, which subjected to higher frequency of stop–and–go pattern of traffic flow and therefore causing higher engine load, subjected to higher emission rate. Each pollutant showed different behavior for the same variations in speed and acceleration. The emission rates of CO and HC was found higher at speed range12–30 km/h whereas emission rate of NOx and CO2 were found higher speed range of 30–40 km/h. The evaluation of travelling behavior corresponding instantaneous emission of auto-rickshaw concludes that and the improving vehicle flow and reducing frequency of sudden acceleration and deceleration could curb emission rate and reduce fuel consumption. © 2019 URSI.

The leaf stoichiometric characteristics differed significantly among the plant species of the four different life forms, the lowest C content occurring in submerged macrophytes and the highest N content in free-floating macrophytes. Overall, though the variance explained by the linear regression models was low, the C and N contents decreased toward the northern latitudes, the C content and the C:N ratios increased with increasing altitude. Multiple regressions revealed that the stoichiometric characteristics of submerged macrophytes varied significantly across the large spatial and climatic gradients and among the species studied. For floating-leaved and emergent macrophytes, no correlation between climate factors and SC, FAA, starch, TOPH, C, and N contents and C:N ratio was observed. For free-floating macrophytes, the TOPH content was markedly positively correlated with latitude and altitude. We conclude that the C and N contents related more closely to latitude, altitude or mean annual air temperature than did the C and N metabolic indicators for the submerged macrophytes, while the relationships with the metabolic indicators turned out to be insignificant for most species of the other life forms. The results helped us to identify species with significant physiological plasticity across geographic and climatic gradients in China, and such information is useful when conducting restoration of lost aquatic plants in different climate regions. © 2019 Chou, Cao, Ni, Xie and Jeppesen.","Aquatic macrophytes; Biogeographical; Climate gradients; Life form; Stoichiometry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064218214

Progression of healthy liver to steatosis and NASH is not yet fully understood in terms of process and response. Hepatic oxidative stress is believed to be one of the factors driving steatosis to NASH. Oxidative protein modification is the major cause of protein functional impairment in which alteration of key hepatic enzymes is likely to be a crucial factor for NAFLD biology. In the present study, we aimed to discover carbonylated protein profiles involving in NAFLD biology in vitro. Methods: Hepatocyte cell line was used to induce steatosis with fatty acids (FA) in the presence and absence of menadione (oxidative stress inducer). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics and dinitrophenyl hydrazine derivatization technique were used to identify carbonylated proteins. Sequentially, in order to view changes in protein carbonylation pathway, enrichment using Funrich algorithm was performed. The selected carbonylated proteins were validated with western blot and carbonylated sites were further identified by high-resolution LC-MS/MS. Results: Proteomic results and pathway analysis revealed that carbonylated proteins are involved in NASH pathogenesis pathways in which most of them play important roles in energy metabolisms. Particularly, carbonylation level of ATP synthase subunit α (ATP5A), a key protein in cellular respiration, was reduced after FA and FA with oxidative stress treatment, whereas its expression was not altered. Carbonylated sites on this protein were identified and it was revealed that these sites are located in nucleotide binding region. Modification of these sites may, therefore, disturb ATP5A activity. As a consequence, the lower carbonylation level on ATP5A after FA treatment solely or with oxidative stress can increase ATP production. Conclusions: The reduction in carbonylated level of ATP5A might occur to generate more energy in response to pathological conditions, in our case, fat accumulation and oxidative stress in hepatocytes. This would imply the association between protein carbonylation and molecular response to development of steatosis and NASH. © 2019 The Author(s).","Fatty acids; Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; Oxidative stress; Protein carbonylation; Proteomics; Redox proteomics","2,4 dinitrophenol; ATP synthase subunit alpha; fatty acid; menadione; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; unclassified drug; Article; cell respiration; disease course; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme synthesis; Hep-G2 cell line; in vitro study; lipid storage; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver cell; nonalcoholic fatty liver; oxidative stress; protein analysis; protein carbonylation; protein expression; protein modification; proteomics; steatosis; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Western blotting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063519646

In South Africa, it is increasingly apparent that delays in responding to climate change over the past decades have jeopardized human life and livelihoods. While slow progress with mitigation, especially in the energy sector, has garnered much attention, focus is now shifting to developing plans and systems to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Methods: We applied systematic review methods to assess progress with climate change adaptation in the health sector in South Africa. This case study provides useful lessons which could be applied in other countries in the African region, or globally. We reviewed the literature indexed in PubMed and Web of Science, together with relevant grey literature. We included articles describing adaptation interventions to reduce the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible. Data from included articles and grey literature were summed thematically. Results: Of the 820 publications screened, 21 were included, together with an additional xx papers. Very few studies presented findings of an intervention or used high-quality research designs. Several policy frameworks for climate change have been developed at national and local government levels. These, however, pay little attention to health concerns and the specific needs of vulnerable groups. Systems for forecasting extreme weather, and tracking malaria and other infections appear well established. Yet, there is little evidence about the country’s preparedness for extreme weather events, or the ability of the already strained health system to respond to these events. Seemingly, few adaptation measures have taken place in occupational and other settings. To date, little attention has been given to climate change in training curricula for health workers. Conclusions: Overall, the volume and quality of research is disappointing, and disproportionate to the threat posed by climate change in South Africa. This is surprising given that the requisite expertise for policy advocacy, identifying effective interventions and implementing systems-based approaches rests within the health sector. More effective use of data, a traditional strength of health professionals, could support adaptation and promote accountability of the state. With increased health-sector leadership, climate change could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent, adequately-resourced response. Such a shift in South Africa, but also beyond the country, may play a key role in accelerating climate change adaptation and mitigation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Extreme weather; Health policy; Health systems; Heat; South Africa","climate change; climate effect; environmental policy; extreme event; health policy; health worker; temperature effect; case control study; climate change; curriculum; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; government; health care cost; health care personnel; health care planning; health care policy; health care system; health service; human; incidence; listeriosis; malaria; medical information system; nonhuman; priority journal; private sector; public health; Review; risk reduction; sea surface temperature; South Africa; systematic review; temperature acclimatization; training; role playing; South Africa; Climate Change; Health Care Sector; Humans; Role; South Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063187244

This CAM4-BAM captures the expected characteristics that the dust aerosol optical depth and loading over East Asia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) were significantly greater compared to the current climate. A comparative analysis of the Active and Passive experiments reveals that consideration of the dust-radiation interaction can significantly reduce dust emissions and then weaken the whole dust cycle, including loading, transport, and dry and wet depositions over East Asia. Further analysis of the dust-radiation feedback shows that the DRF decreases surface sensible heat, mainly owing to the negative surface forcing induced by dust with a value of -11.8 W m -2. The decreased surface sensible heat weakens the turbulent energy within the planetary boundary layer and the surface wind speed, and then reduces the regional dust emissions. This process creates a negative DRF-emission feedback loop to affect the dust cycle during the LGM. Further analysis reveals that the dust emissions in the LGM over East Asia were more reduced, with amounts of -77.2 Tg season -1 by the negative DRF-emission feedback, compared to the current climate with -6.8 Tg season -1. The two ratios of this reduction to their emissions are close to -10.7% for the LGM and -7.5% for the current climate. © 2019 by the authors.

In these regions, if human choose traditional development mode to constantly exploited natural resources for developing economy, the environment will be hardly destroyed or polluted, and finally cause larger economic loss and make poverty more serious. It formed a development dilemma of environmental fragility-economic poverty vicious circle (FPVC). How to break FPVC has been the goal being pursued in the literature worldwide. In this study, we constructed a Circular-Economy-Effect-and-Policy-Simulation-System-Dynamics (CEEPS-SD) model, evaluated the ecological economic comprehensive effects and simulated the future development trends of the circular economy system (CES) which we have planned, constantly tracked and improved in Anding District of Northwest China for 16 years, that is a typical FPVC area. The evaluation and simulation results notably evidenced that the CES had four ecological economic benefits: livestock faeces pollution elimination, water saving, agricultural waste recycling, as well as energy conservation and emission reduction. Through long-term and stable operation, the CES can expand its ecological economic comprehensive benefits constantly and finally eliminate the double pressures of ecological fragility and economic poverty. This study could help large number similar FPVC areas in the world to scientifically build, manage, evaluate, simulate and optimize CES for getting rid of FPVC and achieving sustainable development, which has important theoretical significance and practical value. © 2018","CEEPS-SD model; Circular economy system; Ecological economic effects; FPVC development dilemma; Simulation and improvement","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Economic analysis; Emission control; Losses; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water pollution; Water recycling; Circular economy; Ecological economics; FPVC development dilemma; Sd models; Simulation and improvement; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058106817

The newly developed model is found to reproduce IFTs between methane and water with an absolute average relative deviation (AARD) of 3.5% and greatly outperform the three existing correlations. Both a higher methane solubility in aqueous phase and a higher water solubility in hydrocarbon phase can decrease the IFT. Also, the new model can help explain the slight IFT change for methane-water pair but a simultaneously great change of their mutual solubility at low pressures. Temperature is found to exert an effect on IFT mainly through regulating the water solubility in hydrocarbon phase, while the pressure imposes an impact on IFT mainly through regulating the methane solubility in aqueous phase. The newly developed model can yield a reasonable estimate for the IFTs between natural gas and water/brine. It is found that using two sets of correlations and adding a pressure term are both necessary to account for the density effects on IFT for CO2-water pair in the vapor-liquid (aqueous) region at temperatures lower and near the CO2 critical temperature (i.e., 304.3 K), whereas they are not necessary for methane-water pair, whose density is changed more smoothly rather than sharply in the supercritical region. In addition, a new mixing rule is developed to successfully extend the IFT correlations based on mutual solubility to the ternary methane-CO2-water systems with an AARD of 5.2%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Equation of state; Interfacial tension; Methane-water/brine-CO2 systems; Mixing rule; Mutual solubility","Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Methane; Mixing; Surface tension; Critical temperatures; Equation of state; Equilibrium interfacial tension; Methane solubility; Mixing rules; Mutual solubility; Relative deviations; Super-critical regions; Solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058241908

The utilization of inhibitor is an effective method to inhibit the formation of PCDD/Fs. In the present study, the thiourea is used as an effective inhibitor in two full-scale MSW incinerators, and the suppression mechanisms are investigated in detail. After the injection of thiourea, the total PCDD/Fs emission factor decreases from 6.19 and 7.89 mg/t MSW (0.13 and 0.18 mg I-TEQ/t MSW) to 1.35 and 1.34 mg/t MSW (0.029 and 0.026 mg I-TEQ/t MSW), respectively for incinerator A and B. In the post-combustion zone, the contribution of three pathways on PCDD/Fs formation is found to be in the order of de novo synthesis &gt; chlorophenol (CP) route formation &gt; chlorination of dibenzofuran (DF) and dibenzodioxin (DD). The S and N in thiourea poison the catalytic metals, thus significantly hindering the de novo synthesis of PCDD/Fs. Since metal catalysts for precursor-formation are not as crucial as for de novo synthesis, the thiourea has less suppression effect on CP-route synthesis, which is identified from the reduction of signal intensity of CP-route congeners. In addition, the chlorination of DF/DD is also observed to be suppressed, indicating the transformation of Cl2 to less activate HCl caused by thiourea. This study provides a robust basis to promote the industrial application of inhibitor to control the emissions of PCDD/Fs from MSW incinerator. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Emission reduction; Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI); Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and -furans (PCDF); S-N-containing compounds; Suppression","Aromatic compounds; Catalysts; Chlorination; Chlorine compounds; Emission control; Organic pollutants; Thioureas; Waste incineration; Emission reduction; Municipal solid waste incinerator; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; S-N-containing compounds; Signal intensities; Suppression; Suppression effects; Suppression mechanism; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056360071

The studied physical conditions include: (a) water temperature, (b) water salinity, and (c) flow structures (magnitudes and directions of flows between marine basins and the associated coastal zones and wetlands). We use numerical simulations of three hydro-climatically distinct cases to investigate the variations in hydro-climatic drivers and the resulting physical conditions (a-c) among the cases. The studied hydro-climatic forcing variables are: net surface heat flux, wind conditions, saltwater influx from the North Sea, and freshwater runoff from land. For these variables, the available observation-based data show that the total runoff from land is significantly and positively correlated with precipitation on the sea itself, and negatively correlated with saltwater influx from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea. Overall, the physical condition (a-c) variability in the Baltic Sea and its coastal zones is found to be pairwise well-explained by simulation case differences as follows: (a) Net heat flux is a main control of sea water temperature. (b) Runoff from land, along with the correlated salt water influx from the North Sea, controls average sea salinity; with the variability of local river discharges shifting some coastal zones to deviate from the average sea condition. (c)Wind variability and change control the Baltic Sea flow structure, primarily in terms of flow magnitude and less so in terms of flow direction. For specific coastal wetland zones, considerable salinity differences from average Baltic Sea conditions (due to variability in local river discharges) are found for the coasts of Finland and Estonia, while the coastal wetland zones of south-eastern Sweden, and of Estonia and Latvia, emerge as particularly sensitive to wind shifts. © 2019 by the authors.","Baltic sea; Coastal wetlands; FVCOM; Hydro-climatic variability and change; Physical sea changes","Flow structure; Heat flux; Large scale systems; Runoff; Seawater; Temperature; Wetlands; Baltic sea; Climatic variability; Coastal wetlands; FVCOM; Physical sea changes; Coastal zones; coastal wetland; flow velocity; heat flux; hydrometeorology; river discharge; salinity; salt water; water temperature; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Estonia; Finland; Latvia; North Sea; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065024420

In this study, a sensitive method using gas chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry combined with ultrasonic-assisted extraction and multi-phase column purification was developed for simultaneously determination of 29 flame retardants including halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) in PM2.5 samples. Extraction time, as well as the type and volume of elution solvent were optimized. The recoveries of all target flame retardants from PM2.5 samples were in the range of 70%‒130%, with good repeatability and reproducibility (0.39%‒17.4%). The instrumental detection limits (IDLs) and method quantitation limits (MQLs) of HFRs were in the range of 0.004‒5.44 pg and 0.002‒2.52 pg m−3, while those of OPFRs were 0.003‒0.23 pg and 0.07‒5.41 pg m−3, respectively.

A “double high” pollution episode (i.e., both NO2 and O3 concentrations exceeding the ambient air quality standards of China) was selected as a typical case to identify a collaborative control method for NO2 and O3 by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA). Considering the nonlinear relationship between O3 and its precursors; we scaled down the volatile organic carbons (VOC) and NOx emission inventories to investigate O3 responses. The results showed that Foshan is VOC-sensitive and that the VOC-NOx reduction ratio more than 1:1 not only helped to steadily reduce O3 concentrations but also to avoid an increase in NO2 concentrations. On-road and Non-road mobile sources and ports were found to be the dominant sources of NO2, while O3 was mostly affected by organic solvents in Foshan. Controls on ports and the organic solvents are key to achieving a synergetic control of NO2 and O3 pollution in Foshan.

However, most dust emission simulations utilizing dust emission scheme merely investigate natural dust, neglecting the contributions of anthropogenic dust induced by direct or indirect anthropogenic activities, resulting in great uncertainties in estimating dust emissions by previous numerical modelling. To comprehensively reproduce the anthropogenic dust emissions process, both “indirect” and “direct” anthropogenic dust emission schemes were constructed to simulate anthropogenic dust emissions originated from diverse kinds of source regions in the study. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) retrievals were utilized as the constraint of anthropogenic dust simulations. Results showed that using both indirect and direct anthropogenic dust emission schemes show good performance on reproducing the spatio-temporal distributions of anthropogenic dust at the global scale during 2007–2010. High value centers of anthropogenic dust emission fluxes locate in India, the east of China, North America, and Africa. Compared with natural dust emissions, indirect anthropogenic dust emissions show an indistinctive seasonal variation, with seasonal differences generally less than 0.42 μg m−2 s−1. Among indirect anthropogenic dust emissions, pasturelands produce more anthropogenic dust particles emission into the atmosphere than croplands at approximately 0.28 μg m−2 s−1, contributing 75.9% of indirect anthropogenic dust emissions. The developing regions emit much higher direct anthropogenic dust emissions than those from developed regions.

The evaluation system model of fragility is established based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in order to analyze how climate change affects fragility directly or indirectly, then the abstract problem is transferred into a mathematic one. When the weight of index identified, the fragility could be calculated and the sensitive index can be obtained by Local Amplification. Since the trend of development can lead to the fluctuation of fragility, quadratic smooth in time series method is applied to predict the change of the fragility. Then strategies are put forward to mitigate the impact of climate change on fragility. Besides, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to extend the model to evaluate the fragility of continents. When conducting the experiment, the result accords with the reality. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Analytic hierarchy process; Climate models; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Principal component analysis; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Hot spot; Sensitive index; System modeling; Time series method; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063380965

However, g-C3N4 still suffers from random charge carriers transfer in planes and low efficiency in reactants activation, which leads to unsatisfactory photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, these formidable challenges are addressed via a new strategy of O/La co-functionalization in amorphous carbon nitride (C N-O La), leading to the formation of electronic channels for directional electron delivery in the interlayers, the generation of localized electrons for enhanced reactants activation and thus highly boosted photocatalytic performance for NO removal. With a closely combined experimental and theoretical approach, we have revealed that the breakage of in-plane hydrogen bonds between strands of polymeric melon units with CO32− could promote the amorphization of g-C3N4 and increase the visible light absorption ability. A directional electron delivery pathway (L2 → La → L1→ O) is proposed based on results of charge difference distribution and experimental observation. The electron localization could directly activate the O2 and NO molecules and dramatically promote the production of activated species (e.g. O2- and OH radicals) and thus enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. With the optimized electronic structure, the photocatalytic NO removal ratio of C N-O La is significantly increased from 35.8% of pristine g-C3N4 to 50.4% and it is stable for recycled runs. The in situ FT-IR spectra, in combination with ESR spectra and DFT calculations, unravel the conversion pathway of photocatalytic NO oxidation on C N-O La where some important reaction intermediates are discovered. This work could provide a fascinating modification strategy for carbon nitride and new insights into mechanistic understanding of 2D layered photocatalysts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amorphous carbon nitride; Electron delivery pathway; NO removal; Photocatalysis mechanism; Reactants activation","Air cleaners; Amorphous carbon; Carbon nitride; Chemical activation; Efficiency; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electronic structure; Electrons; Free radicals; Hydrogen bonds; Light; Light absorption; Nitrides; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Reaction intermediates; Delivery pathways; Electron localizations; Graphitic carbon nitrides; NO removal; Photocatalytic efficiency; Photocatalytic performance; Visible light absorption; Visible-light photocatalysts; Lanthanum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054168250

Different control strategies have been discussed to reduce air pollution, but possible outputs have not been identified. In this study, the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to simulate potential benefits from future emission control with unchanged meteorology. Fourteen scenarios towards energy, residential, agriculture, industry, and open burning were simulated and the changes in ozone (O3) and PM2.5 as well as health outcomes were evaluated. PM2.5 concentrations decreased significantly by reducing uses of solid fuels (S4), uses of diesel generating sets (S13) and applying new standards to industry facilities (S11) with maximum reductions of ∼50 μg/m3, ∼30 μg/m3 and ∼15 μg/m3 in north India, separately. Reducing uses of solid fuels caused significant O3 reduction by maximum &gt;8 ppb (S4, December), significant effects also occurred when applying new standards to current power plants (S1) (∼4 ppb, October.) and in S13 (∼3 ppb, December). Combination of all possible strategies would reduce O3 primary PM components (PPM) and total PM2.5 in December by &gt;20 ppb, &gt;40 μg/m3 and &gt;60 μg/m3 in north India, while O3 and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) would increase by 5 ppb and 2 μg/m3 in October in western and southern India.

We applied a process-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to simulate the spatial pattern of topsoil organic carbon changes from 2001 to 2010 under 4 crop-residue return scenarios in China. The carbon loss (28.89 Tg yr–1) with all crop-residue removal (CR0%) was partly reduced by 22.38 Tg C yr–1 under the status quo CR30% (30% of crop-residue return). The topsoil in cropland of China would become a net carbon sink if the crop-residue return rate was increased from 30% to 50%, or even 75%. The national SOC sequestration potential of cropland was estimated to be 25.53 Tg C yr–1 in CR50% and 52.85 Tg C yr–1 in CR75%, but with high spatial variability across regions. The highest rate of SOC sequestration potential in density occurred in Northwest and North China while the lowest was in East China. Croplands in North China tended to have stronger regional SOC sequestration potential in storage. During the decade, the reduced CO2 emissions from enhanced topsoil carbon in CR50% and CR75% were equivalent to 1.4% and 2.9% of the total CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement production in China, respectively. In conclusion, we recommend encouraging farmers to return crop-residue instead of burning in order to improve soil properties and alleviate atmospheric CO2 rises, especially in North China. © 2019, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

To solve the problem, this study first summarizes 12 restrictions for AMP promotion, and then analyzes to what degree the restrictions inhibit promotion and application and their interaction mechanism using the fuzzy DEMATEL model. In the final, the three key factors restricting AMP application and promotion in China, namely policies and support systems, AMP construction standard, and the laws and regulations, are explored.

However, the relative contributions of leaching and gaseous N emissions to intensified N losses are largely unknown. Thus, we simulated intensified precipitation seasonality in a subtropical forest by extending the dry season via rainfall exclusion and increasing the wet-season storms via irrigation without changing the total annual precipitation. Extending the dry season length increased the monthly mean soil NO3− content by 25%–64%, net N mineralization rate by 32%–40%, and net nitrification rate by 25%–28%. After adding water in the wet season, the monthly NO3− leaching was enhanced by 43% in the relatively dry year (2013, 2,094-mm annual rainfall), but reduced by 51% in the relatively wet year (2014, 1,551 mm). In contrast, the monthly mean N2O emissions were reduced by 24% in 2013 but increased by 78% in 2014. Overall, the annual inorganic N content was decreased significantly by the precipitation changes. Decrease of soil inorganic N might be linked to the enhanced NO3− leaching in 2013, and be linked to the increased N2O emissions in 2014. However, in both years the annual total amount of N lost through leaching was significantly greater than that through N2O emissions. The enhanced N2O emissions driven by wet-season storms were correlated with an increase in nirS abundance. Our results suggest that increased frequency of droughts and storms will decrease soil inorganic N content in warm and humid subtropical forests mainly through enhanced leaching losses. ©2019.

In China, approximately 20 million rural populations transfer to the urban areas annually, which results in a lot of new infrastructure construction and consumer requirements. This paper quantifies the numbers and trends of urban and rural resident on energy use and carbon footprint in Beijing from 1996 to 2011 by analysis of Consumer Lifestyle Approach (CLA) and carbon footprint. It provides a better understanding of complete energy consumption and carbon emissions profile in Beijing. The results show that for the Beijing residents, when direct and indirect energy consumption and CO2 emissions are taken into account, the total household energy consumption proportion compared to the city increases from 22.7% to 59.2%, and the total household CO2 emissions proportion increases from 32.2% to 68.8% in the research period. In the urbanization process, total energy consumption and carbon emissions of Beijing urban residents are significantly higher than those of rural residents. However, the transformation of a rural Beijing resident into an urban Beijing resident would not create a large difference between urban and rural areas in the per-capita energy consumption and per-capita carbon footprint. Results are assessed with respect to the available scientific literature, as well as potential available technological and policy solutions. Since the implementation that different policy instruments can mitigate carbon emissions, governments are gradually combining policy measures for the same technology. The results in this paper may help promote alternative consumption strategies in household sector which could entail more reasonable resource distribution and effective reduction of both urban and rural environmental influences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Carbon footprint; Consumer Lifestyle Approach; Urban and rural residents","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Rural areas; Beijing; Consumer Lifestyle Approach; Environmental influences; Household energy consumption; Infrastructure construction; Resource distribution; Total energy consumption; Urban and Rural Residents; Carbon footprint; accountability; carbon footprint; economic instrument; energy use; environmental economics; household structure; lifestyle; pollution policy; residential location; rural area; urban area; urbanization; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056860728

Previous attempts to reduce this carbon and electron loss focused on engineering of a single organism. In nature, most microorganisms live in complex communities where syntrophic interactions result in superior resource utilization. Here, we show that a synthetic syntrophy consisting of the solventogen Clostridium acetobutylicum, which converts simple and complex carbohydrates into a variety of chemicals, and the acetogen C. ljungdahlii which fixes CO2, achieved carbon recoveries into C2-C4 alcohols almost to the limit of substrate-electron availability, with minimal H2 and CO2 release. The syntrophic co-culture produced robust metabolic outcomes over a broad range of starting population ratios of the two organisms. We show that direct cell-to-cell interactions and material exchange among the two microbes enabled unforeseen rearrangements in the metabolism of the individual species that resulted in the production of non-native metabolites, namely isopropanol and 2,3-butanediol. This was accomplished by pathway-specific alterations of gene expression brought about by one organism on the other, and vice versa. While some of these gene-expression alterations can be explained by the exchange of metabolites that induce specific gene expression patterns, others, as demonstrated by co-culture setup in a transwell system, cannot. The latter, for now, would be attributed to complex direct physical interactions among the two organisms, thus providing a glimpse of the potential microbial complexity of simple or multicomponent microbiomes. Such direct material-transfer phenomena have not been documented in the literature. Furthermore, our study shows that syntrophic cultures offer a flexible platform for metabolite production with superior carbon recovery that can also be applied to electron-enhanced fermentations enabling even higher carbon recoveries. © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society",,"Biomolecules; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carboxylation; Clostridium; Cytology; Electrons; Fermentation; Metabolism; Metabolites; Recovery; Cell-to-cell interactions; Clostridium acetobutylicum; Complex carbohydrates; Gene expression patterns; Metabolite production; Microbial fermentation; Resource utilizations; Syntrophic interactions; Gene expression; 2 propanol; 2,3 butanediol; acetyl coenzyme A; carbohydrate; carbon; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; pyruvic acid; sugar; 2,3-butylene glycol; butanediol; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; Article; bacterial metabolism; carbon dioxide fixation; cell interaction; Clostridium acetobutylicum; coculture; controlled study; decarboxylation; electron; fermentation; gene expression; metabolite; microbial population dynamics; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; Clostridium; Clostridium acetobutylicum; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microflora; 2-Propanol; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Butylene Glycols; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Clostridium; Clostridium acetobutylicum; Fermentation; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056591043

The LDN framework assumes that SOC changes slowly, primarily by decomposition and respiration of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, there is growing evidence that soil erosion by wind, water and tillage also reduces SOC stocks rapidly after land use and cover change. Here, we modify a physically-based wind erosion sediment transport model to better represent the vegetation cover (using land surface aerodynamic roughness; that is the plant canopy coverage, stone cover, soil aggregates, etc. that protects the soil surface from wind erosion) and quantify the contribution of wind erosion to global SOC erosion (2001–2016). We use the wind erosion model to identify global dryland regions where SOC erosion by wind may be a significant problem for achieving LDN. Selected sites in global drylands also show SOC erosion by wind accelerating over time. Without targeting and reducing SOC erosion, management practices in these regions will fail to sequester SOC and reduce land degradation. We describe the interrelated nature of the LDN indicators, the importance of including SOC erosion by wind erosion and how by explicitly accounting for wind erosion processes, we can better represent the physical effects of changing land cover on land degradation. Our results for Earth's drylands show that modelling SOC stock reduction by wind erosion is better than using land cover and SOC independently. Furthermore, emphasising the role of wind erosion in UNCCD and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reporting will better support LDN and climate change mitigation and adaptation globally. © 2018","Land cover; Land degradation neutrality; Sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Wind erosion","carbon dioxide; organic carbon; adaptive environmental management; Article; canopy; climate change; decomposition; degradation; land use; model; priority journal; soil erosion; surface property; tillage; vegetation; wind erosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058804510

This is because of the current environmental challenges that have tremendously increased concerning air pollution, particularly pollutant emissions from vehicles. Yet, industries and governments alike have disregarded this phenomenon which has been considerably contributing to climate change. It is against this background that, the research works carried out in this present study is predominantly focusing on improving energy efficiency and reducing emission levels from diesel engines. This can be achieved with the help of atmospheric-plasma system which can offer a noble solution to the above-mentioned challenges due to its potential to improve combustion efficiency which leads to energy efficiency, while reducing emission levels from diesel engines. In this study, the performance and emissions of a diesel generator supplemented with an atmospheric-plasma system was examined. The diesel engine was used to examine the effects of fuel composition, or brake specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at different plasma system voltages. To this end, we equally examined the effects of atmospheric-plasma system on energy efficiency improvement and emissions reduction from diesel engine as the main purpose of this study. We do so by testing the diesel-fueled engine generator under the atmospheric-plasma system. The tests were carried out at a constant state condition with the engine running at 2200 rpm with torque and power outputs of 10.4 Nm (75% of the max load) and 2.1 kW, separately, for the tested fuels and this was used to increase the output voltage of the plasma system during this study. The plasma system ionized the intake air and improved the formation of free radicals upon combustion. During this study, the output voltage of the plasma was set within the range of 0–7 kV. The experimental results have indicated that formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein account for more than 75% of total carbonyl compounds emissions. Simultaneously, it was also observed from the results that higher plasma system voltage reduces pollutants emissions levels. Hence, such reduction is predominantly evident for nitrogen oxides, particulate matters and carbon monoxide. However, the marginal improvements of engine performance and emissions reduction become insignificant when the plasma system voltage reaches 6 kV. On the other hand, increasing the amount of plasma system voltages in diesel engine continues to significantly reduce pollutant emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric-plasma system; Carbonyl compounds; Diesel engine; Pollutant emissions; Saving energy","acetaldehyde; acrolein; carbon monoxide; carbonyl derivative; diesel fuel; formaldehyde; nitrogen oxide; gasoline; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; chemical compound; combustion; diesel engine; emission; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; performance assessment; plasma; traffic emission; air pollutant; Article; atmosphere; combustion; diesel engine; electric potential; energy conservation; exhaust gas; particulate matter; torque; air pollutant; air pollution; exhaust gas; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Gasoline; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060008499

A major reason of the unsuccessfulness may be attributed to imprecise comprehension on the sources of greenhouse gas pollution and their changing dynamics. Utilizing the LMDI decomposition method, this paper investigates the time- and spatial-dynamics of drivers governing global carbon emissions. We decompose and quantify the effects of different drivers, that is, population, affluence, energy intensity and carbon intensity, across time on global carbon emissions. Next based on country-level decomposition, we also calculate and track the spatial gravity centers of the effects of the drivers. Our results show that energy intensity effect is the leading contributor for carbon emission mitigation, whereas economic development, carbon emission intensity and population serve as factors accelerating carbon emissions. We also find significant heterogeneities in the spatial dynamics of the contribution of different drivers, implying that differentiated climate change policies should be made at different countries to effectively curb global carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Global carbon emission; ImPACT; LMDI decomposition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064058803

It was hypothesized that lime treatment can potentially lower the pCO2(water) in aquaculture ponds and hence make these aquatic bodies sinks for CO2. The results portrayed that NTP acted as a source of CO2 throughout the year (annual mean: 1929 ± 1397 μmol m−2 h−1), whereas, LTP acted as CO2 sinks post lime addition (monthly mean ranged from −366 ± 16 to −449 ± 32 μmol m−2 h−1), though the effect of lime addition was found to diminish by the next month and it acted as source for CO2 in the months when no lime treatment was done (LTP annual mean: 1010 ± 1617 μmol m−2 h−1). Lime treatment increased the pH level and reduced the turbidity which facilitated optimum photosynthesis and the productivity increased rapidly. Beyond the critical pH value of 8.9–9.0, the pCO2(water) values became under-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 concentration. The effect of lime treatment was not found to prevail in the following months as a steady source of sewage from the Kolkata metropolis which feeds these aquaculture constantly bring in a huge carbon source both in inorganic and organic form. As soon as the flocculation effect of the lime dies off, the water column starts becoming turbid again which aids in converting the system into a net heterotrophic one from a net autotrophic.

As it significantly contributes to the total cost, municipality is most concerned on waste transportation. The paper aims to analyze the role of waste compaction facility to reduce the GHGs emission reduction. Through a sampling procedure for 8 consecutively days, total waste collected from the service area to the compaction facility was 122.35 m3 d-1 with waste density of 103.27 kg m-3. In order to transport all amount of waste to final disposal site located about 45 km from central of Bandung City, Indonesia it requires at least 8 trucks for 2 trips with waste density at truck of 200 kg m-3. Waste compaction results the increasing waste density up to 350 kg m-3. Thus, the truck required for waste transportation becomes 4 trucks. By assuming fuel efficiency of 5 km per litre of diesel and using emission factor published by DEFRA of UK (2.67 kg CO2 eq. per litre), it is found that total GHG emission reduction due to operational of waste compaction is 40% (from 720.9 into 432.54 kg CO2 eq. daily).

Although recent literature has increasingly acknowledged the differences in national positions on energy and climate issues among these states, there has been little comprehensive evidence about their positioning on EU climate and energy policies and the domestic interests which shape government preferences. The article addresses this gap by tracing the voting behavior of six CEE countries (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania) on EU energy-related legislation in the Council of Ministers between 2007-2018. The article shows that the contestation of energy policies, particularly of climate-related legislation, in the Council of Ministers has increased over time and that these six CEE countries have indeed most often objected to the adoption of EU legislation. The CEE states do not, however, have a common regional positioning on all EU energy policies. Voting coalitions among the six CEE countries differ substantially across energy policy areas. The lack of a common regional position and changing national preferences have enabled the adoption of a relatively ambitious EU Energy and Climate Package for 2030. The differences in national voting patterns are explained by the evolving interests and the ability of key domestic political and economic actors to adapt to and explore benefits from the ever-expanding EU energy and climate policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Central and Eastern Europe; Council of Ministers; Domestic interests; Energy transition; Energy Union; EU climate policy; EU energy; Illiberalism; Visegrad states",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064167917

There, today's local socio-ecological systems suffer from lack of freshwater because they cannot rely anymore on the contribution of fog captured by vegetation. This paper presents the results of an experimental reforestation project carried out in Mejia (Peru), where tree seedlings of five native and exotic species were planted in two permanent plots in 1996. Part of the seedlings were irrigated during the first three years after planting, others not. The irrigation was carried out thanks to water harvesting by large fog collectors. From the third year onwards, all trees relied only on fog water collected by their canopy. Survival rate, height, and root-collar diameter were monitored until 2010, when also the soil carbon and nitrogen stocks were measured. Fifteen years after the planting, about 65% of trees were still alive and growing, and reforestation had induced substantial carbon sequestration both above- and below-ground. Of the tree species, Acacia saligna was definitely best performing than the other, with most of the above ground carbon stored in its biomass and a consequent high efficiency as natural fog collector. Overall, the combination of fog collection by nets and the plantation of trees showing good fog collection capacity, represented a successful strategy for allowing reforestation of arid environments and induced fast and substantial carbon sequestration. Greater efforts should be thus devoted for this purpose, paying special attention to the selection of the most suitable tree species to plant, especially looking at the local biodiversity. This work is dedicated to the memory of Professor Mario Falciai, passed away in 2015, who firstly conceived the experiment and attended all the work since 1996, bringing in our University the idea of Fog Collection for sustainable water management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Advection fog; Anthropocene; Carbon sink; Desert; Reforestation; Water harvesting","Advection; Biodiversity; Carbon; Collector efficiency; Deforestation; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Runoff; Seed; Water conservation; Water management; Advection fog; Anthropocene; Carbon sink; Desert; Water harvesting; Fog; carbon; nitrogen; organic carbon; advection; Anthropocene; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; desertification; fog; harvesting; irrigation; reforestation; water management; Acacia saligna; Article; biodiversity; biomass; Caesalpinia spinosa; carbon sequestration; Casuarina equisetifolia; climate change; controlled study; desert; dryland; environmental aspects and related phenomena; exotic species; fog; irrigation (agriculture); land use; native species; nonhuman; Parkinsonia aculeata; Peru; plant growth; plant height; plant parameters; plantation; priority journal; Prosopis pallida; reforestation; root collar diameter; seedling; soil; survival rate; tree; water management; chemistry; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; metabolism; procedures; species difference; Chile; Peru; Acacia saligna; Biomass; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Peru; Soil; Species Specificity; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058011889

Morphologic characteristics of the valley networks have been interpreted to indicate the formation of these features through precipitation-derived fluvial activity and therefore as evidence for a relatively warm and wet Noachian Mars climate. However, these interpretations conflict with the results of sophisticated global climate modeling studies, which suggest that early Mars was dominated by a cold and icy climate with conditions characterized by adiabatic cooling and regional ice sheets within the highlands. Difficulties in replicating the warm and wet early climate conditions interpreted from the valley networks has served as the basis for alternative suggestions for the formation of valley networks by transient heating and snowmelt in an otherwise cold and icy climate. Here we test a conceptual model for valley network formation and incision under cold and icy conditions with a substrate characterized by the presence of an ice-free, desiccated surface regolith and subjacent ice-cemented regolith, similar to that found in the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys on Earth. We implement numerical thermal models, quantitative erosion and transport estimates, and morphometric analyses in order to outline and test predictions for: (1) the nature and structure of the cold and icy Noachian substrate, (2) valley network fluvial erosion and incision rates, and (3) resulting channel/valley morphology. Morphologic predictions are compared against observational data to determine if the valley networks characteristics are consistent with formation in a cold and icy climate. Through this approach we present and develop the underlying conceptual model, identify and generate the fundamental data inputs required to evaluate it, and perform a preliminary first-order assessment to serve as a basis for further investigation. While these analyses have been performed over a broad parameter space to address relative uncertainties, we report findings with a specific emphasis on the nominal results. We find that under cold conditions, the substrate is characterized by a kilometers-thick, globally-continuous cryosphere with a ∼ 50–100 m thick ice-free surface layer in diffusive equilibrium with the atmosphere and underlying ice-cemented regolith, the top of which forms the ice-table. Estimates of the potential infiltration capacity of the ice-free surface regolith layer indicate that surface runoff generation does not require excessively large precipitation rates, and thus does not preclude fluvial activity sourced by rainfall. Additionally, due to the predicted thicknesses of the ice-free surface regolith, any transient period of warming would need to be sustained in duration (∼ 2 kyr) to induce melting of ground ice to initiate solifluction/gelifluction activity. The predicted range of ice-table depths is exceeded by the incised depths of a majority of the valley network population, therefore suggesting interactions were possible. Evaluation of the rates of mechanical substrate erosion and thermal ice-cement erosion by valley network fluvial activity are subject to large uncertainties due to several poorly constrained parameters (i.e. the substrate erodibility factor and the valley network fluvial water temperature) but generally indicate that at low water temperatures, consistent with a cold and icy surface environment, thermal erosion of the ice-cement can be outpaced by mechanical erosion of the substrate. In this scenario, the relative efficiency of lateral erosion is predicted to be enhanced during incision below the ice-table, causing preferential channel/valley widening and increased width-to-depth ratios. Assessment of this prediction through a morphometric analysis of valley network width-to-depth ratios and occurrence of U-shaped cross sections indicates no significant correlation to ice-table depths. This result suggests that either: (1) permafrost was not present in the Noachian Mars substrate, indicating a warmer climate, (2) the permafrost ice-table did not significantly influence valley network width-to-depth ratios, possibly owing to more rapid thermal erosion rates than mechanical, or (3) additional factors not accounted for in this analysis are involved. Potential additional factors which could influence the results of this analysis include variable surface geothermal heat flux, substrate thermal conductivity, substrate composition and physical state as well as valley network preservation state, and morphometric sampling biases (due to data availability constraints). These factors represent areas for future investigation to refine assessments of valley network formation under cold early Mars conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Mars;Mars, Climate;Mars; Surface;Geological processes;Regoliths",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057049110

Damages to coastal archeological sites, loss of access to historical sites, and the alteration of cultural landscapes will force changes in the way researchers can study sites, tourists can enjoy places, and descendant communities who have lived in particular areas for time immemorial, and local community members can utilize and relate to landscapes. In the USA, the National Park Service is a primary coastal cultural resource management organization. The National Park Service has been working on climate change adaptation for cultural resources for over a decade; however, there are few examples of parks in which long range climate change adaptation plans for cultural resources have been implemented. Building from 20 semi-structured interviews with cultural resource managers in three parks, we found that institutional structures within the National Park Service, as well as historical conceptual framings specific to the research, recreational, and interpretive values of cultural resources act as barriers to managers’ ability to design and implement climate change adaptation plans. Institutional barriers managers discussed include the dependence of climate change adaptation decisions partnership projects and the leveraging of budgetary and staff resources within NPS that may affect climate change adaptation capacity. We found that park managers often saw impacts in parks that may be associated with climate change, but found it difficult to separate normal maintenance from climate change affected deterioration, which may lead to status quo management actions rather than revised planning for a changing future regime. Conceptual barriers managers discussed revealed a conflict between preservation needs of research versus interpretive uses and while NPS guidance recommends prioritization of cultural resources for preservation at the park level, regional managers were more focused on this topic than park managers. As NPS moves forward with climate change adaptation planning, opportunities to develop and improve cultural resource preservation with new technologies, improved prioritization schemes, and include public input in resource preservation may help coastal managers overcome these barriers. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; climate change adaptation; cultural heritage management; cultural resources; heritage tourism","Budget control; Deterioration; Human resource management; Managers; Climate change adaptation; Cultural heritages; Cultural resource management; Cultural resources; Heritage tourisms; Institutional barriers; Institutional structure; Semi structured interviews; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone; cultural heritage; cultural landscape; heritage tourism; park management; tourism management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063139369

Fire is recognised as a key stressor facing forest conservation efforts. Large-scale accidental fires are increasingly prevalent across the forested tropics, generating negative impacts across sectors and scales. Policy responses to mega-fires in the Brazilian Amazon have been diverse but all are dominated by an anti-fire narrative that highlights long-stigmatised smallholder agricultural practices. Despite forest conservation initiatives and fire management policies, escaped fire (wildfire) remains pervasive. Forest conservation initiatives are often situated in contexts where swidden agriculture prevails, generating a need for an improved understanding of the interplay between fire management and conservation initiatives on the ground. We explore these dynamics through a case study approach in three leading forest conservation initiative types, situated across diverse contexts in the Brazilian Amazon: a Reduction of Emissions of Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) site (in Middle Solimões region), an extractive reserve (RESEX) (in Arapíuns region), and a Green Municipality Pact (GMP) (in Paragominas). Between sites, climate and colonisation histories vary, yet all demonstrate that farmers experience the burden of escaped fire, attesting to the failure of fire management policies and suggesting that fire (as currently managed) threatens forest conservation goals. Restrictive fire management policies do not replace the necessity of fire-based agriculture and rather serve to disempower swidden farmers by making burning increasingly illicit. We show that awareness of fire-free alternatives exists, yet experience is limited and constraints are considerable. We argue that marginalising fire use in the context of forest conservation initiatives contributes to a legacy of failed interventions and jeopardises partnerships between communities and conservation practitioners. Finally, we suggest that given the absence of imminent and viable fire-free alternatives, particularly in sites where swidden and conservation collide, a new model of fire warrants experimentation.

This study aims at identifying the driving forces of national and regional carbon intensity changes in China at multiple levels by a newly extended multiplicative structural decomposition analysis. Attribution analysis is further adopted to identify sectors with large intensity-reduction potential. National and regional carbon intensity changes during 2007–2012 are decomposed into three determinants: intensity (or efficiency) effect, input structure effect and final demand effect. Temporal decomposition results suggest that 29.0% decline of national carbon intensity is mainly due to intensity effect, while input structure and final demand effect drive the increment of national carbon intensity. Eight regions are divided into two groups: carbon intensity in Northwest, South Coast and Northeast increased due to input structure and final demand effect; carbon intensity in other regions decreased due to intensity effect and final demand effect. Investment and export are the dominant final demand categories to carbon intensity decline in most regions. Spatial decomposition results reveal the huge contribution discrepancy of driving forces among 30 provinces, and 30 provinces are accordingly classified into four groups. For most regions, simultaneously optimizing input structure and final demand are preferred in sectors with large intensity-reduction potential like Mining, Manufacture, Metals and metal productions and Production and supply of electricity, gas and water. Targeted intensity-reduction strategies at multiple levels are suggested. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attribution analysis; Carbon intensity; China; Driving forces; Multiplicative structural decomposition analysis","Carbon; Manufacture; Metal analysis; Attribution analysis; Carbon intensity; China; Driving forces; Structural decomposition analysis; Structural analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060018161

However, few studies have investigated the multiseasonal characteristics of indoor PM2.5 and its chemical composition in China. In this study, the chemical composition of PM2.5 samples in residences was analyzed over four seasons in Nanjing, China. Indoor water-soluble ions exhibited similar seasonal variations (winter &gt; autumn &gt; summer &gt; spring) to those from outdoors (winter &gt; autumn &gt; spring &gt; summer) except in summer. Whereas, indoor metallic elements exhibited a different seasonal pattern from that of outdoors. The highest concentrations of indoor metallic elements were observed in summer when the outdoor concentrations were low. The different seasonal variations of the chemical composition between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 indicated that people should consider both indoor and outdoor sources to reduce their exposure to air pollutants in different seasons. The carcinogenic risks for metallic elements were within the acceptable levels, while manganese (Mn) was found to have potential noncarcinogenic risk to humans. More attention should be paid to the pollution of Mn in the study area in the future.

The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phenology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 ± 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 ± 2.38 Mg ha −1 , and the soil C stock at 0–20 cm depth was 14.68 ± 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 ± 8.98 Mg ha −1 . This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables. © 2018","Google Earth Engine; Machine learning; National Forest Inventory; NDVI","Carbon; Climate change; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Magnesium; Remote sensing; Soils; Spatial distribution; Stabilization; Climate change mitigation; Environmental variables; Google earths; Modeling and predictions; National forest inventories; NDVI; Permanent sample plots; Vegetation phenology; Soil surveys; carbon; carbon sequestration; forest inventory; Internet; Landsat; litter; machine learning; NDVI; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil carbon; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; Article; density; environmental parameters; forest; geographic and geological parameters; litter carbon stock; model; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; prediction; priority journal; remote sensing; soil carbon stock; soil moisture; spatial modeling; United States; vegetation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056446361

Precipitation is the main water source for drinking water and agricultural production. For this reason, a better understanding of precipitation variability and its relation with climate phenomena can provide important information for forecasting of droughts and floods, disaster risk reduction, and improvement of water management. We present results of an analysis of the austral summer precipitation variability at six locations in the Bolivian Altiplano and connections to climate variability. For this purpose, the variability of the summer precipitation was related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Antarctic Meridional Mode (AMM), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). A statistically significant correlation between climate indices and precipitation was found in various spectral frequencies and power. The variability of the summer precipitation was associated with the climate indices using a band-pass filter, representing the signal at a particular period of time. For the ENSO, band-pass filtering was applied for Niño3.4 and Niño3 at band ~2–7 years, for NAO band ~5–8 years, and for AMM band ~10–13 years. The variability of summer precipitation was related to all studied climate modes by negative relationships. The physical explanation for this is first the dry air transported from the Pacific Ocean to the Altiplano during El Niño events. Second, NAO and ENSO are dynamically linked through teleconnections. Third, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) shifts are northwards during the warm phases of AMM. These physical mechanisms lead to a reduced austral summer precipitation associated with positive phases of the ENSO, NAO, and AMM. The results can be used to better forecast precipitation in the Bolivian Altiplano and provide support for the development of policies to improve climate resilience and risk management of water supply. © 2018 The Authors.

It carries a high amount of nutrients and suspended particulate matter, both organic and inorganic, to the adjacent shelf waters and is considered among the most turbid estuarine systems in the world. Knowledge of the concentration and spatial and temporal variability of these materials is critical for any biological study in the Río de la Plata. In this work, the relationship between suspended particulate matter and turbidity is empirically established in order to derive suspended particulate matter maps from satellite data (MODIS-Aqua) for the Río de la Plata region. A strong correlation between suspended particulate matter and turbidity was found (Pearson correlation coefficient =0.91) and the linear regression (slope =0.76 and intercepts =12.78, R 2 =0.83) explained 83% of the variance. The validation of the empirical algorithm, using co-located and coincident satellite and in situ measurements, showed good results with a low mean absolute error (14.60%) and a small and positive bias (3.04%), indicating that the estimated suspended particulate matter values tend to slightly overestimate the field values. © 2019 CSIC.","Empirical algorithm; In situ measurements; MODIS-Aqua satellite image; Río de la plata; Suspended particulate matter","algorithm; Aqua (satellite); concentration (composition); estuarine environment; in situ measurement; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; suspended sediment; turbidity; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Rio de la Plata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064110821

Yet, the growing literature on the topic has been largely descriptive and little attention has been placed on how to transform barriers into enablers for action. By taking a fragile socio-ecological lagoon system in Southern Mexico as a case study, the paper applies a social network analytical approach to: i) reveal the actual web of connections tying stakeholders through local governance arrangements; ii) identify shortcomings in multi-actor collaboration networks; and iii) propose ways to tackle them so that the full potential of adaptation can be exploited. The paper employs a mixed-method approach combining both a quantitative and qualitative Social Network Analysis (SNA). The quantitative SNA is used to assess the quality and strength of relationships among formal public organisations working on climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction in the site. The qualitative SNA is employed to both assess linking ties between formal organizations and local coastal communities potentially targeted with adaptation interventions, and bonding ties connecting community members. The approach proves to be useful to map the relational architecture of the system of interest and to reveal network characteristics that are important for collective action including: network fragmentation in subgroups; density of relations; centralization around a few actors. The actual topology of the network, as revealed, can then be compared with what is required for achieving societally desired adaptation outcomes and for identifying agents that can promote change. The paper acknowledges that a social analytical approach might be limited in unveiling the interests and motives behind actors’ participation in the network, and that the latter ultimately determine actors’ contribution in defining and enacting a joint solution for a common problem. However, the mixed-methods approach presented in this paper allows for gaining first insights on the way a mismatch between formal and informal institutions might drive socio-ecological systems towards inadequate adaptation outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation barriers; Collaborative governance; Institutions; Social network analysis","article; attention; centralization; climate change; controlled study; disaster; ecosystem; human; joint; lagoon; Mexico; quantitative analysis; risk reduction; social network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059590348

Consequently, testing a modeling system's ability to predict changes in ozone resulting from emission changes is critical. We evaluate model simulations for precursor species (NOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds [VOCs]), radicals (OH and HO2), a secondary pollutant (O3), and the model response of these compounds to weekend/weekday emission changes during California Nexus study in 2010. The modeling system correctly simulated the broad spatial and temporal variation of NOx and O3 in California South Coast. Although the model generally underpredicted the daytime mixing ratios of NO2 at the surface and overpredicted the NO2 column, the simulated weekend to weekday ratios are consistent with each other and match the observed ratios well. The modeling system exhibited reasonable performance in simulating the VOC compounds with fossil fuel origins but has larger bias in simulating certain species associated with noncombustion sources. The modeling system successfully captured the weekend changes of the enhancement ratios for various VOC species to CO and the relative changes of HOx, which are indicators of faster chemical processing on weekends. This work demonstrates satisfactory model performances for O3 and most relevant chemical compounds with more robust performance in simulating weekend versus weekday changes. Improved planetary boundary layer height simulations, a better understanding of OH-HO2 cycling, continued improvement of emissions, especially urban biogenic emissions and emissions of oxygenated VOCs, are important for future model improvement. ©2019.

In the 21st century, the world faces the novel challenge of drastically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases while simultaneously expanding energy access and economic opportunity to billions of people. We examine this challenge in the electricity sector, which has been widely identified as an early candidate for deep decarbonization. In most regions, serving the projected electricity demand in 2050 while simultaneously reducing emissions will require a mix of electrical generation assets different from the current system. Although a variety of low- or zero-carbon technologies can be employed, our analysis demonstrates the potential contribution nuclear can make as a dispatchable low-carbon technology. The least-cost portfolios in our analysis include an important share for nuclear, the magnitude of which grows significantly as its cost drops. Therefore, there are strong incentives for industry to reduce the cost of new nuclear plants, and here we identify promising approaches for achieving such cost reductions.

Herein, we develop a predictive framework to tune the selectivity of CO2 reduction on Cu by examining a series of polymeric and molecular modifiers. We find that protic species enhance selectivity for H2, hydrophilic species enhance formic acid formation, and cationic hydrophobic species enhance CO selectivity. ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the hydrophilic/hydrophobic modifiers influence the formation of surface hydrides, which yield formic acid or H2.

Carbonate composition varies from primarily sodium at the Cerealia and Vinalia Faculae and at Oxo crater, where carbonate deposits are most abundant, to magnesium and calcium for most other bright regions. The formation of hydrated salts is expected from the aqueous alteration of silicates; however, VIR measurements of the faculae show no water signature, potentially the result of dehydration after exposure to Ceres’ surface conditions. We investigate the stability and decomposition pathway for hydrated sodium-carbonate, natron (Na2CO3.10H2O), grains in the laboratory under Ceres’ cryogenic, low-pressure environment by UV–vis–NIR reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. H2O-loss begins simultaneously with vacuum-exposure, altering natron's spectral signature by attenuation of the water bands, enhancement of the carbonate features, and concurrent reduction of the NIR blue spectral slope. We find that the water absorption features in natron reduce below VIR's detection limit (&lt; 2%) within a time scale of &lt; 6 days at temperatures ≥ 200 K, eliminating hydrous sodium carbonate from Ceres’ surface mineralogy in the equatorial region and the mid-latitudes without continuous rehydration. A temperature-dependent systematic shift of the 1.9-µm band center to lower wavelengths is observed with vacumm-exposure time at 200 and 240 K. In Ceres’ polar-regions (∼120 K), natron retains water longer, depleting the 1.9-µm water band to &lt; 2% within a few hundred years (∼300 years). No significant changes in the visible relative reflectance or spectral slope result from vacuum-exposure of hydrous or anhydrous sodium carbonate, which does not match the observed red-slope in the Framing Camera (FC) measurements for Occator Crater's faculae. In the UV, extended exposure to vacuum in all sodium carbonates examined here causes significant reddening due to an increase in short-range crystallographic defects and reduction of the conduction band energy; in addition, the development of new UV electronic transition features at ∼ 275 and 235 nm is observed in hydrous and anhydrous sodium-carbonates with vacuum-processing.

The metalliferous deposit represents a stratiform body lying conformably in the Upper Devonian carbonaceous siliceous and clayey–carbonate–siliceous shales. The ore bed occurs 180 m below the regional Famennian manganiferous rock association in Pai-Khoi. Discovery of the Nadeiyakha ore occurrence suggests the existence of an additional age interval of Mn accumulation within the Devonian sequence of this region. The studied metalliferous rocks display structures and textures typical of the metasedimentary rocks. In terms of composition, they are divided into two varieties: (i) ferromanganese (quartz–carbonate) rocks composed of quartz, dolomite, kutnahorite, rhodochrosite, siderite, and calcite; (ii) manganiferous (quartz–rhodochrosite–silicate) rocks composed of quartz, rhodochrosite, tephroite, sonolite, and pyroxmangite. The Nadeiyakha ore occurrence is marked by the abundance of dolomite in the ferromanganese rocks and host shales. In terms of the relationship of indicator elements (Al, Ti, Fe, and Mn), ferromanganese and manganese rocks are comparable with the recent metalliferous and ore-bearing sediments. The carbon isotope composition in carbonates (δ 13 C from –16.4 to –7.8‰ PDB) corresponds to authigenic carbonates related to the involvement of carbon dioxide produced during the microbial decomposition of organic matter at the stage of dia- and/or catagenesis. Geological and petrographic observations show that the ferruginous and manganiferous sediments were deposited synchronously with the terrigenous–carbonate–siliceous sediments. Fe and Mn could be sourced from hydrothermal solutions or interstitial diagenetic waters. The latter version seems to be more probable. Metals were accumulated in a depression-trap characterized by a periodic stagnation of bottom waters. Such sedimentation setting promoted the formation of paragenetic association of ferruginous and manganiferous sediments with the carbonaceous sediments and fostered reductive conditions during the postsedimentary mineral formation. Calcium carbonates contained in the primary rocks were subjected to dolomitization during the dia- or catagenesis. This process was promoted by the mobilization of Mg released during the transformation of clay minerals owing to the montmorillonite–illite transition. Iron and manganese carbonates were formed during the later replacement of oxides of Mn 3+ , Mn 4+ , and Fe 3+ . Crystallization of manganese silicates also started at early stages of lithogenesis and terminated during the regional metamorphism of metalliferous rocks. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065744928

These changes directly affect the global carbon cycle by altering the transport of organic material from the surface ocean to depth, with consequences that remain poorly understood. We investigated how distributional and abundance changes of copepods, the dominant group of zooplankton, have affected biogenic carbon cycling. We used trait-based, mechanistic models to estimate the magnitude of carbon transported downward through sinking faecal pellets, daily vertical migration and seasonal hibernation at depth. From such estimates for over 200,000 community observations in the northern North Atlantic we found carbon flux increased along the northwestern boundary of the study area and decreased in the open northern North Atlantic during the past 55 years. These changes in export were primarily associated with changes in copepod biomass, driven by shifting distributions of abundant, large-bodied species. Our findings highlight how recent climate change has affected downward carbon transport by altering copepod community structure and demonstrate how carbon fluxes through plankton communities can be mechanistically implemented in next-generation biogeochemical models with size-structured representations of zooplankton communities. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"animal; Atlantic Ocean; biological model; biomass; carbon cycle; climate change; copepod; metabolism; zooplankton; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Biomass; Carbon Cycle; Climate Change; Copepoda; Models, Biological; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061491619

We compare the natural and anthropogenic contributions to haze in the western United States in 2011 estimated using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended method and using model projections from the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) and the Particulate Source Apportionment Tool (PSAT). We do so because these two methods will be used by states to demonstrate visibility progress by 2028. If the two methods assume different natural and anthropogenic contributions, the projected benefits of reducing U.S. anthropogenic emissions will differ. The EPA method assumes that episodic elevated carbonaceous aerosols greater than an annual 95th percentile threshold are natural events. For western U.S. IMPROVE monitoring sites reviewed in this paper, CAMx-PSAT confirms these episodes are impacted by carbon from wildfire or prescribed fire events. The EPA method assumes that most of the ammonium sulfate is anthropogenic in origin. At most western sites CAMx-PSAT apportions more of the ammonium sulfate on the most impaired days to global boundary conditions and anthropogenic Canadian, Mexican, and offshore shipping emissions than to U.S. anthropogenic sources. For ammonium nitrate and coarse mass, CAMx-PSAT apportions greater contributions to U.S. anthropogenic sources than the EPA method assigns to total anthropogenic contributions. We conclude that for western IMPROVE sites, the EPA method is effective in selecting days that are likely to be impacted by anthropogenic emissions and that CAMx-PSAT is an effective approach to estimate U.S. source contributions. Improved inventories, particularly international and natural emissions, and further evaluation of global and regional model performance and PSAT attribution methods are recommended to increase confidence in modeled source characterization. Implications: The western states intend to use the CAMx model to project visibility progress by 2028. Modeled visibility response to changes in U.S. anthropogenic emissions may be less than estimated using the EPA assumptions based on total U.S. and international anthropogenic contributions to visibility impairment. Additional model improvements are needed to better account for contributions to haze from natural and international emissions in current and future modeling years.

Exotic herb Hieracium pilosella (hawkweed, Asteraceae) recently invaded steppes of Tierra del Fuego island, Southern Patagonia, Argentina, where plant communities exhibit different vulnerabilities to invasion. To investigate H. pilosella invasion’s effects on litter decomposition, we conducted a field experiment in two plant communities, a tussock grassland and a grazing lawn, having contrasting environmental conditions and different vulnerabilities of being invaded by H. pilosella. At each community, we decomposed litter of dominant native species and of the exotic herb during 24 months. In addition, we characterized the litter qualities of the different species, and the microclimates of the communities. Exotic litter decomposition was remarkably faster and showed a higher association to microenvironmental variability compared to native litter decomposition. H. pilosella decomposed three-times faster than native litter in the moister, and more susceptible to invasion by H. pilosella plant community, the tussock grassland. By contrast, decomposition of native litter was not associated to the contrasting environmental conditions of the studied communities. Results suggest that introduced species may exhibit different ecosystem process rates and controls compared to resident species, affecting ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycles. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon cycle; Ecosystem process; Grasslands; Litter decomposition; Plant invasions","biological invasion; carbon cycle; decomposition; environmental conditions; herb; introduced species; invasive species; litter; microhabitat; native species; plant community; steppe; tussock grassland; Argentina; Patagonia; Tierra del Fuego [(PRV) Argentina]; Asteraceae; Hieracium; Hieracium pilosella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062794619

Reducing the country's emissions requires policies and initiatives that reduce emissions in the province. Yet the study of provincial climate change policy in Canada has largely focused on lower-emitting provinces like British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario. This article argues that Alberta is best understood as a reluctant actor on climate change, whose policies are influenced by decisions and pressures from outside its borders. The literature on Canadian-American environmental policy making and international policy transfer are used to explore provincial GHG targets and carbon pricing policies. The article finds that Alberta's 2002 targets and Specified Gas Emitters Regulation were determined by economic competitiveness and leakage concerns, while the adoption of new GHG targets in 2008 and a carbon tax was the result of policy transfer through political bandwagoning and the desire for reputational benefits. © 2018 Canadian Political Science Association (l'Association canadienne de science politique) and/et la Société québécoise de science politique.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055002090

Yet the GCF faces challenges of operationalization not only as a relatively new international fund but also as a result of US President Trump’s announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Consequently the GCF faces a major reduction in actual funding contributions and also governance challenges at the levels of its Board and the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP), to which it is ultimately accountable. This article analyzes these challenges with reference to the GCF’s internal regulations and its agreements with third parties to demonstrate how exploiting design features of the GCF could strengthen its resilience in the face of such challenges. These features include linkages with UNFCCC constituted bodies, particularly the Technology Mechanism, and enhanced engagement with non-Party stakeholders, especially through its Private Sector Facility. The article posits that deepening GCF interlinkages would increase both the coherence of climate finance governance and the GCF’s ability to contribute to ambitious climate action in uncertain times. Key policy insights The Trump Administration’s purported withdrawal from the Paris Agreement creates challenges for the GCF operating model in three key domains: capitalization, governance and guidance. Two emerging innovations could prove crucial in GCF resilience to fulfil its role in Paris Agreement implementation: (1) interlinkages with other UNFCCC bodies, especially the Technology Mechanism; and (2) engagement with non-Party stakeholders, especially private sector actors such as large US investors and financiers. There is also an emerging soft role for the GCF as interlocutor between policy-makers and non-Party actors to help bridge the communication divide that often plagues cross-sectoral interactions. This role could develop through: (a) the GCF tripartite interface between the Private Sector Facility, Accredited Entities and National Designated Authorities; and (b) strengthened collaborations between the UNFCCC Technical and Financial Mechanisms. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change law; climate finance; climate governance; Green Climate Fund; Paris agreement; private sector","climate change; environmental policy; finance; governance approach; private sector; public administration; regulatory approach; stakeholder; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053733833

Employing a computer-assisted content analysis of over 2886 mayoral press releases related to climate change from 82 major American cities for the period 2010-2016, we describe and explain the extent to which city governments discuss mitigation and adaptation policies in official communications. Specifically, we rely on a semi-supervised topic model to measure key climate policy themes in city press releases and examine their correlates using a multilevel statistical model. Our results suggest that while mitigation policies tend to dominate the city agenda on climate policy, discussion of adaptation efforts has risen dramatically in the past few years. Further, our statistical analysis indicates that partisanship influences city discussion on a range of climate policy areas-including emissions, land use policy, and climate resiliency-while projected vulnerability to climatic risks only influences discussion of climate resiliency and adaptation efforts. © 2019 by the authors.","Agenda-setting; Climate change policy; Political communication; Semi-supervised topic model; Text analysis; Urban politics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063793993

Electric vehicles (EV) become an option for internal combustion engine (IC) based on public transportation. Use of EV can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels by the internal combustion engines and can reduce air pollution as well. This paper proposes a direction of development of fast charging station for public transportation in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. The feasibility study of the fast charging station comparing with conventional type is presented in this paper. The obstacles of fast charging stations in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, the direction of development, are discussed in this paper. This paper also presents the type of EV charging, both conductive charging, and inductive charging. It also includes the DC fast charging station infrastructure. Finally, the fast charging station installation for each location is also discussed. The results show that the fast charging systems are suitable for urban installation due to the need for quick charging. The electrical power system in the area where the station installed is an essential part of the power supply, which must be capable of supporting the high-power demand of charging station and does not affect the electricity consumption of the area. It is necessary to consider that the power supply connected to a charging station requires a significant amount of electrical energy for charging. The EV charging affects voltage drop and power loss in a power distribution system, as a result, the quality of power and the stability of the power system is reduced. © 2019 GMSARN International Journal.","Electric public transportation; Electric vehicle; Fast charging station; Public charging stations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065019008

However, species distribution modelling has yet to incorporate perspectives that assess threats to the linked biological and cultural systems of local and Indigenous Peoples. Here, we provide the first example of integrating species distribution modelling with benefit-relevant indicators. This novel approach assesses how human access to culturally important species may change over time. Focusing on two culturally significant species used by the Indigenous Māori people of New Zealand, we first identified predictor variables relevant to the habitat of each species. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the recent (1961–1990) potential distribution for each species based on occurrence records and predictor variables, then generated future climate suitability maps. Our models show that future suitability for one species shifts to the south, in line with changes in temperature and precipitation, while the second species range expands into higher latitudes, driven primarily by increased temperature. When we combined these models with knowledge of tribal boundaries and cultural practices, results indicated that these distributions might decrease access to culturally important plants. Future suitability for one species shifted substantially from where it is most valued for weaving, while the second species range expanded to include more of its primary medicinal users. Climate change-mediated shifts in the ranges of these species are likely to affect intergenerational human–environment relationships, sense of place, cultural identity and knowledge on a regional scale, as well as cultural identity and social cohesion on a national scale. By interpreting SDMs within a socioecological framework, this research illustrates a new approach to assessment of vulnerabilities to climate change and identifies strategies for adaptation.

Climatic changes drive increased export of terrestrial OC into many aquatic networks, yet the role that circumpolar lakes play in mineralizing this carbon is unclear. Here we directly evaluate ecosystem-scale OC cycling for lakes of interior Alaska. This arid, low-relief lake landscape is representative of over a quarter of total northern circumpolar lake area, but is greatly under-represented in current studies. Contrary to projections based on work in other regions, the studied lakes had a negligible role in mineralizing terrestrial carbon; they received little OC from ancient permafrost soils, and had small net contribution to the watershed carbon balance. Instead, most lakes recycled large quantities of internally derived carbon fixed from atmospheric CO2, underscoring their importance as critical sites for material and energy provision to regional food webs. Our findings deviate from the prevailing paradigm that northern lakes are hotspots of terrestrial OC processing. The shallow and hydrologically disconnected nature of lakes in many arid circumpolar landscapes isolates them from terrestrial carbon processing under current climatic conditions. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"air-soil interaction; arid region; carbon cycle; climate conditions; organic carbon; permafrost; terrestrial environment; watershed; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061384332

To address this knowledge gap, we performed two complementary experiments to determine (1) whether ectomycorrhizal plants can discriminate among potential fungal partners, and (2) to what extent the plants might reward better mutualists. In experiment 1, split-root Larix occidentalis seedlings were inoculated with spores from three Suillus species (S. clintonianus, S. grisellus, and S. spectabilis). In experiment 2, we manipulated the symbiotic quality of Suillus brevipes isolates on split-root Pinus muricata seedlings by changing the nitrogen resources available, and used carbon-13 labeling to track host investment in fungi. In experiment 1, we found that hosts can discriminate in multi-species settings. The split-root seedlings inhibited colonization by S. spectabilis whenever another fungus was available, despite similar benefits from all three fungi. In experiment 2, we found that roots and fungi with greater nitrogen supplies received more plant carbon. Our results suggest that plants may be able to regulate this symbiosis at a relatively fine scale, and that this regulation can be integrated across spatially separated portions of a root system. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ectomycorrhiza; Larix occidentalis; Partner choice; Pinus muricata; Stable isotope enrichment; Suillus","coniferous tree; ectomycorrhiza; host preference; mutualism; root architecture; root colonization; seedling; spore; stable isotope; substrate preference; trade-off; Fungi; Larix occidentalis; Pinus muricata; Suillus; Suillus brevipes; Suillus grisellus; Suillus spectabilis; Larix; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; pine; seedling; symbiosis; Larix; Mycorrhizae; Pinus; Seedlings; Soil Microbiology; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059685703

In this sector, indicators have been centered on the impacts of climate on production systems, crops, yields, infrastructure, financial performance, farmers’ livelihoods and food security. This paper focuses on designing an indicator set to capture the resilience of agriculture to inform decision-making frameworks and policies. The indicators’ selection and definition were driven by their relevance for decision-making through the combined knowledge of policy and information priorities on climate change impacts and vulnerabilities as well as pragmatic issues relating to data availability. In total, 36 indicators were selected covering the following areas: regional drivers of the change to the agricultural sector (demographics, agricultural markets, climate); farmland production activities (food and feed); non-farm economy; and primary outcomes (off-farm net income, numerous environmental services). By coordinating this process among policy-makers with different roles in regional planning, we were able to identify shared information needs among the various sectoral representatives. The indicator selection process also captured policy gaps potential responses that could increase resilience and feed directly into policy reviews, thereby strengthening integration of actions across sectors. This indicator set emphasizes that the relationships between government agencies and both industry and academia may be improved by addressing gaps in data availability, accessibility, and privacy constraints. © 2018","Adaptation to climate change; Agriculture; Canada; Farm management; Indicators; Ontario; Resilience; System mapping; Vulnerability","adaptive management; agricultural production; climate change; decision making; policy making; regional planning; vulnerability; Canada; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059057654

Thanks to its long geometry, the absorption cross section and linestrength of the laser transition could be directly measured, allowing easier estimation of the emission cross section than with usual methods relying on fluorescence decay time and quantum efficiency measurements, or a Judd–Ofelt analysis. Our measurements are corroborated by McCumber’s reciprocity principle. The small-signal gain spectrum measured in an amplifier experiment matches well with the emission cross section. Order-of-magnitude loss reduction is demonstrated by lowering the temperature to −34°C, implying substantial reduction of the laser oscillation threshold in cold solar-pumping environments. © 2019 Optical Society of America.",,"Lasers; Neodymium; Optical fibers; Pumping (laser); Absorption cross sections; Emission cross section; Fluorescence decay time; Neodymium doped fibers; Quantum Efficiency measurements; Reciprocity principle; Solar-pumped lasers; Substantial reduction; Optically pumped lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062462004

The nucleation rate can have a strong impact on microphysical processes, optical properties, lifetime, and, therefore, on the climate impact of contrail cirrus. We study contrail ice crystal formation offline for specified atmospheric conditions and its spatial variability in a global climate model. Assuming the standard atmosphere, above around 270 hPa (10 km) contrail ice nucleation is mainly controlled by aircraft soot number emissions and below additionally by atmospheric temperature. Parameterizing contrail ice nucleation in a global climate model, we find that in the northern extratropics contrails form frequently far away from their formation threshold. For current soot number emissions and in case of contrail formation, 90% of emitted soot particles form on average ice crystals around the cruise level and more than 70% between cruise altitudes and 300 hPa. The number of nucleated ice crystals in the extratropics decreases nearly at the same rate as soot number emissions. In contrast, in the tropics around cruise altitudes approximately 60% of contrails develop close to their formation threshold so that on average only about 50% of emitted soot particles can form ice crystals. Below, contrail formation occurs rarely and ice nucleation is reduced more strongly. Of the main air traffic areas, contrail ice nucleation is significantly limited by the atmospheric state over eastern Asia and over the southeastern United States.

However, the deployment of wireless charging lanes on highways and urban road networks can be costly and resource-intensive. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to compare the sustainability performance of DWPT applied in a network of highways and urban roads for charging electric passenger cars. The assessment compares DWPT to stationary wireless charging and to conventional plug-in charging using a case study of Washtenaw County in Michigan, USA over 20 years. The LCA is based on three key sustainability metrics: costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and energy burdens, encompassing not only the use-phase burdens from electricity and fuel, but also the upfront deployment burdens of DWPT infrastructure. A genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the rollout of DWPT infrastructure both spatially and temporally in order to minimize life cycle costs, GHG, and energy burdens: (1) spatial optimization selects road segments to deploy DWPT considering traffic volume, speed, and pavement remaining service life (RSL); (2) temporal optimization determines in which year to deploy DWPT on a particular road segment considering EV market share growth as a function of DWPT coverage rate, future DWPT cost reduction, and charging efficiency improvement. Results indicate that optimal deployment of DWPT electrifying up to about 3% of total roadway lane-miles reduces life cycle GHG emissions and energy by up to 9.0% and 6.8%, respectively, and enables downsizing of the EV battery capacity by up to 48%, compared to the non-DWPT scenarios. Roadside solar panels and storage batteries are essential to significantly reduce life cycle energy and GHG burdens but bring additional costs. Breakeven analysis indicates a breakeven year for solar charging benefits to pay back the DWPT infrastructure burdens can be less than 20 years for GHG and energy burdens but longer than 20 years for costs. A monetization of carbon emissions of at least $250 per metric tonne of CO2 is required to shift the optimal “pro-cost” deployment to the optimal “pro-GHG” deployment. A roadway segment with volume greater than about 26,000 vehicle counts per day, speed slower than 55 miles per hour (1 mile ≈ 1.609 km), and pavement RSL shorter than 3 years should be given a high priority for early-stage DWPT deployment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Deployment plan; Dynamic wireless power transfer; Electric vehicle; Life cycle assessment; Optimization; Wireless charging","Artificial life; Commerce; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric automobiles; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric vehicles; Energy transfer; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Inductive power transmission; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Optimization; Pavements; Secondary batteries; Service life; Sustainable development; Vehicle performance; Charging efficiency; Deployment plans; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; Spatial optimization; Sustainability metrics; Sustainability performance; Wireless charging; electric vehicle; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; optimization; performance assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; urban transport; Michigan; United States; Washtenaw County",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060076859

Brazilian bovine livestock is also responsible for emissions from land-use changes. In contrast, enteric emissions from extensive cattle systems in wetlands might have been overestimated. We provide scientific evidences that the human footprint of bovine products delivered by the Pantanal can be much lower. To assess this, a historical cloud-free imagery of the Landsat-5, spanning 26 years, were processed for mapping spatiotemporal landscapes in a Pantanal farm under cattle intensification studies. Eight landscape categories were identified according to spatiotemporal dynamics of interannual floods. The spatiotemporal map allowed in the field the adoption of stratified random samplings of chamber gas fluxes. The combination of stratified sampled landscapes with Monte Carlo simulations of measured methane emissions in wet and dry soils permitted to integrate landscapes emissions at annual basis with biased uncertainties. Assuming enteric emissions obtained for the Pantanal region, our results suggest that the landscapes methane emissions are 10- to 23-fold superior than the enteric emissions of traditional bovine systems. While enteric emissions seem negligible with respect to net farmland emissions, cattle livestock provide important environmental services like carbon recycling through non-competing herbivory. Moreover, cattle might be making use of a biomass that would undergo decomposition during the flooding phase. Our analysis thus indicate that enteric emissions from traditional bovine systems in flooding farmlands could be considered neutral. By contrast, intensification to improve the stocking rate should be accounted as net anthropogenic emissions. A case study of intensification allowed an increase of 48% in the stocking rate, which is associated with net anthropogenic emissions from 534 bovine animals or about 27 to 63 Mg of enteric CH4 per year. In short, the competition between traditional and distinct levels of cattle intensification will result from a trade-off between public policies and strategic market niches (organic, sustainable) for the optimal landscape management of the Pantanal. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Beef; Cattle; Flood pulse; Landscape ecology; Sparing/sharing lands; Wetlands","Beef; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Farms; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Land use; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Wetlands; Anthropogenic emissions; Cattle; Enteric methane emissions; Environmental services; Flood pulse; Landscape ecology; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Stratified random sampling; Mammals; carbon; methane; methane; cattle; landscape ecology; landscape planning; livestock farming; methane; spatiotemporal analysis; wetland; agricultural land; air pollution; animal husbandry; Article; beef; biomass; bovine; Brazil; cloud; DNA footprinting; flooding; geography; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; herbivory; landscape; lifespan; livestock; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; priority journal; public policy; random sample; recycling; spatiotemporal analysis; analysis; animal; animal husbandry; environmental protection; geographic information system; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; procedures; trends; wetland; Animalia; Bos; Bovinae; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Brazil; Cattle; Conservation of Natural Resources; Geographic Information Systems; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Multivariate Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056891009

A way to limit the traffic noise is to reduce the noise emission, for example, by using specific low noise pavements, particularly in suburban areas. However, in real situations, it can be difficult to evaluate the impact of a given pavement, because it depends, for example, on the road geometry, the meteorological conditions, or the distance of the receiver position. Finally it can be difficult to select the most appropriate pavement for a given noise reduction objective. In this paper, a simple method is proposed to evaluate the noise impact of a pavement, in typical road geometries and environmental conditions. The proposed approach uses two databases, the first one based on measurements of emission spectra of road vehicles on several typical pavements, the second one made of pre-calculations of noise propagation for typical road configurations. Finally, the method is implemented in an interactive web tool, called DEUFRABASE, which allows one to obtain a fast estimation of the LAeq (1 h or 24 h) and Lden noise levels for various pavements and road configurations, as functions of the traffic flow and composition. By comparing the method with measurements, it is showed that the tool, although based on a restricted number of pavements and on several simplifications, can predict the noise impact of typical road configurations, with an acceptable error, most often less than 2 dB. © 2019 by the authors.

Understanding the factors that influence indoor air quality in schools is critical for the assessment and control of indoor air pollution. This study analysed the concentration and sources of air pollution at an urban primary school (5–11 years) in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand. Over a three-week period during spring, indoor measures of particulate matter (PM 2.5 , PM 10 ), temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) were taken and hourly air particulate matter samples (PM 2.5 , PM 10-2.5 ) were collected inside and outside for elemental speciation analysis. Indoor PM 10 concentrations during the school day were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher than outdoor concentrations 30.1 (range 10.0–75.0, SD 1.9) μg m −3 c.f. 8.9 (range &lt;1.0–35.0, SD 6.8) μg m −3 . Elemental analysis and receptor modelling of PM samples showed that indoor PM 10 was primarily composed of crustal matter (soil) elements, possibly brought in on children's footwear. The primary driver of indoor PM 2.5 was from the infiltration of outdoor pollutants inside, with by-products of motor vehicle emissions the main contributor to indoor PM 2.5 . There is a need for mitigation strategies to reduce exposure to indoor air pollution at school, such as improved cleaning methods, reducing the use of carpet in schools and improved ventilation. The findings from this study will be applicable to many other schools and public buildings with high foot traffic. © 2019","Air pollution; Air quality; Children; Schools; Source apportionment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061626215

The ensemble simulation is based on the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology climate model, ECHAM6, where all members have been exposed to the identically same radiative forcing. The range of global mean surface temperature warming over the 1850–2005 period, based on all members, is 0.65–1.10 °C. The distribution of the global mean surface temperature about the ensemble mean has a standard deviation (StD) of ~ 0.14 °C which slowly decreases in time. Regionally, the largest decrease in the ensemble StD occurs in the Northern Hemisphere winter. Comparing the temporal StD with that from the observed HadCRUT4 surface temperature data indicates that the majority of the ensemble members have a larger temporal StD than the observations suggesting that the model simulations might overestimate the variance. There are clear random 20-year linear trends in global mean surface temperature anomalies as well as significant regional 50-year linear trends. Even with an ensemble mean warming trend, typical of the early twenty-first century, a global hiatus in temperature of 20 years duration is possible to occur by chance. The results support the view that observed decadal and multi-decadal anomalies in the twentieth century were significantly influenced by internal processes of the climate system. This is particularly the case for the observed global warming trend of 1910–1940 and the global cooling trend of 1940–1970. Global mean precipitation hardly increases with time in the ensemble simulations, but in agreement with theory regional changes occur, with increasing precipitation in polar regions and in some tropical areas. In the subtropics there are reductions in precipitation. Long-lasting regional anomalies of significant amplitudes occur by chance in the ensemble integration. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"climate change; climate modeling; climate variation; computer simulation; ensemble forecasting; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; radiative forcing; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049905503

Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that the pharmaceutical industry is significantly more emission-intensive than the automotive industry. We also use a previously published mathematical framework linking national target emissions to the target emission intensity of the pharmaceutical sector to derive the emission intensity of the pharmaceutical sector required for the US to meet its reductions commitments per the now defunct Obama-administration commitments at the 2015 Paris Agreement. We identify the excess emitters among the top-15 Pharmaceutical companies, from those that are leading the pack with their emissions improvement efforts. The results are quite instructive as we find a far greater variability amongst the Top-15 pharmaceuticals than the Top-10 automotive companies, suggesting a very disparate set of environmental practices within the industry.

The similarities of the carbon dioxide (CO2) and OCS molecules within chemical and plant metabolic pathways have led to the use of OCS as a proxy for global gross CO2 fixation by plants (gross primary production, GPP). However, unknowns such as the OCS exchange from soils, where simultaneous OCS production (POCS) and consumption (UOCS) occur, currently limits the use of OCS as a GPP proxy. We estimated POCS and UOCS by measuring net fluxes of OCS, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO) in a dynamic chamber system fumigated with air containing different mixing ratios [OCS]. Nine soils with different land use were rewetted and soil-air exchange was monitored as soils dried out to assess responses to changing moisture. A major control of OCS exchange was the total amount of available sulfur in the soil. POCS production rates were highest for soils at WFPS (water-filled pore space) &gt;60% and rates were negatively related to thiosulfate concentrations. These moist soils switched from a net source to a net sink activity at moderate moisture levels (WFPS 15% to 37%). For three soils we measured NO and CO mixing ratios at different mixing ratios of OCS and revealed that NO and potentially CO exchange rates are linked to UOCS at moderate soil moisture. High nitrate concentrations correlated with maximum OCS release rates at high soil moisture. For one of the investigated soils, the moisture and OCS mixing ratio was correlated with different microbial activity (bacterial 16S rRNA, fungal ITS RNA relative abundance) and gene transcripts of red-like cbbL and amoA. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air-soil interaction; carbon monoxide; climate change; community response; inorganic compound; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; nitric oxide; soil moisture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063463049

Biostimulation tests in a gas-free coal seam were analysed over 1.5 years encompassing methane production, cell abundance, planktonic and surface associated community composition and chemical parameters of the coal formation water. Evidence is presented that sulfate reducing bacteria are energy limited whilst methanogenic archaea are nutrient limited. Methane production was highest in a nutrient amended well after an oxic preincubation phase to enhance coal biofragmentation (calcium peroxide amendment). Compound-specific isotope analyses indicated the predominance of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Acetoclastic methanogenic archaea of the Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina genera increased with methane concentration. Acetate was the main precursor for methanogenesis, however more acetate was consumed than methane produced in an acetate amended well. DNA stable isotope probing showed incorporation of 13 C-labelled acetate into methanogenic archaea, Geobacter species and sulfate reducing bacteria. Community characterisation of coal surfaces confirmed that methanogenic archaea make up a substantial proportion of coal associated biofilm communities. Ultimately, methane production from a gas-free subbituminous coal seam was stimulated despite high concentrations of sulfate and sulfate-reducing bacteria in the coal formation water.

Saving energy in transportation is requested for both reducing energy pressure intensity and decreasing relevant emissions. Large scale energy conservation and emission reduction are Chinese automotive industrys’ fundamental objectives. This paper addresses a nonlinear hybrid fuzzy based proportional integral derivative (PID) control methodology to reduce the automobile fuel over-consumption and gases over-emission. After introducing the mathematical model of the automobile Pierburg mechatronic actuator of nonlinear character with parameter uncertainties, its angular displacement is controlled via the proposed PID-fuzzy logic control (FLC) approach. The outputs of the PID controller are the entries of the series-connected FLC. The hybrid topology merges the simplicity and robustness advantages of both the classical PID and the FLC methods respectively. The feedback controller, based on FLC technique, is designed to desirably maintain the angular displacement towards their desired reference values with possible least steady state errors. The proper steady state error elimination will lead to considerable gas emission reduction together with improved energy efficiency. Through Matlab/Simulink tools, the numerical simulations significantly illustrate that the hybrid PID-FLC technique can contribute efficiently in ameliorating the system dynamic behavior in presence of parameter uncertainties. The overall system behavioral analysis enhancement and the proposed controller robustness are experimentally validated. © 2018","Climate change; Energy consumption; Fuzzy logic control; Gas emission reduction; Mechatronic systems; Pierburg actuator","Actuators; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer aided software engineering; Computer circuits; Controllers; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Gas emissions; Global warming; MATLAB; Robustness (control systems); Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Fuzzy logic control; Fuzzy logic control (FLC); Gas emission reduction; Mechatronic actuators; Mechatronic systems; Proportional integral derivative control; Proportional control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057763282

The shared socio-economic pathways framework is used to inform country-level changes in the mean surface temperature for the climate projections associated with each scenario. The temperature changes are used to calculate the economic damages using empirical estimates of climate effects on GDP growth. Finally, an energy system model is used under the original socio-economic assumptions and the climate-damaged assumptions, illustrating the indirect effect of climate change in a country-level energy system. Mexico was chosen to exemplify this method. The results show a reduction of energy access and a slow down of technological transition in the energy sector under climate-damaged projections. It is concluded that greenhouse gas mitigation goals should be re-calibrated under cost-benefit analysis that takes into account the damages associated with future climates consistent with the baseline.

However, due to the limited flexibility of current power systems, the rapidly growing number of installations of renewable energy systems has resulted in rising levels of generation curtailments. This paper probes the benefits of simultaneously coordinating aggregated hydro-reservoir storage with residential demand response (DR) for mitigating both load and generation curtailments in highly renewable generation power systems. DR services are provided by electric water heaters, thermal storages, electric vehicles, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads. Accordingly, an optimization model is presented to minimize the mismatch between demand and supply in the Finnish power system. The model considers proportions of base-load generation comprising nuclear, and combined heat and power (CHP) plants (both CHP-city and CHP-industry), as well as future penetration scenarios of solar and wind power that are constructed, reflecting the present generation structure in Finland. The findings show that DR coordinated with hydropower is an efficient curtailment mitigation tool given the uncertainty in renewable generation.

In some instances, to restore these and other ecosystem services, degraded montane forests are replaced by exotic tree plantations, which cover sizeable areas in several countries. Despite their importance for assessment of ecological services and for intrinsic ecological value, comparative studies of paired native montane forest and conifer plantation are scarce along the Northern Andean Cordillera. Additionally, extrapolations are challenging because each pair of communities is highly site specific due to environmental setting, age and density of plantation, and reforestation species. Here, we assess and compare structure, biogeochemistry and ecosystem services provided by closely positioned native forest and pine plantation from a protected montane area in Venezuela. Soil nutrients and soil carbon content were 60 and 54 % respectively higher in the forest. As consequence of pine’ growth form and leaf biochemistry, aboveground biomass and litter mass, as well as nutrient content and carbon stocks, were higher in the plantation. This results in the plantation storing 30 % more MgC ha -1 than the nearby forest. Canopy structure and litter properties influence the hydrology of both ecosystems through differences in rain throughfall. Most of the ecosystem services itemized are superior in the native forest, with exception that the younger plantation sequesters more carbon. An additional service provided by plantations might be that of ecological corridors that connect fragmented native forests. Our study, a specific case of nutrient and carbon cycling dynamics in paired montane forests and pine plantations, provides another set of data for the design of policy and management of considerable areas in the Neotropics with established conservation plantations. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

In this paper, we argue that attempts to mitigate this process through a focus on individualised risk communication and behavioural change are unlikely to be successful, given the epistemic conflicts surrounding climate change knowledges in public discourse. In response, we argue for an alternative framework for developing environmental knowledges, using social learning to promote both epistemic re-alignment and a re-scaling of environmental governance that promotes enablement. We use insights from research on flooding in South West England to highlight the ways in which traditional policy approaches such as behavioural change have come to be so overbearing in public debate on environmental hazards management. In contrast, we demonstrate the potential for a re-scaling of environmental governance to reconfigure climate change knowledge and build new spaces for enablement to reduce hazard vulnerability at the place-based community scale. We argue that this has major epistemological and practical implications for the ways that researchers and policy makers work with publics to reduce hazard risk under a changing climate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Community; Flooding; Hazard governance; Resilience","behavioral response; climate change; flooding; governance approach; hazard assessment; hazard management; policy approach; risk assessment; vulnerability; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061725292

The seasonal variability in water and sediment input has significant impacts on the ecosystem influencing the rate of CO 2 sequestration. We have assessed the impact of seasonal variability on CO 2 sequestration using foraminiferal analysis and grain size data end member modeling. Lake floor sediment samples were collected seasonally, besides in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters of the lake bottom water at fixed stations influenced by seasonally variable fresh and saline water influx. Low electrical conductivity, pH of bottom water and absence of calcareous foraminifera suggest that the region proximal to the river mouth has fresh water ecosystem and has very limited role in CO 2 sequestration. The region near to the sea mouth experiences high energy condition and seasonally changes from brackish to marine water ecosystem are ideal for diversification and opportunistic populations of foraminifera, but not ideal for flourishing (high population) of calcareous foraminifera. Inter-mixing of fresh and saline sea water develops fresh to brackish water conditions with medium energy condition in the interior region. These locations are away from the river and sea mouths and have high calcareous foraminifera abundances, but low diversity along with high bottom water pH suggesting seasonal variations in the sinking of CO 2 . Like other shallow coastal areas, Ammonia beccarii and Ammonia tepida are the dominant calcareous species, but their smaller size suggests a seasonal stressed condition. The opening of new and artificial sea mouth has increased the inflow of sea water into the lagoon that maintains its brackish water conditions, suggested by significant increase in calcareous foraminifera abundance. The sinking of these calcareous foraminifera may enhance the rate of CO 2 sequestration and reduce degassing of dissolved carbon carried by the fresh water to the atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Brackish water; Chilika lake; Energy condition; Foraminifera; Fresh water; Marine water","bottom water; brackish water; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; coastal lagoon; ecosystem dynamics; electrical conductivity; energy efficiency; estuarine front; foraminifera; freshwater; grain size; in situ measurement; lacustrine deposit; seasonal variation; seawater; spatiotemporal analysis; transition zone; Asia; Chilka Lake; India; Odisha; Ammonia beccarii; Ammonia tepida; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062036353

Lignocellulosic biomass-derived jet fuel blendstocks can contribute to the shift toward renewable, low-carbon energy sources for aircrafts. Producing these renewable jet fuel molecules from biomass requires advanced pathways with the potential for efficient and affordable conversion routes. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic analysis and sensitivity analysis, including estimated minimum selling price (MSP), and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs for five routes to four potential bio-jet fuel molecules-limonane via limonene, limonane via 1,8-cineole, tetrahydromethylcyclopentadiene dimer (RJ-4), bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane. The simulated biorefineries utilize biomass sorghum and an integrated high-gravity ionic liquid-based biomass deconstruction process. We present results reflecting the current state of the technology and potential future scenarios with improved yields. Among the conversion pathways and the fuel molecules evaluated in this study, limonane, bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane could reach an MSP of $0.73-$0.91 per L-Jet A ($2.75-$3.45 per gal-Jet A) in optimized future cases, without a hypothetical lignin-derived co-product. RJ-4 requires a more costly upgrading process and catalysts, resulting in a comparatively higher MSP ($1.33 per L-Jet A or $5.04 per gal-jet A). Based on the GHG footprints of each fuel, the minimum achievable carbon mitigation cost relative to conventional Jet-A is $29 per metric ton CO2e, which is just under double the current cap-and-trade market price in California. In the absence of any policy support, the economics could be improved through high-value uses for lignin. To reach a target selling price of $0.66 per L-Jet A ($2.50 per gal), lignin-derived products would need to be sold for at least $1.9 per kg. However, the higher energy density of these bio-based blendstocks offers valuable improvements in aircraft efficiency/range; we find that commercial airlines may be willing to pay a 4-14 cent per L premium for these bio-jet fuels. Our results highlight the need for improvements beyond currently-reported yields for the biologically produced intermediates, identification of ideal microbial hosts, selection of metabolic pathways to achieve competitive production costs, and a focus on fuels with attractive properties that increase their value. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Air transportation; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Dimers; Economic analysis; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Ionic liquids; Jet fuel; Lignin; Molecules; Sensitivity analysis; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas mitigation; Higher energy density; Lignin-derived products; Lignocellulosic biomass; Low carbon energies; Techno-Economic analysis; Transportation sector; Costs; air transportation; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; catalysis; catalyst; chemical compound; climate change; cost analysis; economic analysis; energy resource; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; lignin; performance assessment; Biomass; Carbon; Commerce; Dimers; Economic Analysis; Greenhouse Gases; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063081085

However, migration also carries risks and costs, such that vulnerability may not be reduced. This article constructs an index of rural households' vulnerability to extreme weather events, in order to explore how key components of vulnerability relate to migration. Applied to case studies in China and India, the study finds that the effect of remittances is non-linear. Although overall, in Assam, few differences were found in the vulnerability of households that did and did not receive remittances, in Yunnan, remittance-recipient households were found to have less adaptive capacity in response to drought. However, those who had received remittances over longer periods were found to have improved adaptive capacity in both case studies, and in Yunnan, their exposure to such events was also lower. Meanwhile in Assam, longer distance migration was associated with reduced exposure to flooding and with specific forms of adaptation. The vulnerability index developed has capacity to be used in assessments of effects of migration on vulnerability elsewhere.

The results indicate that biomass might be an appealing option for reduction of the carbon footprint in Estonia's and Latvia's electricity generation, whereas wind energy might be preferred in Lithuania.

This paper presents numerical studies on the interaction between novel combustion concepts and conventional “high pressure turbine” (HPT) stages. In order to obtain higher efficiency and reduce emissions of jet engines, it is necessary to apply innovative and revolutionary technologies. The most promising technical solutions are based on the cycle processes, employing “pressure gain combustion” (PGC) methods. PGC methods provide a significant thermal efficiency enhancement and low NO x -emission rates at the same time. The investigations presented in this paper give information on the integrability of revolutionary combustion concepts into conventional engine architecture. This paper aims at providing insight into the numerical modelling of the transient behaviour of prospective combustion outflow and its influence on the operation of HPTs, especially on the first stage. The focus is on the aerodynamic effects and loss mechanisms within the blade passage. The interaction between the two components plays an important role. To study the performance under new conditions, an engine-like HPT geometry is used. This study reveals a decrease in turbine efficiency with transient inflow conditions compared to a steady-state inflow case. The decrease is primarily due to the interaction between transient inflow and the loss mechanisms in the turbine.

Results: The largest differences in the FA composition were between biodynamic summer and winter milk. We found increased proportions of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA-n3), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in the summer milk. A principal component analysis expressed the structure that was present in the biodynamic farm milk samples, based on clusters of a single FA within four components. The components could be correlated with the season of production, the amount of precipitation, the elevation of the farm above sea level, and the length of the grazing season. Biodynamic shop milk in the summer had a lower n6/n3 PUFA ratio compared to the conventional shop milk in all regions of production. Mean values were 1.37 and 1.89, respectively. Conclusions: The differentiation of biodynamic milk FA composition is consistent with the existing knowledge about the effects of fresh grass, fodder, and ratio composition on the milk’s FA composition. Based on the n6/n3 PUFA ratio, the average biodynamic dairy cow had a high intake (>82%) of fresh grass and conserved roughage (hay and grass silage), especially in the summer. © 2019 by the authors.

Yet, wind time series analyses can be impacted by several artefacts, both temporally and spatially, which may introduce inhomogeneities that mislead the study of their decadal variability and trends. The aim of this study is to present a strategy in the homogenization of a challenging climate extreme such as the DPWG using 548 time series across Australia for 1941–2016. This automatic homogenization of DPWG is implemented in the recently developed Version 3.1 of the R package Climatol. This approach is an advance in homogenization of climate records as it identifies 353 break points based on monthly data, splits the daily series into homogeneous subperiods, and homogenizes them without needing the monthly corrections. The major advantages of this homogenization strategy are its ability to: (a) automatically homogenize a large number of DPWG series, including short-term ones and without needing site metadata (e.g., the change in observational equipment in 2010/2011 was correctly identified); (b) use the closest reference series even not sharing a common period with candidate series or presenting missing data; and (c) supply homogenized series, correcting anomalous data (quality control by spatial coherence), and filling in all the missing data. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis wind speed data were also trialled in aiding homogenization given the station density was very low during the early decades of the record; however, reanalysis data did not improve the homogenization. Application of this approach found a reduced range of DPWG trends based on site data, and an increased negative regional trend of this climate extreme, compared to raw data and homogenized data using NCEP/NCAR. The analysis produced the first homogenized DPWG dataset to assess and attribute long-term variability of extreme winds across Australia. © 2018 The Authors.

Since fuel resources are scarce, it is an urgent need to find alternative fuel. Biofuel is one of the favorable choices in the market. Algae-based biofuel is the fourth generation of biofuel where it does not compete with the food production and it has myriad of advantages. These abundant algae are easy to cultivate and researchers found that algae-based biofuel is capable of reducing engine emission. This paper modelled the RB211 aero-gas turbine engine by utilizing algae-based biofuel with various blended percentage ratios at different flight conditions. Cranfield's University in-house software, PYTHIA, and HEPHAESTUS are used to model the engine performance and emission prediction respectively. PYTHIA programme uses a modified Newton-Raphson convergence technique in the zero-dimensional steady-state model for both design and off-design conditions. Meanwhile, HEPHAESTUS software uses the Zeldovich equations (for NOx) and models the emission by implementing a partially-stirred reactor (PSR) model and perfectly stirred reactor (PSRS) models at different zones in the combustor. Results have shown that thrust force produced is increasing at higher blended percentage ratio of algae biofuel. Through emission analysis prediction, generally, the nitrous oxide emission formation is lower at a higher altitude during the cruising. Results also predicted that higher percentage blended ratio of algae biofuel also reduces the emission formation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aerospace engineering; Aircraft propulsion; Algae; Forecasting; Gas turbines; Nitrogen oxides; Oils and fats; Aero gas turbine engines; Engine performance; In-house software; Nitrous oxide emissions; Off design condition; Perfectly stirred reactor; Political factors; Steady-state modeling; Biofuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063894074

These risks have a huge negative impact on their livelihood. However, mounting evidence has revealed that farmers can effectively manage this negative impact by adapting their farming practices to climate change. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the farmers’ ongoing adaptation measures, and to identify factors that influence their choice of adaptation methods in wheat production in the Kermanshah district in Western Iran. A sample of 350 farmers living in this region was selected through a multi-stage stratified and random sampling method. Principal component analysis revealed that three components play a role in the farmers’ decisions on adaptation methods, namely, farm production practices, farm financial management, and government programs and insurance. The relative influence of the factors listed under each of the three components was assessed using a multiple linear regression analysis. Our analysis showed that these factors accounted for 50%, 25%, and 40% of the adaptation responses analyzed, respectively.

Implemented at a large-scale, it provides a viable solution to harvesting and storing the modern crisis of GHGs emissions. To date, technological and economic barriers have inhibited broad-scale utilisation of mineral carbonation at industrial scales. This paper outlines the mineral carbonation process; discusses drivers and barriers of mineral carbonation deployment in Australian mining; and, finally, proposes a unique approach to commercially viable CCUS within the Australian mining industry by integrating mine waste management with mine site rehabilitation, and leveraging relationships with local coal-fired power station. This paper discusses using alkaline mine and coal-fired power station waste (fly ash, red mud, and ultramafic mine tailings, i.e., nickel, diamond, PGE (platinum group elements), and legacy asbestos mine tailings) as the feedstock for CCUS to produce environmentally benign materials, which can be used in mine reclamation. Geographical proximity of mining operations, mining waste storage facilities and coal-fired power stations in Australia are identified; and possible synergies between them are discussed. This paper demonstrates that large-scale alkaline waste production and mine site reclamation can become integrated to mechanise CCUS. Furthermore, financial liabilities associated with such waste management and site reclamation could overcome many of the current economic setbacks of retrofitting CCUS in the mining industry. An improved approach to commercially viable climate change mitigation strategies available to the mining industry is reviewed in this paper. © 2019 by the authors.","Australian mining; Climate change; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission; Mine reclamation; Mineral carbonation; Mining waste","carbon sequestration; climate change; emission; financial system; greenhouse gas; land reclamation; long-term change; mine waste; mineral; mining industry; waste management; waste treatment; Australia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062884778

For Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, its physical dynamics and associated changes are not well understood as evidenced, e.g., from the citations of its area 66,400 – 69,485 km2, length 300 – 412 km, width 240 – 355 km, and shorelines 3300 – 4828 km. Its sheer size and lack of research resources commitment by regional governments hamper observations. This contribution employs a suite of remotely sensed products for the past 34 years (1984–2018); Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS, Google Earth Pro, CHIRPS, Multivariate El’ Niño-Southern Oscillation Index and altimetry data together with the physical parameters from 37 publications (1969–2018) to (i) study the lake's dynamics and establish its current (2018) state, (ii) identify and analyse hotspots where significantly dynamic changes occur, and (iii), study the contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities on these dynamics. Utilizing manual digitisation, MNDWI, NDVI and PCA methods, the study shows the lake's mean surface area to be 69,295 km2 (i.e., 812 km2 or 1.2% more than that of the 37 publications) and its 2018 value to be 69,216 km2 (i.e., ∼733 km2 (1.1%) more than that of the 37 publications). As to whether the lake is dying, it shrunk by 203 km2 (0.3%) compared to its 1984 value, a decrease noted mainly in four hotspot Gulfs (Birinzi 40%, Winam 20%, Emin Pasha 38% and Mwanza 55%). Correspondingly, the expansion of Nalubaale Dam (2002–2006) decreased the areas by 31%, 10%, 21% and 44%, respectively. Seasonal analysis shows an increase of 9 km2 in the lake's area during the heavy rainy season (March–May) while the ENSO enlarged the area by 0.23% (2007) and 0.45% (2010). It is evident, therefore, that both climate variability/change and anthropogenic activities are exerting a toll on the tropical's largest freshwater body thereby necessitating careful exploitation and management plans. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic activities; Climate change; Lake Victoria; Physical parameters; Spatio-temporal changes","Atmospheric pressure; Dynamics; Earth (planet); Lakes; Water; Anthropogenic activity; Climate variability/change; Lake Victoria; Physical parameters; Regional government; Seasonal analysis; Southern oscillation index; Spatio-temporal changes; Climate change; rain; climate change; human activity; lake dynamics; parameter estimation; physical analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; climate change; controlled study; drought; dynamics; environmental exploitation; environmental planning; environmental policy; flooding; lake; physical parameters; priority journal; seasonal variation; surface area; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058977827

The various mixtures and sizes of photovoltaic (PV) arrays, wind turbines, power converters, diesel generators, and batteries are evaluated to find out the optimal system configuration to meet the required peak load of 1353 kW. The recommended HRES is optimized for the minimum net present cost (NPC). The electrical power, economic, and greenhouse gas emission analyses of the optimized HRES architecture are performed. Finally, a detailed sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the impact of uncertainties in diesel cost and renewable resource variations on various system architectures, NPC, and CO2 emissions. The optimal system consists of two generators 500 kW and 1 MW, one V82 wind turbine (1.65 MW), a 100 kW PV, a 200 kW converter, and 100 batteries.

About 30% of domestic water use in the U.S. is for outdoor activities, especially landscape irrigation and gardening. Optimum landscape and garden irrigation contributes to substantial water and energy savings and a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Thus, the objectives of this work are to (i) calculate site-specific turf grass irrigation water requirements across Harris County and (ii) calculate CO2 emission reductions and water and energy savings across the county if optimum turf grass irrigation is adopted. The Irrigation Management System was used with site-specific soil hydrological data, turf crop water uptake parameters (root distribution and crop coefficient), and long-term daily rainfall and reference evapotranspiration to calculate irrigation water demand across Harris County. The Irrigation Management System outputs include irrigation requirements, runoff, and drainage below the root system. Savings in turf irrigation requirements and energy and their corresponding reduction in CO2 emission were calculated. Irrigation water requirements decreased moving across the county from its north-west to its south-east corners. However, the opposite happened for the runoff and excess drainage below the rootzone. The main reason for this variability is the combined effect of rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, and soil types. Based on the result, if the average annual irrigation water use across the county is 25 mm higher than the optimum level, this will result in 10.45 million m3 of water losses (equivalent water use for 30,561 single families), 4413 MWh excess energy use, and the emission of 2599 metric tons of CO2. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emission; IManSys; Irrigation water requirement; Turf grass","emission control; evapotranspiration; garden; grass; irrigation system; landscape ecology; precipitation intensity; water demand; water uptake; water use; Harris County [Texas]; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062921586

A methodology is presented for developing a standardized test waste composition and demonstrated using three military and one civilian waste types. Batch charges of waste were processed through a gasification chamber, afterburner, and wet scrubber. The 0.5–2 metric ton per day (MTD) system was designed for mobile deployment by the military in forward operations but would be applicable to small scale civilian applications. Emissions data from these types of small capacity, cyclically operated systems are lacking, limiting efforts to compare technologies and their environmental performance. Eight tests were conducted in a 7-day period at the Kilauea Military Camp (KMC) in Hawaii. The pollutants characterized were chosen based on their regulatory and health relevance: particulate matter (PM), mercury (Hg), elemental composition, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Averaged data from 4-hour runs, including startups and shutdowns, indicated that five of the nine EPA-regulated compounds (lead, cadmium, Hg, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride) were under the emission limits set for Other Solid Waste Incineration Units (OSWI) while four, PCDD/PCDF, PM, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide, were higher. The procedures through which waste compositions were created and emissions were characterized provide a methodology by which differing waste to energy technologies can be compared on an equivalent basis.

At the same time, few rural areas are subjected to measurements of ambient air quality, and policy documents and media rarely discuss the health and environmental risks caused by household air pollution (HAP) produced by the use of biomass for cooking and heating. Between 2014 and 2017 a cross-disciplinary team carried out a joint study of air quality and perceptions of air pollution in one of China's richest provinces, Zhejiang. We found that the ambient PM2.5 concentration in the rural villages was similar to that in the urban areas. Moreover, the 24-hour mean personal exposure to particulate pollution (PM2.5) was similar for urban and rural participants in total. However, we found indications of enhanced exposure levels in certain sub-groups, such as biomass users, women, and family cooks. We found that while villagers were strongly concerned about risks of air pollution coming from nearby factories, they were largely unaware of the problem of HAP. In this article, we analyse to what extent HAP contributes to the air pollution exposure in the areas studied, and we discuss possible reasons why it has largely remained a hidden hazard. In the conclusion, we suggest that air pollution in rural areas should receive more attention from media, environmental organizations and policy makers; furthermore, that HAP in particular should be incorporated into air pollution policies to a greater extent, and its contribution to air pollution exposure in rural areas be made more publicly known. © 2018","China; Household air pollution; perceptions of pollution; risk of air pollution, gender and air pollution; rural air pollution","adult; air pollution; article; attention; biomass; China; female; gender; household; human; organization; perception; rural area; rural population; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058527387

A multi-technique approach was adopted for the complete PM chemical characterization. The bulk characterization was performed by IC (Ion Chromatography), HPAEC (High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography), TOT (Thermal Optical Transmittance) and ED-XRF (Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence) while XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) was used for the surface characterization. Using levoglucosan as specific tracer of biomass burning emissions, the assessment of the impact of this source was carried out and it represent the major PM source at the investigate site during winter. In winter the average levoglucosan concentration is 2096 ± 324 ng/m3 while during summer its concentration is negligible (18 ± 7 ng/m3). Levoglucosan content in PM2.5 during winter is on average 13.7%; it is estimated that 65% of PM2.5 is due to wood burning. XPS has been exploited in this work aiming at highlighting possible differences between surface and bulk composition of PM2.5. The surface of the particulate matter resulted enriched in carbon compared to the bulk. Among the components of XPS C1s signals recorded on the samples collected during winter, it was found that the signal at 286.5 eV, which is due to the presence of C–OH, reflects the bulk composition of levoglucosan. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon analysis; ED-XRF analysis; Levoglucosan; Particulate matter; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ion chromatography; Ion exchange; Photoelectrons; Photons; Carbon analysis; Chemical characterization; Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence; High-performance anion-exchange chromatography; Levoglucosan; Particulate Matter; Thermal-optical transmittance; XRF analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; levoglucosan; carbon; air sampling; biomass burning; chemical composition; organic compound; particulate matter; summer; winter; X-ray diffraction; X-ray spectroscopy; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; chemical composition; comparative study; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; Italy; particulate matter; surface area; volume; winter; wood; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Italy; Sardinia; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059323840

These particles interact with the climate conditions (indirectly) and the radiation balance (directly) of the Earth. Iraq represents one of the aerosol hot spots in southwest Asia because of repeated dust storms that need further in-depth studies to describe and understand the dust activity. This research assesses the spatiotemporal pattern variability of the aerosol index values obtained from TOMS—OMI satellite platforms and compares it with selected surface weather factors to describe the dust phenomena over Iraq during 1980–2015. The results show a significant monthly and seasonal variability of aerosol index AI distributions between the northern and southern regions of Iraq. The monthly average AI data display maximum values during the hot summer months and minimum values in the cold winter months over the study regions. Maximum AI values occur above the southern area during March–October, reducing gradually towards the north, whereas the minimum values are recorded between December and February. The highest values of AI distribution from the TOMS satellite were 2.06, 1.93, and 1.87 and for the OMI sensor were 2.32, 2.27 and 2.24 in June above the northern, central and south regions, respectively, with lower values in December. The correlation between aerosol index and relative humidity, air temperatures, wind velocity and rainfall can be employed effectively to estimate and predict dust activity.

Traditionally, the financial assessments of these decisions are based on capital budgeting methods comprising cash flow analyses and net present value calculations.

Local knowledge on landscape sustainable-hydrological management reduces soil CO2 emission, fire risk and biomass loss in West Kalimantan Peatland, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 725-731. Local knowledge in managing peatlands, especially in the area of peat hydrology, has been practiced through generations to manage peatlands for agriculture and small scale gardens. Farmers in West Kalimantan have developed the way to conserve water by making simple dams using soil or woody plants to hold water from the peat upstream areas on small channels or rivers. To reduce puddles during rain or tides, people make small trenches, so-called parit cacing in the middle of the larger channel. The trench cross-section size is ~30-40 cm2. This channel can maintain the peat water level to the extent of the depth of the channel. These channels, at the same time, are useful, for a clear, easy land ownership border for one farmer family land. The results of CO2 emissions assessment at various water levels on the peatland landscape demonstrate that the landscape which surrounded by the parit cacing trenches can maintain lower CO2 emissions compared to the one that has deeper water levels. The knowledge to develop this channel has also reduced the risk of peatland fire hazard and the amount of peat biomass loss on a fire event. An assessment on the effect of water level on the loss of peat biomass when burned, reduce 30-78% loss risks if compared to water table depth of 60-80cm, which is assumed as general practices on peatland recently. The practices of the knowledge on peatlands hydrology management can reduce the risk of peatland soil CO2 emission as well as loss of peat mass through decomposition and during peat fires. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Soil management influences the accumulation of C, regulating the balance between mineralization and/or the humification of SOM. This study aimed to quantify inputs of different chemical forms of C into soil and to evaluate the structural chemical characteristics of humified SOM. Four management systems were established: Forest (F), Pasture (P), Conventional tillage (T), and No-tillage (NT). Total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) by depth, chemical forms of organic matter input, and spectroscopic characterization of SOM in the form of humic acids (HA) were analyzed. The results obtaining by PCA-13C NMR show that the forest accumulated a high amount of C on the surface (surpassing 20 Mg ha−1), favoring the formation of aliphatic HA (CAlkyl-H,R; CAlkyl-O,N; CAlkyl-O). In the NT management that increases biomass in the soil (14 Mg ha−1), the mineralization process occurred to a greater extent, allowing HA to form with a predominance of aromatic structures (CArm-H,R and CArm-O,N). The PCA-FTIR analysis showed that the P system contributed to the formation of similar HA to those under F management. The T management system incorporated the least TOC and TN, with different HA types being formed in these soils than what was found in other managements. Thus, minimally managed and more stabilized systems in tropical climates form HA of structural and compositional similarity, regardless of the nature of C (C3 or C4). In contrast, soils subjected to agricultural uses that promote higher or lower C inputs, form HA that are structurally different from P and F. This study demonstrates the need for developing experiments for model building to elucidate the relationships among C input, management type, and the formation of humic substances. © 2018","13C NMR; Carbon balance; Humic substances; Soil organic matter; Spectroscopy characterization","Agronomy; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Forestry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Global warming; Magnesium; Mineralogy; Organic carbon; Soils; Stabilization; Tropics; 13C NMR; Agricultural management; Carbon balance; Carbon dioxide emissions; Compositional similarities; Humic substances; Soil organic matters; Spectroscopic characterization; Soil pollution; carbon; nitrogen; organic matter; carbon; organic compound; agricultural management; carbon balance; carbon cycle; carbon isotope; soil organic matter; soil quality; spectroscopy; tropical region; agriculture; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass; Brazil; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; controlled study; conventional tillage; humic substance; priority journal; soil quality; spectroscopy; total organic carbon; tropic climate; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; soil; tropic climate; Brazil; Agriculture; Brazil; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Humic Substances; Organic Chemicals; Soil; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058780611

This article advances a poststructural geographical understanding of this complexity by focusing on the spatiotemporally articulated rationalities and strategies of local communities in their encounter with Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ‘Plus’ (REDD+), a form of neoliberal conservation. We integrate literature on ‘technologies of resistance’ and ‘multiple environmentalities’ retracing the progressive development of the subject of power in Michel Foucault's work in order to conceptualise local engagement with neoliberal conservation in terms of community ‘technologies of the self’. Developed in Foucault's later works, the notion of technologies of the self places the strategies of the governed at the centre of analysis, while attending to their diverse and creative comportments. We develop this empirically through a detailed ethnographic investigation of community engagement with REDD+ in Nigeria. We show how the project proponents’ efforts to produce Ekuri forest community as a ‘model REDD + community’ clash with this community's technologies of the self which have evolved dynamically through historically-sedimented values, practices, relations and struggles. Ekuri's technologies are at once, traditional and modern in their ethos; local and global in their spatial articulations. They manifest in Ekuri's contestation of the failing promises of REDD+, the moral burden of its assumptions about local deforestation and its restriction on community development. Yet, this community would surprisingly align with REDD+ and the global carbon forestry regime to challenge the state's appropriation of community forest land for infrastructural development. We highlight four key moments of community technologies through their corresponding provisional subjectivities: the subject of hope, the moral subject, the unruly subject and the mobilising subject. We reflect on the wider implications of our poststructural geographical analysis for understanding local engagement with neoliberal conservation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Multiple environmentalities; Neoliberal conservation; Nigeria; REDD+; Resistance; Technologies of the self","community forestry; conservation; deforestation; emission control; neoliberalism; technology adoption; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059694386

Identifying and assessing pathways for converting existing houses to NZE buildings at the housing stock level is a complex and multifaceted problem and requires extensive analysis on the impact of energy efficiency and renewable/alternative energy technology retrofits on the energy use and GHG emissions of households. A techno-economic analysis of retrofitting renewable/alternative energy technologies in the CHS to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions was conducted to develop strategies to achieve or approach NZE status for Canadian houses.

We report on X-ray and optical observations obtained during this event, which indicate that the source is a new low-mass X-ray binary. The outburst lasted ∼70 d and peaked at LX(0.5-10 keV) ∼ 7.6 × 1036 erg s−1, assuming a distance of 8 kpc. Swift/XRT follow-up covering the whole activity period shows that the X-ray emission was always dominated by a hard power-law component with a photon index in the range of 1.4-1.7. These values are consistent with MAXI J1813-095 being in the hard state, in agreement with the ∼30 per cent fractional root-mean-square amplitude of the fast variability (0.1-50 Hz) inferred from the only XMM-Newton observation available. The X-ray spectra are well described by a Comptonization emission component plus a soft, thermal component (kT ∼ 0.2 keV), which barely contributes to the total flux (8 per cent). The Comptonization y-parameter (∼1.5), together with the low temperature and small contribution of the soft component supports a black hole accretor. We also performed optical spectroscopy using the Very Large Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias telescopes during outburst and quiescence, respectively. In both cases, the spectrum lacks emission lines typical of X-ray binaries in outburst. Instead, we detect the Ca II triplet and H α in absorption. The absence of velocity shifts between the two epochs, as well as the evolution of the H α equivalent width, strongly suggest that the optical emission is dominated by an interloper, likely a G-K star. This favours a distance 3 kpc for the X-ray transient. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society","Accretion; Accretion discs; Black hole physics; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual: MAXI J1813-095",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067034558

Specifically, an adaptive structure ensures a controlled and fully reversible transition from a baseline shape to a set of different configurations, each one characterized by different external loads and transmission paths of the internal stresses. The Consortium de recherche et d'innovation en aérospatiale au Québec (CRIAQ) MD0-505 research project, born from an efficient transatlantic cooperation among Italian and Canadian academic departments, research centers, and leading companies, suggests a possible solution to more stringent government requirements on emissions and safety: an innovative morphing aileron implemented to increase both structural stability and the in-cruise load control, was designed, manufactured, and tested. The aim of this article is to predict the aero-servo-elastic impact of a true-scale prototype on a regional aircraft, following an experimental test campaign and the development of a well-correlated finite-element model of the device. A detailed trade-off flutter analysis was performed by means of SANDY, an in-house code, in compliance with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) CS-25 airworthiness requirements and referring - initially - to nominal aileron functioning. Furthermore, a sensitivity investigation was carried out to assess the dynamic stability of the adaptive aileron, verifying the flutter clearance in the presence of critical scenarios related to malfunctions of the actuation system. Safety values for the aileron control harmonic were investigated looking at potential certification and industrialization issues. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Aeroelasticity; Failure; Finite-element model (FEM); Ground vibration testing; Morphing","Aeroelasticity; Ailerons; Aircraft; Computer system recovery; Economic and social effects; Flutter (aerodynamics); Stability; Structural design; Academic department; Adaptive structure; European Aviation Safety Agency; Ground vibration testing; Morphing; Reversible transitions; Structural stabilities; Transatlantic co-operation; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057849532

In this article, I draw on geopolitical ecology and situated urban political ecology to examine the production and contestation of the Egyptian state’s narratives of the floods. In doing so, I argue against using the term authoritarian, which predetermines the state’s function through an inherited set of characteristics. Rather, I start with the how and why of state power to carefully examine the complex relationship between the state and urban environments.

Demand for heat is considered as substantial contributor to carbon emissions and energy-related emissions equivalent to 12.5 Gt of carbon emissions. Data on heat is limited and therefore, a study on the causal correlation between energy use and emissions would provide policy guidance on how to decarbonize the heat sector to achieve Paris’s Greenhouse Effect Treaty. Most empirical works aggregated energy consumption and ignore spatial dependence and heterogeneity in a panel dataset. Our study, however, disaggregated energy into renewable and non-renewable to find their distinct influence on emissions, which were tested for spatial dependence and heterogeneity and applied potential emissions as environmental impact. Using FGLS and PCSE estimators for the period 1971–2013, our findings revealed that the increase in renewable energy use and industrialization improves the ecological structure of emerging economies while the increase in population, economic expansion, and non-renewable energy use increases the carbon stock. We accordingly, investigated causation direction with pooled mean group estimator. Rising economic power states therefore encourage to ensure energy efficiency and replace fuel use with renewable source for heating to reduce carbon stock. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide emission; Emerging economies; Non-renewable energy use; Renewable energy use","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; correlation; economic conditions; energy efficiency; energy use; industrialization; nonrenewable resource; carbon; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; air pollution; developing country; economic development; economic model; environmental policy; international cooperation; legislation and jurisprudence; prevention and control; renewable energy; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollution; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Developing Countries; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Fossil Fuels; International Cooperation; Models, Economic; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060738421

From 1970 to 2014, passenger and the net ton kms increased by a factor of 4 and 10, respectively. This significant increase in transportation demand was met by the transition of locomotives from steam to diesel and electric in the last few decades, as better energy efficiency led to lower operation costs. For policy making, emission inventory of locomotives is essential for better understanding of the relation between air quality and the choice of traction. However, the available national emission inventories developed by the top-down approach using the national fuel consumption statistics contain huge uncertainties due to non-consideration of activity data, such as age, power and type of locomotive. To estimate this uncertainty, for the first time, a bottom-up approach using link specific activity data was used to develop the emission inventory for North-eastern Indian states. In comparison to the bottom-up approach, the emissions calculated by top-down approach were lower in case of passenger transport (246% for NO x ) and higher (36% for NO x ) in case of goods transport. Further analysis indicated that, even though the estimated emissions were sensitive to emission factors used, role of activity data was more significant. Assuming that this difference is representative for other parts of the country, a national emission inventory for Indian Railways was developed using a modified top-down approach. Using the newly developed emission inventory for railways and the existing fuel based emissions for roadways, it was estimated that if road based freight transport is switched to rail, an average decrease of 58% and 50% of NO x and CO 2 , respectively can be achieved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2; Criteria pollutants; India; IPCC; Railways","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Engines; Greenhouse gases; Locomotives; Nitrogen oxides; Railroads; Uncertainty analysis; Consumption statistics; Criteria pollutants; Emission inventories; India; IPCC; National emission inventories; Railways; Transportation demand; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059639282

Median daytime [O3] was 48 ppbv at the site downwind of central San Antonio. Higher concentrations of NO and XO2 at the downwind site also led to median daytime ozone production rates .P .O3// of 4.2 ppbv h1, a factor of 2 higher than at the two upwind sites. The 95th percentile of P.O3/ at the upwind site was 15.1 ppbv h1, significantly lower than values observed in Houston. In situ observations, as well as satellite retrievals of HCHO and NO2, suggest that the region was predominantly NOx - limited. Only approximately 20% of observations were in the VOC-limited regime, predominantly before 11:00 EST, when ozone production was low. Biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) comprised 55% of total OH reactivity at the downwind site, with alkanes and non-biogenic alkenes responsible for less than 10% of total OH reactivity in the afternoon, when ozone production was highest. To control ozone formation rates at the three study sites effectively, policy efforts should be directed at reducing NOx emissions. Observations in the urban center of San Antonio are needed to determine whether this policy is true for the entire region. © Author(s) 2019.",,"atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); nitrogen oxides; nitrous oxide; ozone; peroxy radical; volatile organic compound; San Antonio; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062563793

This paper provides a systematic analysis of NDCs submitted by South Asian nations, in order to assess how far their commitments might deliver meaningful contributions to the global 2°C target and to sustainable broad-based adaptation benefits. Though agriculture-related emissions are prominent in emission profiles of South Asian countries, their emission reduction commitments are less likely to include agriculture, partly because of a concern over food security. We find that income-enhancing mitigation technologies that do not jeopardize food security may significantly augment the region’s mitigation potential. In the case of adaptation, analysis shows that the greatest effort will be directed towards protecting the cornerstones of the ‘green revolution’ for ensuring food security. Development of efficient and climate-resilient agricultural value chains and integrated farming bodies will be important to ensuring adaptation investment. Potentially useful models of landscape level climate resilience actions and ecosystem-based adaptation are also presented, along with estimates of the aggregate costs of agricultural adaptation. Countries in the region propose different mixes of domestic and foreign, and public and private, adaptation finance to meet the substantial gaps. Key policy insights Though substantial potential for mitigation of agricultural emissions exists in South Asia, governments in the region do not commit to agricultural emissions reductions in their NDCs. Large-scale adoption of income-enhancing technologies is the key to realizing agricultural mitigation potential in South Asia, whilst maintaining food security. Increasing resilience and profitability through structural changes, value chain interventions, and landscape-level actions may provide strong options to build adaptive capacity and enhance food security. Both private finance (autonomous adaptation) and international financial transfers will be required to close the substantial adaptation finance gap. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

But, while the increase in mean temperature is statistically significant and unequivocal, we do not know if the behaviour of extreme events is another significant signal of climate change or if it is still compatible with a “constant climate”, that is, with a stationary distribution of temperatures. Here, we propose a method to study the extremes through the analysis of the trend of the new historical records of mean monthly temperatures, and apply it to data about Italy, a country affected by a warming stronger than the global mean. A deep analysis of a 56-year data set for 54 Italian stations and the use of Monte-Carlo simulations permits us to achieve the evidence of a climate change also from the analysis of extremes. This analysis is performed at both the national level and for clusters of stations. The results show that the number of warm records increases more than what is expected by a constant climate “law,” in some months reaching or even overpassing the 95th percentile: May, June, July, and especially August appear as the most significant in this respect. Vice versa, the number of cold records lies often close to the fifth percentile or even under it; furthermore, in many months the cold records are very few after the middle of the 1990s. Some months can be, however, seen as “stationary islands.” For instance, the behaviour of the number of warm records in December and January follows closely the hypothesis of a constant climate, even if, in contrast, the cold records in January lie under the fifth percentile. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change detection; climatic extremes; constant climate hypothesis; temperature historical records","Global warming; Intelligent systems; Climate change detection; climatic extremes; constant climate hypothesis; Extreme events; Historical records; Mean temperature; Stationary distribution; Temperature extremes; Monte Carlo methods; air temperature; climate change; extreme event; global warming; historical perspective; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058390106

Being the largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) after China, the United States is increasingly faced with an urgent policy drive toward environmental sustainability. Against the backdrop, this study employed the dynamic ARDL-bound testing approach to observing the tripartite impact of the trade policy, monetary policy, and migration index on carbon emissions over the period 1990:Q1–2018: Q2. The incorporated renewable energy consumption and the real GDP which controls for other unobserved factors are observed to have similar and significant impacts as in previous studies. The current study found that the trade policy, monetary policy, and migration index exerts positive and significant impacts on carbon dioxide emissions in the long-run. It implies that in the near future, the environmental sustainability of the United States is at the risk of the government policies on trade, monetary, and migration. However, such impact of the migration index on the carbon dioxide emissions is barely significant in the long-run and at the immediate time. Although the impact of the government's trade policy on carbon dioxide emissions is significant in the long-run, it immediate impact is negative and not significant.

Most of that population resides in the rural communities in developing countries in South Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to electricity can eliminate existing problems related to health, education, social life, economy and the environment, and can increase the income of underserved communities. Most of the yet to be energized regions are in remote, isolated areas, that cannot be serviced through the central grid. While decentralized diesel generators can potentially be installed in these areas, they have a poor effect on climate change mitigation. Clean renewable energy alternatives for off-grid systems are being deployed to reduce the non-electrification rate in the world, and The United Nation Foundation's 2030 Agenda has the objective of universal access to electricity by 2030. While there has been some progress towards that goal, the challenges are countless. If no changes in models, policies and practices are made, the universal access objective will not be achieved, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa that has a level of electrification projection of 30% by 2030. To determine the necessary changes, this paper reviews the rural electrification initiatives in eight developing countries, from Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa to Latin America, and aims to provide an assessment of their success and to discuss the lessons that can be learned and applied on future initiatives. © 2018","Business models for Rural electrification; Distributed Generation; First Access Systems; Innovative Solutions for Energy; Leap-frogging in Power Systems; Microgrids; Policy making for Sustainable Energy; Renewable Energy based Electrification; Rural Electrification; Social Sciences for Sustainability; Underserved Communities","Climate change; Developing countries; Distributed power generation; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Access system; Innovative solutions; Leap-frogging; Micro grid; Renewable energies; Rural electrification; Sustainable energy; Rural areas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057581514

In the U.S. in 2018, this study examined the official Instagram account of Bird, the e-scooter market share leader with over 66,000 followers, to determine how much it emphasized safety in its posts. All posts to Bird's official Instagram account were collected from 22 September 2017 to 9 November 2018 (n = 324) and rules for coding content were developed. Among all posts, 69.14% contained a person visible with a Bird e-scooter, 6.17% contained persons wearing protective gear, 6.79% had protective gear somewhere in the post, and 1.54% of posts mentioned protective gear in the comment box. About 69.44% of the posts were reposts, and among reposts, 7.11% had persons wearing protective gear. Posts to Bird's official Instagram rarely showed e-scooters being used with protective gear. Photos of customers' experiences with Bird, via reposts, rarely featured protective gear potentially normalizing these behaviors among customers.

Design/methodology/approach: The study assessed the vulnerability of male-headed and female-headed farming households to climate change and variability by using the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and tested for significant difference in their vulnerability levels by applying independent two-sample-student’s t-test based on gender by using a sample of 210 smallholder farming households. Findings: The results revealed a significant difference in the vulnerability levels of female-headed and male-headed farming households. Female–headed households were more vulnerable to livelihood strategies, socio-demographic profile, social networks, water and food major components of the LVI, whereas male-headed households were more vulnerable to health. The vulnerability indices revealed that female–headed households were more sensitive to the impact of climate change and variability. However, female-headed households have the least adaptive capacities. In all, female-headed farming households are more vulnerable to climate change and variability than male-headed farming households. Research limitations/implications: The study recommends that female-headed households should be given priority in both on-going and new intervention projects in climate change and agriculture by empowering them through financial resource support to venture into other income-generating activities. This would enable them to diversify their sources of livelihoods to boost their resilience to climate change and variability. Originality/value: This is the first study that examined the gender dimension of vulnerability of smallholder farmers in Ghana by using the livelihood vulnerability framework. Female subordination in northern region of Ghana has been profound to warrant a study on gender dimension in relation to climate change and variability, especially as it is a semi-arid region with unpredictable climatic conditions.

Olive (Olea europaea L.) is a global, high value crop currently cultivated in 28 countries worldwide. Global data to assess the vulnerability of the crop to climate variability are scarce, and in some notable cases, such the United Nations Food and Agricutlure Organization database (FAO, 2006), qualitative assessments rather than quantitative indicators are provided. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a new approach to help overcome these constraints toward a globally applicable method to assess the adaptability of olive cultivars. The adaptability of 11 cultivars, widely used in 11 countries worldwide, was studied using a new generic approach based on the evaluation of soil hydrological regime against cultivar-specific hydrological requirements. The approach requires local data, notably on soil hydrological properties, but it is easily transferable to other countries and regions. We applied an agrohydrological model in 60 soil units to determine hydrological indicators both in a reference (1961–1990) and a future (2021–2050) climate case. We compared indicators with cultivar-specific requirements to achieve the target yield; requirements were established using experimental yield response curves. We estimated the probability of adaptation, i.e., the probability that a given cultivar attains the target yield, and we used it to evaluate the cultivar potential distribution in the study area. At the locations where soil hydrological conditions were favorable, the probabilities of adaptation of the cultivars were high in both climate cases. The results show that the area with suitable conditions for the target yield (area of adaptability) decreased under future climate for all the cultivars, with higher reduction for Frantoio and Maiatica and smaller reduction for Itrana, Nocellara, Ascolana, and Kalamata. These cultivars are currently grown in Argentina, United States (US), Australia, France, Greece, and Italy. Our results indicate also that these cultivars require higher available soil water to attain the target yield, i.e., we may expect similar vulnerability in other parts of the world. Based on these findings, we provide some specific recommendations for enrichment of global databases and for further developments of our approach, to increase its potential for global application. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Agro-hydrological model; Climate change; Olea europaea L; Yield response curves","adaptation; climate change; crop plant; cultivar; evergreen tree; future prospect; hydrological modeling; hydrological regime; Mediterranean environment; soil property; vulnerability; water availability; yield response; Argentina; Australia; France; Greece; Italy; United States; Olea europaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048372689

Two major tributaries of the Tigris River, the Diyala (Sīrvān) and the Lesser Zab River basins, are shared between Iraq and Iran. They were adopted as representative basins for a large number of transboundary rivers, where short-sighted perspectives are currently ruling their management policies. Climate change is anticipated to lead to greater frequency and intensity of droughts, and higher tension is likely to emerge. The authors developed a technical support framework (TSF) that helps decision-making to alleviate the combined negative impact of climate change at basin scale and upstream human-induced impairments. The TSF encompasses six key measures: (1) cross-sectoral trade-offs; (2) improved water-use efficiency and reduction of losses; (3) development of a sound groundwater planning policy; (4) cutbacks in demand while maintaining environmental flow in the river; (5) inter-and intra-basin water transfer systems; and (6) quantification of current supply-demand gaps and sizing a future gaps. The framework supports the sustainable management of water resources in both Diyala and Lesser Zab basins as well as others in common river catchments. The recommendation is that a lower riparian country should put in place measures such as increasing water-use efficiency, rehabilitation of damaged and deteriorated irrigation facilities, and inter-and intra-basin water transfer arrangements to reduce the gap between growing water demands and corresponding supplies. © 2019, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

We use a simple monthly water balance model to quantify and decompose uncertainties associated with the GCMs and statistical techniques in projections for four snow-dominated regions in the western United States. The end-of-century projections from GCMs exhibit substantial variation in change over the regions (temperature range of 2.8–8.0 °C and precipitation range of −22–31%). The six downscaled data sets exhibit disparate high-resolution representations of the magnitude and spatial patterns of future temperature (up to 2.2 °C) and precipitation (up to 30%) for a common GCM. Two data sets derived by the same downscaling method (Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs) produce median losses of snow water equivalent over the Upper Colorado of 51% and 81%. The principal causes of the differences among the downscaled projections are related to the gridded observations used to bias correct the historical GCM output. Specifically, (1) whether a fixed atmospheric lapse rate (−6.5 °C/km) or a spatially and temporally varying lapse rate is used to extrapolate lower elevation observations to high-elevations and (2) whether high-elevation station data (e.g., SNOTEL) are included in the observations. The GCM projections are the largest source of uncertainty in the monthly water balance model simulations; however, the differences among seasonal projections produced by downscaled data sets in some regions highlight the need for careful evaluation of the statistically downscaled data in climate impact studies.

The monitoring approach couples atmospheric methane concentration measurements from an open-path dual frequency comb laser spectrometer with meteorological data in an inversion to characterize emissions. During single-blind testing, the spectrometer is placed &gt;1 km from decommissioned natural gas equipment configured with intentional leaks of controllable rate. Single, steady emissions ranging from 0 to 10.7 g min -1 (0-34.7 scfh) are detected, located, and quantified at three gas pads of varying size and complexity. The system detects 100% of leaks, including leaks as small as 0.96 g min -1 (3.1 scfh). It attributes leaks to the correct pad or equipment group (tank battery, separator battery, wellhead battery) 100% of the time and to the correct equipment (specific separator, tank, or wellhead) 67% of the time. All leaks are quantified to within 3.7 g min -1 (12 scfh); 94% are quantified to within 2.8 g min -1 (9 scfh).

Therefore, combining the two EOR processes as low salinity water-alternating CO2 EOR injection (LSWA CO2) can further improve oil recovery by promoting the synergy of the mechanisms underlying these two methods. Core flooding experiments, contact angle, interfacial tension (IFT), and CO2 solubility measurement in oil and brine were conducted to investigate the viability and performance of LSWA CO2 in sandstone reservoirs. A favorable wettability alteration, along with IFT reduction and mobility control, are the mechanisms that contribute to residual oil mobilization efficiencies during the LSWA CO2 EOR process. In addition, LSWA CO2 core flooding experiments result in a significant incremental oil recovery. Three smart waters were tested in our research, to examine the impact of changing cationic composition on oil recovery. The solutions are designed brines as NaCl (SW1), MgCl2 (SW2), and KCl (SW3). Of the three solutions, SW1 yields the highest incremental oil recovery and highest IFT reduction. In addition, it results in a favorable wettability alteration towards a more water-wet state. In all cases, introducing CO2 to the brine/oil system shows a great advantage in terms of enhancing wettability modification, promoting IFT reduction, and controlling the displacement front of the injected fluid through mobility control. © 2019 Southwest Petroleum University",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049503538

This study focuses on UFT policy choice by local authorities, investigating how policy context, resource availability and the need for legitimacy influence how local authorities seek and select UFT specific policies. The methodology is a cross-case analysis of eleven cities across three countries (Sweden, England and Scotland), based on interview and documentary data. Findings reveal that all cities have the same high-level goals, such as reducing emissions and congestion, supporting the economy and improving quality of life. However, in most cases these rather general goals are not broken down into clear objectives with targets that can be measured. Therefore, selected UFT policy measures are chosen from a pool of common measures (primarily access restrictions such as time windows and weight restrictions), but without monitored targets that determine whether or not they are achieving objectives. This does not necessarily mean that the measures chosen are inappropriate, but that there is a lack of a strategic approach to setting and reviewing measures according to achieving specific policy goals. This is primarily a result of a lack of resources and dedicated UFT personnel, as well as challenges related to public acceptability of restrictive policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","City logistics; Governance; Planning; Policy; UFT; Urban freight transport","freight transport; local government; public attitude; resource availability; transportation policy; urban planning; England; Scotland; Sweden; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060930565

In many such cases carbon monoxide levels reach such a magnitude that carbon monoxide poisoning must be the primary cause of death. Available literature suggests that normal population usually has 5-10% carboxyhaemoglobin in blood while it is 10-15% in the case of smokers. In a number of cases the levels of carboxyhaemoglobin are too low to be considered lethal and it is not unusual to find blood samples from fire victims to be virtually free of carboxyhaemoglobin. In the present study carboxyhaemoglobin levels of 39 cases of death due to burns were analysed (ABG analysis) during the period of December 2014 to August 2016, which were brought for autopsy at Office of the District Police Surgeon, General Hospital, Ernakulam. Carboxyhaemoglobin levels in post-mortem bloodsamples were compared with total body surface area of burns sustained, duration of survival and hospitalised/non hospitalised status. Carboxyhaemoglobin levels of burns cases were also compared with carboxyhaemoglobin levels of control cases. It was found that there existed a relationship between percentages of carboxyhaemoglobin levels in post-mortem blood samples with that of surface area (percentage) of burns sustained in an individual. It was statistically proved (p value = 0.04) that higher values of carboxyhaemoglobin levels were seen in individuals who had sustained 60-80% surface area of burns. The levels of carboxyhemoglobin in post-mortem blood samples were found not to have any relationshipwith the duration of survival and whether a person had been hospitalised or not prior to death. It is also interesting to note that the carboxyhemoglobin levels in postmortem blood samples of individuals (whether they died due to burns or not) was found to be similar.

Particularly forest biomass is considered to be one of the leading renewable energy sources in European Union (EU) in the next few decades. Thus, every innovative solution contributing towards meeting the long-term renewable targets is called for. This study tackled a new approach: artificial drying of forest chips by applying the reserve heat from district-heating loop. We focused on estimating the effect of using an artificial drying system in a container on the financial incentives of heat entrepreneurs. Traditional forest fuel supply chain was compared to a fast forest fuel supply chain in which artificial drying was applied. In this study a heat entrepreneur is financially responsible for all the costs related to both forest fuel supply chains. A break-even price for energy used for artificial drying was determined so that the fast forest fuel supply chain would equal the traditional forest fuel supply chain in monetary terms, i.e. profitability. The case study covered seven end-use facilities located in Northern Finland and presenting an entity of app. 13–14 Gigawatt hours, GWh produced per annum. The results of financial analysis indicated that artificial drying of forest chips is financially viable for the heat entrepreneur if the productivity of the container exceeds ca. 3.6 dried bulk-m3 hour−1, given the observed moisture content (before and after artificial drying) in test runs. However, the results were considerably sensitive to the energy price of delivered stem chips (euros per Megawatt hour, € MWh−1). Furthermore, new technical solutions to increase the productivity of the container are welcomed since at the current productivity level (range from 2.5 to 3.6 bulk-m3 hour−1) artificial drying is barely financially attractive for a heat entrepreneur. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial drying; Biomass; Forest chips; Heat entrepreneur; Profitability","Biomass; Climate change; Containers; Drying; Finance; Fuels; Productivity; Profitability; Supply chains; Artificial drying; Energy from biomass; Financial incentives; Financial viability; Forest chips; Innovative solutions; Renewable energy source; Technical solutions; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058662108

To facilitate mitigation and adaptation planning, it is essential to quantify and synthesize climate change impacts and characterize the associated uncertainties. By synergistically using projections of climate scenarios from an ensemble of regional climate models and a spatially explicit version of an empirical health risk model, here we quantify the mortality risk associated with excessive heat stress for people aged over 65 years old across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Our results show that mortality risk is expected to intensify by a factor of 8–20 in the last 30 years of the twenty-first century with respect to the historical period (1951–2005) if no climate change mitigation planning is undertaken. If global warming is limited to 2 °C, the mortality risk is expected to rise by a factor of 3–7 for the same period. Further analyses reveal that much of the increase in mortality risk is due to the increase in frequency of warm days rather than their intensity. Unfortunately, the poorest countries with least contribution to climate change are expected to be most impacted by it, as they will experience higher mortality risks compared to wealthier nations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Developing countries; Global warming; Health risks; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Thermal stress; Anthropogenic climate; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Historical periods; Middle East and North Africa; Poorest countries; Regional climate models; Spatially explicit; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; global warming; health risk; historical perspective; low income population; mortality risk; regional climate; Middle East; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060088584

The modified OMCs were characterized using Nitrogen Adsorption-Desorption Isotherm, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). TEM images of neodymium modified OMCs revealed ordered structure. Analysis of FT-IR and XPS spectra revealed the formation of hydroxides coordinated with neodymium(III). In the lower pH region, the modified OMCs have increased positively charged sites for adsorption of anionic sunset yellow. Adsorption kinetics revealed that the adsorption of sunset yellow was better fitted with the Pseudo-Second-Order Kinetic model than the Pseudo-First-Order Kinetic Model. The adsorption isotherms were well fitted with Langmuir Model depicting the formation of monolayer adsorbates onto the surface of OMC-Nd. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 285.7 mg g−1 was observed for OMC-2Nd. The overall adsorption capacity was increased by 40% compared to the virgin OMC.

Inhalation of these toxic compounds as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or airborne fine particulate matter (PM) may cause serious pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer. Spraying chemical dispersants to enhance distribution of the crude oil into the water was employed extensively during the Deepwater Horizon spill. There is some evidence that dispersion of the crude oil decreased the emission rate of the VOCs but increased the emission rates of fine PM that may carry toxic compounds. In this study, the cancer risks and non-cancer hazards of the detected VOCs and particulates for spill-response workers were estimated with and without use of dispersant under action of breaking waves. A subchronic exposure scenario was modeled to address the inhalation health threat during initial phases of an oil spill response. A dosimetry model was used to estimate regional deposition of PM. Use of dispersant reduced benzene cancer risks from 57 to 37 excess lifetime cancer cases per million for 1 h of daily exposure that continues for 3 months. Adding dispersant resulted in emissions reductions of the lighter VOCs (up to 30% lower). However, hazard quotients (HQs) of the non-carcinogenic VOCs even after dispersant addition were above 1 meaning there are serious concerns about exposure to these VOCs. Inhalation of airborne particles emitted from the slick containing dispersant increased the total mass of deposited particles in upper respiratory regions compared to the slick of crude oil only. This study showed the application of dispersant onto the pollution slick increased the total mass burden to the human respiratory system about 10 times, an exploratory HQ analysis is presented to evaluate the potential health risk. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer; COREXIT 9500A; Crude oil; Dosimetry; Health risk assessment; Occupational health","Air pollution control; Crude oil; Diseases; Dosimetry; Hazards; Industrial hygiene; Occupational risks; Oil spills; Particulate emissions; Respiratory system; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Volatile organic compounds; Cancer; COREXIT 9500A; Emissions reduction; Fine particulate matter; Human respiratory system; Occupational health; Potential health risks; Subchronic exposure; Health risks; benzene; oil dispersant; petroleum; volatile organic compound; corexit 9500; lipid; sea water; surfactant; volatile organic compound; cancer; crude oil; emission inventory; health risk; occupational exposure; oil spill; risk assessment; volatile organic compound; adult; air pollution; airborne particle; Article; cancer risk; carbon footprint; dosimetry; environmental exposure; female; health hazard; human; inhalation; long term exposure; male; oil spill; particulate matter; priority journal; respiratory system; risk assessment; upper respiratory tract; chemistry; exposure; neoplasm; occupational exposure; oil spill; risk assessment; water pollutant; Air Pollution; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Lipids; Neoplasms; Occupational Exposure; Particulate Matter; Petroleum Pollution; Risk Assessment; Seawater; Surface-Active Agents; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056615315

There is also limited information on the nexus between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)in the region. Therefore, this study applied the Environmental Kuznets hypothesis to test the relationship between economic growth and GHG emissions in SSA and also test the effect of global GHG emission on economic growth of SSA. Using an aggregated panel data for the period of 1970 to 2012, a Vector Autoregressive and an Ordinary Least Square regression were estimated. From the result, although the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality was established in the short run, there are no clear turning points for the greenhouse gasses. Generally, there is a monotonic decreasing relationship between economic growth and environmental quality in the long-run. Interestingly, this study showed that global GHG emission levels have a long-run effect on the economic growth of SSA. We concluded that to ensure that economic growth leads to an improvement in environmental quality, there must be a global effort to introduce innovations and technologies that can lead to increase production with little GHG emissions. The study recommended that, SSA should consider carbon tax policies other than stringent GHG emission reduction initiatives or climate stabilization policies that would negatively affect production in the region. © 2019","Economic growth; Environmental Kuznets curve; Greenhouse gas; Sub-Saharan Africa; Vector autoregressive",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065227215

Some areas are covered with arid soil and salty water, while others have power transmission problems. Water evaporation from reservoirs is also another problem during high temperatures, thereby posing additional energy and water demands. This paper discusses the multiple prospects of floating photovoltaic technology in different regions of the world and highlights the importance of such technologies in already water-scarce regions like South Asia and Central Asia. This technology will prove to be highly feasible as it is an environment friendly and cost efficient and will help in reducing evaporation, achieving sustainable water supply and clean energy production and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There is very minimal work done on floating solar technology; thus, there is immense need to explore and research on this technology on every level through information sharing. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Clean energy; Evapotranspiration; Floating; Photovoltaic; Power; Submerged PV panels; Sustainable","Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Photovoltaic cells; Soils; Water conservation; Water supply; Clean energy; Floating; Photovoltaic; Power; PV panel; Sustainable; Petroleum prospecting; evaporation; evapotranspiration; greenhouse gas; photovoltaic system; power generation; solar power; sustainability; technology; water supply; Afghanistan; Central Asia; Pakistan; South Asia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055707141
