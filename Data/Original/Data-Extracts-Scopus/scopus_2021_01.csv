It complements the academic focus of previous chapters with insights as to how mixed-method research is shaping our world today. The chapter sets out with insights by Steve Harris, Industrial Ecology expert at the Swedish Environmental Research Institute, describing how mixed-method research has been applied to develop indicators used to assess industrial symbiosis projects and urban development. Next, are the insights from Brad Pettitt, Mayor of Fremantle, Western Australia, as to how the City of Fremantle uses different methods and data to inform their sustainability and low carbon policies and initiatives and how they benefitted from both, quantitative and qualitative data. Before concluding the book, we complement this with an informal dialogue with Ruth Hillary, a leading UK sustainability consultant, where we discuss the added value and challenges of mixed methods. The decision to take a discursive iterative approach to create this part of the chapter is to reflect the experimental journey that mixed-method research can take and to capture the complexities confronting the researcher. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Aharon Factor and John Parm Ulhøi.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109598701

In order to mitigate the effects of these greenhouse gases, CO2 can be captured, stored and utilized for the dry reforming of methane. Various CO2 capture techniques have been investigated in the past decades. This study investigated the performance and process modeling of CO2 capture through calcium carbonate looping (CCL) using local (Malaysia) limestone as the sorbent. The original limestone was compared with two types of oxalic acid-treated limestone, with and without aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as supporting material. The comparison was in terms of CO2 uptake capacity and performance in a fluidized bed reactor system. From the results, it was shown that the oxalic acid-treated limestone without Al2O3 had the largest surface area, highest CO2 uptake capacity and highest mass attrition resistance, compared with other sorbents. The sorbent kinetic study was used to design, using an Aspen Plus simulator, a CCL process that was integrated with a 700 MWe coal-fired power plant from Malaysia. The findings showed that, with added capital and operation costs due to the CCL process, the specific CO2 emission of the existing plant was significantly reduced from 909 to 99.7 kg/MWh. © Copyright © 2021 Zubir, Afandi, Manap, Hamid, Ayodele, Liu and Abd Hamid.","calcium carbonate; CO2 capture; economic analysis; natural gas; process modeling","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide process; Chemical reactors; Coal; Computer software; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Lime; Limestone; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Oxalic acid; Process engineering; Sorbents; Sorption; Aspen Plus Simulators; Attrition resistances; Coal-fired power plant; Dry reforming-of-methane; Fluidized bed reactors; Industrial activities; Principal Components; Supporting material; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100541683

Most likely among all the abiotic stresses, drought has the strongest effect on soil biota and plants along with complex environmental effects on other ecological systems. Plants being sessile appears the least resilient where drought creates osmotic stress, limits nutrient mobility due to soil heterogeneity, and reduces nutrient access to plant roots. Drought tolerance is a complex quantitative trait controlled by many genes and is one of the difficult traits to study and characterize. Nevertheless, existing studies on drought have indicated the mechanisms of drought resistance in plants on the morphological, physiological, and molecular basis and strategies have been devised to cope with the drought stress such as mass screening, breeding, marker-assisted selection, exogenous application of hormones or osmoprotectants and or engineering for drought resistance. These strategies have largely ignored the role of the rhizosphere in the plant's drought response. Studies have shown that soil microbes have a substantial role in modulation of plant response towards biotic and abiotic stress including drought. This response is complex and involves alteration in host root system architecture through hormones, osmoregulation, signaling through reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of systemic tolerance (IST), production of large chain extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and transcriptional regulation of host stress response genes. This review focuses on the integrated rhizosphere management strategy for drought stress mitigation in plants with a special focus on rhizosphere management. This combinatorial approach may include rhizosphere engineering by addition of drought-tolerant bacteria, nanoparticles, liquid nano clay (LNC), nutrients, organic matter, along with plant-modification with next-generation genome editing tool (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9) for quickly addressing emerging challenges in agriculture. Furthermore, large volumes of rainwater and wastewater generated daily can be smartly recycled and reused for agriculture. Farmers and other stakeholders will get a proper knowledge-exchange and an ideal road map to utilize available technologies effectively and to translate the measures into successful plant-water stress management. The proposed approach is cost-effective, eco-friendly, user-friendly, and will impart long-lasting benefits on agriculture and ecosystem and reduce vulnerability to climate change. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Climate change; Drought; Osmoregulation; PGPR; Plant responses; Soil water deficit; Stress management strategies; Yield losses","Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Bacteria; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Ecology; Endocrinology; Genes; Hormones; Knowledge management; Nutrients; Osmosis; Plants (botany); Soils; Wastewater reclamation; Biotic and abiotic stress; Combinatorial approach; Extracellular polysaccharides; Management strategies; Marker-assisted selection; Quantitative traits; Stress response genes; Transcriptional regulation; Drought; climate change; drought resistance; drought stress; genome; rainwater; rhizosphere; soil biota; stakeholder; vulnerability; wastewater; antioxidant; reactive oxygen metabolite; agriculture; drought; ecosystem; osmoregulation; osmotic pressure; physiological stress; physiology; plant; plant development; plant physiology; plant root; rhizosphere; soil; water management; Agriculture; Antioxidants; Droughts; Ecosystem; Osmoregulation; Osmotic Pressure; Plant Development; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plant Roots; Plants; Reactive Oxygen Species; Rhizosphere; Soil; Stress, Physiological; Water Purification",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093699350

However, the effects of reduced SO2 on the particle number concentrations and subsequent contributions of grown new particles to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) populations, particularly at high altitudes with low aerosol number loadings, are poorly understood. In contrast, the increase in provincial forest areas in China with rapid afforestation over the last few decades expectedly increases the biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds and their oxidized products as nucleating precursors therein. In this study, we evaluated the campaign-based measurements made at the summit of Mt. Tai (1534 m a.s.l.) from 2007 to 2018. With the decrease in SO2 mixing ratios from 15 ± 13 ppb in 2007 to 1.6 ± 1.6 ppb in 2018, the apparent formation rate (FR) of new particles and the net maximum increase in the nucleation-mode particle number concentration (NMINP) in the spring campaign of 2018 was 2- to 3-fold higher than those in the spring campaign of 2007 with almost the same occurrence frequency of new particle formation (NPF) events. In contrast, the campaign-based comparison showed that the occurrence frequency, in which the maximum geometric median diameter of the grown new particles (Dpgmax) was > 50 nm, decreased considerably from 43 % 78 % of the NPF events before 2015 to < 12 % in 2017 2018. Assuming > 50 nm as a CCN threshold size at high supersaturations, the observed net CCN production decreased from 3.7 × 103 cm-3 (on average) in the five campaigns before 2015 to 1.0 × 103 cm-3 (on average) in the two campaigns in 2017 2018. We argue that the increases in the apparent FR and NMINP are mainly determined by the availability of organic precursors that participate in nucleation and initial growth, whereas the decrease in the growth probability is caused by the reduced emissions of anthropogenic precursors. However, large uncertainties still exist because of a lack of data on the chemical composition of these smaller particles. © 2021 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; cloud condensation nucleus; particulate matter; probability; sulfur dioxide; survival; volatile organic compound; China; Shandong; Tai Shan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100222362

Duranti 67, Perugia, 06125, Italy","To fulfill its commitment to carbon emission reduction and peak carbon emission in 2030, China is expected to conduct large-scale carbon capture and storage deployment in future decades, considering the dominant role of coal-based energy for power generation. As an important carbon emission mitigation technology, oxy-fuel combustion will play a significant role in this process. Meanwhile, the water scarcity in China is also worthy of attention, especially in coal-rich areas which are usually water-scarce. The development and implementation of coal-based carbon capture and storage technology may exacerbate the water shortage situation in these regions. Considering this background, a correct analysis of the water use of oxy-fuel combustion power plants is of great importance, before implementing the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage. Therefore, this study aims to assess the life-cycle water consumption of a 600 MW oxy-fuel combustion power plant, retrofitted from a typical 600 MW coal-fired power plant in China. Based on a tiered hybrid method, the direct and indirect water consumption of a typical oxy-combustion CCS project is evaluated. Results show that 4.63 L of water is used for capturing 1 kg of carbon dioxide, while the calculated water intensity for power generation is 3.79 L/kWh. The operation and maintenance processes dominate the total water consumption, in which the cooling mode exerts a great influence on life cycle water consumption. Once-through cooling has lower water consumption than recirculating cooling in the retrofitted oxy-combustion power plant. If we compare water consumption with other power generation technologies, the water intensity of oxy-combustion carbon capture and storage power production is lower than that of bio-power, but beyond that of solar photovoltaic and wind power. Moreover, based on the thermal power production in China in 2017 and the water use calculated in this study, transforming all the thermal power plants to oxy-combustion systems is hardly feasible as the induced water withdrawal will account for 17.26%–827.19% of the total industrial water budget in 2030. Further regional analysis indicates that even to achieve 10 Gt of carbon dioxide abatement, Shanxi province will encounter great difficulties due to reduced water availability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Life cycle assessment; Oxy-fuel combustion; Water availability; Water use","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Coal storage; Cooling; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Life cycle; Regional planning; Solar power generation; Thermoelectric power plants; Water supply; Wind power; Capture and storage technologies; Carbon emission reductions; Coal-fired power plant; Large-scale deployment; Once-through cooling; Operation and maintenance; Power generation technology; Thermal power plants; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092504567

Adaptation strategies can increase farmers’ resilience to climate change in agricultural production. Many studies have explored how farmers adapted to climate change on the underlying premise that they homogeneously have a complete knowledge about climate change adaptation strategies. However, the knowledge of smallholder farmers can be incomplete and heterogeneous particularly under climatic shocks. And the role of social network in farmers’ adaptation decisions cannot be neglected. We specify social network into formal social tie (cooperative membership), and informal social tie (to local farmers and agricultural input retailers). This paper is the first attempt to examine the heterogeneous impact of social ties on farmers’ adaptation decisions, and further assess the effect of adaptation strategies on land productivity under climate change using Augmented Inverse Probability Weights (AIPW) estimator, based on the primary data collected from banana farmers in China. The results show that 55 percent of banana farmers adopted adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change in farming practices. Out of eight coping strategies, diversifying crops, increasing chemical use, increasing irrigation and planting trees were prioritized measures used by banana farmers. Both formal and informal social ties of farmers exerted a significant impact on farmers’ adaptation decisions. Participation in agricultural cooperatives and tie to agricultural input retailers increased farmers’ uptake rate of adaptation strategies. In contrast, tie to local farmers hindered farmers from taking active actions to combat climate change. We also found that the adaptation strategies significantly increased the land productivity of banana farmers. Interestingly, the land productivity of adopters was more influenced by the formal social tie (cooperative membership); while the informal social tie (to agricultural input retailers) affected that of non-adopters. These findings highlight the importance of different social ties of smallholder farmers in designing policy package to increase their responses to climate change and improve land productivity in developing regions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation strategy; Climate change; Land productivity; Smallholder farmers; Social network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116344434

A challenge to this approach is that temperature proxies integrate over the timescales of the fast feedback processes (e.g., changes in water vapor, snow, and clouds) that are captured in ECS as well as the slower feedback processes (e.g., changes in ice sheets and ocean circulation) that are not. A way around this issue is to treat the slow feedbacks as climate forcings and independently account for their impact on global temperature. Here we conduct a suite of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) simulations using the Community Earth System Model version 1.2 (CESM1.2) to quantify the forcing and efficacy of land ice sheets (LISs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) in order to estimate ECS. Our forcing and efficacy quantification adopts the effective radiative forcing (ERF) and adjustment framework and provides a complete accounting for the radiative, topographic, and dynamical impacts of LIS on surface temperatures. ERF and efficacy of LGM LIS are <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula-3.2 W m<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula-2 and 1.1, respectively. The larger-than-unity efficacy is caused by the temperature changes over land and the Northern Hemisphere subtropical oceans which are relatively larger than those in response to a doubling of atmospheric <span classCombining double low line""inline-formulaCO2. The subtropical sea-surface temperature (SST) response is linked to LIS-induced wind changes and feedbacks in ocean-atmosphere coupling and clouds. ERF and efficacy of LGM GHG are <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula-2.8 W m<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula-2 and 0.9, respectively. The lower efficacy is primarily attributed to a smaller cloud feedback at colder temperatures. Our simulations further demonstrate that the direct ECS calculation using the forcing, efficacy, and temperature response in CESM1.2 overestimates the true value in the model by approximately 25 % due to the neglect of slow ocean dynamical feedback. This is supported by the greater cooling (6.8 C) in a fully coupled LGM simulation than that (5.3 C) in a slab ocean model simulation with ocean dynamics disabled. The majority (67 %) of the ocean dynamical feedback is attributed to dynamical changes in the Southern Ocean, where interactions between upper-ocean stratification, heat transport, and sea-ice cover are found to amplify the LGM cooling. Our study demonstrates the value of climate models in the quantification of climate forcings and the ocean dynamical feedback, which is necessary for an accurate direct ECS estimation. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Our result showed that both richness and phylogenetic diversity had almost the same tendency in total woody and herbaceous plants, in which they showed positive relationships with annual precipitation, precipitation annual range of climate, all the three variables of topography, and total nitrogen and total extractable phosphorus of soil, and negative relations with mean annual temperature. Compared with the total and herbaceous plants, the environmental variables explained greater variance both in the standardized effect size phylogenetic diversity and net relatedness index for woody plants.

However, the effectiveness of ecological restoration remains contentious because vegetation restoration is impacted by both climate change and human activities. Climate change is an important factor for vegetation restoration, especially in ecologically vulnerable areas. The Zhangjiakou region of northern China is located in a semiarid and subhumid climate region with apparent ecosystem vulnerability. Since the late 1970s, a series of ecological restoration programmes have been carried out in this area to recover the vegetation and ecosystems. Based on remote sensing images and ground-based meteorological data, two vegetation indexes (NDVI and EVI2) and aridity index were calculated to analyse (i) the vegetation dynamics and climate aridity trends in the Zhangjiakou region and (ii) the response of the vegetation dynamics to ecological restoration programmes and climate change between 1987 and 2017. The results indicated that vegetation cover increased with twice abrupt changes in 2002 and 2009, respectively, which simultaneously underwent an increase in aridity. Vegetation cover has increased rapidly since 2003 because of ecological recovery projects and policies. The contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation cover were12%~ 5.2% and 88% ~ 94.8% during the period 2003–2009, respectively. The contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation cover were2.1% ~ 2.4% and 97.9% ~ 97.6% during the period 2010–2017, respectively.

After testing in several controlled release experiments, the system was deployed in a field campaign in the Eagle Ford basin, TX. We found fat-tail distributions for both methane and total VOC (C4-C12) emissions (e.g., the top 20% sites ranked according to methane and total VOC (C4-C12) emissions were responsible for μ60 and μ80% of total emissions, respectively) and a good correlation between them (Spearman's R = 0.74). This result suggests that emission controls targeting relatively large emitters may help significantly reduce both methane and VOCs in oil and wet gas basins, such as the Eagle Ford. A strong correlation (Spearman's R = 0.84) was found between total VOC (C4-C12) emissions estimated using SUMMA canisters and data reported from a local ambient air monitoring station. This finding suggests that this system has the potential for rapid emission surveillance targeting relatively large emitters, which can help achieve emission reductions for both greenhouse gas (GHG) and air toxics from O&G production well pads in a cost-effective way. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Gas emissions; Methane; Monitoring; Petroleum industry; Volatile organic compounds; Ambient air monitoring; Controlled release; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Mobile measurement systems; Oil and gas production; Strong correlation; Volatile organic compound emission; Greenhouse gases; 1,3 butadiene; delapril plus manidipine; ethane; formaldehyde; hydrocarbon; isobutylene; isoprene; methane; methanol; oil; petroleum derivative; propane; propylene; volatile organic compound; methane; volatile organic compound; emission; experimental study; gas production; ground-based measurement; measurement method; methane; oil production; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollution control; air sampling; ambient air; Article; boiler; cavity ring down spectroscopy; combustion; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; environmental temperature; gas; gas chromatography; greenhouse gas; humidity; plume; pressure; wind speed; air pollutant; cost benefit analysis; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098844805

This study was designed to measure methane emissions from non-associated (i.e., produced without crude oil extraction) natural gas (NG) well pads in California, by applying a novel mobile measurement system combined with a source characterization model. This study surveyed 86 non-associated NG well pads (66 active and 20 idle well pads) in northern California during a two-week field campaign in 2018. The mean emission rate from active non-associated NG well pads was estimated to be 9.5 (95% CI: 6.1–14.6) kg CH4/d. By extrapolating the survey results to the entire state, the annual methane emissions from all active non-associated NG well pads were 3.2 (95% CI: 2.0–5.1) Gg CH4/y, which represents roughly 5% of CH4 emissions from the oil and natural gas production sector in California. The methane emission rates exhibited a fat-tail distribution, with roughly 15% of the active well pads responsible for &gt;85% of the total measured emissions. This result suggests that controlling a small number of large emitters can significantly reduce methane emissions from this sub-sector. Methane emissions were also detected from over 60% of the idle well pads, with a similar fat-tail distribution but much smaller magnitudes than the active well pads. Quick screening tools to identify and fix these unexpected fugitive leaks can offer useful real-world emission reductions. The mobile measurement system was also able to detect emissions from more well pads when compared to the use of an optical gas imaging camera, which suggests that mobile measurement techniques can be an effective screening tool to support leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs. © 2020","Emission factor; Methane emission; Mobile sampling; Natural gas","Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Leak detection; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas wells; Oil field equipment; Particulate emissions; Petroleum industry; Surveys; Crude oil extraction; Leak detection and repair; Methane emission rates; Mobile measurement systems; Oil and natural gas; Oil and natural gas productions; Real-world emission; Source characterization; Natural gas well production; methane; natural gas; petroleum; crude oil; emission; gas production; gas well; methane; natural gas; sampling; air sampling; Article; California; carbon footprint; extraction; fluorescence imaging; limit of detection; measurement; meteorology; methanogenesis; plume; priority journal; screening; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091594634

Charge transfer from Co to ceria occurs upon deposition of Co on CeO1.96 and partially reduced CeO1.83 at 300 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies show that Co is oxidized to Co2+ species at the cost of the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, at a lesser extent on reduced ceria. Co2+ is the predominant species on CeO1.96 at low Co coverages (e.g., ≤0.20 ML). The ratio of metallic Co/Co2+ increases with the increase in the Co coverage. However, both metallic Co and Co2+ species are present on CeO1.83 even at low Co coverages with metallic Co as the major species. Scanning tunneling microscopy results demonstrate that Co tends to wet the CeO1.96 surface at very low Co coverages at room temperature forming one-atomic layer high structures of Co-O-Ce. The increase in the Co coverage can cause the particle growth into three-dimensional structures. The formation of slightly flatter Co particles was observed on reduced CeO1.83. In comparison with other transition metals including Ni, Rh, Pt, and Au, our studies demonstrate that Co on ceria exhibits a smaller particle size and higher thermal stability, likely arising from strong metal-support interactions. The formed particles upon Co deposition at 300 K are present on the ceria surface after heating to 1000 K. The Co-ceria interface can be tuned by varying the Co metal coverage, the annealing temperature, and the nature of the ceria surface. © 2021 U.S. Government.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cerium oxide; Charge transfer; Cobalt; Particle size; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Sintering; Thin films; Vapor deposition; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Annealing temperatures; Chemical state; Metal coverages; Particle growth; Strong metal support interaction; Three-dimensional structure; Ultrahigh vacuum conditions; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies; Cobalt metallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100199565

An effective solution to this problem is urgently needed to achieve the energy conservation and emission reduction goals, as well as a sustainable growth of China's economy. However, under China's existing political promotion system, there exists a market segmentation that hinders cooperation between regions. In the short term, market segmentation is conducive to the utilization of installed capacity in each place; however, in the long run, can market segmentation alleviate the over-capacity problem in the thermal electricity generation industry across China? Using the China Industrial Enterprise Database (CIED) from 2002 to 2013, this paper estimates the capacity utilization rate, an indicator of over-capacity, of China's thermal electricity generation firms through stochastic frontier analysis. Then, by applying the fuel and electricity price index, this paper measures the degree of market segmentation at three levels, (i) among all provinces, (ii) between neighboring provinces and (iii) among provinces covered by the same grid company. Based on these, this paper empirically estimates the impacts of market segmentation on the utilization rate of China's thermal electricity generation firms. The results indicate that market segmentation has significantly negative impacts on the capacity utilization rates. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that private firms, firms in regions with abundant coal resources and those in the western regions are affected to a larger degree. The results remain robust in the robustness check that replaces the data with the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) Database, the counterfactual test and the test that concerns endogeneity. These findings provide important policy implications for the solution of the over-capacity problem in China's electricity generation industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity utilization rate; Market segmentation; Over-capacity; Thermal electricity generation industry","carbon dioxide; economic growth; electricity generation; emission control; energy market; market system; national economy; segmentation; stochasticity; article; China; electricity; sensitivity analysis; stochastic model; China; family size; industry; China; Indicator indicator; coal; China; Coal; Electricity; Family Characteristics; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097752458

However, the fast gravity flow of wastewater on the smooth surface of substrate in unsaturated zone led to a short contact time between wastewater and biofilm on the surface of substrate for the microbial pollutant oxidation process. While, the strengthened oxygen supplement also consumed organic carbon, intensifying the shortage of electron donator for the denitrification process. To further enhance the efficiency of both nitrification and denitrification processes, two strategies were conducted as follows: (1) adding microfiber in unsaturated zone to extend the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and improve the oxygenating efficiency; (2) adding slow-release carbon source (Poly butylenes succinate, PBS) as electron donor in saturated zone for denitrification. Results showed that the ammonia oxidation efficiency reached up to 97.0% in the microfiber-enhanced constructed wetland. Additionally, adding microfiber provided more sites for microbes and increased the total number of microbes in unsaturated zone. The addition of PBS in the saturated zone obviously improved the denitrification efficiency with the total nitrogen (TN) removal rate raising from 20.6 ± 4.0% to 90.4 ± 2.7%, which excellently solved the problem of poor denitrification efficiency caused by low ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N).

In this study, four Chinese metropoles (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) were selected to investigate integral carbon emissions at three scales (city, national, and global) by combining ecological network analysis with input-output analysis. The complex structures and relationships of carbon emission flows in 2010 due to interregional and international trade could be further evaluated. The results showed that, within the metropoles themselves, because of adjustments to the industrial structure and the promotion of tertiary industry, more than 11% of integral carbon emissions input in Beijing and Shanghai derived from the services and construction sectors. At the national scale, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai were the net recipients of carbon emissions, mainly from the northwestern, central, and northern regions, owing to geographic proximity. The integral flow from the northwest region to Shanghai was the highest (22.37 Mt CO2e). At the global scale, carbon emission flows exported from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai were higher than in Chongqing, as the three metropoles are located near harbors. Shanghai's integral export value was the highest at over 31 Mt CO2e. This analysis aims to provide a scientific foundation for appropriate decarbonization actions, which can help policy makers allocate emission-reduction targets for metropoles and regions. On the one hand, policy makers can mitigate carbon emissions from an integral perspective; on the other, at the city and regional scales, they can guide metropoles or regions to reduce emissions based on their own development status. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Chinese metropoles; Ecological network analysis; Flow analysis; Multiscale; Utility analysis","Construction industry; Decision making; Emission control; International trade; Service industry; Carbon emission flows; Carbon emission reductions; Construction sectors; Ecological network analysis; Emission reduction targets; Industrial structures; Input output analysis; Scientific foundations; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089661162

By extending subsystem analysis from UCEs to DCEs, this study investigates the formation mechanism of sectoral emission responsibilities in both directions. The approach is illustrated through the case of Zhejiang Province from 2002 to 2012. Moreover, multi-temporal structural path analysis is applied to identify the crucial UCE and DCE transmission paths and the perturbation factors for path regulation priorities. The results show that: (1) sectoral emission responsibilities exhibit significant disparities from the entire production chain perspective, and Mining (MS2), Electricity, Steam, Gas and Water Production and Supply (MS18), and Other Services (MS24) are the primary emission sources. (2) The spillover effect plays the dominant role in the formation of UCEs and DCEs.

However, the insufficient bioavailability of petroleum in crude oil-contaminated soil limits its application in contaminated soil. Biosurfactant could improve the remediation efficiency of contaminated soil by improving the bioavailability of petroleum in crude oil-contaminated soil. The combination of rhamnolipid and biochar was used to improve the bioremediation efficiency in bioremediation of oil-contaminated soil. Materials and methods: Here, three types of biomass were applied to produce biochar including rice husk (BC), sewage sludge (SC), and petroleum coke (PC). Rhamnolipid was used to modify biochar for assessing their effect in bioremediation of oil-contaminated soil. The rhamnolipid-modified biochar was added to oil-contaminated soil with loading rate of 2% (wt/wt) for a 3-month experiment. Soil properties, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and microbial community compositions were characterized. Results and discussion: The application of rhamnolipid-modified biochar exhibited better performance regarding the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, diversity, and abundance of microbial communities and degradation of n-alkanes and PAHs than pristine biochar. Besides, the application of biochar played an important role in the bioavailability of indigenous microbial communities for biodegrading of short-chain hydrocarbon. Meanwhile, the biochar amendments increased the emission of CO2 and CH4, while reduced the emission of N2O. Conclusion: The application of rhamnolipid-modified biochar could improve the diversity and abundance of microbial communities and then promote the degradation of n-alkanes and PAHs, providing an effective approach for bioremediation of crude oil-contaminated soil.

However, the relationship between the intestinal flora and chemotherapy outcomes remains unclear and was investigated in this study. Methods: We analyzed baseline stool samples from patients with locally advanced and advanced lung cancer before chemotherapy treatment, through metagenomics of the gut microbiota. The composition, diversity, function, and metabolic pathway analysis were compared among patients with different clinical outcomes. Results: From 64 patients, 33 responded to treatment (responders) and 31 did not (nonresponders). Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus casseliflavus were enriched in responders (P < 0.05), while 11 bacteria including Leuconostoc lactis and Eubacterium siraeum were enriched in nonresponders (P < 0.05) by variance analysis. Responders were associated with significantly higher Acidobacteria and Granulicella, while Streptococcus oligofermentans, Megasphaera micronuciformis, and Eubacterium siraeum were more abundant in nonresponders by Lefse analysis. Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus casseliflavus were further identified as bacterial markers relevant to responders using unsupervised clustering, and Leuconostoc lactis and Eubacterium siraeum were related to nonresponders. The L-glutamate degradation VIII pathway was enriched in responders (P = 0.014), and the C4 photosynthetic carbon assimilation cycle, reductive TCA cycle I, and hexitol fermentation to lactate, formate, ethanol, and acetate were enriched in nonresponders (P < 0.05). Additionally, significant associations of bacterial species with clinical phenotypes were observed by Spearman correlation analysis. Conclusions: The specific gut microbiome of patients with lung cancer might be connected to the clinical outcomes of chemotherapy. Key points: Significant findings of the study Lung cancer patients with different gut microbiome compositions and microbiome metabolic pathways have different responses to chemotherapy. Microbiome species are also associated with different lung cancer clinical phenotypes. What this study adds We have identified specific gut microbiome species that can be used as relevant biomarkers for chemotherapy outcomes. This can potentially be used to guide clinical treatment decisions. © 2020 The Authors.

The suitability of farmland abandonment as the wetland restoration has not been well studied in arid regions. The plant growth, community structure and soil property were examined in three farmlands abandoned for 2 (W2), 6 (W6) and 15 (W15) years and reference wetland (Wr) in the Zhangye National Wetland Park in Gansu province. The results showed that the plant abundance, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil water content increased and pH value decreased along the wetland restoration stages. Shannon-Wiener diversity and Pielou’s evenness index moved towards natural wetland with increasing time of farmland abandonment, the plant community composition of the three abandoned farmlands also changed from annual to perennial dominant species. The farmland abandonment is conducive to improve soil nutrients and quality. Soil and vegetation facilitated one another in the abandonment stages. Thus, farmland abandonment is rational for wetland restoration. The mechanism of interaction between plant and soil can be used to guide wetland restoration of abandoned farmland. © 2021, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Abandoned farmland; Soil nutrient; Soil quality; Vegetation; Wetland restoration","arid region; geodiversity; national park; plant community; restoration ecology; river basin; soil nutrient; soil property; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; species evenness; wetland; China; Gansu; Zhangye",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100580227

The promising solution for reducing air pollution in cities is commonly regarded as electric vehicles, which helps to optimize the environment management more effectively, as a key to future low carbon mobility. However, their environmental benefits rely on the temporal and spatial sense of real use, and challenges such as limited range complicated for the rollout of an Electric Vehicle (EVs). This paper investigates the environmental carbon pollution in cities and control preventions using Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). Further, the Artificial intelligence model has been introduced, which defines optimal automobile designs and the assignment of vehicles to drivers across a variety of scenarios, including minimum net life cycle expense, GHG emissions, and oil usage for effective environmental management. By designing overspent vehicle power for corresponding output, weight, and cost impact, the life cycle costs and the emission of GHG are reduced utilizing high battery swinging and replacing batteries as needed. Moreover, energy consumption (EC) and pollution have been greatly influenced by the use of energy sources in the environment. The significant energy consumption and pollution variables resulted in a large proportion of coal-fired energy. The results show that the PHEV can achieve better fuel economy by combining the proposed model with an allowable deviation from the state of the charge. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emission control; Electric vehicles; Environment pollution; Environmental management; New technology","Artificial intelligence; Carbon; Charging (batteries); Coal industry; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Plug-in electric vehicles; Pollution control; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environment management; Environmental benefits; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Technological innovation; Temporal and spatial; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Plug-in hybrid vehicles; atmospheric pollution; coal-fired power plant; cost analysis; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; innovation; life cycle analysis; pollution control; technological development; transportation infrastructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093956706

Using industrial pollution panel data from 350 prefectures in China and difference-in-differences models, we estimate causal effects of the DEPPP on the coal-fired power plants. We find that the DEPPP provided the coal-fired power plants strong incentives to invest in capital-intensive flue gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment and to operate the installed FGD at a higher rate, and thus contributed to significant reductions in total SO2 emissions in China. Our results suggest that the DEPPP reduced uncertainty faced by the coal-fired power plants when making large capital investments in SO2 abatement techniques such as FGD to comply with stringent environmental regulations. However, the DEPPP may not be cost-effective in reducing SO2 emissions given heterogeneous marginal costs for operating FGD units in different coal-fired power plants. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the DEPPP also depends on strengthened environmental regulatory capacities to enforce coal-fired power plants to comply with the operating rate requirement for the installed FGD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China SO2 control policies; Desulfurated electricity pricing premium program; Difference-in-differences; Environmental regulations; Investment decisions","Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric power plant equipment; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Investments; Mining; Power markets; Sulfur dioxide; Capital investment; Coal-fired power plant; Difference-in-differences models; Electricity pricing; Flue gas desulfurization(FGD); Industrial pollution; Operating rates; Sulfur dioxide emissions; Fossil fuel power plants; coal-fired power plant; electricity generation; emission control; emission inventory; industrial emission; industrial investment; pollution policy; regulatory framework; sulfur dioxide; uncertainty analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094964675

Except for a site inside a tunnel, NH3 concentrations did not increase significantly after the lockdown had ended compared to those during the lockdown, while ?15N-NH3(measured) increased by 2.1-9.9‰.

The emission factors (EFs) of the total PAH were in the range of 84.5–344 mg/kg for biomass burning, with lower EFs for biomass with higher densities, and in the range of 38.0–206 mg/kg for coal combustion, with lower EFs for coals with higher maturity. Moreover, EFs were lower from high-density biomass fuels (wood trunk, 84.5 ± 11.3 mg/kg) than low-maturity coals (bituminous coal, 206 ± 16.5 mg/kg). Parent, oxygenated, alkylated, and nitrated PAHs accounted for 81.1%, 12.6%, 6.2%, and 0.1%, respectively, of the total-PAH EFs from biomass burning, and 84.7%, 13.8%, 1.4%, and 0.1%, respectively, of the total-PAH EFs from coal combustion. PAH source profiles differed negligibly between biomass fuels but differed significantly between bituminous coal and anthracite coal fuels. The characteristic species of sources were phenanthrene, 9-fluorenone, and 2-nitrobiphenyl for biomass burning, and were phenanthrene, benzo[ghi]perylene, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and 2-nitrobiphenyl for coal combustion. The ratios of benzo[b]fluoranthene/(benzo[b]fluoranthene + benzo[k]fluoranthene) were 0.40–0.45 for biomass burning and 0.89–0.91 for coal combustion, and these significantly different values constitute unique markers for distinguishing these fuels in source apportionment. Benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent factor emissions were 2.79–11.3 mg/kg for biomass and 7.49–41.9 mg/kg for coal, where parent PAHs contributed 92.0%–95.1% from biomass burning and 98.6%–98.8% from coal combustion. Total-PAH emissions from residential heating were 1552 t across Shaanxi province, to which wheat straw (445 t) in biomass burning and bituminous coal (438 t) in coal combustion were the highest contributors. Results from this study provide crucial knowledge for the source identification of PAHs as well as for the design of abatement strategies against pollutant emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent factor emissions; Field experiments; PAHs emissions; Rural heating; Source profiles","Anthracene; Anthracite; Biomass; Bituminous coal; Fuels; Housing; Mineral oils; Smoke; Wood fuels; 1 ,4-Naphthoquinone; Crucial knowledge; Nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Pollutant emission; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Residential heating; Source apportionment; Source identification; Coal combustion; 1 methylnaphthalene; 1 nitropyrene; 1,4 naphthoquinone; 1,6 dinitropyrene; 1,8 naphthalic anhydride; 2 methylnaphthalene; 2 nitrobiphenyl; 2,6 dimethylnaphthalene; 2,7 dinitrofluorene; 9 fluorenone; acenaphthylene; acid anhydride; alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthraquinone; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; biphenyl; chrysene; coal; fluoranthene; fluorene; fluorenone derivative; naphthalene; nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; nitropyrene; oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; unclassified drug; coal; nitric acid derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; biomass burning; coal combustion; database; emission; experiment; heating; PAH; particulate matter; smoke; source identification; Article; biomass; burn; combustion; controlled study; density; emission factor; environmental aspects and related phenomena; maize; particulate matter; air pollutant; biomass; China; environmental monitoring; heating; particulate matter; China; Shaanxi; Triticum aestivum; Air Pollutants; Biomass; China; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Nitrates; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093671187

It is difficult to accurately measure the absorption cross sections of carbon disulfide because carbon disulfide will be easily converted into carbon sulfide when it is exposed to ultraviolet light. In this study, the absorption cross sections of carbon disulfide were measured by reducing carbon disulfide conversion. The factors affecting carbon disulfide conversion, including gas flow rate, ultraviolet light intensity, and duration of illumination, were studied to reduce the conversion of carbon disulfide by controlling experimental conditions in the experiment. Finally, the absorption cross sections of carbon disulfide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure were calculated using the absorption spectrum and the carbon disulfide concentration in the absence of carbon disulfide conversion. The wavelengths of 16 absorption peaks on the carbon disulfide absorption cross sections of the vibration change were marked. Carbon disulfide has the maximum absorption cross section of 4.5 × 10–16 cm2/molecule at a wavelength of 198.10 nm. © The Author(s) 2020.","absorption cross-sections; carbon disulfide; Carbon sulfide; ultraviolet light; UV","Absorption spectroscopy; Atmospheric pressure; Flow of gases; Ultraviolet radiation; Absorption cross sections; Absorption peaks; Carbon sulfide; Experimental conditions; Strong absorptions; Ultra-violet light; Ultraviolet light intensity; Wavelength ranges; Carbon disulfide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092129042

A series of strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China, contributing to the improvement of air quality. In this study, we described the trend of air pollutant concentrations and the incidence of COVID-19 during the epidemic and applied generalized additive models (GAMs) to assess the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 235 Chinese cities. Disease progression based on both onset and report dates as well as control measures as potential confounding were considered in the analyses. We found that stringent prevention and control measures intending to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, contributed to a significant decline in the concentrations of air pollutants except ozone (O3). Significant positive associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter with diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), particulate matter with diameters ≤10 μm (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with daily new confirmed cases were observed during the epidemic. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 (lag0-15), PM10 (lag0-15), and NO2 (lag0-20) were associated with a 7% [95% confidence interval (CI): (4–9)], 6% [95% CI: (3–8)], and 19% [95% CI: (13–24)] increase in the counts of daily onset cases, respectively. Our results suggest that there is a statistically significant association between ambient air pollution and the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the quarantine measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the spread by improving ambient air quality, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Short-term exposure to air pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, may contribute to an increase in the counts of daily onset cases. Stringent prevention and control measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the virus spread by reducing air pollution, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; China; COVID-19; Quarantine; Short-term exposure; Time series","Air quality; Disease control; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Transmissions; Viruses; Air pollutant concentrations; Ambient air pollution; Ambient air quality; Generalized additive model; Global public health; Inter quartile ranges; Prevention and controls; Short-term exposure; Air pollution control; carbon oxide; nitrogen dioxide; oxide; ozone; sulfur oxide; unclassified drug; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; particulate matter; time series analysis; viral disease; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; China; concentration (parameter); confounding variable; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease course; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; epidemic; human; incidence; major clinical study; particulate matter; quarantine; wind speed; air pollutant; city; Coronavirinae; epidemiology; quarantine; China; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemics; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094140084

The health effects of PM2.5 vary location by location due to the variation in size distribution, chemical composition, and sources. In this study, the cytotoxicity effect, oxidative stress, and gene expression regulation of PM2.5 in Chengdu and Chongqing, two typical urban areas in southern China, were evaluated. Urban PM2.5 in summer and winter significantly inhibited cell viability and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in A549 cells. Notably, PM2.5 in winter exhibited higher cytotoxicity and ROS level than summer. Moreover, in this study, PM2.5 commonly induced cancer-related gene expression such as cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1), interleukin 24 (IL24), and cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1); meanwhile, PM2.5 commonly acted on cancer-related biological functions such as cell-substrate junction, cell-cell junction, and focal adhesion. In particular, PM2.5 in Chengdu in summer had the highest carcinogenic potential among PM2.5 at the two sites in summer and winter. Importantly, cancer-related genes were uniquely targeted by PM2.5, such as epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) and membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 1 (1-Mar) by Chengdu summer PM2.5; collagen type IX alpha 3 chain (COL9A3) by Chengdu winter PM2.5; SH2 domain-containing 1B (SH2D1B) by Chongqing summer PM2.5; and interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) and zinc finger protein 42 (ZNF423) by Chongqing winter PM2.5. Meanwhile, important cancer-related biological functions were specially induced by PM2.5, such as cell cycle checkpoint by Chengdu summer PM2.5; macromolecule methylation by Chengdu winter PM2.5; endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane by Chongqing summer PM2.5; and cellular lipid catabolic process by Chongqing winter PM2.5. Conclusively, in the typical urban areas of southern China, both summer and winter PM2.5 illustrated significant gene regulation effects. This study contributes to evaluating the adverse health effects of PM2.5 in southern China and providing public health suggestions for policymakers. © 2020","Biotoxic; Chengdu; Chongqing; PM2.5; Southwestern China; Transcriptome","Alkylation; Biological systems; Cell adhesion; Cell membranes; Diseases; Gene expression; Health risks; Proteins; Adverse health effects; Atmospheric fine particulate matter; Biological functions; Carcinogenic potential; Cell adhesion molecules; Chemical compositions; Cytotoxicity effects; Endoplasmic reticulum; Gene expression regulation; cell adhesion molecule 1; collagen type 9; cytochrome P450 1A1; interleukin 1 receptor type I; interleukin 24; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP; reactive oxygen metabolite; zinc finger protein; SH2D1B protein, human; transcription factor; gene expression; haze; health impact; particulate matter; protein; public health; reactive oxygen species; toxicity; urban area; A-549 cell line; Article; cell cycle checkpoint; cell junction; cell viability; China; controlled study; cytotoxicity; focal adhesion; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene targeting; human; human cell; lipolysis; macromolecule; oxidative stress; particulate matter; priority journal; protein methylation; summer; urban area; winter; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; gene expression regulation; particulate matter; season; toxicity; Chengdu; China; Chongqing; Sichuan; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090594243

Farming practices like ridge-furrow planting with plastic film mulching (RFFM) can effectively improve crop yield and crop water productivity (WP) by enhancing soil moisture and temperature availability. This meta-analysis study collected and analyzed the data of 964 observations published in 90 peer-reviewed papers to investigate the effects of various farming practices, i.e., RFFM, ridge-furrow planting without film mulching (RF) and flat planting with film mulching (FM) in comparison with conventional flat planting without film mulching (F), on yield and WP of three major crops (wheat, maize and potato) in China, in terms of planting region, climatic condition, altitude, soil type and seeding method. The results showed that RFFM, RF and FM improved mean crop yields by 33.8 %, 16.6 % and 27.0 %, and increased mean WP of crops by 35.8 %, 17.5 % and 27.8 % compared with F, respectively. Increases in crop yields under RFFM, RF and FM were greater in regions with seasonal rainfall <400 mm than in regions with seasonal rainfall>400 mm. RFFM, RF and FM performed better in Northwest China than in North-central and other regions of China. Among the three crops, potato obtained the greatest increases in yield and WP under ridge-furrow planting or film mulching. For clay soils and high altitude regions, the two film mulching practices (FM and RFFM) attained greater yield increases. With regards to the two ridge-furrow practices (RFFM and RF), it is better to plant crops in the furrow than on the ridge. In short, RFFM was most effective to improve yield and WP of wheat, maize and potato among the farming practices. These findings have important implications for choosing appropriate field management practices to improve crop yield and crop water productivity in China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop water productivity; Farming practices; Film mulching; Meta-analysis; Ridge-furrow planting; Yield","Clay; Crops; Frequency modulation; Plastics industry; Productivity; Rain; Soil moisture; Water resources; Altitude regions; Climatic conditions; Crop water productivity; Farming practices; Field management; NorthWest China; Plastic film mulching; Seasonal rainfall; Seed; clay soil; crop improvement; crop production; crop yield; farming system; film; maize; meta-analysis; mulching; potato; wheat; China; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090361031

Moreover, 4% of China's total cement share is contributed by Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ). In this study, we developed and used an integrated nexus framework that involves multiple tools to quantify the potential for energy efficiency improvements, for CO2 and air pollutant emission reduction, and for public health benefits in relation to air pollution of the JJJ's cement industry at different scales from 2010 to 2030. Results show that the overall cost-effective energy efficiency measure implemented for energy efficiency improvement under the economic potential scenario could result in 21% energy savings, 8% reduction in CO2 emissions, 13% reduction in air pollution, 0.5 μg/m3 reduction in average annual PM2.5 concentration, and in avoidance of morbidity in 17,000 individuals in the JJJ region. Under the technical potential scenario, the implementation of all the best available technologies for energy efficiency improvement would result in 23% energy savings and in reduction in CO2 emission by 5%, in air pollution by 16%, in PM2.5 by 0.2 μg/m3, and in morbidity by 58%. At the prefecture level, the cities of Tangshan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang were the top three contributors to the potential for energy saving and to the mitigation of CO2 emissions and air pollution, whereas Beijing and Tianjin demonstrated a limited potential. Overall, the direct energy-saving benefits could be 15–47% lower than the cost of the energy efficiency measures in both scenarios, but the full benefits (i.e., energy savings benefit, CO2 reduction benefits, and health benefits) would be 1.3–3.6 times higher than the total costs during the study period. We recommend the design and implementation of an integrated policy (integrating carbon, air quality, and health elements into energy efficiency), which would create more opportunities to address multiple challenges in a cost-effective manner, for instance by increasing energy efficiency, cleaning the air, and extending human life. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cement industry; Emissions; Energy efficiency; Health effects; Jing-jin-ji; Nexus assessment","Air cleaners; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Diseases; Emission control; Energy utilization; Air pollutant emission; Best available technologies; Design and implementations; Economic potentials; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy-saving benefits; PM2.5 concentration; Total energy consumption; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089935725

Therefore, based on the theory of green supply chain, this research constructs a dynamic multi-objective model under the uncertain decision-making environment with the realization of the equilibrium of the total economic cost and carbon emission of electric-coal supply chain as the decision goal, and taking the coal supply capacity and and other practical requirements as the constraints. The following equilibrium model is applied to a electric-coal supply chain in the southwestern region of Y Province. With full consideration of different carbon emission reduction scenarios, the total economic cost and carbon emission balance plan of electric-coal supply chain under five different emission reduction scenarios were obtained, which verified the practicability and effectiveness of the equilibrium model. The results show that the equilibrium model can effectively alleviate the conflict between the economic cost and carbon emission reduction.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of PAH emission as a SFR indicator on subkiloparsec scales by studying the Spitzer/IRS mapping-mode observations of the nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M51. We present a new approach of analyzing the spatial elements of the spectral data cube that simultaneously maximizes spatial resolution and spatial coverage, while yielding reliable measurements of the total, integrated 5-20 μm PAH emission. We devise a strategy of extracting robust PAH emission using spectra with only partial spectral coverage, complementing missing spectral regions with properly combined mid-infrared photometry. We find that in M51 the PAH emission correlates tightly with the extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet, near-ultraviolet, and Hα emission, from scales of ∼0.4 kpc close to the nucleus to 6 kpc out in the disk of the galaxy, indicating that PAH serves as an excellent tracer of SFR over a wide range of galactic environments. But regional differences exist. Close to the active nucleus of M51 the 6.2 μm feature is weaker, and the overall level of PAH emission is suppressed. The spiral arms and the central star-forming region of the galaxy emit stronger 7.7 and 8.6 μm PAH features than the inter-arm regions. © 2020. The American Astronomical Society.

It is found that there is a diversified competitive behavior in the enforcement of environmental regulation among local governments in China. And the diversified competitive behavior results in the nearby transfer of pollution, which increases local CO2 emissions. In addition, there is an inverted ""U"" curve between environmental regulation and CO2 emissions, and China is still in the ""green paradox"" stage. Furthermore, it is found that the environmental regulation mainly affects CO2 emissions through industrial structure and technological progress. Also, there are differences in the spatial spillover effect of environmental regulation due to the existence of regional heterogeneity, and its impact on CO2 is particularly significant in the western region.

Multiple elements work jointly in plant physiology. Although a large number of studies have focused on the variation and allocation of multiple elements in plants, it remains unclear how these elements co-vary to adapt to environmental change. We proposed a novel concept of the multi-element network including the mutual effects between element concentrations to more effectively explore the alterations in response to long-term nitrogen (N) deposition. Leaf multi-element networks were constructed with 18 elements (i.e., six macronutrients, six micronutrients, and six trace elements) in this study. Multi-element networks were species-specific, being effectively discriminated irrespective of N deposition level. Different sensitive elements and interactions to N addition were found in different species, mainly concentrating on N, Ca, Mg, Mn, Li, Sr, Ba, and their related stoichiometry. Interestingly, high plasticity of multi-element network increased or maintained relative aboveground biomass (species dominance) in community under simulated N deposition, which developed the multi-element network hypothesis. In summary, multi-element networks provide a novel approach for exploring the adaptation strategies of plants and to better predict the change of species dominance under altering nutrient availability or environmental stress associated with future global climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Ren, Yang, Xu, Li, Zhang, Han and He.","climate change; co-vary; nitrogen addition; plasticity; species dominance; steppe",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100446717

This paper takes carbon emissions as the unexpected output and energy consumption as the input factor into the traditional output density model. The dynamic spatial panel Durbin model is used to analyze the mechanism for innovation agglomeration and energy intensity to affect carbon emissions from 2004 to 2017 in thirty Chinese provinces. Then, we test the possible mediating effect of energy intensity between innovation agglomeration and carbon emissions. The major findings are as follows. (1) The carbon emission intensity has time-dependence and positive spatial spillover effect. That is, there is a close correlation between current and early carbon emissions, and there is also a high-degree correlation between regional and surrounding areas’ carbon emissions. (2) Carbon emissions keep a classical inverted U-shaped relation with innovation agglomeration, as well as with energy intensity. However, the impact of innovation agglomeration on carbon emissions in inland regions of China does not appear on the right side of the inverted U-shaped curve, while carbon emissions are subject to a positive nonlinear promoting effect from energy intensity. (3) When the logarithm of innovation agglomeration is more than 3.0309, it first shows the inhibition effect on energy intensity. With the logarithm of innovation agglomeration exceeding 5.0100, it will show the dual effect of emission reduction and energy conservation. (4) Energy intensity could work as the intermediary variable of innovation agglomeration’s influence on carbon emissions. Through its various positive externalities, innovation agglomeration can produce a direct impact on carbon emissions, and through energy intensity, it can also affect carbon emissions indirectly. © 2021 by the authors.

The results of this study revealed that sustainable extensive green roof was realizable without irrigation in Beijing. In terms of plant adaptive strategies, the most successful plants in this study were the stress-tolerant species, followed by the ruderal species. While deeper substrate could facilitate the survival and performance of plants, substrate moisture content was more significant for the survival of plants in the dry and cold winter in Beijing.

Data from conventional meteorological observations, air quality monitoring, reanalysis and numerical models are used. The results show that before the two precipitation processes in 2015 and 2016, the circulations in the middle and high latitudes of Asia and Europe demonstrate “two troughs and one ridge”. Besides, the weather is stable and the pollutant concentration is relatively high. During the precipitation, the circulation is relatively stable for the episode in 2015, and no obvious change in the synoptic system is observed. However, during the episode in 2016, the formation of blocking high and the enhancement of the average ridge in western Asia cause obvious change in the circulation. The simulation results show that significant removal can be detected in both cases, and the PM2.5 wet deposition fluxes are 647 g/ha and 486 g/ha, respectively, with the removal in 2015 slightly stronger than that in 2016. The removal and dissipation of pollutants is determined by the atmospheric diffusion conditions and the precipitation, especially in the former episode. In the case of February 2016, good diffusion conditions and the precipitation demonstrate obvious PM2.5 removal effect. In the case of February 2015, the longstanding calm wind with high humidity and the physical quantity configuration in the lower mixed layer lead to the poor pollutant removal. © 2021 The Authors","Atmospheric diffusion conditions; PM2.5; Static and stable; Wet removal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113910580

This study proposes an evaluation framework and analyzes three sets of experiments conducted using a seasonal prediction model developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). These experiments apply the nudging technique to the model integration and/or initialization to estimate possible improvements from nearly perfect model conditions. The results suggest that reducing sea surface temperature (SST) errors remains important for better predicting TC activity at long forecast leads-even in a flux-adjusted model with reduced climatological biases. Other error sources also contribute to biases in simulated TC activity, with notable manifestations on regional scales. A novel finding is that the coupling and initialization of the land and atmosphere components can affect seasonal TC prediction skill. Simulated year-to-year variations in June land conditions over North America show a significant lead correlation with the North Atlantic large-scale environment and TC activity. Improved land-atmosphere initialization appears to improve the Atlantic TC predictions initialized in some summer months. For short-lead predictions initialized in June, the potential skill improvements attributable to land-atmosphere initialization might be comparable to those achievable with perfect SST predictions. Overall, this study delineates the SST and non-oceanic error sources in predicting TC activity and highlights avenues for improving predictions. The nudging-based evaluation framework can be applied to other models and help improve predictions of other weather extremes. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

The structures of AlnC5−/0(n= 1-5) were explored by theoretical calculations. It is found that the structures of AlC5−/0and Al2C5−/0are linear while those of Al3C5−/0, Al4C5−/0, and Al5C5−/0are two-dimensional. The most stable structures of AlC5−/0and Al2C5−/0are linear with the Al atoms attached to the ends of C5chain. The most stable structures of Al3C5−/0can be viewed as three Al atoms interacting with a nonlinear C5chain. The most stable structure of Al4C5−anion is a planar structure composed of a C2unit, a C3unit, and two Al2units, while that of the neutral Al4C5cluster has four Al atoms connected to different positions of a distorted C5chain. The global minimum structures of Al5C5−/0are planar structures composed of an Al4C quadrilateral, two C2groups, and an Al atom connected to two C2groups. Planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) has been identified in the structures of both anionic and neutral Al5C5. It is worth mentioning that the star-like structure of Al5C5−is slightly higher in energy than the ground state structure. The comparison of theoretical calculations with the experimental spectra indicates the star-like structure of Al5C5−may also appear in our experiments. © the Owner Societies 2021.",,"Atoms; Carbon; Ground state; Isomers; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Photons; Stars; Anion photoelectron spectroscopy; Experimental spectra; Global minimum structure; Ground-state structures; Planar tetracoordinate carbons; Relative stabilities; Structural evolution; Theoretical calculations; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100265054

However, fluxes, distributions, and physi-chemical compositions of regional N deposition and the response of N deposition levels to N emissions remain poorly characterized, particularly in high N-emission regions. To explore these issues, this study collated observations on N deposition fluxes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of northern China. We found that total inorganic N (TIN) deposition in the study region averaged 61.3 ± 13 kg-N/ha/yr based on observations from 1998 to 2017. Respectively, about 97%, 73%, 20%, 32%, and 59% of farmland, constructed land, forest, grassland, and water areas had TIN deposition above 50 kg-N/ha/yr. These results indicated substantial ecological risks of atmospheric N loading to these ecosystems. Dry deposition accounted for 59% of TIN deposition and gaseous N accounted for 73% in dry IN deposition. In gaseous N deposition, ammonia, N dioxides, and nitric acid accounted for 42%, 47%, and 11%, respectively. Ratios of NH3-N (N in ammonia) to (NO2-N + HNO3-N) (N in N dioxides, nitric acid) or NH4-N (N in ammonium) to NO3-N (N in nitrate) averaged 0.8, 2.0, 1.0, 1.9, and 1.3 in gaseous, particulate, dry, wet, and total deposition fluxes, respectively. These indicated different transformation and deposition mechanisms between NH4-N and NO3-N under high emissions. Moreover, we found a non-linear relationship between TIN deposition and anthropogenic IN emissions. All these results provide a systematic assessment of the N deposition and its responses to human activities in a high N-emission region, which is valuable for emission mitigation and effect evaluation of regional N pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Critical load; Land use; Nitrogen emissions; Terrestrial ecosystems","Ammonia; Atmospheric chemistry; Ecology; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Chemical compositions; Deposition fluxes; Deposition mechanism; Emission mitigation; Non-linear relationships; Systematic assessment; Nitric acid; anthropogenic source; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; global perspective; nitrogen; physicochemical property; policy approach; pollution policy; risk assessment; China; Jingjinji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088877947

Previous flood risk assessments can barely take into account future changes of fine-scale hydroclimatic characteristics and hardly quantify multivariate interactions among flood variables, thereby resulting in an unreliable assessment of flood risk. In this study, for the first time, we develop probabilistic projections of multidimensional river flood risks at a convection-permitting scale through the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate simulations with 4-km horizontal grid spacing. Vine copula has been widely used to assess the multidimensional dependence structure of hydroclimate variables, but the commonly used frequentist approach may fail to identify the correct vine model and to obtain the uncertainty interval. Thus, a Bayesian vine copula approach is proposed to explicitly address the multidimensional dependence of flood characteristics (i.e., flood peak, volume, and duration) and underlying uncertainties. The proposed approach enables a robust assessment of return periods of future floods for Guadalupe and Mission river basins located in South Texas of the United States. Our findings reveal that the South Texas region is projected to experience more flood events with longer duration and greater discharge volume. The flood peak, however, will not necessarily increase even though precipitation extremes are expected to become more frequent. The projected flood return periods over the Guadalupe river basin do not show an obvious increase while the Mission river basin is projected to face a dramatic increase in flood risk with exposed to 100-year and even severer floods nearly every 2 years, on average, when considering the combined effects of flood peak, volume, and duration. © 2020.

Physiological and phenological changes of a tree may eventually disrupt the beneficial effects that it provides to the ecosystem (‘ecosystem services’). This research examined how the urban forest in Canberra has responded to climate change in the last 20 years. A road survey was conducted to document the growth of commonly planted trees across the city, which was then compared with a tree growth model (DISMUT) that reflected growth around the turn of the 20th century. The results suggest that urban trees have various mechanisms whereby they respond to climate change, and these mechanisms are partially based on tolerance to heat and drought, leaf phenology and age. In general, trees with high tolerance, evergreen leaves and young age grow faster and bigger than expected, while drought-intolerant, deciduous and older trees are more likely to exhibit restricted size. Water deficit is one of the main threats to tree vitality in Canberra. Species alleviate water deficit stress by forming dead branches or showing crown dieback. However, these symptoms undermine the ecosystem services that urban trees can provide. Urban forest management should be modified to adapt to the changes in trees, including accelerated growth and severe stress symptoms. DISMUT models can be updated to incorporate the systematic deviations in growth to improve predictions and scenario planning. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Climate change; DISMUT; Drought stress; Heat stress; Tree growth","climate change; dieback; drought stress; ecosystem service; forest management; growth modeling; growth rate; phenology; physiological response; urban forestry; water stress; Australia; Australian Capital Territory; Canberra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096987920

Due to the high altitude and cold climate in the region, the vegetation ecosystem has become very sensitive to environmental changes. In recent decades, due to the impact of climate change and human activities, the grassland degradation and desertification in this region have become very serious. In order to study the changes in aeolian desertification of grassland (ADG) in Sanjiangyuan, the Landsat images and GIS technology were used to monitor the dynamics of ADG from 1975 to 2015, and the driving factors behind this were analyzed. The results revealed that from 1975 to 2000, the area of ADG increased by 2855.8 km2, and the growth rate was 114.23 km2 a−1. In contrast, the ADG was restored from 2000 to 2015, with a decrease of 1286.54 km2 and a rate of 85.77 km2 a−1. The main reasons for the expansion of ADG in the early stage were the rising temperature, the fluctuation of precipitation and wind speed, and the increase in intensified human activities. The main reasons for the reversal of ADG in the later stage were the warming and humidification of the climate, the reduction in wind speed, and the reduction in human activities and restoration of grassland caused by the ecological protection project. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aeolian desertification of grassland; Ecological restoration project; Remote sensing monitoring; Sanjiangyuan region","Ecology; Image analysis; Restoration; Water conservation; Wind; Driving factors; Ecological protection; Environmental change; Grassland degradation; Human activities; Rising temperatures; Spatial-temporal changes; Water conservation areas; Climate change; desertification; eolian deposit; GIS; grassland; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; climate; desertification; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; grassland; human activities; warming; wind; wind speed; China; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; grassland; human; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan; Varanidae; China; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Grassland; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097581577

Here, we investigate how elevation regulates the biophysical climate impacts of deforestation over tropical mountainous areas by integrating satellite-observed forest cover changes into a high-resolution land–atmosphere coupled model. We show that recent forest conversion between 2000 and 2014 increased the regional warming by 0.022 ± 0.002 °C in the Southeast Asian Massif, 0.010 ± 0.007 °C in the Barisan Mountains (Maritime Southeast Asia), 0.042 ± 0.010 °C in the Serra da Espinhaço (South America) and 0.047 ± 0.008 °C in the Albertine Rift mountains (Africa) during the local dry season. The deforestation-driven local temperature anomaly can reach up to 2 °C where forest conversion is extensive. The warming from mountain deforestation depends on elevation, through the intertwined and opposing effects of increased albedo causing cooling and decreased evapotranspiration causing warming. As the elevation increases, the albedo effect increases in importance and the warming effect decreases, analogous to previously highlighted decreases of deforestation-induced warming with increasing latitude. As most new croplands are encroaching lands at low to moderate elevations, deforestation produces higher warming from suppressed evapotranspiration. Impacts of this additional warming on crop yields, land degradation and biodiversity of nearby intact ecosystems should be incorporated into future assessments. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"albedo; climate effect; deforestation; elevation; forest cover; global warming; induced response; land degradation; land-atmosphere interaction; mountain region; satellite altimetry; temperature anomaly; tropical region; Brazil; East African Rift; Serra do Espinhaco; Southeast Asia; Western Rift; Western Rift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098927107

The biogeography of soil bacteria and fungi lags behind in animals and plants, especially in arid areas with alkaline conditions. Understanding the biogeographic of soil microbes and the interactions with environmental factors will provide new insights into the ecosystem functions and services droved by soil bacteria and fungi. Therefore, we chose 48 dryland sites from two transects (north-south and east-west transects) on the Loess Plateau (an arid area) to determine soil bacterial and fungal diversity and community compositions in response to environmental factors and geographic distance. The results showed that soil organic carbon enhanced soil fungal diversity rather than soil bacterial diversity, while soil bacterial diversity was not affected by the environmental factors on the Loess Plateau. The significant associations between the abundance of main bacteria and fungi and soil pH, suggesting that soil pH was the predominant factor affecting soil microbial community structure. In the alkaline soils (pH = 7.4–9.1), soil bacterial community compositions were limited by soil pH, while soil fungal community composition was less sensitive in response to the alterations in soil pH, revealing soil fungi has a wider optimal pH range than bacteria. Compered to historical contingencies, local environment mainly controlled the geography of bacteria and fungi in soils. On the Loess Plateau, soil microbial communities diverge most by soil pH, especially for soil bacteria.

However, unreasonable tourism exploitation and large energy consumption have brought severe challenges to China's urban environment, particularly for air pollution problems which constrains improvements in sustainable economic development and social welfare. This paper is aim to empirically investigate the direct and spatial spillover effects of tourism development on air pollution in China using panel data from 285 prefecture-level cities from 2005 to 2017. After spatial correlation statistical analysis, this research employs a generalized nested spatial econometric model (GNS) to conduct empirical estimations. The results demonstrate that the tourism development's direct effect on PM2.5 concentrations takes on an inverted U-shaped relationship. In contrast, the indirect effect of tourism development on PM2.5 demonstrates reveals a U-shaped relationship. For industrial SO2 emissions, both the direct and indirect effect of tourism development have inverted U-shape relationships. We find that urban high-speed rail construction and tourism resources play an important moderating role in the relationships between tourism development and urban industrial SO2 emissions. These results confirm a tourism-environment Kuznets curve in the context of China, with significant spatial spillover effects from tourism development on air pollution.

From the athlete perspective, it examines the implications of decisions by global sports federations when selecting host cities and the subsequent impacts upon elite athletes competing in unfavourable climates. Design/methodology/approach: Using an exploratory case study approach at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, this paper explores insider perspectives of four elite female participants competing in the Marathon. Adopting the “elite interviewing” technique, and based on event participant experiences, the paper prioritises the perspective and “voice” of the athlete. Findings: Four key themes emerged from the data. These were (1) the importance of training and preparation; (2) unique challenges of competition day; (3) elite athlete retrospection; and (4) prioritising the perspectives of elite athletes at international sports events. The findings highlight the challenges of managing athlete preparation and performance at world championship events hosted in extreme climatic conditions. Research limitations/implications: The sample size for this study whilst relatively small is unique. This reflects challenges accessing elite athletes, their reluctance to be interviewed, and the small pool of elite athlete talent available. Given these practical barriers, this represents a good sample size. Originality/value: This paper secures unique insider access to elite level female endurance athletes competing at world championship events. The study makes a contribution to knowledge in event studies by introducing concepts of “elite event interviewing” and the “athlete-event paradox”. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Elite interviewing; Endurance sport; Extreme climate; International sports events; Marathon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097934484

However, direct linkage of satellite-derived NO2 trends with changes in underlying NOx emissions and NOx surface concentrations is complicated by the contribution of background NO2 to the column, by changes in the chemical regime wherein emissions take place, and by data sampling differences. Here we study the 2005–2018 changes in nitrogen oxides concentrations over the polluted Netherlands. We use the QA4ECV OMI NO2 retrievals, RIVM surface measurements of NO, NO2, and O3, wet deposition fluxes of nitrate, and NOx emissions reported in two European inventories (EMEP and TNO-MACC-III). We interpret the observed changes in concentrations with simulations by CLASS, a box model accounting for boundary layer dynamics and chemistry. Nationally averaged, OMI column NO2 and RIVM surface NO2 concentrations are reduced by 30% and 32% respectively between 2005 and 2018. This is in line with Dutch national NOx emissions from the TNO-MACC-III and EMEP inventories showing decreases of 32%–39%, respectively, between 2005 and 2018. There is no indication that the decrease in NO2 concentrations slows down after 2010. The observed reductions in nitrogen oxides differ between winter and summer and turn out to be modulated by ozone chemistry. The RIVM surface measurements show a stronger reduction in NOx than in NO2, accompanied by an increase in O3 of 4–6 ppbv, which is due to diminished NO-titration following the lower NOx emissions, especially in winter. CLASS simulations confirm that daytime O3 increases have shifted the NO–NO2 equilibrium more towards NO2, explaining the weaker reductions in NO2 (−30%) than in NOx (−40%) concentrations over time. The O3 increases occur both during day and during night, and have likely shortened the NOx lifetimes both in summer (via faster OH + NO2+M during daytime) and in winter (via faster nighttime N2O5 formation and subsequent hydrolysis). Our findings suggest a reduction in anthropogenic NOx emissions of approximately 30% in the southern part of the Netherlands, and propose that interpreting satellite NO2 trends as a proxy for trends in NOx emissions is well-possible over a high-NOx region, but requires careful analysis in terms of changes in the chemical regimes and NOx lifetime. © 2021 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Nitrogen oxides; OMI; Ozone; Trends","Air quality; Boundary layers; Chemical analysis; Reduction; Satellites; Surface measurement; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Boundary layer dynamics; Chemical regimes; Long term change; Nitrogen oxides concentration; Satellite measurements; Subsequent hydrolysis; Surface concentration; Wet deposition flux; Nitrogen oxides; nitrate; nitric acid; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; boundary layer; concentration (composition); emission control; environmental monitoring; long-term change; nitrogen oxides; ozone; reduction; satellite altimetry; wet deposition; aerosol; air pollution; Article; boundary layer; combustion; Europe; meteorology; Netherlands; photochemistry; photolysis; precipitation; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); seasonal variation; simulation; steady state; summer; surface property; titrimetry; troposphere; wet deposition; winter; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100443976

This work explored the seasonal sensitivity of open earth air heat exchanger systems to variations in these temperatures. Utilizing 492 weather files in Canada, the heating and cooling potential of open earth air heat exchangers computed using a climate-based approach were compared for different seasonal variation scenarios. Heightened sensitivity to seasonal changes in ground temperatures relative to air temperatures were observed. These effects expectedly decreased with depth. Heating and cooling potential sensitivity to seasonal variations in air temperatures are dependent on the timing, often observing the greatest influence during peak demand periods. Binning by climates identified that regions with a greater mix of heating and cooling potential were more susceptible to seasonal variations. These results also suggest improvements to the heating potential in Canada can be improved by increasing ground surface temperatures outside the summer season, with little influence on the cooling potential. Understanding the interaction between open earth air heat exchanger systems and their environments can ultimately help outline limitations and design solutions specific to their implementation in Canadian climates. © 2020","Climate; Earth-air heat exchanger; Seasonal sensitivity","Heat exchangers; Heating; Sensitivity analysis; Surface properties; Earth-air heat exchangers; Earthair heat exchanger (EAHE); Ground surface temperature; Ground temperature; Heating and cooling; Seasonal variation; Subsurface temperature; Surrounding environment; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; cooling; heat source; heating; regional climate; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; surface temperature; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088121631

These emissions are still poorly quantified in subarctic regions that contain vast amounts of surface C in permafrost peatlands. This is especially true in NE European peatlands, located within sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zones which are highly vulnerable to thaw. Initial measurements of C emissions from lentic waters of the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra (BZT; 200,000 km2) demonstrated sizable CO2 and CH4 concentrations and fluxes to the atmosphere in 98 depressions, thaw ponds, and thermokarst lakes ranging from 0.5 × 106 to 5 × 106 m2 in size. CO2 fluxes decreased by an order of magnitude as waterbody size increased by &gt; 3 orders of magnitude while CH4 fluxes showed large variability unrelated to lake size. By using a combination of Landsat-8 and GeoEye-1 images, we determined lakes cover 4% of BZT and thus calculated overall C emissions from lentic waters to be 3.8 ± 0.65 Tg C yr−1 (99% C-CO2, 1% C-CH4), which is two times higher than the lateral riverine export. Large lakes dominated GHG emissions whereas small thaw ponds had a minor contribution to overall water surface area and GHG emissions.

However, their impacts on regional carbon cycle remain unclear. Here, we explore the effects of climate and land cover change (LCC) on ecosystem productivity and carbon storage in China during 2001-2012 by forcing a dynamic vegetation model with satellite-based land cover and two different climate datasets. The model predicts a significant increase of 0.065 m2 m−2 decade−1 in annual mean leaf area index, higher than the observed trend of 0.038 m2 m−2 decade−1. Meanwhile, national annual total gross primary productivity increases by 0.041 ± 0.007 Pg C yr−2, which is contributed by CO2 fertilization (0.035 ± 0.001 Pg C yr−2), LCC (0.036 ± 0.001 Pg C yr−2), and climate change (-0.032 ± 0.01 Pg C yr−2). Consequently, the total land carbon storage in China increases by 0.99 Pg C yr−1, to which the LCC alone contributes 0.77 Pg C yr−1. The maximum enhancement of &gt;1 g C m−2 yr−1 in land carbon stock is found over the central west, where a large fraction of shrublands is converted to forests. Our results suggest that afforestation in China provides a strong mitigation to the regional carbon emissions during the 2000s. © 2020","afforestation; CO2 fertilization; gross primary productivity; land carbon storage; land cover change; trend","afforestation; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; fertilizer application; leaf area index; net ecosystem production; radiocarbon dating; trend analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094178057

Although definitions of drought vary among different indices, the frequency of drought is likely to enhance in a strong warming climate either because of increased temperature or decreased precipitation. However, for a low warming target such as 1.5°C, drought tendency is uncertain as it depends on the competition between evapotranspiration and precipitation, both of which may show only moderate changes. In this study, future changes of self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) in China are projected for the periods of 1.5°C global warming under two different scenarios based on outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Compared to present day, national average scPDSI decreases by 0.04 ± 0.53 at a high emission scenario but increases by 0.20 ± 0.60 at a low emission scenario to the same 1.5°C global warming. Even with large uncertainties, the multi-model ensemble scPDSI significantly increases by 0.52 ± 1.07 in the Southeast from the high to low emission scenarios. Such relieved drought is mainly attributed to the increased regional precipitation, which is likely caused by reductions in aerosols following emission regulations. Consequently, an associated control of both carbon and air pollution emissions helps retain the warming target globally and relieve drought risks regionally. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","1.5°C global warming; aerosols; drought stress; evapotranspiration; scPDSI","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Global warming; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Emission regulation; Emission scenario; Increased temperature; Low emission scenarios; Multi-model ensemble; Pollution emissions; Self-calibrating Palmer drought severity indices; Drought; aerosol; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; drought; emission control; evapotranspiration; global warming; precipitation (climatology); China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087205631

This is particularly true in China which is globally the largest manufacturer and relies heavily on coal-fired electricity. Research that explores the linkages between industrial electricity use and the electricity supply sector to curb air pollution is limited. In this study, an integrated modeling framework is developed that quantifies the impact of industrial electricity savings on the evolution of the coal power plant fleet in China, and on air pollutants for the different power grids in the period 2016–2040. The framework includes a rich set of efficiency technologies and detailed unit-level information (geo-coordinates, thermal efficiency, environmental performance). We find that the reduced electricity load due to the industrial efficiency improvements can effectively scale down the coal power fleet, and most importantly allows closing the most polluting units. The potentials for electricity savings vary amongst the industrial sectors and provinces, resulting in significant heterogeneity of coal plant phaseout per power grid. Because energy-intensive industrial plants are mostly found in the North, Central and Northwest grids, these three grids provide 66% of the total displaced coal capacity. The closing of coal units leads to a variation in annual emission reductions per power grid of 13–85 kt-SO2, 19–129 kt-NOx, 3–17 kt-PM and 21–167 Mt-CO2, compared to business-as-usual emissions. The iron &amp; steel, aluminium and chemical sectors, together contribute to 84% of the total electricity savings by 2040, and are thereby most important to target. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Carbon emission; Coal-fired power; Electricity saving; Industry; Multiple benefits","Air pollution; Aluminum coated steel; Automation; Climate change; Coal; Coal industry; Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Industrial research; Plant shutdowns; Power plants; Sulfur dioxide; Ambient air pollution; Coal-fired electricity; Efficiency improvement; Electricity supply sectors; Environmental performance; Integrated model framework; Pollution emissions; Sustainable industries; Electric power transmission networks; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; climate change; electricity supply; heterogeneity; power plant; regional development; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096703432

How to control air pollution in megacities is still a challenging issue because of the complex pollutant sources, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorology. There is substantial uncertainty in accurately identifying the contributions of transport and local emissions to the air quality in megacities. The COVID-19 outbreak has prompted a nationwide public lockdown period and provides a valuable opportunity for understanding the sources and factors of air pollutants. The three-month period of continuous field observations for aerosol particles and gaseous pollutants, which extended from January 2020 to March 2020, covered urban, urban-industry, and suburban areas in the typical megacity of Hangzhou in the Yangtze River Delta in eastern China. In general, the concentrations of PM2.5–10, PM2.5, NOx, SO2, and CO reduced 58%, 47%, 83%, 11% and 30%, respectively, in the megacity during the COVID-Lock period. The reduction proportions of PM2.5 and CO were generally higher in urban and urban-industry areas than those in suburban areas. NOx exhibited the greatest reduction (&gt;80%) among all the air pollutants, and the reduction was similar in the urban, urban-industry, and suburban areas. O3 increased 102%–125% during the COVID-Lock period. The daytime elevation of the planetary boundary layer height can reduce 30% of the PM10, PM2.5, NOx and CO concentrations on the ground in Hangzhou. During the long-range transport events, air pollutants on the regional scale likely contribute 40%–90% of the fine particles in the Hangzhou urban area. The findings highlight the future control and model forecasting of air pollutants in Hangzhou and similar megacities in eastern China. © 2018","Air pollution; COVID-19; Hangzhou; Planetary boundary layer; Transport","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Fog; Locks (fasteners); Nitrogen oxides; River pollution; Urban transportation; Air pollution in megacities; Environmental problems; Gaseous pollutants; Long range transport; Planetary boundary layers; Reduction proportion; Spatio-temporal variation; Yangtze river delta; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; epidemiology; megacity; pollution control; respiratory disease; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; exhaust gas; forecasting; geographic elevation; human; isolation; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; suburban area; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; pandemic; river; virus pneumonia; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089813391

Combing our seasonal results with prior fall values we find that wetlands are the largest regional methane source (32 %, 20 [16-23] Gg/d), while livestock (enteric/manure; 25 %, 15 [14-17] Gg/d) are the largest anthropogenic source. Natural gas/petroleum, waste/landfills, and coal mines collectively make up the remainder. Optimized fluxes improve model agreement with independent datasets within and beyond the study timeframe. Inversions reveal coherent and seasonally dependent spatial errors in the WetCHARTs ensemble mean wetland emissions, with an underestimate for the Prairie Pothole region but an overestimate for Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Wetland extent and emission temperature dependence have the largest influence on prediction accuracy; better representation of coupled soil temperature-hydrology effects is therefore needed. Our optimized regional livestock emissions agree well with the Gridded EPA estimates during spring (to within 7 %) but are g≈ 25 % higher during summer and winter. Spatial analysis further shows good top-down and bottom-up agreement for beef facilities (with mainly enteric emissions) but larger (g≈ 30 %) seasonal discrepancies for dairies and hog farms (with > 40 % manure emissions). Findings thus support bottom-up enteric emission estimates but suggest errors for manure; we propose that the latter reflects inadequate treatment of management factors including field application. Overall, our results confirm the importance of intensive animal agriculture for regional methane emissions, implying substantial mitigation opportunities through improved management. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Remote sensing (RS) can support effective monitoring and mapping approaches for tropical forests, and to facilitate this we propose a deep neural network with an encoder–decoder architecture here to classify tropical forests and their environment. To deal with the complexity of tropical landscapes, this method utilizes a multi-scale convolution neural network (CNN) to expand the receptive field and extract multi-scale features. The model refines the features with several attention modules and fuses them through an upsampling module. A two-stage training strategy is proposed to alleviate misclassifications caused by sample imbalances. A joint loss function based on cross-entropy loss and the generalized Dice loss is applied in the first stage, and the second stage used the focal loss to fine-tune the weights. As a case study, we use Hainan tropical reserves to test the performance of this model. Compared with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation networks, our network achieves the best performance with two Hainan datasets (mean intersection over union (MIoU) percentages of 85.78% and 82.85%). We also apply the new model to classify a public true color dataset which has 17 semantic classes and obtain results with an 83.75% MIoU. This further demonstrates the applicability and potential of this model in complex classification tasks. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective of this work is to propose some eco-driving behavior suggestions by analyzing the impact of driving behaviors on vehicle emissions. A Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) was used to collect emissions and microscopic driving behavior data. Then the multi-dimensional characteristics of driving behaviors and corresponding link-level emission characteristics were quantified. The results show that the vehicle activities change significantly when the road traffic tends to be saturated or forced. The change of driving behavior and associated vehicle activities leads to the significant increase of emission factor in saturated flow and forced flow. Traditional eco-driving advice advocates using the highest gear as much as possible to reduce fuel consumption. But the results indicate that using the highest gear can achieve a savings in CO2 while at a cost in NOX. If the time percentage of the highest gear increase by 54%, the CO2 emission factors will reduce by 22% while NOX will increase by 14%. Then a total of six factors were extracted to characterize driving behaviors. The statistical analysis shows that not only the driving operational intensity have an impact on the emissions factors but also the durations and frequencies of individual maneuver states will affect emissions. Decision tree algorithm was used to identify eco-driving behaviors. Finally, a model with 97% accuracy was put forward. The conclusions are helpful to improve traditional eco-driving strategies. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Decision tree model; Driving behaviors; Eco-driving; Factor analysis; PEMS; Vehicle emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092026726

Meanwhile, the corresponding conventional process-based LCA is conducted alongside to quantify the impact of applying different LCA approaches. For the whole precinct, the life cycle GHG emissions from hybrid LCA is 16% higher than its corresponding process-based LCA result, reaching 16.6 t CO2e/inhabitant/year. Embodied emissions, operational emissions and occupant-related transport emissions take up 28%, 32% and 40% of the life cycle GHG emissions, respectively, and the biggest difference between these two LCA approaches is seen in embodied emissions (22%), followed by transport emissions (17%) and operational emissions (11%). Assuming no technology innovation and substantial changes in economic structure, precinct design and lifestyle are involved, twelve GHG emissions mitigation measures are quantified. While process-based LCA suggests a mitigation potential of 35%, hybrid LCA results in a reduction of 31%. The most effective measures are related to reducing transport emissions and operational emissions, but for the embodied emissions, instead of reducing them, the combination of all measures brings about a slight increase both absolutely and relatively. From base case to mitigated case, the differences between two LCA approaches are enlarged and the biggest difference is always seen in embodied emission. This implies the process-based LCA would further underestimate the life cycle GHG emissions in mitigated case, therefore, the use of hybrid LCA is more favourable for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and reliable assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Embodied emissions; Hybrid life cycle assessment; Operational emissions; Precinct; Transport emissions","Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Embodied emissions; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; Low-carbon strategies; Reliable assessment; Technology innovation; Transport emissions; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089804622

This two-stage method enhances the accuracy and obtainable detail of the decomposition results. Then, empirical research was conducted by decomposing the changes of China's industrial sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions during 2005–2015. At the national level, CP and ET both decreased Chinese SO2 emissions, and CP has become the dominant approach for SO2 emission reduction in 2010–2015. Moreover, coal pollution intensity and treatment strength are key factors that need to be improved in CP and ET, respectively. At the provincial level, CP exerts a stronger impact on SO2 emission differences among different regions, while ET exerts less impact on SO2 emission differences among different regions.

It is vital to compensate for the economic and environmental loss of power output region by taking the carbon subsidy strategy into account. In this study, a risk explicit interval multistage stochastic programming model considering inter-regional carbon subsidy is developed to support an optimal energy system planning in Inner Mongolia, China. This model can not only deal with uncertainties embedded in the complex energy system described as interval values and random variables but also reflect dynamic linkage between multiple stages over a time series. It advanced the existing optimization methods by introducing the cost-risk tradeoff information based on the risk preferences of decision-makers. The obtained crisp solutions are more feasible, effective and optimum for the practical policymaking process. Different scenarios associated with carbon subsidy policy implementation, renewable energy share adjustment and carbon emission reduction strategy are employed to project the optimal power generation scheme, net system cost, installed electricity capacity, carbon intensity and pollution emission in the future. The results indicate that the amount of exported electricity will keep increasing, and the carbon subsidy strategy will prominently promote the economic growth of the electric power sector by 3.05%. The further power supply pattern is going to transform from fossil fuel to renewable energy, by which wind and solar power will occupy around 44% of total power generation capacity in West Inner Mongolia. Raising the share of renewable energy will be the most effective approach to adjust the power generation scheme; meanwhile, reducing carbon intensity will significantly contribute to enlarge green energy capacity, enhance low-carbon emission and mitigate air pollution. These findings will help decision-makers gain insights into a more scientific energy system planning under various uncertainties. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon intensity; Inter-regional; Interval multistage programming; Power system planning; Renewable energy; Risk explicit; Subsidy policy","Air pollution; Carbon; Decision making; Economic analysis; Electric power system planning; Emission control; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Solar power generation; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Carbon emission reductions; Complex energy systems; Electric power sector; Electricity transmission; Low-carbon emissions; Multi-stage stochastic programming; Policy implementations; Wind and solar power; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092795914

In accordance with the theory of compounding two functional groups integrally into a single structure under relatively moderate formation conditions, this paper presents an efficacious interfacial passivation modification strategy for PSCs with well-controlled morphologies and passivated charged surface states using a bidentate ligand perfluorocarbon copolymer (PFOMA). The strategy involves self-assembly of biomimetic PFOMA on a perovskite surface due to the coordination binding between the catecholic OH groups of PFOMA and Pb2+. The time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrated that the effective passivation of catecholic OH groups benefits from the inhibition of the photogenerated carrier recombination. Furthermore, the long fluorocarbon alkyl chains of PFOMA bestow the perovskite surface with higher resistance against moisture. Hence, the resulting PFOMA-modified PSC can accomplish an above-average efficiency of about 20.66% (with an average PCE of 19.71%) with a notable increment in the open-circuit voltage of about 40 mV compared to the control voltage (1.12 mV). Particularly, the PFOMA-modified PSC exhibits a remarkable enhancement in the moisture stability factor under a relative humidity of 70 ± 5%, retaining >90% of their initial efficacies along with considerably upgraded device performance (an average PCE of 19.71% and a champion device PCE of 20.66% were achieved) and an enhanced moisture stability factor even under a relative humidity of 70 ± 5%. The highly proficient passivation strategy demonstrated in this work can help the future exploration of this function-oriented synthesis strategy and can pave the path for the universal application of PSCs employing the modification of polymers and more organic species. ©","defect passivation; interfacial engineering; moisture stability; perfluoro-copolymer; perovskite solar cells","Biomimetics; Cell engineering; Charge carriers; Conversion efficiency; Efficiency; Fluorocarbons; Lead compounds; Ligands; Moisture; Open circuit voltage; Organic polymers; Passivation; Perovskite; Charged surface state; Interfacial modification; Modification of polymers; Photogenerated carriers; Power conversion efficiencies; Stability enhancement; Time-resolved photoluminescence; Universal application; Perovskite solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099101700

These channels have placed tremendous pressure on land resources, and some require large quantities of electrical energy to lift the water to a higher altitude. Within this context, this study attempts to make full use of local solar energy resource and upper space of water channel to construct an on-channel photovoltaic (PV) system. Based on-site data and PVsyst model, this study took the central line of the “South-to-North water diversion” project as an example to examine the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed on-channel PV system under two alternative scenarios. The major results indicated that the initial investment would be 3,733 million Yuan under the scenario 1, with an expected annual electricity output of 659 GWh; while under the scenario 2, the number of initial investments would increase to 18.665 billion Yuan with an expected electricity output of 3.295 billion kWh. Moreover, carbon balance analysis demonstrated that the rate of carbon emission reduction can reach as much as 98.45% comparing to the baseline case.

However, the lag structure of the effects lacks investigation. A two-stage analysis was used to assess the effects of meteorological factors on daily levels of particulate matter with an atmospheric diameter of less than 2.5 μg (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in 284 major Chinese cities during 2015–2018. A quantile regression model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model was first used to estimate the city-specific nonlinear and delayed effects of meteorology on air pollutants. Then, a multivariate meta-analysis was utilized to pool the city-specific effect estimates across China. In general, the meteorological effects were nonlinear. The wind speed, temperature, and rainfall were observed to be the primary meteorological factors influencing PM2.5 concentration, while temperature, relative humidity, and sunshine duration played crucial roles in influencing O3 concentration. Additionally, diverse meteorological lag pattern effects were also noted. For PM2.5, the effects of rainfall and wind were delayed and lasted for 2–4 d, while the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and sunshine duration peaked in real time and then quickly became negative or vanished after 1 d.

The effect of the top-down emission estimation on air quality modeling and the response of ambient ozone (O3) and inorganic aerosols (SO24 , NO3 , and NHC 4 , SNA) to the changed precursor emissions were evaluated with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) system. The top-down estimates of NOx emissions were smaller than those (i.e., the bottom-up estimates) in a national emission inventory, Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), for all the 4 months, and the monthly mean was calculated to be 260.0 Gg/month, 24% less than the bottom-up one. The NO2 concentrations simulated with the bottom-up estimate of NOx emissions were clearly higher than the ground observations, indicating the possible overestimation in the current emission inventory, attributed to its insufficient consideration of recent emission control in the region. The model performance based on top-down estimate was much better, and the biggest change was found for July, with the normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) reduced from 111% to 0.4% and from 111% to 33 %, respectively. The results demonstrate the improvement of NOx emission estimation with the nonlinear inversed modeling and satellite observation constraint. With the smaller NOx emissions in the top-down estimate than the bottom-up one, the elevated concentrations of ambient O3 were simulated for most of the YRD, and they were closer to observations except for July, implying the VOC (volatile organic compound)-limited regime of O3 formation.With available ground observations of SNA in the YRD, moreover, better model performance of NO3 and NHC 4 was achieved for most seasons, implying the effectiveness of precursor emission estimation on the simulation of secondary inorganic aerosols. Through the sensitivity analysis of O3 formation for April 2016, the decreased O3 concentrations were found for most of the YRD region when only VOC emissions were reduced or the reduced rate of VOC emissions was 2 times of that of NOx , implying the crucial role of VOC control in O3 pollution abatement. The SNA level for January 2016 was simulated to decline 12% when 30% of NH3 emissions were reduced, while the change was much smaller with the same reduced rate for SO2 or NOx . The result suggests that reducing NH3 emissions was the most effective way to alleviate SNA pollution of the YRD in winter. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Yet, it is unclear which region and which form of commodity consumption were responsible for the greatest loss of land carbon. Here we assumed a uniform lifespan (20-year) for managed land and took the managed land in 2010 as a reference to estimate the land carbon loss for region-commodity on a global scale. The estimates and multi-region input-output table were then combined to identify the regions and commodities that contributed the most to global land carbon loss from the consumption side. The results show that during the lifespan, global consumption for agricultural and forestry commodities excluding wood fuel lost a total of 15.6 Pg in land carbon annually, of which 29% and 25% were attributed to beef and wood consumption, respectively. Land carbon loss per capita consumption was highest in high-income regions (Australia, the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe) primarily due to the high consumed quantity for commodities per capita in these areas. Further, the net importers for land carbon were usually high-income regions (they held lower land carbon loss per unit of production), which was not conducive to reducing global land carbon loss. The research could contribute to discussions of climate responsibility and then inform climate mitigation policies. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Agricultural robots; Climate change; Forestry; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Critical component; Global consumption; Global scale; Input-output table; Percapita consumption; Wood consumption; Carbon; carbon; agricultural land; agroforestry; commodity; food consumption; global change; agricultural land; Article; Australia; beef cattle; calculation; Canada; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration (parameter); cropland; environmental policy; Europe; forestry; global change; highest income group; Japan; land use; lifespan; livestock; nonhuman; rangeland; United States; urban area; vegetation; wood; agriculture; environmental protection; human; Agriculture; Australia; Canada; Carbon; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Europe; Forestry; Humans; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100125862

The solid-state MF substituting the liquid-state solvent in the pores of organic wet gel effectively alleviates the capillary pressure, preventing the mesopores from collapse during ambient pressure drying, and then decomposes into gases slowly during the modified carbonization process. As a result, the obtained MeCA with the slimmest skeleton demonstrates a pore volume of 0.82 cm3 g−1, a surface area of 534 m2 g−1 and a well-retained mesoporous structure with a pore size of 11 nm. This value of the mesopore size, to our knowledge, is the smallest one of the ever reported MeCAs prepared by ambient pressure drying.

Yet, quantification of FAP emissions from human beings remains limited, along with a poor understanding of the underlying emission mechanisms. To reduce the knowledge gap, we characterized human emissions of size-segregated FAPs (1-10 μm) and total particles in a climate chamber with low-background particle levels. We probed the influence of several personal factors (clothing coverage and age) and environmental parameters (level of ozone, air temperature, and relative humidity) on particle emissions from human volunteers. A material-balance model showed that the mean emission rate ranged 5.3-16 × 106 fluorescent particles per person-h (0.30-1.2 mg per person-h), with a dominant size mode within 3-5 μm. Volunteers wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants produced 40% more FAPs relative to those wearing t-shirts and shorts. Particle emissions varied across the age groups: seniors (average age 70.5 years) generated 50% fewer FAPs compared to young adults (25.0 years) and teenagers (13.8 years). While we did not observe a measurable influence of ozone (0 vs 40 ppb) on human FAP emissions, there was a strong influence of relative humidity (34 vs 62%), with FAP emissions decreasing by 30-60% at higher humidity. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Ozone; Aerosol particles; Climate chambers; Emission mechanism; Environmental factors; Environmental parameter; Fluorescent particle; Material balance; Particle emissions; Fluorescence; ozone; ozone; aerosol; air quality; emission; environmental factor; fluorescence; humidity; indoor air; pollution incidence; adolescent; adult; aerosol; age; aged; air conditioning; air temperature; airborne particle; ambient air; Article; comparative study; controlled study; environmental factor; environmental parameters; female; human; humidity; male; normal human; particle resuspension; steady state; aerosol; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; particle size; young adult; Adolescent; Aerosols; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Ozone; Particle Size; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098994138

Comparing firms' optimal decisions and maximum profits between the two models, this paper finds that the domain is divided into two regions. In Pareto improvement region, both customers and firms can benefit from the carbon emissions tax policy. Further, this region is determined simultaneously by two countries' carbon taxes, which indicates when policy makers enact carbon emissions tax, they should consider how the upstream or the downstream country enact carbon tax rather than considering own country's situation separately. In addition, with regard to the Non-Pareto improvement region, we find the revenue sharing contract can coordinate the supply chain and achieve a Pareto improvement when the coordinated parameter satisfies a certain condition. © 2021 IEEE.","B2B international trade; Carbon emissions tax; coordination; game theory; revenue sharing contract","Carbon; Emission control; International trade; Supply chains; Tantalum compounds; Benchmark models; Carbon emissions; Maximum profits; Optimal decisions; Optimization models; Pareto improvements; Revenue sharing contracts; Two-echelon supply chain; Taxation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106759417

This is the first study to determine the characteristics of PM2.5‐bound polycyclic and nitro‐polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs and NPAHs) and water‐soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) in this city. In this study, the non‐volcanic eruption period was taken as the target and daily PM2.5 samples were collected from 24 November to 21 December 2016. The daily concentrations in PM2.5 of ƩPAHs, ƩNPAHs, and ƩWSIIs ranged from 0.36 to 2.90 ng/m3, 2.12 to 22.3 pg/m3, and 1.96 to 11.4 μg/m3, respectively. Through the results of the diagnostic ratio analyses of the PAHs, NPAHs, and WSIIs and the backward trajectory analysis of the air masses arriving in Kirishima, the emission sources of PAHs, NPAHs, and WSIIs in PM2.5 in Kirishima were influenced by the coal burning that came from the East Asian continent, although there was no influence from volcanic emission sources during the sampling period. The total benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)‐equivalent concentration was lower than many other cities but the health risks in Kirishima were nonetheless notable. These findings are very important for future research on PM samples during the inactive Asian monsoon and volcanic eruption periods, to further understand the characteristics of air pollutants in Kirishima, and to contrib-ute to the improvement in health of residents and a reduction in the atmospheric circulation of air pollutants in East Asia. © 2021 by the authors.

As the co-host city of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games and the only National Renewable Energy Demonstration Zone in China, Zhangjiakou urgently needs to transform its conventional energy-dependent industries. This paper establishes a Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP)-Zhang model to examine the environmental and socio-economic effects of renewable energy development in Zhangjiakou by projecting the energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions by various sectors over the 2016–2050 period. Two scenarios are designed, i.e., the business as usual scenario (BAU) and the integrated scenario (INT) (including three sub-scenarios, i.e., renewable energy alternatives scenario (REA), industrial structure optimization scenario (ISO) and energy saving facility scenario (ESF)). Results indicate that under the INT scenario, Zhangjiakou's greenhouse gas emissions would peak in 2030 with 13.23% of lower energy consumption when compared with the BAU scenario. Compared with the conventional energy, renewable energy shows competitive advantages in terms of greenhouse gas reduction, employment opportunities and economic costs.

To solve this, we propose a facile and efficient strategy of constructing carbon shells and oxygen vacancies. Oxygen-deficient Bi2O3 nanoflakes stabilized by N-doped carbon and supported on graphite fibers (GF@Bi2O3-NCs) were prepared to improve specific capacity, rate capability and cycling stability. The N/S-codoped carbon aerogels supported on graphite fibers (GF@NS-CAGs) provided a high capacitance of 312 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, which was mainly attributed to the microporous structure and high active N content. The flexible quasi-solid-state BSH device based on the GF@Bi2O3-NC anode and the GF@NS-CAG cathode with a stable voltage window of 2.3 V could deliver a remarkable capacity of 103 mA h g-1, an energy density of 118 W h kg-1 and capacity retention of 95.7% after 10 000 cycles, reflecting that this was a highly-efficient approach to develop high-performance flexible energy storage devices. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aerogels; Anodes; Capacitance; Cathodes; Doping (additives); Electric energy storage; Graphite fibers; Oxygen vacancies; Refractory materials; Secondary batteries; Supercapacitor; Capacity retention; Cycling stability; Efficient strategy; Electrochemical kinetics; Faradaic reactions; High energy densities; Micro-porous structure; Specific capacities; Bismuth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100194573

In this study, we simultaneously measured the SOC content of the bulk and rhizosphere soil fractions, the aggregate stability, the chemical composition of SOC (solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]), the bacterial community structure in the rhizosphere, and the FR morphological traits including biomass, specific root length (SRL), and root length density (RLD) along a chronosequence (stand age of 19, 37, and 64 years) of extensively managed Moso bamboo plantations and in an adjacent secondary forest as a control. The organic C content in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil increased rapidly with plantation age in the 0–20- and 20–40-cm soil layers, accompanied by an increase in the aggregate stability. FR traits including biomass, SRL, and RLD also increased continuously in response to soil C:N:P stoichiometry. All of these traits were significantly correlated with SOC, occluded particulate organic C (oPOC), and mineral-associated organic C (MOC), suggesting that FR traits could drive the soil C sequestration with the plantation age. Further analysis indicated that the microbial biomass C (MBC) content, MBC/total organic carbon (TOC) ratio, and bacterial abundance decreased with the plantation age, and the shift from soil oligotrophy to copiotrophy bacteria were mainly driven by changes in FR traits and SOC properties. Such a reassembly of bacterial communities combined with an increase in root biomass is favorable for the accumulation of stable C functional groups (alkyl C or aromatic C). Our findings indicate that extensive management regimes of Moso bamboo plantations could promote long-term soil C sequestration especially in the rhizosphere by promoting the formation of soil aggregates and organic-mineral complexes and by shifting bacterial community composition, and that these changes can be inferred through changes in the FR traits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial community structure; Extensive management; Root morphology; Soil C sequestration","Aggregates; Bacteria; Bamboo; Biomass; Chemical stability; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Organic carbon; Tropics; Bacterial community composition; Bacterial community structure; Chemical compositions; Management strategies; Morphological traits; Organic-mineral complexes; Phyllostachys edulis; Specific root length; Soils; aromatic hydrocarbon; carbon; functional group; mineral; nitrogen; organic carbon; organic mineral complex; phosphorus; unclassified drug; carbon; bacterium; bamboo; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; extensive agriculture; microbial community; plantation; soil carbon; soil management; age; aggregate stability; Article; biomass; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical composition; China; chronosequence; community structure; complex formation; controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental management; fine root; microbial community; morphological trait; nonhuman; Phyllostachys; Phyllostachys edulis; plantation; priority journal; rhizosphere; root length density; soil analysis; soil copiotrophy bacterium; soil microflora; soil oligotrophy bacterium; soil property; specific root length; stoichiometry; total organic carbon; bacterium; forest; Poaceae; soil; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Phyllostachys pubescens; Bacteria; Carbon; China; Forests; Poaceae; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090893470

Driving these electrochemical conversions at useful rates requires not only fast electrode kinetics, but also rapid mass and ion transport. However, little is known about the effect of local environments on ionic flows in solid polymer electrolytes. Here, we show that it is possible to measure and manipulate the local pH in membrane electrolysers with a resolution of tens of nanometres. In bipolar-membrane-based gas-fed CO2 electrolysers, the acidic environment of the cation exchange layer results in low CO2 reduction efficiency. By using ratiometric indicators and layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte assembly, the local pH was measured and controlled within an ~50-nm-thick weak-acid layer. The weak-acid layer suppressed the competing hydrogen evolution reaction without affecting CO2 reduction. This method of probing and controlling the local membrane environment may be useful in devices such as electrolysers, fuel cells and flow batteries, as well as in operando studies of ion distributions within polymer electrolytes.

There is high consumption of papaya in Yasothon municipality but a lack of papaya plantations in the area lead to a vast amount import of papaya. The study developed a green supply chain and logistics model, using network analysis. The best route for each significant case was the shortest route of the total distance from each registered stop. The results of the analysis revealed that papaya distributed from Ubon Ratchathani and Sisaket Farms should use the route generated by driving and distance impedance with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at 898.42 kg CO2 eq./FU. Meanwhile, the distribution from Nakorn Ratchasima should use the driving distance impedance to generate the route with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at 987.37 k kg CO2 eq./FU. While the papaya supply chain from Kamphaeng Phet, Kanchanaburi, Lopburi, and Ratchaburi to Khon Kaen Market with driving distance impedance is the best solution among all the alternative routes as it generates the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at 6620.23 kg CO2 eq./FU. The results suggest that the distribution center can help reducing the distance, resulting in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The results of the study can suggest the sustainable index of the papaya supply chain by comparing the conventional and improved environmental impact of the papaya supply chain from the green logistics model. The alternatives will be the suggestion of pathways towards improvements in green supply chain and logistics of papaya, which can also be considered for implementation in other agricultural products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; GHG; GIS; Green supply chain; Logistics; Network analysis","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Commerce; Emission control; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Alternative routes; Distribution centers; Driving distance; Green logistics; Green supply chain; Logistics model; Sustainable indices; Total distances; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097128745

Driven by clean air policies, the air quality in China, one of the most polluted countries, has improved rapidly since 2013. This has enabled a unique, quasi-experiment to assess the economic impact of air pollution empirically. Methods and findings Using a series of nation-scale longitudinal surveys in 2011, 2013, and 2015, we first examined the questionnaire-based medical expenditure changes before and after the policy intervention for air pollution. Using a state-of-the-art estimator of the historical concentration of particulate matters with diameter less than 2.5 μm (particulate matter (PM)2.5), we further quantified the association between household medical expenditure and PM2.5 using mixed-effect models of the repeated measurements from 26,511 households in 126 cities. Regression models suggest a robust linear association between reduced PM2.5 and saved medical expenditures, since the association did not vary significantly across models with different covariate adjustments, subregions, or subpopulations. Each 10 μg/m3 reduction in PM2.5 was associated with a saving of 251.6 (95% CI: 30.8, 472.3; p-value = 0.026) Yuan in per capita annual medical expenditure. However, due to limitations in data quality (e.g., self-reported expenditures), and imperfect control for unmeasured confounders or impact from concurrent healthcare reform in China, the causality underlying our findings should be further confirmed or refuted. Conclusion In this study, we observed that compared with the PM2.5 reduction in 2013, the PM2.5 reduction in 2017 was associated with a saving of 552 (95% CI: 68, 1036) Yuan / (person × year), or approximately 736 billion Yuan (equivalent to 111 billion US dollar) per year nationally, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of the national gross domestic product of China. © 2021 Xue et al.

Spatiotemporal changes over the period 1986–2015 in four key ecosystem services (ESs) – grain yield, nitrogen loss, N2O emission, and soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation – were examined by applying the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) across the basin at county level. Two straw return modes (namely, full straw return versus no return) and three fertilizer-use reduction modes (−5%, −10%, and −20%) were set up to generate six combined scenarios, to propose pathways that reduce the variability of grain production and improve water quality by reducing loss of nitrogen (N loss) – in consideration of the Basin's vital role in agricultural production and the need to protect water quality. Results show that annual grain yield and net five-year difference in SOC accumulation exhibited an overall downward trend from 1986 to 2015, while N2O emission and N loss increased. Two pairs of ESs showed desirable synergies (increasing grain yield and increasing SOC accumulation; decreasing N2O emission and decreasing N loss), encompassing 45.8% and 2.4% of total cultivated land area respectively. Another two pairs exhibited desirable trade-offs (increasing SOC accumulation and decreasing N loss; increasing SOC accumulation and decreasing N2O emission), accounting for 19.0%, and 2.4% of total cultivated land area respectively. There was considerable overlap within counties, which showed high values of grain yield, N2O emission, nitrogen loss, and SOC accumulation in the Basin; but values were relatively high in the east and relatively low in the west. Fertilizer use has significant positive correlations with grain yield and SOC accumulation, and it reduces N loss and N2O emission. Straw return was predicted to raise grain yields and net five-year difference in SOC accumulation and to reduce N loss, but also to increase N2O emissions. Recommended strategies to reduce N loss and stabilize grain supply in the study area are 1) reducing fertilizer use by 20% in areas where N application was above 490 kg N/ha, and 2) implementing straw return and reducing fertilizer use by 5% for areas where N application ranged between 380 and 490 kg N/ha. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agroecosystem services; APSIM model; Taihu Lake Basin; Trade-off","fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; organic carbon; soil water; carbon; fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agricultural management; agricultural worker; agroecosystem; air pressure; Article; artificial neural network; carbon footprint; China; conductance; crop rotation; cultivated land; ecosystem; grain yield; humidity; lake basin; nitrogen dynamics; nonhuman; precipitation; rice; soil acidity; soil moisture; soil temperature; summer; water quality; wheat; wind speed; winter; agriculture; lake; soil; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Lakes; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092126123

To predict changes of carbon emissions from leaves to the atmosphere under a warming climate, it is, therefore, important to understand the thermodynamics of the temperature response of leaf respiration. In this study, we measured the short-term temperature response of leaf respiration from five different urban tree species in a subtropical region of southern China. We applied two models, including an empirical model (the Kavanau model) and a mechanistic model (Macromolecular Rate Theory, MMRT), to investigate the thermodynamic properties in different plant species. Both models are equivalent in fitting measurements of the temperature response of leaf respiration with no significant difference (p = 0.67) in model efficiency, while MMRT provides an easy way to determine the thermodynamic properties, i.e., enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of activation, for plant respiration. We found a conserved temperature response in the five studied plant species, showing no difference in thermodynamic properties and the relative temperature sensitivity for different species at low temperatures (<42°C). However, divergent temperature response among species happened at high temperatures over 42°C, showing more than two-fold differences in relative respiration rate compared to that below 42°C, although the causes of the divergent temperature response remain unclear. Notably, the convergent temperature response at low temperatures could provide useful information for land surface models to improve predictions of climate change effects on plant respiration. © Copyright © 2021 Xu, Liáng, Kirschbaum, Fang and Yu.","enthalpy; entropy; Gibbs free energy of activation; Leaf respiration; macromolecular rate theory; temperature response; temperature sensitivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102101939

CO2 emissions could be significantly reduced due to the co-effects of implementing the BSPC. This paper employs the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies Asia model to quantitatively evaluate the CO2 reductions when implementing the BSPC in the BTH region. The results indicate that CO2 emissions can be reduced by 20.7 Mt (equivalently, a 19.7% reduction in the corresponding baseline scenario), 6.8 Mt (3.8%), and 80.2 Mt (9.2%) by 2020 for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, respectively, as a co-benefit of the BSPC. By 2030, it is estimated that the CO2 emission reductions will be 37.8 Mt (26.6%), 4.85 Mt (2.5%), and 69.9 Mt (8.6%) for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, respectively. NOx presents the highest co-effects with CO2 in each region. From the key sector perspective, sectors of power and heating in Beijing, residential combustion in Tianjin, and industrial combustion in Hebei are the most important sector that presents the highest co-effects on CO2 emission reductions due to the application of BSPC. We suggest that the implementation of BSPC, specifically the energy control measures in the power and heating, residential combustion, and industrial combustion sectors for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, respectively, have high synergies and can simultaneously reduce CO2 and other atmospheric emissions. The results contribute to city-level policymaking on facilitating air pollution control and climate change mitigation among different governmental departments. © 2021 The Author(s).

Better COD and antibiotics removal performance was obtained in CW-MFC. Notably, both reactors can remove more than 90.00% of CIP. A decline in methane fluxes (by 15.29%) was also observed in CW-MFC compared with CW. The presence of Acorus tatarinowii had no obvious effect on antibiotics removal but the application of manganese ore substrate reduced methane emissions. Further study showed that Proteobacteria was enriched on the Mn substrate anode and the relative abundance of Methanothrix was declined. The results suggested that suppression of methanogenesis may be contributed to a low methane flux in CW-MFC.

Subsequently, the flowability, compressive and flexural strengths, and impact resistance of the RFRRC are discussed. Experimental results show that the compressive strength of the mixed composites is slightly improved, while the ductility, flexural toughness, impact resistance and energy absorption capacity are significantly enhanced. Ecological evaluation of the RFRRC is conducted through case studies of an individual building and regional buildings. Evaluation results indicates that CO2 emissions can be substantially reduced through the application of RFRRC in construction fields.

The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been recognized as one of the most effective ways to improve microcirculation and to benefit wound healing, while the need of the specialized equipment and the uncontrollable delivery of gas CO2 might restrict such strategy in wide applications. Herein, we develop a photothermal hydrogel for the on-demand and localized delivery of CO2 to accelerate skin wound healing by combining thermoresponsive block copolymer (BCP) of Pluronic F127 and carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) with amino groups, which can be used for loading CO2 precursor of bicarbonate for controlled release. We show that by rationally optimizing the content of the thermoresponsive BCP in the photothermal hydrogel, a liquid-to-solid transition triggered by the body temperature can be achieved. Under light irradiation, the CNPs can convert light into heat, triggering the decomposition of the bicarbonate, and the photothermal hydrogel can thus locally release CO2 in the wound site. Wound healing can be accelerated by improving local microcirculation disturbance and increasing tissue oxygen concentration.

Therefore, carbon emissions caused by the public should be taken seriously, and the public should be encouraged to engage in behavior that limits carbon emissions. Therefore, this article introduces a new incentive mechanism called the Carbon Generalized System of Preferences (CGSP), which was first introduced in Guangdong Province, China. It is believed that this new mechanism matches the role of leadership in Guangdong in the urbanization and economic development of China by addressing the small sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and by issuing carbon coins. Compared with Chinese Certified Emission Reduction (CCER), the development scope, management level, and novel criteria of CGSP are very different but relatively easy for the public to accept. The CGSP shows that the network platform, reduced carbon emissions, and urban pilots are all compatible with the goals of the nation and city, and they promote the CGSP in different ways. Because of its consistency with ecological civilization in China, the prospect of the CGSP is bright; however, there are some challenges, such as policy and economic factors, combined with pollution control. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon Generalized System of Preferences; Climate change; Development; Public","carbon emission; economic analysis; economic development; emission control; greenhouse gas; incentive; pollution control; urbanization; China; Guangdong; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; city; economic development; urbanization; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Economic Development; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096393110

Biofouling and scaling are two leading issues in drip irrigation emitters. This study investigated a practice that applied electromagnetic fields (EMFs) to control biofilms and scales. The bacterial communities and mineral precipitations in the clogging substances of emitters were determined. Results showed that EMFs inhibited the growth of microbes, and influenced BS physicochemical parameters. Consequently, EMFs shifted the bacterial communities with reduced diversities. Network analyses revealed that bacterial species under EMFs treatments showed lower average connectivities and simpler interactions, which were responsible for the decreases of extracellular polymers substances (EPS). Moreover, EMFs treatments not only reduced the carbonates in emitters, but also prevented the depositions of phosphates, silicates, and quartzes. EMFs also had impacts on the lattice parameters and crystal volumes of carbonates. In addition, the changes in bacterial communities and EPS contents were associated with the reductions of various minerals. Accordingly, EMFs effectively mitigated biofilms and scales with the fixed clogging substances reduced by 29.1–53.8 %. These findings demonstrated that applying EMFs is an effective anti-biofouling and anti-scaling treatment with potential applications in BS irrigation systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial community; Biofilm; Electromagnetic field; Emitter clogging; Scale","Agricultural robots; Bacteria; Biofilms; Biofouling; Biogas; Carbonates; Electromagnetic fields; Environmental impact; Silicates; Adverse environmental impacts; Bacterial community; Bacterial species; Drip irrigation systems; Extra cellular polymers; Irrigation systems; Mineral precipitation; Physicochemical parameters; Irrigation; biogas; carbonic acid derivative; distilled water; mineral; phosphate; polymer; RNA 16S; silicate; silicon dioxide; biofuel; bacterium; biofouling; biogas; drip irrigation; electromagnetic field; environmental impact; inhibition; microbial community; physicochemical property; precipitation (climatology); slurry; agricultural slurry; Article; bacterial growth; biofilm; biofouling; community structure; controlled study; dry weight; electric conductivity; electromagnetism; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; human; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; precipitation; water quality; water supply; electromagnetism; irrigation (agriculture); Bacteria (microorganisms); Agricultural Irrigation; Biofilms; Biofouling; Biofuels; Electromagnetic Fields",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087218488

Previous studies estimated varying PM2.5-related mortality in China due to the usage of different source data, but rarely justify the data selection. To quantify the sensitivity of mortality assessment to source data, we first constructed state-of-the-art PM2.5 predictions during 2000–2018 at a 1-km resolution with an ensemble machine learning model that filled missing data explicitly. We also calibrated and fused various gridded population data with a geostatistical method. Then we assessed the PM2.5-related mortality with various PM2.5 predictions, population distributions, exposure-response functions, and baseline mortalities. We found that in addition to the well documented uncertainties in the exposure-response functions, missingness in PM2.5 prediction, PM2.5 prediction error, and prediction error in population distribution resulted to a 40.5%, 25.2% and 15.9% lower mortality assessment compared to the mortality assessed with the best-performed source data, respectively. With the best-performed source data, we estimated a total of approximately 25 million PM2.5-related mortality during 2001–2017 in China. From 2001 to 2017, The PM2.5 variations, growth and aging of population, decrease in baseline mortality led to a 7.8% increase, a 42.0% increase and a 24.6% decrease in PM2.5-related mortality, separately. We showed that with the strict clean air policies implemented in 2013, the population-weighted PM2.5 concentration decreased remarkably at an annual rate of 4.5 μg/m3, leading to a decrease of 179 thousand PM2.5-related deaths nationwide during 2013–2017.

Here, we describe a simple microwave accelerated approach to generate high surface area, ordered mesoporous carbons with controllable nitrogen content directly on a nickel foam framework. Cooperative assembly of phenolic resin (resol) and Pluronic F127 coated on the nickel foam provides a route to hierarchically structured composites to promote efficient transport, while melamine provides the nitrogen source. The strong interaction of microwaves with nickel rapidly and locally heats the precursors to yield nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon with high surface areas attached to the nickel foam within 3 min. As the microwave power is increased, the total nitrogen incorporated into the framework increases with a preference for pyridinic nitrogen. With this microwave assisted synthesis, the nitrogen content within the mesoporous carbons can approach 20 at%, while a relatively large average pore size (~7.5 nm) is obtained from the Pluronic template without any swelling agents or inorganic scaffold. To illustrate their potential, these nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons are demonstrated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with stable performance over 5000 cycles. This solid state microwave fabrication methodology produces highly nitrogen doped ordered mesoporous carbons with characteristics difficult to obtain with traditional soft templating and this methodology should be extendable to a wide range templates and heteroatom dopants. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","FDU-16; Heteroatom doped carbon; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Rapid thermal processing","Carbon; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Foams; Mesoporous materials; Microwaves; Morphology; Oxygen reduction reaction; Phenolic resins; Pore size; Co-operative assembly; Inorganic templates; Microwave assisted synthesis; Microwave fabrication; Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Pyridinic nitrogen; Stable performance; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091647966

The results reveal the influence of different divisions of a system on heterogeneity in carbon flows along metabolic pathways within the network. Paths of 18-node network were between 3 and 5 times than those of the 8-node network with 4% or less differences in carbon flows. The 8-node model provided a good overview of the system and revealed the key paths. However, it also concealed some important flows. In contrast, the 18-node model revealed the details of the flows and clarified the amplification effect of the socioeconomic components and the masking of the effect of natural components that occurred in the 8-node model. However, it was too complex to clearly reveal the key interactions. Therefore, we can choose the optimal division of a network model based on the specific problems we are trying to solve and the specific context. The application of 18-node network is suitable for moderately mature cities which are under the pressure of consolidation and urban adjustment.

Third, combining Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) with the entropy methods, the approach is utilized to calculate the index weights. Fourth, considering DMs' evaluation greyscale, grey fuzzy synthetic evaluation eliminates the defects caused by subjective preferences to a certain extent, which makes the evaluation results more reasonable. Fifth, sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are performed to verify the reliability of evaluation results.

However, when seeking cost savings and emission reductions, it is also important to consider thermal comfort. Thus, the overall and local thermal comfort of occupants were investigated during the experimental study while applying the demand response of space heating. Thermal manikin measurements were used to reveal the draught risk of convection flow caused by cold windows. Results show that when the surface temperature of windows was below 15 °C while the thermostat valves of the radiators were closed, the draught risk became unacceptable. The main objective of the simulation with the developed predictive control algorithm (MPC) was to show how much the minimization of draught risk by limiting minimum window surface temperature to 15 °C during decentralized demand response control effects heating energy cost-saving potential. Results show the maximum annual district heat energy cost saving by demand response control without minimization of draught risk is 4.8% and 3.8% with energy-efficient (U = 1.0 W/m2K) or poor (U = 2.6 W/m2K) windows respectively, but the draught risk is high with the poor windows. The minimization of draught risk has an insignificant effect on the cost-saving with the energy-efficient windows, but the cost-saving was reduced to 2.3% and draught risk significantly decreased with the poor windows. Thus, it is necessary to use the window temperature restriction with demand response control of radiator heating to prevent the draught risk of cold poorly insulated windows within the thermal comfort range. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Model predictive control; Optimization; Thermal comfort; Thermal manikin","Atmospheric temperature; District heating; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Model predictive control; Office buildings; Predictive control systems; Radiators; Surface properties; Thermal comfort; Convection flow; Demand response; Emission reduction; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient windows; Predictive control algorithm; Radiator heating; Surface temperatures; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092256173

Our empirical results reveal that the conventional polluting technology model is consistent with the two sub-technologies model, and that shadow prices estimated by different models differed in absolute values but shared the same growth trends and regional characteristics. Decomposition results according to the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) method indicate that variations in the shadow prices were due to the combined forces of the energy saving and end-of-pipe controlling effects in the analyzed periods. Moreover, we found that China's environmental regulations with regional disparities in recent years (2006–2016) have effectively reduced industrial air pollutant emissions at an increasing rate, and that the environmental taxes imposed in 2018 still followed the existing regional unbalances of environmental regulation stringency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposition effects; Environmental tax; Industrial air pollutant emissions; Shadow prices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081684319

This study focused on the long-term rutting resistance of WMA and their companion hot mix asphalt (HMA) based on 83 field samples collected from 28 field projects across the United States covering four climate zones, and quantified environmental impacts for various WMA technologies as compared to HMA. Field cores were evaluated by dynamic modulus, creep compliance, and Hamburg wheel-tracking device tests. Asphalt binders extracted from field cores were evaluated by continuous performance grading (PG), multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR), and monotonic shear tests. The results showed that WMA binders exhibited similar rutting resistance compared with the HMA binders after long-term field aging. Existence of polymer in the asphalt binder was displayed through the plot of non-recoverable creep compliance and percent recovery. The long-term field aged polymer modified asphalt binders for WMA and HMA were comparable. The results also showed that the CO2 reduction by using WMA ranged from 89.09% to 42.79% depending on WMA type. On average, the CO2 emission was reduced to 66.89% by using WMA technologies.

The inevitable interactions between water, energy, and food systems bring about trade-offs but also synergies under different decisions and policies. To gain insights into these issues, we developed a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus model that incorporates both production (supply) and demands sides of WEF systems into a single system-of-systems model using the system dynamics (SD) approach. The model is applied to Saskatchewan, Canada, and so is named WEF-Sask. The model results reveal the various levels of sensitivities of water, energy, and food (and feed) sectors to the socioeconomic and climatic drivers. The analysis of trade-offs and synergies shows that the proposed large irrigation expansion (400%) boosts food production by 1.6% while reducing hydropower production by 2.7% in Saskatchewan. Wind expansion strategy (from 5% to 30% of total capacity) makes synergies that not only contribute to electricity supply but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, industrial water demand, and groundwater use by 2.0, 5.7, and 3.8%, respectively. Biofuel use (blending mandate: 10% ethanol and 5% biodiesel) in transportation cuts GHG emissions by 1.2% but reduces the potential food export (food surplus) by 5.0%.

In this study, the projected changes and uncertainties of surface mean temperature over China and four subregions (Northern China, Northwestern China, Southern China, and Tibetan Plateau) are investigated under global warming of 1.5 and 2°C above pre-industrial levels under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios from 21 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model simulations and their multimodel ensemble mean (MMEM). In comparison with the observations over China, the most CMIP5 models can capture the observed warming patterns while the MMEM of surface mean temperature has a cold bias. Under global warming of 1.5/2°C, the MMEM of surface mean temperature over China, Northern China, Northwestern China, Southern China, and Tibetan Plateau under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) will increase by 1.82/2.6°C (1.83/2.52°C), 1.8/2.57°C (1.85/2.56°C), 1.99/2.76°C (1.97/2.76°C), 1.43/2.13°C (1.43/2.04°C), and 2.11/2.96°C (2.1/2.85°C), respectively.

Changes in climate are expected to exacerbate these impacts, particularly through increases and intensification of precipitation events during various times of the year. While decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are ultimately necessary to minimize changes in climate, best management practices (BMPs), such as reforestation, can serve as watershed climate adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of changes in air temperature and precipitation. The Meramec River Basin (MRB) in eastern Missouri is of economic and recreational importance and supports high levels of biodiversity. While much of the MRB is forested, various land transformations are increasing sediment inputs throughout the basin, and these contributions are expected to increase as climate changes. To address the potential of riparian reforestation to serve as a climate adaptation strategy in the MRB, we developed a Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to simulate streamflow and sediment transport throughout the basin. We then used model outputs characterizing spatial variation in sediment yields to identify critical source areas (CSAs) at the subbasin level. The application of a riparian buffer BMP was simulated in each CSA to quantify the effectiveness of this strategy in reducing sediment for contemporary conditions (1990–2009) as well as under three future climate scenarios for two time periods, 2040–2059 (mid-century) and 2080–2099 (late-century). For the contemporary period, the simulated addition of a riparian buffer BMP resulted in a projected 12.1% average reduction in surface sediment yield among CSAs. For the mid-century projection, subbasin surface sediment output is projected to increase by an average of 277.5% and 221.8% for the climate change scenario and the climate change + BMP scenario, respectively. In the late-century, respective increases in sediment for CSAs are estimated to be, on average, 690.7% and 528.3% for the climate change scenario and the climate change + BMP scenario. Results suggest that surface sediment yields will increase with climate change even with riparian buffer BMP applications. While adding a riparian buffer can potentially reduce sediment outputs, the reduction, on average, is likely inadequate to fully offset the impacts from changes in climate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Best management practice; Climate change; Critical source area; Freshwater ecosystems; Riparian buffer; Sediment","adaptive management; assessment method; best management practice; climate change; climate effect; greenhouse gas; precipitation (climatology); reforestation; riparian vegetation; runoff; sediment yield; soil erosion; spatial variation; watershed; Article; biodiversity; calibration; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; futurology; reforestation; riparian ecosystem; sediment transport; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; surface property; watershed management; agriculture; climate change; ecosystem; Missouri; river; Meramec River; Missouri; Missouri; United States; Agriculture; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Missouri; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092087370

In this study, the effectiveness of an emergency disk tube-reverse osmosis (DTRO) treatment system for such a refractory mature landfill leachate was evaluated. A molecular-level analysis was then applied to reveal the changes of the characteristics of leachate organic matter (OM). The DTRO system achieved >83% water recovery rate, reduced the electrical conductivity of effluent to 0.15–0.22 ms/cm, and reduced carbonaceous and nitrogenous pollutants to a level suitable for discharge. Furthermore, the vast majority of salts (e.g., chloride and sulfate ions), as well as refractory OM (e.g., humic- and fulvic-like substances), were effectively removed. The DTRO system can effectively remove a large number of macromolecular dissolved organic compounds with carbon number >23, as well as highly unsaturated compounds with DBE >12. Additionally, > 80% of the molecules assigned to the dissolved OM (DOM) were removed; even CHONS compounds with complex molecular structures were completely removed. The constitution of DOM in the DTRO effluent was simple, mainly comprising anti-sludge agents (e.g., small molecule alcohol and alkyl benzene sulfonic acid, etc.). However, the DOM in the resulting membrane concentrates was very similar to that in raw landfill leachate and the concentration was much higher. Therefore, an effective and feasible method should be developed to treat DTRO membrane concentrates because they pose high environmental risk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emergency treatment; High salinity; Mature leachate; Membrane concentrates; Molecular constitution","Biogeochemistry; Chlorine compounds; Effluents; Molecules; Organic carbon; Refractory materials; Reverse osmosis; Sulfur compounds; Unsaturated compounds; Water pollution; Alkyl-benzene sulfonic acids; Dissolved organic compounds; Electrical conductivity; Environmental risks; Landfill leachates; Reverse osmosis treatments; Treatment systems; Water recovery rates; Leachate treatment; alkyl group; benzene; carbon; chloride; dissolved organic matter; nitrogen; sodium chloride; sulfate; electrical conductivity; landfill; leachate; membrane; organic matter; pollutant removal; reverse osmosis; salinity; soil amendment; aquatic environment; Article; chemical oxygen demand; chemical structure; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; effluent; electric conductivity; emergency disk tube reverse osmosis; landfill leachate; macromolecule; municipal solid waste; reverse osmosis; salinity; sludge; water pollution; water quality; water supply; China; filtration; osmosis; waste disposal; water pollutant; China; China; Filtration; Osmosis; Refuse Disposal; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091113401

Producing advanced fuels (such as biomethane) and bio-based valorised products (such as pyrochar) may offer a solution to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with energy and agricultural circular economy systems. Biological and thermochemical bioenergy technologies, together with power to gas (P2G) systems can generate green renewable gas, which is essential to reduce the GHG footprint of industry. However, each technology faces challenges with respect to sustainability and conversion efficiency. Here this study identifies an optimal pathway, leading to a sustainable bioenergy system where the carbon released in the fuel is offset by the GHG savings of the circular bio-based system. It provides a state-of-the-art review of individual technologies and proposes a bespoke circular cascading bio-based system with anaerobic digestion as the key platform, integrating electro-fuels via P2G systems and value-added pyrochar via pyrolysis of solid digestate. The mass and energy analysis suggests that a reduction of 11% in digestate mass flow with the production of pyrochar, bio-oil and syngas and an increase of 70% in biomethane production with the utilization of curtailed or constrained electricity can be achieved in the proposed bio-based system, enabling a 70% increase in net energy output as compared with a conventional biomethane system. However, the carbon footprint of the electricity from which the hydrogen is sourced is shown to be a critical parameter in assessing the GHG balance of the bespoke system. © 2020 The Authors","Anaerobic digestion; Biomass pretreatment; Biomethane; Circular cascading bio-based system; Power to gas; Pyrochar","Agricultural robots; Anaerobic digestion; Carbon footprint; Fuels; Gas emissions; Green manufacturing; Synthesis gas manufacture; Bio-energy systems; Bioenergy technology; Circular economy; Gas technologies; Individual technology; Mass and energy analysis; State-of-the art reviews; Transportation sector; Greenhouse gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091736712

Changes in tropical forest cover are expected to affect carbon and water cycling with important implications for climatic stability at global scales. A major roadblock for predicting how tropical deforestation affects climate is the lack of baseline conditions (i.e., prior to human disturbance) of forest–savanna dynamics. To address this limitation, we developed a long-term analysis of forest and savanna distribution across the Amazon–Cerrado transition of central Brazil. We used soil organic carbon isotope ratios as a proxy for changes in woody vegetation cover over time in response to fluctuations in precipitation inferred from speleothem oxygen and strontium stable isotope records. Based on stable isotope signatures and radiocarbon activity of organic matter in soil profiles, we quantified the magnitude and direction of changes in forest and savanna ecosystem cover. Using changes in tree cover measured in 83 different locations for forests and savannas, we developed interpolation maps to assess the coherence of regional changes in vegetation. Our analysis reveals a broad pattern of woody vegetation expansion into savannas and densification within forests and savannas for at least the past ~1,600 years. The rates of vegetation change varied significantly among sampling locations possibly due to variation in local environmental factors that constrain primary productivity. The few instances in which tree cover declined (7.7% of all sampled profiles) were associated with savannas under dry conditions. Our results suggest a regional increase in moisture and expansion of woody vegetation prior to modern deforestation, which could help inform conservation and management efforts for climate change mitigation. We discuss the possible mechanisms driving forest expansion and densification of savannas directly (i.e., increasing precipitation) and indirectly (e.g., decreasing disturbance) and suggest future research directions that have the potential to improve climate and ecosystem models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon; climatic change; forest–savanna dynamics; stable isotopes; woody expansion","cerrado; climate effect; climate variation; deforestation; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; rainforest; savanna; soil profile; stable isotope; tree; vegetation cover; Amazonia; Brazil; carbon; Brazil; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; grassland; human; soil; tree; Brazil; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Grassland; Humans; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094670180

There have been calls for a more coordinated approach to planning for current and future flood risks, but is planning rising to the challenge? We apply the Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard (PIRS) methodology to spatially evaluate policies that would impact physical vulnerability to flooding in the network of different city plans that shape land use and steer development in Boston, MA and Fort Lauderdale, FL. Unlike previous applications of this approach, we look at how the plan network is changing over time. Between 2015 and 2019, attention on climate change grew in both cities, as did the number of plans and policies across the network with the potential to decrease physical vulnerability. New types of plans, such as climate change adaptation plans, play an important role in reducing flood risks. However, plans perpetuate past disparities in policy attention. As the first study to analyze how city networks of plans and their potential impact on resilience evolve over time, this work has important implications for planning scholarship and practice as well as hazard and climate change governance more broadly. © 2021 The Authors","Flooding; Longitudinal; Network of plans; Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard; Resilience; Sea Level Rise",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114333910

Strategy focusing on increased resource efficiency and reduced P losses is becoming a challenge. P mass flows through food consumption system was performed in Pathumthani city. The purposes of this study are (1) to develop a P balance model using mass balance approach as a tool and (2) to identify and quantify the potential source for P recovery and recycle. Results of P balance showed that P of approximately 1,856 tons were entered to Pathumthani via food consumption system with 85% collection efficiency. Due to the insufficient wastes sorting, only 10% of P contained in food waste (FW) was utilized at composting center. The remaining P, amounted to 1,217 tons, was entirely ended up in landfill. This led to a clear conclusion that current FW practice is reducing the ability to recover P from waste since most of P was deposited in landfill. Therefore, recycling FW as well as P into a value-added product i.e. soil conditioner via composting process, the simplest alternative method for FW management, was recommended for this study. In addition, environmental and financial benefits gained from FW composting scenario were estimated. Recovery of about 1,217 tons per year into soil conditioning material, landfill emission reduction of 105 thousand tons carbon dioxide equivalent per year along with disposal cost saving of 6 million baht per year can be potentially achieved if FW was preliminary sorted at home. © 2021, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment.

Previous analyses have found that the share that PHEVs are driven in electric mode can differ substantially depending on region, battery size, and trip purpose. Here, we provide a first fleet-wide emissions mitigation potential of US-based PHEV drivers adopting high or low shares of electric driving. Specifically, we illustrate scenarios of different combinations of PHEV uptake, renewable electricity generation shares, and PHEV fueling behavior. Across 21 analyzed scenarios, annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet could differ by an average of 21% (5-43% range) in 2050 depending alone on the fueling behavior of PHEV drivers. This behavior could further determine the discharge of about 1.3 (0.7-1.9) Gt CO2 (or roughly one year of current emissions) over the next three decades, significantly influencing the feasibility of reaching an 80% emission reduction target for the LDV sector. Governments can nudge PHEV drivers toward environmentally favorable fueling behavior. We discuss several options for nudging, including charging infrastructure availability, battery design, and consumer education. ©",,"Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fleet operations; Fueling; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Light weight vehicles; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging infrastructures; Consumer education; Current emissions; Emission reduction targets; Emissions mitigation; Light duty vehicles; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Renewable electricity; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; fuel; gasoline; renewable fuel; climate effect; electric vehicle; fuel; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; combustion; consumer; driver; electricity; energy; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; human; plug in hybrid electric vehicle; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomics; traffic and transport; United States; car driving; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; motor vehicle; power supply; United States; Automobile Driving; Electric Power Supplies; Electricity; Greenhouse Gases; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098775977

Given the potential of seasonal acclimation to reduce the impact of climate change on the dynamics of ectotherm populations, the adaptive evolution of this reversible plasticity has received much attention. Nevertheless, the key assumption of selection on the magnitude of seasonal acclimation, consistent among-individual variation (repeatability), remains unexplored. We studied the short- (across body temperatures) and long-term (over two consecutive years) repeatability of seasonal acclimation on standard metabolic rate (SMR) and spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) in two sympatric newt taxa, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. We exposed the newts to various fluctuating thermal regimes over spring and summer and measured SMR and SLA at three body temperatures in each individual over two consecutive years. We quantified seasonal acclimation as difference between summer and spring trait values. We show that individuals of both species vary substantially in their seasonal acclimation responses. Body temperature affected the population means of seasonal acclimation in a quadratic I. alpestris or linear L. vulgaris fashion. Both short- and long-term repeatability of SMR and SLA seasonal acclimation were poor and both species varied in the amount of total variation in the plastic response. Seasonal shifts in environmental temperatures showed high variation between years, but with no apparent trend attributable to local climate change. Our results demonstrate that seasonal SMR and SLA acclimation prevents the establishment of a consistent relationship between individual trait values and environmental gradients, which may limit the adaptive evolution of this plastic response. Disparate thermal dependence patterns and the amount of total variation in seasonal acclimation suggest a species-specific ability for coping with stochasticity of seasonal variation in the thermal environment. To sum up, information on individual variation and population means measured across ecologically realistic body temperatures is necessary to fully understand the occurrence of seasonal acclimation across taxa and its role in the adaptive capacity to climate change.

Reduced life history diversity within these populations inhibits their ability to respond to these stressors. Putah Creek, a small creek in California’s Central Valley that once supported Chinook Salmon, is undergoing restoration to provide spawning habitats for this imperiled species. Beginning in 2014, increasing numbers of Chinook Salmon spawned throughout the creek, and emigrating juveniles were observed in the following months. Here we used otolith annual growth bands and microchemistry to investigate the age structure and natal origins of the adult spawners. Most individuals were 2 or 3 years old, and they originated from at least seven different natal sources, overwhelmingly from Central Valley hatcheries (~88%). These findings highlight that straying fall-run Central Valley Chinook Salmon can rapidly utilize restored habitats, potentially establishing new populations. However, to facilitate local adaptations, straying rates and gene flow will have to be managed over time. Reconnecting migratory pathways and restoring many small and diverse streams, like Putah Creek, provides an opportunity to increase life history diversity, strengthening the recovery and resilience of Chinook Salmon. © 2020 American Fisheries Society",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099207888

This study explores public perceptions of applying CCS technology at the Port Talbot Steelworks in South Wales. Opinions of local residents were gathered by means of two focus groups. Participants were concerned about the impact of implementing CCS on the competitiveness of the plant and, as a consequence, the possibility of closure. Perceived positive impacts were that a CCS facility would improve local air quality as well as the town's public image, bringing inward investment. Acceptance or otherwise of CCS was found to be influenced by trust. Participants expressed particular distrust towards the local steel firm and various levels of Government, citing poor engagement, whilst showing tentative trust towards scientific/research organisations. Most participants saw emission reducing technologies as an inevitability, with most considering CCS to be of benefit to the Port Talbot Steelworks.

Fast ecological responses closely track climate change, slow responses substantively lag climate forcing, causing disequilibria and reduced fitness, and abrupt responses are characterized by nonlinear, threshold-type responses at rates that are large relative to background variability and forcing. All three kinds of climate-driven ecological dynamics are well documented in contemporary studies, palaeoecology and invasion biology. This fast–slow–abrupt conceptual framework helps unify a bifurcated climate-change literature, which tends to separately consider the ecological risks posed by slow or abrupt ecological dynamics. Given the prospect of ongoing climate change for the next several decades to centuries of the Anthropocene and wide variations in ecological rates of change, the theory and practice of managing ecological systems should shift attention from target states to target rates. A rates-focused framework broadens the strategic menu for managers to include options to both slow and accelerate ecological rates of change, seeks to reduce mismatch among climate and ecological rates of change, and provides a unified conceptual framework for tackling the distinct risks associated with fast, slow and abrupt ecological rates of change. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; ecosystem; Climate Change; Ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097312836

This study on hypoxia in Long Island Sound (LIS), a large urbanized estuary, focuses on responses to managed nitrogen load reductions and climate change. At the analyzed station in western LIS, warming in bottom waters (0.8 °C per decade) favors hypoxia. Total nitrogen concentrations have decreased (0.06 mg L-1 per decade) with load reductions, but no linear temporal trend in chlorophyll is discernible. Bottom dissolved oxygen has increased (0.48 mg L-1 per decade), despite warming-induced solubility decreases (0.13 mg L-1 per decade). Decreasing trends in hypoxic area and volume (100 km2 and 1 km3 per decade) reflect improved conditions and are coincident with reducing loads. Regressions link hypoxic extent to nitrogen loads, chlorophyll, salinity, and winds. Though mitigation has reduced hypoxia, these improvements will not be sustained in the warming climate without continued intervention. The warming-induced oxygen solubility decrease forecasted for 2099 (0.4 mg L-1) would erode 35% of the observed oxygen gains.

It investigates the California electricity market (zone SP15) for selected trading hours using data from January 8, 2013 to September 24, 2016. The approach quantifies a non-linear relationship between the fundamentals and electricity prices, just as predicted by the merit order curve. Natural gas, greenhouse gas allowance prices and load all have a positive effect on electricity prices, with the effect increasing with the quantiles. In contrast, solar production and wind production both have a negative effect on electricity prices. The effect of solar production increases with quantiles, whereas the effect of wind production decreases with quantiles. This paper also includes a stress testing case study in which a producer faces the risk of high solar and wind production, and investigates the effect on the lower tail of the price distribution.

Plant roots accelerate weathering by elevating soil CO2 via respiration. It however remains poorly understood how and how much rooting characteristics (e.g., depth and density distribution) modify flow paths and weathering.We address this knowledge gap using field data from and reactive transport numerical experiments at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (Konza), Kansas (USA), a site where woody encroachment into grasslands is surmised to deepen roots. Results indicate that deepening roots can enhance weathering in two ways. First, deepening roots can control thermodynamic limits of carbonate dissolution by regulating how much CO2 transports vertical downward to the deeper carbonate-rich zone. The base-case data and model from Konza reveal that concentrations of Ca and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are regulated by soil pCO2 driven by the seasonal soil respiration. This relationship can be encapsulated in equations derived in this work describing the dependence of Ca and DIC on temperature and soil CO2. The relationship can explain spring water Ca and DIC concentrations from multiple carbonate-dominated catchments. Second, numerical experiments show that roots control weathering rates by regulating recharge (or vertical water fluxes) into the deeper carbonate zone and export reaction products at dissolution equilibrium. The numerical experiments explored the potential effects of partitioning 40% of infiltrated water to depth in woodlands compared to 5% in grasslands. Soil CO2 data suggest relatively similar soil CO2 distribution over depth, which in woodlands and grasslands leads only to 1% to ∼12% difference in weathering rates if flow partitioning was kept the same between the two land covers. In contrast, deepening roots can enhance weathering by ∼17% to 200% as infiltration rates increased from 3.7×10-2 to 3.7 m/a. Weathering rates in these cases however are more than an order of magnitude higher than a case without roots at all, underscoring the essential role of roots in general. Numerical experiments also indicate that weathering fronts in woodlands propagated >2 times deeper compared to grasslands after 300 years at an infiltration rate of 0.37 m/a. These differences in weathering fronts are ultimately caused by the differences in the contact times of CO2-charged water with carbonate in the deep subsurface. Within the limitation of modeling exercises, these data and numerical experiments prompt the hypothesis that (1) deepening roots in woodlands can enhance carbonate weathering by promoting recharge and CO2-carbonate contact in the deep subsurface and (2) the hydrological impacts of rooting characteristics can be more influential than those of soil CO2 distribution in modulating weathering rates. We call for colocated characterizations of roots, subsurface structure, and soil CO2 levels, as well as their linkage to water and water chemistry. These measurements will be essential to illuminate feedback mechanisms of land cover changes, chemical weathering, global carbon cycle, and climate. © 2021 Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; carbonate; catchment; chemical weathering; concentration (composition); dissolution; experimental study; grassland; inorganic carbon; numerical method; recharge; respiration; rooting; soil carbon; Kansas; Konza Prairie; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099035011

Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. However, country-wide ground-based PM2.5 records only date back to 2013. To reveal the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5, long-term and high-spatial-resolution aerosol optical depths, generated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, were employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a 1 km resolution using our proposed Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model. Our model can capture well variations in PM2.5 concentrations at different spatiotemporal scales, with higher accuracies (i.e., cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R2 = 0.86–0.90) and stronger predictive powers (i.e., R2 = 0.80–0.82) than previously reported. The resulting PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM2.5) provides the longest record (i.e., 2000 to 2018) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km, enabling the study of PM2.5 variation patterns at different scales. In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions combating air pollution in China. While nationwide PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by 0.89 μg/m3/yr (p &lt; 0.001) during the last two decades, the reduction has accelerated to 4.08 μg/m3/yr (p &lt; 0.001) over the last six years, indicating a significant improvement in air quality. Large improvements occurred in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas, while the most polluted region remained the North China Plain, especially in winter. The ChinaHighPM2.5 dataset will enable more insightful analyses regarding the causes and attribution of pollution over medium- or small-scale areas. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","1 km resolution; ChinaHighPM2.5; MODIS; PM2.5; Space-Time Extra-Trees model","Air quality; Health risks; Image resolution; Public policy; Radiometers; Remote sensing; River pollution; Air pollution in chinas; Coefficient of determination; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); High spatial resolution; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Satellite remote sensing; Spatio-temporal variation; Trees (mathematics); aerosol composition; air quality; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; data quality; MODIS; particle size; particulate matter; spatial resolution; China; North China Plain; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094318705

We conducted an aboveground litterfall manipulation experiment in different-aged Betula platyphylla forests (25-, 40-and 61-year-old) of the permafrost region, located in the northeast of China, during May to October in 2018, with each stand treated with doubling litter (litter addition, DL), litter exclusion (no-litter, NL) and control litter (CK). Our results indicated that Rs decreased under NL treatment compared with CK treatment. The effect size lessened with the increase in the stand age; the greatest reduction was found for young Betula platyphylla forest (24.46% for 25-year-old stand) and tended to stabilize with the growth of forest with the reduction of 15.65% and 15.23% for 40-and 61-year-old stands, respectively. Meanwhile, under DL treatment, Rs increased by 27.38%, 23.83% and 23.58% on 25-, 40-and 61-year-old stands, respectively. Our results also showed that the increase caused by DL treatment was larger than the reduction caused by NL treatment, leading to a priming effect, especially on 40-and 61-year-old stands. The change in litter input was the principal factor affecting the change of Rs under litter manipulation. The soil temperature was also a main factor affecting the contribution rate of litter to Rs of different-aged stands, which had a significant positive exponential correlation with Rs. This suggests that there is a significant relationship between litter and Rs, which consequently influences the soil carbon cycle in Betula platyphylla forests of the permafrost region, Northeast China. Our finding indicated the increased litter enhanced the Rs in Betula platyphylla forest, which may consequently increase the carbon emission in a warming climate in the future. It is of great importance for future forest management in the permafrost region, Northeast China. © 2021 by the authors.

Our purpose is to evaluate the effects of different irrigation methods (flood irrigation and drip irrigation) and irrigation water salinities (1.1 g·L−1, 2.0 g·L−1, 3.5 g·L−1, and 5.0 g·L−1) on the soil CO2 emissions during the growth and fallow periods of spring maize. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conducted in Hetao Irrigation District in China from 2017 to 2019. The results showed that compared with flood irrigation, drip irrigation significantly decreased the soil CO2 emissions in the growth period. After irrigation with a salinity of 5.0 g·L−1, the soil moisture was the highest because the plant water absorption was inhabited by soil salt, and the soil CO2 emissions were also promoted during the growth period. Irrigation method and irrigation water salinity had no effect on the soil CO2 emissions in the fallow period. Soil temperature, moisture and inorganic nitrogen content were the main factors affecting the daily CO2 emission flux. The soil CO2 emissions during the growth period accounted for more than 83.93% of the annual soil emissions. Based on the goal of saving freshwater resources, ensuring soil safety, reducing soil CO2 emissions and increasing the size of the carbon pool, adoption of drip irrigation with 2.0 g·L−1 brackish water could be adopted to ensure the sustainable development of local agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Brackish water; Drip irrigation; Hetao Irrigation District; Maize growth; Soil CO2 emissions; Soil properties","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Floods; Soil moisture; Water absorption; Water resources; Field experiment; Flood irrigation; Fresh water resources; Hetao irrigation districts; Inorganic nitrogen; Irrigation methods; Irrigation waters; Soil temperature; Irrigation; bicarbonate; calcium; chloride; magnesium; nitrogen; organic carbon; potassium; sodium; soil organic matter; sulfate; agricultural land; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; drip irrigation; irrigation system; maize; soil moisture; soil pollution; soil quality; adsorption; air temperature; Article; autumn; carbon footprint; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric conductivity; environmental protection; fallow; fertilizer application; freshwater environment; gravimetry; growing season; harvest; harvesting; irrigation (agriculture); maize; nonhuman; plant growth; plant water content; plowing; principal component analysis; priority journal; salinity; soil moisture; soil temperature; water absorption; China; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090024928

The PAH distributions in air, rhizosphere soil, and surface soil were markedly different. This indicated that root morphology variations and root exudates may affect PAH compositions in soil around plants. The PAH concentrations in the plant samples were 29.7–2170 ng/g. The lowest PAH concentration was found in a peeled taproot sample. The PAH concentration gradients from the plant shoots to roots suggested that PAHs entered the plants through various pathways. The three- and four-ring PAHs were found to be absorbed more readily than the higher-molecular-weight (five- and six-ring) PAHs. This indicated that high-molecular-weight PAHs in soil can be prevented from entering plants, particularly taproots, via root exudates and the root peel. For most plants, the highest PAH concentrations were found in leaves, indicating that atmospheric deposition may strongly affect PAH concentrations in aerial plant parts. High-molecular-weight PAHs are more readily absorbed from ambient air by leaves than other parts. Lower PAH concentrations were found in fruits than other plant parts. This and the differences in PAH distributions between fruits and other aerial parts indicated that PAHs may be selectively absorbed by fruits. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","E-waste; PAHs; Plants; Translocation; Uptake","biochemical composition; biological uptake; cultivation; electronic waste; PAH; root-shoot ratio; spatial distribution; waste disposal; China; Taizhou; Zhejiang; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; China; environmental monitoring; soil pollutant; waste disposal facility; China; Environmental Monitoring; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Soil Pollutants; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090302762

We have used primary data from long-term field experiments and commercial plantations to create production and economic models that also include an analysis of competitive ability with conventional crops. Our results showed that current economic conditions favor annual crops over Miscanthus (for energy biomass) and that this new crop shows very good adaptation to the effects of climate change. Selected clones of Miscanthus × giganteus reached high biomass yields between 15–17 t DM ha−1 y−1 despite very dry and warm periods and low-input agrotechnology, and they have good potential to become important biomass crops for future bioenergy and the bioe-conomy. Key barriers and factors are identified, including gene pool and agronomy improvement, change of subsidy policy (Common agriculture policy-CAP), climate change trends, and further development of the bioeconomy. © 2021 by the authors.

Against the backdrop of this problem, several models of improved biomass cookstoves (ICSs) have been developed and distributed in the country. Yet, little is known about the effect of these ICSs on household's fuelwood consumption and the environment. The aim of this study was to examine the potential woodfuel savings, economic and environmental effects of three ICSs (Mirt, Gonziye, and Tikikil) in rural Ethiopia from a cross-sectional study of 605 sample households and direct energy consumption measurements in four rural districts. Inferential statistics and cost-benefit analysis were used to analyse the data. The results showed that compared with the traditional open fire tripod; the use of ICSs could reduce household's fuelwood consumptions on average by 1.72–2.08 tons per household per year. These fuelwood savings translate to potential emissions reductions of 2.82–3.43 tCO2e per stove per year. The results from the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) indicated that investment in these ICSs could provide a net economic benefit of ETB 7204 to 10,381 (US$ 265 to 382) during the 2–5 years lifespan of the stoves. The benefit-cost ratios of these ICSs were calculated between 16.5:1 and 35.0:1. The implication is that promoting the use of Mirt, Gonziye and Tikikil stoves is a viable option and an essential component of the strategy for improving the energy-efficiency and well-being of rural communities while also contributing to the sustainable utilization of biomass resources, and mitigation of climate change in Ethiopia and beyond. © 2020 The Author(s)","CO2 emissions; Cost-benefit analysis; Fuel-savings; Improved biomass cook-stoves; Reduction; Rural households; Sustainable biomass utilization","Biomass; Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Investments; Stoves; Wood products; Benefit cost ratios; Cross-sectional study; Emissions reduction; Energy consumption measurements; Environmental security; Fuelwood consumption; Inferential statistics; Sustainable utilization; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094623668

Methods: We collected daily concentrations of particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5, PM10 and PMcoarse), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and admissions for AECOPD for 21 cities in Guangdong from 2013 to 2017. We examined the association of air pollution with AECOPD admissions using two-stage time-series analysis, and estimated the annual attributable fractions, numbers, and direct hospitalization costs of AECOPD admissions with principal component analysis. Results: From 2013–2017, mean daily concentrations of SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 declined by nearly 40%, 30%, and 26% respectively. As the average daily 8 h O3 concentration increased considerably, the number of days exceeding WHO target (i.e.,100 μg/m³) increased from 103 in 2015–152 in 2017. For each interquartile range increase in pollutant concentration, the relative risks of AECOPD admission at lag 0–3 were 1.093 (95% CI 1.06–1.13) for PM2.5, 1.092 (95% CI 1.08–1.11) for O3, and 1.092 (95% CI 1.05–1.14) for SO2. Attributable fractions of AECOPD admission advanced by air pollution declined from 9.5% in 2013 to 4.9% in 2016, then increased to 6.0% in 2017. A similar declining trend was observed for direct AECOPD hospitalization costs. Conclusion: Declined attributable hospital admissions for AECOPD may be associated with the reduction in concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 in Guangdong, while O3 has emerged as an important risk factor. Summarizes the main finding of the work： Reduction in PM may result in declined attributable hospitalizations for AECOPD, while O3 has emerged as an important risk factor following an intervention. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; COPD; Ecological study; Intervention","carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; concentration (composition); health impact; pollution effect; risk factor; time series analysis; aged; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; chronic obstructive lung disease; city; controlled study; disease exacerbation; ecological study; female; hospital admission; hospitalization cost; human; male; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; principal component analysis; time series analysis; trend study; types of study; air pollutant; air pollution; chronic obstructive lung disease; hospital; hospitalization; particulate matter; risk factor; toxicity; China; Guangdong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Monoxide; China; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Risk Factors; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096231848

Multifaceted health effects of PM2.5 have raised broader, stronger concerns in recent years, calling for comprehensive environmental health-risk assessments to offer new insights into air-pollution control. However, there have been few studies adopting local air-quality-monitoring datasets or local coefficients related to PM2.5 health-risk assessment. This study aims to assess health effects caused by PM2.5 concentrations and metal toxicity using epidemiological and toxicological methods based on long-term (2007–2017) hourly monitoring datasets of PM2.5 concentrations in four cities of Taiwan. The results indicated that (1) PM2.5 concentrations and hazardous substances varied substantially from region to region, (2) PM2.5 concentrations significantly decreased after 2013, which benefited mainly from two actions against air pollution, i.e., implementing air-pollution-control strategies and raising air-quality standards for certain emission sources, and (3) under the condition of low PM2.5 concentrations, high health risks occurred in eastern Taiwan on account of toxic substances adsorbed on PM2.5 surface. It appears that under the condition of low PM2.5 concentrations, the results of epidemiological and toxicological health-risk assessments may not agree with each other. This raises a warning that air-pollution control needs to consider toxic substances adsorbed in PM2.5 and region-oriented control strategies are desirable. We hope that our findings and the proposed transferable methodology can call on domestic and foreign authorities to review current air-pollution-control policies with an outlook on the toxicity of PM2.5. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Epidemiology; Health risk; Heavy metal; Impact assessment; PM2.5; Toxicology","Air quality; Air quality standards; Health; Health risks; Quality control; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Air quality monitoring; Atmospheric fine particles; Cardio-pulmonary function; Chemical compositions; Environmental health risk assessment; Foreign authorities; Hazardous substances; PM2.5 concentration; Air pollution control; aluminum; arsenic; barium; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; heavy metal; lead; manganese; nickel; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; selenium; toxic substance; vanadium; zinc; air quality; concentration (composition); data set; health risk; long-term change; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution monitoring; public health; risk assessment; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air quality standard; Article; atmospheric diffusion; dangerous goods; economic development; health hazard; industrial production; industrialization; meteorology; motorcycle; particulate matter 2.5; Taiwan; toxicology; urbanization; adverse event; air pollutant; analysis; city; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096088940

Although reverse cycle defrosting is widely used, no information is available in the transcritical carbon dioxide system. In this paper, the reverse cycle defrosting was experimentally investigated in a transcritical carbon dioxide heat pump with a microchannel evaporator. The effect of water flow rate, initial water tank temperature, compressor frequency and electronic expansion valve opening are respectively studied, and an optimized control strategy is proposed considering the defrosting time and stability. Results show that thermal energy is considerably affected by water side parameters, and stability is more sensitive to the water temperature and electronic expansion valve opening.

Sharply reduced sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations during the festival holiday resulted in an unexpected increase in the surface ozone (O3) concentration caused by the strong O3- titration phenomenon. Simultaneously, the reduced anthropogenic emissions resulted in massive decreases in particle number concentration at all sizes and the mass concentrations of organics and black carbon. However, the mass concentrations of inorganics (especially sulfate) decreased weakly. Detailed analyses of the sulfur oxidation ratio and the nitrogen oxidation ratio suggest that sulfate formation during the holiday could be promoted by enhanced nocturnal aqueousphase chemical reactions between SO2 and O3 under moderate relative humidity (RH) conditions (40%<RH<80 %). Daytime photochemical reactions in winter in Beijing mainly controlled nitrate formation, which was enhanced a little during the holiday. A regional analysis of air pollution patterns shows that the enhanced formation of secondary aerosols occurred throughout the entire Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during the holiday, partly offsetting the decrease in particle matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm. Our results highlight the necessary control of O3 formation to reduce secondary pollution in winter under current emission conditions. © Author(s) 2021.",,"aerosol formation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; festival; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; physicochemical property; sulfur dioxide; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100295741

However, the fast discharge phenomenon in a high electric field in transformers using synthetic ester seems to indicate its insulation property is inferior to that of mineral oil. In this paper, typical molecular models of synthetic ester, including F2, F4, F6, F8, and F10, are constructed. We studied the effect of electric fields on the molecular properties of the five molecules by density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory. According to the electric field intensity required for discharge initiation and propagation in insulating oil, the electric field intensity applied in this study varied from 108 to 109 V/m. The results showed that the molecular bond lengths are obviously dependent on the electric field. The ionization potential (IP) of the F8 and F10 molecules decreases sharply under electric field intensities of 3.1 × 109 and 4.0 × 109 V/m. It can be inferred that the IP reduction of the long carbon chain molecules, such as F8 and F10, is the reason for the formation of fast discharge in the case of synthesis ester. Calculations for excited states show that the introduction of an electric field makes the electron transition more active. The results obtained by this work improve our understanding of the discharge mechanism in synthetic ester dielectrics and provide theoretical support for improvement in the performance of synthetic ester insulating oil. © 2021 Yachao Wang et al., published by De Gruyter.","density functional theory; discharge mechanism; excited state; molecular structure; synthetic ester",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119971825

COVID-19 has important impacts on the environment as anthropic interventions to nature has been largely reduced after almost all countries implemented partial or complete blockade to curb the spread of the virus. Up to now, a series of studies have focused on the relationship between COVID-19 and the environment from different cities. In this review, we summarized the latest data on the correlation between COVID-19 and environmental changes. As a result, imposing necessary restrictions can help suppress the virus chain while improving air quality in some countries. The significant reduction in NO2 emission, PM2.5 level and other hazardous factors reflected the promising consequence of the efforts made during the lockdown period. It is, sometimes dark clouds have silver linings. It is worth noting that along with these positive outcomes, secondary pollutants such as ozone, however, remained unchanged or even increased significantly. Additionally, medical wastes and plastics pollutants would be increased substantially. The extensive use of masks in daily life and other medical materials is bound to increase the burden of waste disposal and environmental degradation. For the general public, in addition to the physical lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2, confirmed/suspected cases and even the normal group may suffer from mental problems. Based on those mentioned impacts, the way forward depends largely on our attitude and decision. It is indispensable to assess potential deleterious effects and to take preventive measures in time to respond to the post-pandemic era. In this way, potential silver linings will not become temporary. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Environmental pollution; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Particulate matter; Plastic pollution; Psychological trauma; Public health","Air quality; Functional polymers; Silver; Viruses; Waste disposal; Ambient environment; Deleterious effects; Environmental change; General publics; Medical materials; Medical wastes; Mental problems; Preventive measures; Diseases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099858399

Climate change leads to changes in vegetation, resulting in different CUE values, especially on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the most climate-sensitive regions in the world. However, the change trend and the intrinsic mechanism of climate effects on CUE in the future climate change scenario are not clear in this region. Based on the scheme of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6), we analyze the simulation results of the five models of the scenario model intercomparison project (ScenarioMIP) under three different typical future climate scenarios, including SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2015–2100 with methods of model-averaging to average the long-term forecast of the five several well-known forecast models for three alternative climate scenarios with three radiative forcing levels to discuss the CUE changes and a structural equations modeling (SEM) approach to examine how the trends in GPP, NPP, and CUE related to different climate factors. The results show that (1) GPP and NPP demonstrated an upward trend in a long time series of 86 years, and the upward trend became increasingly substantial with the increase in radiation forcing; (2) the ecosystem CUE of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will decrease in the long time series in the future, and it shows a substantial decreasing trend with the increase in radiation forcing; and (3) the dominant climate factor affecting CUE is temperature of the factors included in these models, which affects CUE mainly through GPP and NPP to produce indirect effects. Temperature has a higher comprehensive effect on CUE than precipitation and CO2, which are negative effects on CUE on an annual scale. Our finding that the CUE decreases in the future suggests that we must pay more attention to the vegetation and CUE changes, which will produce great effects on the regional carbon dynamics and balance. © 2020 by the authors.

As the critical precursors of the formation of ozone, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can adversely affect the atmospheric environment. In order to obtain reliable data on the sources and pollution characteristics of VOCs and ozone in the city for precise emission reduction, the concentrations of VOCs and ozone in Xi'an city were monitored by navigation observation using both a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) and differential absorption lidar. Three different functional areas were selected, including a residential area (RA), a commercial district (CD), and an industrial park (IP). The PTR-TOF-MS measurement results found total concentrations of VOCs (TVOCs) with mean values of 136 ppb, 175 ppb, and 267 ppb at RA, CD, and IP sites, respectively. The dominant category of VOCs was oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) at all three sites, accounting for 86%, 81%, and 75% of TVOCs at the RA, CD, and IP sites, respectively. Among OVOCs and aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs), acetone and toluene were the predominant chemical species, accounting for 51% and 58% at the IP site, respectively. Propylene was the most abundant aliphatic hydrocarbon (ALH) at the RA and CD sites, accounting for 42% and 48% of the TVOCs, respectively. The average ozone formation potentials (OFP) of the measured VOCs were 546 μg/m3, 574 μg/m3, and 772 μg/m3 at the RA, CD, and IP sites, respectively; OVOCs were the dominant contributors to OFP at all three sites. Ozone concentrations were measured by differential absorption lidar, with mean values of 82 μg/m3, 92 μg/m3, and 117 μg/m3 at the RA, CD, and IP sites, respectively. Ozone concentration was correlated to VOCs concentration. Local meteorological conditions including wind speed and air pressure influenced VOCs and ozone concentrations. The assessment of the measurement results of local environmental protection departments indicated that forming relevant VOCs and ozone control policies and priority strategies should be considered in order to reduce the adverse effects of these pollutants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Differential absorption lidar; Ozone; Pollution characteristics; PTR-TOF-MS; Volatile organic compounds","Acetone; Aliphatic hydrocarbons; Emission control; Inductively coupled plasma; Mass spectrometers; Optical radar; Ozone; Proton transfer; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Wind; Atmospheric environment; Concentration monitoring; Differential absorption lidars; Environmental protection departments; Meteorological condition; Ozone formation potentials; Proton transfer reactions; Time-of-flight mass spectrometers; Air pollution; 1,3 butadiene; acetone; aliphatic hydrocarbon; aromatic hydrocarbon; halogenated hydrocarbon; ozone; propylene; proton; toluene; volatile organic compound; Afrotropic Ecozone; air quality; aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); industrial emission; industrial location; lidar; ozone; volatile organic compound; absorption; air pollution; air pollution control; air pressure; air sampling; ambient air; Article; atmospheric diffusion; atmospheric pressure; China; circadian rhythm; controlled study; electric field; environmental protection; humidity; meteorology; photochemistry; priority journal; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; residential area; solar radiation; time of flight mass spectrometry; traffic; water vapor; wind speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094566884

Eventually, a series of DPSNs@TiO2@Au nanocomposites with different sizes of Au NPs were successfully constructed by controlling the calcination time.

Meconopsis is a representative endangered genus confined to alpine meadow or subnival habitats in the THR. We used climate-niche factor analysis to study the vulnerability of ten Meconopsis species to climate change, comparing current climate (representative of 1960–1990) to future climate scenarios (2070: average 2061–2080). For these ten Meconopsis species, we then identified potential future climate refugia and determined optimal routes for each species to disperse to the proposed refugia. Our results indicate that for the ten Meconopsis species, the regions with low vulnerability to climate change in the THR are the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Hengduan Mountains (HDM), the eastern Himalayas, and the West Qinling Mountain (WQL), and can be considered potential future climate refugia. Under future climate change, we found for the ten Meconopsis species potential dispersal routes to three of the four identified refugia: the HDM, the eastern Himalayas, and the WQL. Our results suggest that past refugia on the THR will also be the future climate refugia for the ten Meconopsis species, and these species may potentially persist in multiple future climate refugia, likely reducing risks from climate change. Furthermore, climate change may affect the threat ranking of Red Listed Species for Meconopsis species, as Least Concern species were estimated to become more vulnerable to climate change than the only Near Threatened species. © 2020 The Authors.

China recently regards the classification of municipal solid waste as one of the important strategies for national ecological civilization construction. However, the published references have not considered simultaneously on the classification effects of MSW in views of economy, resource, and environment. For this purpose, an integrated system dynamic model is developed for evaluating the impact of waste classification on the aspects of socio-economy, environment and resource. The application of the proposed model is shown using a case study in Tianjin, China during 2006–2017. The socioeconomic benefits show that as the separate rate increases, socioeconomic benefits change from negative to positive values and the maximum socioeconomic benefit could have reached to 0.36% of Tianjin's GDP. The environmental assessment indicates that the yearly reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2-equivalent) from 2006 to 2017 could have ranged from 1.03 to 1.46 million ton due to waste at classification. The results also reveal for every 1% increase in the separate rate, the range of yearly land saved could have been between 502.92 and 2918.59 m2. The system dynamic model and present results are important to policy makers, strategic planners and researchers to realize and predict the importance of waste classification, which encourages residents to actively participate in the action of waste classification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Benefit assessment; Classification; Greenhouse gases; Municipal solid waste (MSW); System dynamics (SD); Waste management","Dynamic models; Economic and social effects; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Benefits analysis; Environmental assessment; Harmonious development; Integrated systems; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Socio-economic benefits; System dynamic models; Waste classification; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089907856

However, the DES is usually driven by various energy sources, and it is a complex issue to decide the composition of the system. To improve the incompleteness of a single subjective or objective assessment. So, it is urgent to find a comprehensive and efficient decision-making method for different systems. This paper states a total of 23 indicators in 4 criterion group: technology, economy, environment, and society. Based on the combination of the order relation analysis method (G1) and the anti-entropy weighting method (a-EWM), a comprehensive evaluation model, order relation-anti-entropy weight model (G1-aEWM), of distributed energy is established. This comprehensive evaluation model is used to analyze a hospital in Henan and find the final solution for the distributed energy system of the hospital. The empirical analysis results verify the rationality of the comprehensive evaluation model and provide an evaluation basis for the establishment of distributed energy systems in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The study aims to compare carbon footprint of two transportation modes in campus transit, bus and bike-share systems, using life-cycle assessment (LCA). A case study was conducted for the four-campus (College Ave, Cook/Douglass, Busch, Livingston) transit system at Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ). The life-cycle of two systems were disaggregated into four stages, namely, raw material acquisition and manufacture, transportation, operation and maintenance, and end-of-life. Three uncertain factors— fossil fuel type, number of bikes provided, and bus ridership—were set as variables for sensitivity analysis. Normalization method was used in two impact categories to analyze and compare environmental impacts. The results show that the majority of CO2 emission and energy consumption comes from the raw material stage (extraction and upstream production) of the bike-share system and the operation stage of the campus bus system. The CO2 emission and energy consumption of the current campus bus system are 46 and 13 times of that of the proposed bike-share system, respectively. Three uncertain factors can influence the results: (1) biodiesel can significantly reduce CO2 emission and energy consumption of the current campus bus system; (2) the increased number of bikes increases CO2 emission of the bike-share system; (3) the increase of bus ridership may result in similar impact between two systems. Finally, an alternative hybrid transit system is proposed that uses campus buses to connect four campuses and creates a bike-share system to satisfy travel demands within each campus. The hybrid system reaches the most environmentally friendly state when 70% passenger-miles provided by campus bus and 30% by bike-share system. Further research is needed to consider the uncertainty of biking behavior and travel choice in LCA. Applicable recommendations include increasing ridership of campus buses and building a bike-share in campus to support the current campus bus system. Other strategies such as increasing parking fees and improving biking environment can also be implemented to reduce automobile usage and encourage biking behavior. © 2020 by the authors.

The calculation results showed that the supported Cun (n = 3–5,7) clusters prefer planar or quasi-planar structures, while Cun (n = 6,8–14) clusters prefer three-dimensional structures. The stabilities of Cun/TiO2 show an odd–even oscillation behavior with the increasing n, except n = 2 and 7. For the supported Cun, the clusters with odd n are more stable than the adjacent clusters. The charge transfer from Cun clusters to TiO2 surface was observed. The electron densities of Cu atoms adjacent to O atoms of the surface are obviously reduced. Electronic structure analysis indicated: (1) Electrons are transferred from Cun clusters to the valence band of TiO2 surface. (2) The states from Cun clusters appear in the energy gap of the TiO2 surface and the energy gaps between the occupied states from Cun clusters and the unoccupied states from TiO2 surface decrease with the increasing n.

Based on more than 400 cases in cold regions, this study compared the post-evaluation and drivers of ZEBs from China, the US and the European Union (EU). Results found that ZEB definition, energy drivers, standard, regional policies, technology adoption and their adoption ratio determine the energy performance of cases. Not all EU and China cases reach the net-zero energy target; however, most ZEBs in the US do. ZEBs in cold regions adopted multiple technologies to achieve high energy-efficiency. The adoption ratio of passive technologies is higher than that of active technologies, especially in China. The active technologies in cold regions are mainly seen in the application of advanced HVAC systems. Such application of renewable technologies exhibits strong regional characteristics; for example, the EU's carbon emission reduction policies promoted the use of biomass-based technologies. The analysis also found that energy policies greatly enhance the development of ZEBs.

Biomass and coal co-firing with CCS is one of BECCS technologies, as well as a pathway to achieve low carbon transformation and upgrading through retrofitting coal power plants. However, few studies have considered co-firing ratio of biomass to coal based on each specific coal power plant's characteristic information such as location, installed capacity, resources allocation, and logistic transportation. Therefore, there is a need to understand whether it is worth retrofitting any individual coal power plant for the benefit of GHG emission reduction. It is also important to understand which power plant is suitable for retrofit and the associated co-firing ratio. In order to fulfill this gap, this paper develops a framework to solve these questions, which mainly include three steps. First, biomass resources are assessed at 1 km spatial resolution with the help of the Geography Information Science method. Second, by setting biomass collection points and linear program model, resource allocation and supply chain for each power plants are complete. Third, is by assessing the life-cycle emission for each power plant. In this study, Hubei Province in China is taken as the research area and study case. The main conclusions are as follows: (a) biomass co-firing ratio for each CCS coal power plant to achieve carbon neutral is between 40% and 50%; (b) lower co-firing ratio sometimes may obtain better carbon emission reduction benefits; (c) even the same installed capacity power plants should consider differentiated retrofit strategy according to their own characteristic. Based on the results and analysis above, retrofit suggestions for each power plant are made in the discussion. © 2020 The Authors.

To this end, the change trajectories and driving factors of production-based carbon emissions in China and Germany from 2000 to 2014 were investigated to use input-output method and decomposition techniques. The emission accounting results show that production-based carbon emission from 2000 to 2014 increased by 194% in China, whereas decreased by 17% in Germany. Embodied carbon emission flow analysis showed that sector structure of production-based carbon emissions in China and Germany was greatly different. The decomposition of production-based carbon emission showed that (i) the leading contributor in China was consumption structure in China, whereas the leading contributor in Germany was per capita consumption in Germany; (ii) production structure and consumption structure contributed to increasing the emission in China, but was offset the emission in Germany; (iii) the rapid decline in the carbon intensity coefficient offset emissions in both China and Germany.

However, few studies have accounted for the emissions from various power-generation technologies. In this paper, a high-resolution inventory of power plants with more than 6 MW accounting for 93% of the national power generation in China is established for the first time. Based on this inventory, the CO2, NOx and SO2 emissions of China's hard coal power, natural gas power, hydropower, wind power, photovoltaic power, biomass power and nuclear power are calculated by using the life cycle assessment method, and their spatial distributions in 2014 are further analyzed. The results show that China's power plants emitted 3.44 E+09 t CO2, 8.56 E+06 t NOx, and 1.19 E+07 t SO2, and the uncertainties were (−18.66%, +19.14%), (−67.10%, +66.41%) and (−88.69%, +87.61%) in 2014, respectively. Renewable-energy power plants accounted for approximately 15% of the national power generation but only contributed less than 1% of the total emissions. Meanwhile, in China's eastern cities, renewable-energy power accounts for the lowest proportion of the total installed capacity.

Cats are docile in nature, like keeping neat and tidy, and don't need too much time with their owners, so keeping pet cats is more convenient for most of people. Therefore, pet cats are very popular among young people, more and more young people start to keep pet cats as companions. In addition, with the improvement of people's living standards, the average family can also afford to raise a cat. Whether as a companion to a child or a member of the family, pet cats are also very popular in ordinary families. According to the surveys, most families now have some pets. But obviously it's a problem for these families to deal with the excrement of the cats. Because of the heavy smell, every time shoveling the feces will cause a lot of trouble to people. What's worse, the smell of feces will evaporate in the air, causing air pollution. In order to solve the above problems, we designed a smart litter box that can separate and completely seal the cat feces. It solves the problem of the difficulty in handling cat feces and the heavy smell of cat feces, and can maximize the utilization of household space. Through the fully automated function and effective human-computer interaction function of this litter box, people can greatly save the time and energy spent in processing cat feces. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Human computer interaction; Fully automated; Living standards; Young peoples; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101862690

The intricate nature of the reaction pathway involving six-electron transfer, however, makes the process highly challenging. In this work, we report a ternary heterostructural catalyst CoO/CN/Ni, with cobalt as catalytic centers supported on N-doped carbon with underlying nickel, which presents a remarkably promoted Faraday efficiency (70.7%) and current density (10.6 mA/cm2) towards methanol, compared with CoO/CN. It appears that the nickel underneath plays an essential role by donating electrons to outer CN layer and thus changes the electronic state of surface and then of the cobalt species which act as catalytic centers. Notably, the unique catalyst shows not only high electrocatalytic activity and selectivity to CH3OH, but also suppression of H2 formation and well-preserved catalytic performance during the long-term test of reaction.

However, electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethanol on the Cu(111) surface is limited to the high applied potential and low selectivity. Herein, we demonstrate that the Cu-based electrocatalysts modified by boron (B) single-atom greatly reduce the thermodynamic energy barrier and improve selectivity relative to pristine Cu(111) in the hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the doped B atom, as a charge transfer medium, not only works in supplying electrons to stabilize the intermediates but also undergoes distinct reaction paths compared with pristine Cu(111) to improve the selectivity of ethanol. Moreover, the formation of the robust B-C bond and the unique isomerization step keep the C atoms of the intermediates in an opposite-charged state, which makes C-C coupling facile to generate ethanol. These findings would be very useful to guide the search for a new catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction with high ethanol selectivity based on the abundant Cu-based materials. ©",,"Atoms; Boron; Calculations; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Charge transfer; Electrocatalysts; Electronic structure; Energy storage; Ethanol; Reaction intermediates; Reduction; Applied potentials; Carbon bonding; Carbon emissions; Cu-based materials; Facile conversion; First-principles calculation; Reaction paths; Thermodynamic energy; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100212873

However, the interactive effects of soil acidity and Nr on the contributions of bacteria and fungi to N2O emissions remain unclear. We conducted a field experiment to assess the effects of anthropogenic Nr forms (i.e., synthetic N fertilizer and manure) on bacterial and fungal N2O emissions along a soil acidity gradient (soil pH = 6.8, 6.1, 5.2, and 4.2). The abundances and structure of bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput sequencing techniques, respectively. Soil acidification reduced bacterial but increased fungal contributions to N2O production, corresponding respectively to changes in bacterial and fungal abundance. It also altered bacterial and fungal community structures and soil chemical properties, such as dissolved organic carbon and ammonia concentrations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses showed that the soil properties and fungal community were the most important factors determining bacterial and fungal contributions to N2O emissions, respectively. The fertilizer form markedly affected N2O emissions from bacteria but not from fungi. Compared with synthetic N fertilizer, manure significantly lowered the bacterial contribution to N2O emissions in the soils with pH of 5.2 and 4.2. The manure application significantly increased soil pH but reduced nitrate concentration. The fertilizer form did not significantly alter the bacterial and fungal community structures. The SEM revealed that the fertilizer form affected the bacterial contribution to N2O production by changing the soil chemical properties. Together, these results indicated that soil acidification enhanced fungal dominance for N2O emission, and manure application has limited effects on fungal N2O emission, highlighting the challenges for mitigation of soil N2O emissions under future acid deposition and N enrichment scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Fertilization; Fungi; Microbial community; Nitrous oxide production; Soil acidification","Acidification; Acidity; Ammonia; Bacteria; Fungi; Manures; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; pH; Polymerase chain reaction; Soils; Ammonia concentrations; Dissolved organic carbon; High-throughput sequencing; Nitrate concentration; Real time polymerase chain reactions; Soil acidifications; Soil chemical property; Structural equation modeling; Soil pollution; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; bacterium; concentration (composition); fertilizer; fungus; manure; nitrogen compound; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil property; acid deposition; Actinobacteria; Article; Ascomycetes; bacterium; Bacteroidetes; Basidiomycetes; Chlamydiae; concentration (parameter); controlled study; fungal community; fungus; Gemmatimonadetes (phylum); high throughput sequencing; Latescibacteria; manure; microbial community; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; Olpidiomycota; Patescibacteria; priority journal; Proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; Rokubacteria; soil acidification; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil property; structural equation modeling; agriculture; genetics; soil; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Agriculture; Bacteria; Fertilizers; Fungi; Manure; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090169361

The causal effect of these control measures on air quality is an important consideration for extreme air pollution control in China. Here, we established a difference-in-differences model to quantitatively estimate the lockdown effect on air quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. We found that the lockdown measures did have an obvious effect on air quality. The air quality index (AQI) was reduced by 15.2%, the concentration of NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and CO were reduced by 37.8%, 33.6%, 21.5%, and 20.4% respectively. At the same time, we further explored the heterogeneous effects of travel restrictions and the control measure intensity on air quality. We found that the traffic restrictions, especially the restriction of intra-city travel intensity (TI), exhibited a significant heterogeneous effect on NO2 with a decrease of approximately 13.6%, and every one-unit increase in control measures intensity reduced the concentration of air pollutants by approximately 2–4%. This study not only provides a natural, experimental basis for control measures on air quality but also indicates an important direction for future control strategies. Importantly, determining the estimated effect helps formulate accurate and effective intervention measures on the differentiated level of air pollution, especially on extreme air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Control measures intensity; COVID-19; Heterogeneous effect; Traffic restrictions","Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Air quality indices; Control measures; Control strategies; Difference-in-differences models; Heterogeneous effects; Intervention measures; Traffic restrictions; Travel restrictions; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); epidemic; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollution control; traffic emission; viral disease; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096709005

Epidemiological studies on the long-term exposure to air pollution can reveal the extent of this damage. Spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) models can be used to obtain long-term pollutant concentration surfaces with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, previously established spatiotemporal LUR models generally exhibit poor spatial prediction performances in some time panels compared with their average performances. These inaccurate pollutant concentrations lead to misclassification errors in epidemiological studies. To solve this problem, a hybrid spatiotemporal LUR model system is proposed in this study, which consists of support vector regression (SVR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and a special spatiotemporal (ST) algorithm. Three SVR layers were used for the main prediction, whereas MLR and ST were used to supplement time panels with poor spatial prediction performances. In addition, temporal segmentation modeling was adopted for SVR to further improve the performance. We used the megacity Tianjin in China for our case study and six target air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2). The superiority of our model system was tested by cross-validation. The results show that the number of days on which the R2cv of the model is higher than 0.6 for CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2 is 363, 364, 362, 357, 360, and 362, respectively, whereas the mean of the daily R2cv on these days is 0.911, 0.903, 0.891, 0.879, 0.866, and 0.883, respectively. Based on the use of our model system, a relatively high spatial prediction performance was achieved for almost all time panels. This model system can be applied to cohort health studies to obtain the pollutant concentration surfaces of any time panel with high reliability and reduce the exposure measurement errors of misclassifications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Epidemiology; Land use regression model; Long-term exposure; Spatiotemporal; Support vector regression","Air pollution; Forecasting; Land use; Linear regression; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Epidemiological studies; Land-use regression models; Misclassification error; Multiple linear regressions; Pollutant concentration; Spatio-temporal resolution; Support vector regression (SVR); Temporal segmentations; Support vector regression; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; epidemiology; land use change; megacity; model validation; numerical model; performance assessment; pollution effect; pollution exposure; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; Article; China; city; cross validation; environmental exposure; explanatory variable; intermethod comparison; long term exposure; measurement error; megacity; multiple linear regression analysis; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; priority journal; regression analysis; reliability; response variable; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; spatiotemporal land use regression model; support vector machine; temporal analysis; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092096773

The reduced-order model was derived using the Thiele modulus method and is an analytical model, which can be easily used in the reactor scale model or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. In the reduced-order model, physical/chemical steps occurring during the carbonation process were considered, including external diffusion of gas around the particle, intraparticle diffusion, surface reaction, product islands growth and product layer diffusion. This model can be used to investigate the complex kinetic behaviors such as reaction controlled steps, kinetics transition from chemical reaction to product layer diffusion, and the effect of particle structure change on intraparticle diffusion, such as pore plugging phenomenon. The prediction accuracy of reduced-order model was verified by the detailed one-dimensional model. In order to demonstrate the application of the reduced-order model for reactor scale analysis, the CaO carbonation kinetics under different temperatures (600–750 °C), CO2 concentrations (25–75 vol%) and particle sizes (0.2–3 mm) were measured using a novel micro-fluidized bed thermogravimetric analysis (MFB-TGA) method, which is based on real-time mass measurement of CaO sample in a fluidizing state. The reduced-order model was implemented into a K-L two-phase bubbling bed reactor model to analyze the experimental data of a micro-fluidized bed reactor. Results indicated that the two-stage behavior of carbonation kinetics can be described successfully using the model, and the effect of particle structure change on pore plugging and intraparticle diffusion can be well predicted and explained. The carbonation is first-order reaction when the CO2 partial pressure is within 75% (1 bar). The effect of particle size on carbonation kinetics shows three-zone characteristics of reaction/diffusion combined controlling mechanism, and was discussed in detail. The reduced-order model provides a promising application for describing multiscale mechanisms (surface, particle and reactor) of carbonation kinetics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CaO carbonation; Micro-fluidized bed thermogravimetric analysis (MFB-TGA); Product island; Reduced-order model","Calcium oxide; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Chemical analysis; Chemical reactors; Computational fluid dynamics; Diffusion in liquids; Fluidized beds; Kinetics; One dimensional; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Reaction kinetics; Surface reactions; Two phase flow; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Controlling mechanism; First order reactions; Fluidized bed reactors; Intra-particle diffusion; Multiscale mechanisms; One-dimensional model; Reaction controlled step; Thermogravimetric analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089753085

This article reports a new study on emissions of VOCs from a typical coking chemical plant. Results show that about 70 species of VOCs including alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons and oxygenates are detected, naphthalene and benzene could be used as the emission markers. Compared to coking stage, gas purifying stage is found to have 4 times more total concentrations of VOCs, in which condensing and blasting process is found to be the largest contributor with 77% ozone formation potential (OFP) contribution. Emission control measures currently used are insufficient and inefficient to reduce VOCs to meet regulatory emission standards. Further, by using a proposed integrated emission factor of 2.652 g/kg coke, the coking chemical industry in China was estimated to account for about 7.8–20% of total historical industrial VOCs emissions, and about 1241 Gg of VOCs were emitted in 2019. A large proportion is emitted from the northern China with a distinctive spatial distribution. Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Shannxi provinces are the top four emitters. It is suggested that more stringent and efficient measures should be taken on the coking chemical industry, not just on the coking processes, but also on the gas purifying processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coking and gas purifying; Control; Emission; Volatile organic compounds","Chemical industry; Chemicals; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas fuel purification; Naphthalene; Volatile organic compounds; Coking process; Emission control measures; Emission standard; Halogenated hydrocarbons; High energy consumption; Integrated emissions; Northern China; Ozone formation potentials; Chemical plants; alkane; alkene; alkyne; aromatic hydrocarbon; benzene; halogenated hydrocarbon; naphthalene; volatile organic compound; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); emission control; purification; spatial distribution; volatile organic compound; Article; China; coking industry; concentration (parameter); controlled study; exhaust gas; gas analysis; gas purifying stage; humidity; ozone formation potential; ozone layer; priority journal; reliability; velocity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090236862

However, a ship can rarely follow pre-defined speeds because dynamic sea environments lead to continuous speed variation. In this paper, a voyage optimization method is proposed to optimize ship engine power to reduce fuel and air emissions. It is a combination of dynamic programming and genetic algorithm to solve voyage planning in three-dimensions. In this method, the engine power is discretized into several levels. The potential benefit of using this algorithm is investigated by a medium-size chemical tanker. A ship's actual sailing is used to demonstrate benefits of the proposed method. On average 3.4% of fuel-saving and emission reduction can be achieved than state-of-the-art deterministic methods. If compared with the actual full-scale measurements, on average 5.6% reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emissions (about 275 tons) can be expected by the proposed method for the six case study voyages. © 2020 The Authors","Dynamic programming; Emission reduction; Expected Time of Arrival (ETA); Fuel-saving; Genetic algorithm; Voyage optimization","Emission control; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Ships; Chemical tankers; Deterministic methods; Deterministic optimization; Emission reduction; Full scale measurements; Optimization method; Potential benefits; Sea environments; Dynamic programming; emission control; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; genetic algorithm; maritime transportation; optimization; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097717779

Hidden Markov models (HMM) are widely applied in precipitation simulation due to its simplicity and advancements in associated computing techniques. HMMs, however, lack the flexibility to accommodate external factors in the dynamics. In this study, we consider a novel semiparametric Bayesian non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (BNHMM) that can explicitly incorporate the effects of observed covariates, e.g., climate index, on the state transition probabilities as well as the observation emission distributions. The proposed approach is tested for three rainfall stations in the service area of Tampa Bay Water, a regional water supply agency in the Southeastern United States. The BNHMM is first examined to simulate historical monthly rainfall data from the period 1979 to 2016. It is then evaluated in a retrospective mode to generate 3-month-ahead precipitation forecasts. Results indicate that the proposed BNHMM can capture historical rainfall properties well, and it is a promising alternative in providing operational rainfall forecasts. Although large-scale atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections, e.g., ENSO, have a strong influence in regional rainfall at the seasonal time scale, especially for the winter and early spring; its influence on monthly scale rainfall is limited. Potential improvement in forecasting performance is also discussed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"atmospheric dynamics; computer simulation; Markov chain; numerical model; performance assessment; precipitation assessment; prediction; rainfall; teleconnection; temporal variation; water management; water supply; weather forecasting; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094203843

Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades in New England (USA), as well as in some other parts of the world. In this study, we investigated plant biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at four sites where restoration of tidal flow occurred five to ten years prior to the study. Site elevation, aboveground biomass, CO2 flux, and porewater chemistry were measured in 2015 and 2016 in both restored marshes and adjacent marshes where tidal flow had never been restricted. We found that the elevation in restored marsh sites was 2–16 cm lower than their natural references. Restored marshes where porewater chemistry was similar to the natural reference had greater plant aboveground biomass, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration, as well as net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) than the natural reference, even though they had the same plant species. We also compared respiration rates in aboveground biomass (AR) and soil (BR) during July 2016, and found that restored marshes had higher AR and BR fluxes than natural references. Our findings indicated that well-restored salt marshes can result in greater plant biomass and NEP, which has the potential to enhance rates of C sequestration at 10-yrs post restoration. Those differences were likely due to lower elevation and greater flooding frequency in the recently restored marshes than the natural marsh. The inverse relationship between elevation and productivity further suggests that, where sea-level rise rate does not surpass the threshold of plant survival, the restoration of these salt marshes may lead to enhanced organic and mineral sedimentation, extending marsh survival under increased sea level, and recouping carbon stocks that were lost during decades of tidal restriction. © 2020","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gas; Restoration; Salt marsh","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Restoration; Sea level; Above ground biomass; C sequestration; Ecosystem respiration; Gross ecosystem productions; Inverse relationship; Net ecosystem co2 exchanges; Pore-water chemistry; Respiration rate; Wetlands; carbon dioxide; elevation; factor productivity; intertidal environment; nutrient uptake; phytomass; porewater; restoration ecology; saltmarsh; air temperature; Article; biomass; breathing rate; carbon dioxide transport; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; coastal waters; ecosystem restoration; environmental management; environmental parameters; factor analysis; flooding; intertidal zone; negative feedback; net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange; nonhuman; priority journal; productivity; salinity; salt marsh; sea level; sedimentation; solar radiation; biomass; ecosystem; United States; wetland; New England; United States; carbon dioxide; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; New England; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089936689

Herein, for the first time, we report that the chemical interaction between LiCoO2 (LCO) and TiO2 can be regulated by two additives, carbon and Li2CO3, which in situ form a continuous ultrathin pure-phase Li2CoTi3O8 (LCTO) layer with a stable 3D network of spinel structures, relatively low electronic conductivity (2.5 × 10-8 S cm-1) and high lithium diffusion coefficient (DLi+ = 8.22 × 10-7 cm2 s-1) on the surface of LCO. When assembled in ASSLIBs, such an LCTO layer functions as an interlayer between the LCO and the Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte (LGPS). As a consequence, the original interface LCO/LGPS is substituted by two new interfaces LCO/LCTO and LCTO/LGPS. DFT calculations indicate that, compared with the LCO/LGPS, the new interfaces are not only thermodynamically and electrochemically more compatible, but also have higher interfacial affinity. Therefore, the relevant ASSLIB exhibits evidently reduced interfacial impedance, and it also displays a high initial capacity of 140 mA h g-1 and a reversible discharge specific capacity of 116 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at room temperature (0.1C). In comparison, the ASSLIB assembled without the LCTO interlayer delivers an initial capacity of 98 mA h g-1 and only retains 22.4% capacity after 100 cycles (0.1C). Even at a high cutoff voltage (4.5 V vs. Li/Li+), the ASSLIB with the LCTO interlayer could also exhibit a high initial capacity of 180 mA h g-1 and a remarkable retention of 132 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Additives; Energy storage; Germanium compounds; Interface states; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Oxide minerals; Solid state devices; Solid state reactions; Solid-State Batteries; Sulfur compounds; Titanium dioxide; All-solid state batteries; All-solid-state lithium ion batteries; Chemical interactions; Cycling performance; Discharge specific capacity; Electronic conductivity; Energy storage technologies; Interfacial impedance; Solid electrolytes; electrolyte; energy storage; engineering; fuel cell; performance assessment; solid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100523008

The results show that the newly constructed GRAPES-CUACE-4D-Var assimilation system is feasible and can be applied to perform BC emission inversion in northern China. The BC concentrations simulated with optimized emissions show improved agreement with the observations over northern China with lower root-mean-square errors and higher correlation coefficients. The model biases are reduced by 20 %-46 %. The validation with observations that were not utilized in the assimilation shows that assimilation makes notable improvements, with values of the model biases reduced by 1 %-36 %. Compared with the prior BC emissions, which are based on statistical data of anthropogenic emissions for 2007, the optimized emissions are considerably reduced. Especially for Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and Henan, the ratios of the optimized emissions to prior emissions are 0.4-0.8, indicating that the BC emissions in these highly industrialized regions have greatly reduced from 2007 to 2016. In the future, further studies on improving the performance of the GRAPES-CUACE-4D-Var assimilation system are still needed and are important for air pollution research in China. © Author(s) 2021.",,"algorithm; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; carbon emission; inverse analysis; observational method; optimization; spatial distribution; technological development; China; Vitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100316753

The production of rice in 2019 reached 49.8 million tons. On a global scale, rice is consumed by half of the human population around the world. This study will support the development of sustainable natural resources management, which is an important thing to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals in zero poverty and zero hunger. Remote sensing is a useful instrument to monitor natural resources. This study used Sentinel-2 imageries to extract rice phenology using vegetation indices (NDVI and NDWI), then acquired the planting and harvesting time using the temporal analysis. The NDVI value is showing a parabolic curve regarding the planting stage of the rice. The value of NDVI is high in the transplanting stage but decreases in the harvesting phase. Besides that, in the seedling and transplanting stage, NDWI has a higher value than NDVI. However, in tillering until the harvesting phase, NDWI has a similar characteristic but lower value than NDVI. Based on the spatial and temporal distribution of rice planting and harvesting date, it is known that climate is not a resistant factor, especially the irrigated rice field. Nevertheless, in the rainfed rice field, the planting time depends on climate conditions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Forestry; Harvesting; Natural resources management; Plants (botany); Regional planning; Climate condition; Harvesting dates; Human population; Remote sensing approaches; Spatial and temporal distribution; Temporal analysis; Transplanting stage; Vegetation index; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100433157

This fact triggers the need to roll out fast-charging stations to fulfill daily road charging demand. Securing the power requirement for those stations has become a significant challenge that would cause substantial load increase on the existing electricity generation system and distribution infrastructure if supplied from the conventional resources. Hence, grid-independent charging stations with renewable energy sources (RES) and multiple energy storage systems has become an alternative solution to overcome the raised challenge. This paper aims to assess the implementation of a standalone fast charging station technically and economically in the State of Qatar comprising of a wind turbine (WT), concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system and a bio-generator as RES along with various storage systems. The proposed design is built, modelled, and simulated using Hybrid Optimization System for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software to determine the optimal techno-economic configuration to fast charge 50 EVs daily in a reliable manner.

Particularly in regions that are massively affected by climatic changes, such as the Pacific Island States, there is a need for increased and combined research on the role which these knowledge systems can play internationally. For this reason, this article provides a synthesis of empirical results and approaches to local and Indigenous climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in selected South Pacific Island States by using a meta-ethnographic approach. The reviewed literature is associated with the sub-disciplinary perspective of the Anthropology of Climate Change. The results of the meta-ethnographic analysis are discussed based on three thematic focal points: First, the empirical ground of local understandings of climate change and its theoretical conceptualization(s) are constituted. Second, the results of practices for adaptation to climate change are synthesized and presented in detail throughout one example. Third, the synthesis of climate change mitigation practices is outlined with a specific focus on human-environment relationships. © 2020 by the author.

This study was designed to test whether lithium administration may stabilize mood via effects on reward processing. It was hypothesized that lithium administration would modulate reward processing in the striatum and affect both anticipation and outcome computations. Thirty-seven healthy human participants (18 males, 33 with suitable fMRI data) received 11 (±1) days of lithium carbonate or placebo intervention (double-blind), after which they completed the monetary incentive delay task while fMRI data were collected. The monetary incentive delay task is a robust task with excellent test-retest reliability and is well suited to investigate different phases of reward processing within the caudate and nucleus accumbens. To test for correlations with prediction error signals a Rescorla–Wagner reinforcement-learning model was applied. Lithium administration enhanced activity in the caudate during reward anticipation compared to placebo. In contrast, lithium administration reduced caudate and nucleus accumbens activity during reward outcome. This latter effect seems related to learning as reward prediction errors showed a positive correlation with caudate and nucleus accumbens activity during placebo, which was absent after lithium administration. Lithium differentially modulates the anticipation relative to the learning of rewards. This suggests that lithium might reverse dampened reward anticipation while reducing overactive reward updating in patients with bipolar disorder. This specific effect of lithium suggests that a targeted modulation of reward learning may be a viable approach for novel interventions in bipolar disorder. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.",,"lithium carbonate; mood stabilizer; placebo; lithium; adult; algorithm; analytical error; anterior cingulate; anticipation; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; bipolar disorder; brain; caudate nucleus; clinical article; coding; computer model; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug capsule; drug dose increase; Eysenck Personality Questionnaire; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; monetary reward; mood; Mood Disorder Questionnaire; normal human; nucleus accumbens; pathophysiology; posterior cingulate; prediction; priority journal; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; reinforcement (psychology); reward; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; task performance; test retest reliability; anticipation; motivation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; Anticipation, Psychological; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Lithium; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Motivation; Reproducibility of Results; Reward",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094651026

One of the major production challenges is the damage caused by Aphis gossypii (Homoptera: Aphididae), a polyphagous aphid, which can negatively affect its host plant, both directly by feeding and indirectly by vectoring viruses. To gain insights into the transcriptome events that occur during the zucchini–aphid interaction and to understand the early-to-late defense response through gene expression profiles, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on zucchini leaves challenged by A. gossypii (24, 48, and 96 h post-infestation; hpi). Data analysis indicated a complex and dynamic pattern of gene expression and a transient transcriptional reconfiguration that involved more than 700 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including a large number of defense-related genes. The down-regulation of key genes of plant immunity, such as leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein kinases, transcription factors, and genes associated with direct (i.e., protease inhibitors, cysteine peptidases, etc.) and indirect (i.e., terpene synthase) defense responses, suggests the aphid ability to manipulate plant immune responses. We also investigated the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from infested plants and observed a reduced emission of (E)-β-caryophyllene at 48 hpi, likely the result of aphid effectors, which reflects the down-regulation of two genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. We showed that (E)-β-caryophyllene emission was modified by the duration of plant infestation and by aphid density and that this molecule highly attracts Aphidius colemani, a parasitic wasp of A. gossypii. With our results we contributed to the identification of genes involved in cucurbit plant interactions with phloem feeders. Our findings may also help pave the way toward developing tolerant zucchini varieties and to identify molecules for sustainable management of harmful insect populations. © Copyright © 2021 Vitiello, Molisso, Digilio, Giorgini, Corrado, Bruce, D’Agostino and Rao.","Cucurbita pepo; insect pests; phloem feeders; RNA-sequencing; transcriptome reprogramming; volatile organic compounds; zucchini–aphid interaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099723534

The novel’s metaphor of evolutionary mutation offers a figuration of a materially transformed human body that demonstrates how humanity is interdependent with its environment, including our planetary climate. Marshall presents this posthuman as an entity that can survive only if we find the capacity to see the potentiality for life in what we deem to be lifeless, an orientation the novel proposes we take toward the ecosystems around us as well as to the posthuman bodies that are transformed rather than killed by diseases in the novel.

However, the C storage potential of agroforestry systems, especially hedge agroforestry, still needs to be quantified in temperate areas. This study was performed in three mixed crop-livestock areas of western France and focused on hedges planted 20 years ago and on hedges inherited from the traditional hedge landscape and planted 40−120 years ago. We quantified soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to a depth of 90 cm in 21 agricultural fields adjacent to a hedge, at 1, 3, 6 and 18 m from the hedge. Additional SOC storage by hedges were estimated in comparison to a reference plot, which corresponded to the 18-m measurement. SOC storage dynamics was empirically modeled from the measurements. SOC distribution by particle-size fraction at 0−30 cm depth was also measured. Compared to those in a reference plot, SOC concentrations and stocks were significantly higher in the adjacent field up to 1 m from the hedge at 0−60 cm depth, and up to 3 m from the hedge at 60−90 cm. However, 56–65 % of the additional SOC was stored at 0−30 cm depth and within 1 m of the hedge. Additional SOC stocks equaled 30−50 % of the C stored in non-harvested biomass. Estimates of SOC accumulation rates over 30 years after tree planting ranged from 0.034−0.096 Mg C yr−1 per 100 linear m of hedge. In the first 30 cm, 59–85 % of the additional SOC was stored in the labile particulate organic matter fraction. Our study demonstrated hedges’ significant potential to store SOC locally around themselves; combined with other practices to store C, they could help increase C storage potential at the scale of an agricultural landscape. Results also highlight the high variability in hedge storage potential, depending on hedge characteristics and intrinsic soil properties, whose underlying controlling processes remain to be understood. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry systems; Field margins; Perennial vegetation; Shelterbelts; Soil carbon sequestration; Windbreaks","agricultural soil; agroforestry; carbon sequestration; climate change; hedgerow; mitigation; particulate organic matter; soil organic matter; temperate environment; tree planting; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091560251

The process uses Mono Ethanol Amine (MEA) solvent to absorb CO2 from Flue gas. The CO2 rich solvent is regenerated in a stripping tower with kettle reboiler using process steam as heating media. The lean MEA solution is recirculated back to absorption column, and the recovered CO2 is taken for further processing depending on the nature of demand. The PCC unit control set-up has challenges in coping up with process upsets caused by variations in power demand resulting in lower operating rate for the power plant. The rapid reduction of flue gas flow rate to the absorber leads to a decreased load on the regeneration stripping tower, necessitating steep reduction of the steam flow to the reboiler. The problem is caused by the dynamic response rate of the regenerator-reboiler combine, which must match the fast-dynamics of the flue gas feed rate. The process upset in the absorber-stripper system takes time to settle down, leading to CO2 slip from the PCC unit. The loss of CO2 is not only an economic concern but an environmental issue as well. This study intends to observe this problem in a simulated environment and evaluate options to ensure faster stabilization of the MEA absorber-regenerator system; to minimize loss of CO2 during changes in production rate of the power plant. The study involves developing a high-fidelity dynamic simulation model of the MEA absorber-stripper unit using 1st principles unit-op models and rigorous thermodynamics on a commercial dynamic simulator platform. Once the steady state conditions and disturbance caused in the system due to plant turn-down have been successfully replicated; the model is used to study the impact of process upsets on key operating parameters like solvent flow rate to absorber, regenerator bottom and top temperature, steam flow-rate and temperature of the reboiler, CO2 slip from the absorber and the key parameter of overall CO2 capture by the system. The next step is evaluation of various control schemes and operating strategies in their effectiveness of controlling the key process parameters viz. lean solvent flow rate to absorber, ratio of solvent flow to feed gas rate and regenerator bottom / reboiler temperature. In the final step the optimal control scheme and operating strategy to be followed by plant operators for the absorber-stripper system is identified. The selection is made based on the capability of the strategy to quickly react to the process upsets caused by reduction in power plant production rate, and to establish steady state operations in the least amount of time; reducing CO2 loss during the process transients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 capture; Control Strategy; Dynamic simulation; MEA solvent; Power plant",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110321423

Analog forestry aims to strengthen rural communities, both socially and economically, with tree plantings of high biodiversity, which provide commercial products and resiliency, while avoiding agrochemicals and fossil fuels. The latter links this strategy to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, but there has been little analysis comparing the potential for above- and below-ground carbon storage in analog forests, as compared with more typical reforestation efforts via single-species plantations. We present the results of a study to estimate carbon sequestration levels, above- and below-ground, from an experimental analog forest system and a teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) plantation system, in comparison with a degraded pasture system. The study found that the analog and teak plantation forest systems stored higher quantities of total carbon (178 and 141 t C ha-1, respectively), when compared with a degraded pasture system (124 t C ha-1). However, the teak plantation had decreased soil carbon stocks, relative to the degraded pasture. The analog forest had the best balance of both above- and below-ground carbon stored over the 17-year study period and provided a more diverse array of timber and non-timber forest products when compared with the teak plantation. This suggests that analog forestry could be a viable social-ecological approach to carbon storage and reforestation in the study region and other places with large areas of degraded pasture and a good understanding of the structure and function of the original vegetation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The mean methane emission rate from 63 four-stroke, lean-burn (4SLB) compressor engines was 5.62 kg/h (95% CI = 5.15-6.17 kg/h) and ranged from 0.3 to 12.6 kg/h.

The first excited triplet state 3B2 of CO2, including its vibrational structure, is considered in our model, and a more consistent approach to CO2 dissociation is also proposed. The model is benchmarked against a few academic zero-dimensional (0D) cases and compared to decomposition time measurements in a shock tube.

The examined criteria consisted of soil pH, soil electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract (ECe), exchangeable Na, percentage of exchangeable Na, and content (%) of nitrogen and phosphorus. The results revealed that the pH range of soil decreased from 5.14-5.72 to 4.08-5.14 when the soil salinity increased from 0 to 25‰. At the salinity of 10‰ and higher, the available nitrogen began to decline. Meanwhile, the available phosphorus tended to decrease as the salinity increased past 12‰.

On the other hand, the thermodynamic aspects of climate change are already largely apparent from observations and are far more certain since they are anchored in agreed-upon physical understanding. The storyline method of extreme-event attribution, which has been gaining traction in recent years, quantitatively estimates the magnitude of thermodynamic aspects of climate change, given the dynamical conditions. There are different ways of imposing the dynamical conditions. Here we present and evaluate a method where the dynamical conditions are enforced through global spectral nudging towards reanalysis data of the large-scale vorticity and divergence in the free atmosphere, leaving the lower atmosphere free to respond. We simulate the historical extreme weather event twice: first in the world as we know it, with the events occurring on a background of a changing climate, and second in a ""counterfactual"" world, where the background is held fixed over the past century. We describe the methodology in detail and present results for the European 2003 heatwave and the Russian 2010 heatwave as a proof of concept. These show that the conditional attribution can be performed with a high signal-To-noise ratio on daily timescales and at local spatial scales. Our methodology is thus potentially highly useful for realistic stress testing of resilience strategies for climate impacts when coupled to an impact model. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

However, the nature of the active sites and the mechanisms underlying NOxadsorption in Pd/zeolites remain a subject of ongoing investigation. In this study, we employ quantum chemical simulations to investigate the structure of Pd species in cation-exchange sites at isolated Al and Al pairs in the 6-ring and 8-ring of the CHA framework before the introduction of NOx. Our calculations show that the speciation of Pd in these exchange sites strongly depends on the precise Al arrangement within the framework, as well as the operating conditions. Ionically dispersed Pd is found to be the most favorable species over a wide range of oxidizing and reducing conditions. Small oligomers of PdO and metallic Pd do not appear to be competitive at either isolated Al or Al pairs. Notably, our calculations show that ion exchange sites other than next-next-nearest neighbor Al pairs in the 6-ring will be preferentially occupied by Pd+instead of Pd2+. The stability of Pd+in the zeolite environment is an interesting contrast with its rareness in molecular Pd compounds. Nonetheless, a detailed analysis of the electronic structure shows that predicted Pd oxidation states are consistent with chemical intuition for all complexes investigated in this study. We also discuss the potential ambiguity in Pd characterization provided by typical experimental techniques such as XANES, EXAFS and UV-Vis, and highlight the need for additional EPR spectroscopy studies to further elucidate the initial Pd speciation in zeolites for PNA applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Aluminum; Chemical analysis; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electronic structure; Ion exchange; Quantum chemistry; Starting; Zeolites; Cation exchanges; Computational model; EPR spectroscopy; Experimental techniques; Next-next-nearest neighbors; Operating condition; Quantum-chemical simulations; Reducing conditions; Palladium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100396668

In the past, the production impacts of alternative vehicle technologies have been widely assessed within the life cycle assessment framework, with large uncertainties regarding fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). FCEVs allow an almost double driving range with a single charge or refill of the tank and more than ten times the fueling/charging rate compared to batteries. However, FCEVs currently suffer from two major issues, lack of widespread fueling infrastructure coverage and high production costs, compared to the well-established Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the data used for life cycle assessments of the technology should be constantly updated, as their technological development is rapidly moving forward. In this regard, an early detection of the likely environmental impacts from this fast development is fundamental to guide the progress of the technology. In this study we perform a life cycle assessment of a fuel cell system for FCEV currently on the market. We found that the production of the tanks, the catalyst and the fuel cell auxiliaries are the components with lower environmental performance of the system, across all the investigated impact categories. Currently, the production of a fuel cell system with a net power output of 80 kW, and two storage tanks with a total capacity of 5 kg of H2, generates approximately 5 ton CO2-eq. In addition, in line with the targets set by the US Department of Energy, we performed an assessment of the prospective technological developments to identify its future impact. In the assessed prospective scenarios, we analyzed the effects of the technical improvements, and we subsequently combined them with the use of a higher share of renewable energy sources and secondary platinum. In essence, the technology shows potential reduction of the environmental footprints ranging from 25% to 70%, depending on the impact category. However, to achieve these results, the combination of renewable energy sources and a high learning rate must take place. © 2020 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Fuel cell electric vehicles; Fuel cell system; Life cycle assessment; Transport sector","Artificial life; Costs; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Fleet operations; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Fuel systems; Fueling; Greenhouse gases; Light electric vehicles; Light weight vehicles; Lithium-ion batteries; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Tanks (containers); Uncertainty analysis; Environmental footprints; Environmental performance; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energy source; Technical improvement; Technological development; US Department of Energy; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096466587

Mitigation measures must be urgently deployed in urban environments, which are responsible for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions. In this sense, a deeper integration between energy and urban planning disciplines is a key factor for effective decarbonisation in urban environments. This is addressed in the Cities4ZERO decarbonisation methodology. This method specifically points out the need for technology-based solutions able to support that integration among both disciplines at a local level, enriching decisionmaking in urban decarbonisation policy-making, diagnosis, planning, and follow-up tasks, incorporating the spatial dimension to the whole process (GIS-based), as well as the possibilities of the digital era. Accordingly, this paper explores the demands of both integrated urban energy planning and European/Basque energy directives, to set the main requisites and functionalities that Decision Support Systems (DSSs) must fulfil to effectively support city managers and the urban decarbonisation process. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper argues that long-lasting capacity is necessarily embedded in the institutions governing cooperation between state and non-state actors. This institutional capacity for cooperation is determined by the two interactive processes of conception and calibration, where the state plays a definitive role in mediating between competing interests. In conception, the state uses its discretionary power to set the long-term vision, whereas during calibration it exercises flexibility to accommodate concerns and capacity of other actors. We conclude that proportionality of policy response is better understood, and achieved, through the convergence of both these processes. Drawing on climate policy experiences of India and South Africa, we recommend that successful implementation and enhancement of NDCs would require a greater emphasis on capacity building for calibration in developing countries. © The Author(s) 2020.","capacity building; climate ambition; Implementation; India; proportionality; South Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095421338

While rich practical and academic research has evolved on the economic and technical side of ETS linking, political drivers and barriers have so far been underrepresented in this debate. Filling this lacuna and based on international relations theory, existing research and qualitative fieldwork, this book introduces the range of political conditions that influence linking, such as political leadership and stakeholder activity. Specifically, it analyzes which of these aspects have played a role in three different linking activities of the EU: (1) a failed linking attempt: EU ETS-California Cap-and-Trade Program; (2) a successful linking treaty: EU ETS-Switzerland Emissions Trading System; and (3) an agreed-upon but not realized link: EU ETS-Australia Carbon Pricing Mechanism. Through an interrogation of these examples, Dr. Unger concludes that it is not only the technical challenges or the overall economic benefit but rather domestic interests, structural aspects, and external international political developments that have jointly dominated linking activities, especially those in which the EU takes part.

A major arterial road with heavy vehicle emissions in the Kumasi Metropolis was designated as the polluted site, while Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Campus was designated as the control site. Four tree species (Terminalia catappa, Mangifera indica, Ficus platyphylla and Polyalthia longifolia) selected for the study were well distributed and abundant in the polluted and control sites. Photosynthetic pigments and levels of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd and zinc) were assessed in their leaves. Chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were determined by absorption spectrometry, while the metal accumulation index (MAI) was used to determine the total metal accumulation capacity of the tree species. We observed a reduction in photosynthetic pigments in the leaf samples from the polluted site. Ficus platyphylla had the maximum reduction in total chlorophyll (49.34%), whereas Terminalia catappa recorded the lowest reduction (33.88%). Similarly, the largest decrease (31.58%) of carotenoid content was found in Terminalia catappa trees and the lowest in Polyalthia longifolia (16.67%). The Polyalthia longifolia, Ficus platyphylla and Terminalia catappa leaf samples collected at the polluted site recorded a higher ratio of chlorophyll a/b. Heavy metal (Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd) accumulation in leaf samples was higher in the polluted site than in the control, as expected. The highest metal MAI value was recorded in Mangifera indica (5.35) followed by Polyalthia longifolia with 4.30. The findings from this study specifically demonstrate that air contamination induced by vehicles decreases the level of photosynthetic pigments in trees subjected to roadside emissions. It is clear that both chlorophyll a/b and chlorophyll/carotenoid ratios will act as very useful stress-level markers. Elevated heavy metal levels in the tree species along arterial roadsides indicate that they serve as heavy metals sink. The change in MAI resulting from different pollution burden is an indication that the removal capabilities of the tree species differ from each other. We therefore suggest M. indica and P. longifolia as potential species to be used in air pollution reduction plans in the city. © 2021, The Author(s).","Heavy metal; Photosynthetic pigment; Urban trees physiology; Vehicular air pollution","Absorption spectroscopy; Bioaccumulation; Chlorophyll; Heavy metals; Pigments; Plants (botany); Pollution; Roadsides; Absorption spectrometry; Heavy metal accumulation; Metal accumulation; Metal accumulation indices; Photosynthetic pigments; Pollution reduction; Science and Technology; Vehicular pollutions; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100700991

Arguably, such perceptions would be acute for those who have lived in the vicinity of a nuclear accident. We conducted a surveyembedded experiment in Japan (N = 2574) to assess how the NIMBY syndrome influences public support for restarting nuclear reactors when health, economic, and climate change benefits of nuclear energy are highlighted. We focus on Japan because the risks of nuclear energy became salient after the 2011 Fukushima accident. We test for two types of NIMBY effect, (1) respondents' proximity to any nuclear power plant and (2) respondents' place of residence in 2011 and its proximity to Fukushima. We do not find support for either the NIMBY syndrome or the Fukushima effect. On the contrary, we find support for a “reverse-NIMBY” among low-income residents, when they are treated with information on nuclear energy's low local air pollution (health).

Cereal water footprints data were obtained from the secondary literature. The study finds that 8% of domestic cereal supply (70% wheat, 17% maize, and 2% rice and related products) was imported through international trade. The annual average virtual cropland area and water imported through trade of 6.9 million tonnes of the three cereal crops (excluding products) were 2.1 million ha and 14 billion m3, respectively, during 2014-17. Bangladesh would need additional 2.81 million ha land and 12 billion m3 water to be cereal self-sufficient.

Sixteen identical energy depositions events were simulated for four independent flow realisations at four different locations. The successful ignition and subsequent flame propagation have been found to be well correlated to the mean mixture fraction and flammability factor values of the energy deposition location. Furthermore, similarly to what has been observed in experiments, the early stages of flame development from the ignition kernel involved initial downstream convection of the kernel, followed by simultaneous radial expansion and downstream propagation and finally the upstream propagation of the flame base indicating the onset of flame stabilisation. The mixture composition and the scalar dissipation rate (SDR) values in the immediate vicinity of the ignitor have been identified to play key roles in determining the outcome of the external energy deposition, while the development of an edge flame structure propagating along the stoichiometric mixture fraction iso-surface was found to be necessary but not sufficient for the flame to propagate upstream. It has also been found that in the case of successful self-sustained burning, the edge flame was developing in low SDR regions, and that the most probable edge flame speed remains close to the theoretical laminar value irrespective of the flame development history. Finally, the mean flame speed of the edge flame elements propagating towards the nozzle exit has been found to be considerably greater than the unstrained laminar burning velocity. Thus, the edge flame, depending on its orientation with respect to the flow, is able to propagate upstream and initiate the onset of flame stabilisation. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Direct Numerical simulation; edge flame; Localised forced ignition; planar jet; scalar dissipation rate","Air; Deposition; Flame research; Flammability; Mixtures; Numerical models; Stabilization; Direct-numerical-simulation; Dissipation rates; Edge flames; Flame development; Forced ignition; Localised; Localized forced ignition; Planar jets; Scalar dissipation; Scalar dissipation rate; Direct numerical simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103995878

S. mutans and most other streptococci are considered auxotrophic for several essential vitamins including riboflavin (vitamin B2), which is used to generate key cofactors and to perform numerous cellular redox reactions. Despite the well-known contributions of this vitamin to central metabolism, little is known about how S. mutans obtains and metabolizes B2. The uncharacterized protein SMU.1703c displays high sequence homology to the riboflavin transporter RibU. Deletion of SMU.1703c hindered S. mutans growth in complex and defined medium in the absence of saturating levels of exogenous riboflavin, whereas deletion of cotranscribed SMU.1702c alone had no apparent effect on growth. Expression of SMU.1703c in a Bacillus subtilis riboflavin auxotroph functionally complemented growth in nonsaturating riboflavin conditions. S. mutans was also able to grow on flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in an SMU.1703c-dependent manner. Deletion of SMU.1703c and/or SMU.1702c impacted S. mutans acid stress tolerance, as all mutants showed improved growth at pH 5.5 compared to that of the wild type when medium was supplemented with saturating riboflavin. Cooccurrence of SMU.1703c and SMU.1702c, a hypothetical PAP2 family acid phosphatase gene, appears unique to the streptococci and may suggest a connection of SMU.1702c to the acquisition or metabolism of flavins within this genus. Identification of SMU.1703c as a RibU-like riboflavin transporter furthers our understanding of how S. mutans acquires essential micronutrients within the oral cavity and how this pathogen successfully competes within nutrient-starved oral biofilms. IMPORTANCE Dental caries form when acid produced by oral bacteria erodes tooth enamel. This process is driven by the fermentative metabolism of cariogenic bacteria, most notably Streptococcus mutans. Nutrient acquisition is key in the competitive oral cavity, and many organisms have evolved various strategies to procure carbon sources or necessary biomolecules. B vitamins, such as riboflavin, which many oral streptococci must scavenge from the oral environment, are necessary for survival within the competitive oral cavity. However, the primary mechanism and proteins involved in this process remain uncharacterized. This study is important because it identifies a key step in S. mutans riboflavin acquisition and cofactor generation, which may enable the development of novel anticaries treatment strategies via selective targeting of metabolite transporters. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

The soil and climatic conditions in the south of Russia are favorable for the successful development of the essential oil industry, which is important for our country. Sowing coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) is the most common essential oil culture of the Russian Federation and countries of the Union of Independent States. Its crops occupy about 82.4% of all areas of volatile-oil-bearing plants. Coriander fruits contain from 1.5 to 1.8% essential oil. The main component of the essential oil, linalool, and serves as the initial product for the production of a number of fragrant substances with the smells of lemon, orange, rose, violet, etc., which are successfully used in the perfumery, food, and distillery industries. Coriander is also a honey plant. Due to the growth in demand and gross purchases of coriander seeds associated with its high purchase price, problems arose with increasing its productivity and improving the technology of cultivation. Due to the large volumes of sales of both coriander raw materials and finished products, the levels of profitability and net income of farms both in the Republic of Crimea and in the Russian Federation as a whole, as well as the development of the agro-industrial complex will significantly increase. The above analysis of domestic and foreign literature in this review article shows that winter coriander crops are most productive compared to spring crops.

It is a complex process mediated by the coordinated engagement of multiple ZP receptors forming high-molecular-weight (HMW) protein complexes at the acrosomal region of the sperm surface. The present article aims to review the current understanding of sperm-ZP binding in the four most studied mammalian models, i.e., murine, porcine, bovine, and human, and summarizes the candidate ZP receptors with established ZP affinity, including their origins and the mechanisms of ZP binding. Further, it compares and contrasts the ZP structure and carbohydrate composition in the aforementioned model organisms. The comprehensive understanding of sperm-ZP interaction mechanisms is critical for the diagnosis of infertility and thus becomes an integral part of assisted reproductive therapies/technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

This review paper highlights the impact of exclosures on above and below ground carbon stocks in biomass as a solution to globally curb carbon emissions. The data has been analyzed dependent on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Forest Resource Assessment report (FRA, 2020), and scientific journal publications mostly from the last decade, to show the research results of carbon stock and the impact of exclosures, particularly the challenges of deforestation and erosion of land and opportunities of area exclosures to provide a general outlook for policymakers. Overall, the world’s forest regions are declining, and although the forest loss rate has slowed, it has still not stopped sufficiently because the knowledge and practice of exclosures are limited. The global forest loss and carbon stock have decreased from 7.8 million ha/yr to 4.7 million ha/yr and from 668 gigatons to 662 gigatons respectively due to multiple factors that differ across the regions. However, a move toward natural rehabilitation and exclosures to reduce the emissions of Greenhouse Gas (GHGs) is needed. In the global production of carbon, the exclosure of forests plays an important role, in particular for permanent sinks of carbon. © 2021 by the authors.

This study quantifies the impact of two extreme storm surge events in October 2006 on the Ibaraki Coast in Japan to the coastal Sea Surface Height (SSH), vertically averaged velocity (Vbar), Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) by reproducing hindcasts of the dynamically downscaled coastal dynamics from a 10 km resolution parent dataset (Four-dimensional Variational Ocean ReAnalysis for the Western North Pacific over 30 years, FORA-WNP30) to related 2 km, 667 and 222 m resolution datasets using three domain nesting Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment-Transport Modeling System (COAWST). Validation was made by comparing the SSH, Vbar, SST, and SSS modeled results with observed data and discussing differences in their values in the downscaled and the parent datasets. This study concludes that the low-pressure system event on October 7 had much bigger impact to the SSH and Vbar than the one on October 24, which had similar peak of southward surface wind but lower Sea Level Pressure drop, whereas the impact to the SST and SSS was similar. These findings are helpful in understanding and assessing shoreline changes and damages on the well-developed local fishery and seashell industry. Finally, these findings and modeling approach are useful for climate change impact assessment and can ultimately serve as guidelines for developing adaptation policies. © Copyright © 2021 Trošelj, Ninomiya, Takewaka and Mori.","3 domain nesting; climate change; COAWST; dynamical downscaling; extreme storm surges; hindcasts; ocean model application",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100024361

Because both space and water heating are dominated by natural gas, the carbon footprint of Canada could be significantly reduced with a shift towards clean space and water heating, such as heat pump water heaters (HPWHs). HPWHs use electricity but are between two and three times more efficient than electric water heaters (EWHs). However, while they operate, HPWHs cool nearby ambient air which increases natural gas-dominant space heating loads. Solar assisted HPWHs (SAHPWHs) may allow the GHG reductions of HPWHs to be realized without increased space heating loads. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of HPWHs and SAHPWHs in terms of their GHG reductions across Canada and the United States. It was found that the systems reduced GHGs compared to EWHs and natural gas water heaters (NGWHs) in many locations, as indicated graphically within this paper. The locations and electricity grid mixes which have potential for the greatest GHG reductions are shown in this paper. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Energy reduction; GHG reduction; Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs); Heat pump water heater; Solar assisted heat pump water heater (SAHPWH); Solar thermal; TRNSYS simulation","Air source heat pumps; Carbon footprint; Gas emissions; Hot water distribution systems; Natural gas; Solar water heaters; Space heating; Water heaters; Ambient air; Electric water heaters; Electricity grids; GHG reductions; Heat pump water heater; Solar assisted; Solar thermal collector; Water heating; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096392582

The pace of rehabilitation using the improved remediation technologies to enhance sustainable environmental management and regional economic development is of crucial social and economic importance. In a 120-day incubation experiment, we evaluated the prospects for the restoration of two soils at different degradation stages via carbon pool regulation comparing to mineral ameliorants – NPK fertilizer, and liming agent. Organic additives used included a humic preparation based on an alkaline brown coal extract, wood-derived biochar, and peat-derived gel, supplied by mycorrhizae fungi. The results demonstrate that the selected organic amendments are suitable for restoration of acidic metal contaminated soils. Specifically, the treatments provided a measurable increase in soil carbon content, a marked decrease in acidity, a decrease in extractable metal contents, together with an enhanced nutrient uptake and vegetative growth. A stabilization effect increased from biochar to peat-gel, liming agent and humic preparation, with an accompanying increase in soil pH. Although biochar showed a reduced ability to metal stabilization, the associated treatments were the most productive. The most effective amendments in multi-metallic contaminated soils need to be able to stabilize bioavailability of metals, adjust pH to the optimum for plant growth, and regulate nutrient consumption. © 2021 The Authorssoil remediation, heavy metals, carbon stock regulation. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon stock regulation; Heavy metals; Soil remediation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099816880

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presumed to have jumped species from another mammal to humans. This virus has caused a rapidly spreading global pandemic. To date, over 300,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in England and over 40,000 patients have died. While progress has been achieved in managing this disease, the factors in addition to age that affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have not been clearly identified. Recent studies of COVID-19 in several countries identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored potential links between major fossil fuel-related air pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 mortality in England. We compared current SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from public databases to both regional and subregional air pollution data monitored at multiple sites across England. After controlling for population density, age and median income, we show positive relationships between air pollutant concentrations, particularly nitrogen oxides, and COVID-19 mortality and infectivity. Using detailed UK Biobank data, we further show that PM2.5 was a major contributor to COVID-19 cases in England, as an increase of 1 m3 in the long-term average of PM2.5 was associated with a 12% increase in COVID-19 cases. The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 withstands variations in the temporal scale of assessments (single-year vs 5-year average) and remains significant after adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related variables. We conclude that a small increase in air pollution leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 infectivity and mortality rate in England.

While several Alaska Native villages have been impacted by severe erosion, additional communities face burgeoning erosion concerns. St. Paul, a remote island located in the Bering Sea, Alaska, and home to ~450 Unangan, or Aleut, residents, is experiencing relatively new erosion and associated flooding issues. This study aimed to inform St. Paul’s erosion monitoring and climate adaptation strategies by documenting community perceptions of coastal erosion as an ecological and social threat within a broader context of multiple established climate stressors. We interviewed 21 residents to answer: (1) what are the community’s perceptions of erosion on St. Paul in the context of the island’s other environmental concerns?; (2) do current perceptions of erosion affect how local governing and management entities address erosion impacts?; and (3) how does erosion relate to and impact Unangan cultural traditions and heritage? Residents identified six locations of primary concern, owing to how erosion of those areas impact their culture, subsistence practices, and sense of place. We suggest methods in which local entities can better support proactive climate adaptation and mitigation measures and utilize resources for community-driven adaption planning. By documenting perspectives in Indigenous communities on emergent climate impacts, as well as perceptions of adaptation planning and implementation, it can establish the foundation for more collaborative, culturally relevant, and successful community-driven climate adaptation planning. © 2020, The Author(s).","Arctic; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Coastal management; Community perceptions; Erosion","Ecology; Adaptation strategies; Community perceptions; Cultural traditions; Current perception; Environmental concerns; Erosion monitoring; Indigenous community; Mitigation measures; Erosion; adaptive management; coastal erosion; flooding; perception; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; adult; Alaska; Aleut (people); Arctic; article; Bering Sea; climate change; flooding; human; inheritance; perception; protest; resident; threat; Alaska; perception; wind; Alaska; Bering Sea; Minnesota; Pacific Ocean; Saint Paul; United States; Alaska; Climate Change; Floods; Perception; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095594041

The reference A-USC unit without CCS achieves a net efficiency of 47.6% with CO2 emissions of 700 kgCO2/MWh. Relatively to subcritical units, the net efficiency of the A-USC is 8%-pts higher while CO2 emissions are 16.5% lower. For a CO2 removal rate of 90%, the net efficiency of the CCS integrated A-USC unit is 36.8%.

The purpose of the research is to identify the risky areas in terms of air pollution using the emission density distribution data from ships called at Port of Alsancak in 2018. A geographic information system (GIS)–based emission inventory model was used to examine spatial changes in emissions in the Izmir Bay. Initially, by the bottom-up method, 187 movements from 41 ships combined have been evaluated. A spatial distribution map of air pollutants was then compiled using the point density analysis in GIS. The analysis revealed that SO2, NOX, CO2, PM10 and HC emissions from ships were identified as 334.5 t, 398.9 t, 19653 t, 37.4 t and 27 t, respectively. Besides, the research revealed that container ships accounted for the largest share (~ 91.3%) of all emissions. In conclusion, the highest emissions were recorded in Port of Alsancak and inner bay due to long hoteling periods. The port area was determined as the riskiest region that threatens public health. The study recommends emission reduction strategies such as replacement of ships’ source of energy in ports (e.g. cold ironing) and increase usage of green fuels. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Bottom-up methodology; Geographic information system (GIS); Izmir Bay; Point density analysis; Ship emissions","atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; emission inventory; estimation method; GIS; nitrous oxide; numerical model; public health; spatial distribution; Izmir Bay; Izmir [Turkey]; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089868912

However, this does not necessarily translate to a reduction of CO2 emission, as the source of the electricity utilized for the charging/recharging of such vehicles plays a significant contribution to its emission rate. This study looks at selected economies in six different continents and the Middle East to estimate the electric vehicle adoption and CO2 emission (kg/kWh) benchmark to make them greener than the conventional vehicles. At the current state of the emission from the conventional automobiles, CO2 emission per kWh of generated electricity is assumed to be below 0.5495 kg for the electric vehicles to be greener, and for a matured synthetic fuel technology below 0.1923 kg. The estimates show that to ensure a transition to the adoption of electricity powered vehicles in Bangladesh and Africa, a shift in electricity generation to clean renewable sources is required. © 2021 Published by RERIC in International Energy Journal (IEJ).","CO2 emission; Conventional automobiles; Electric vehicles; Global warming; Greenhouse gas","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Synthetic fuels; Carbon footprint reductions; CO2 emissions; Electricity generation; Emission rates; Fuel technology; Middle East; National governments; Renewable sources; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103786530

Green infrastructure (GI) is one potential passive control system for air pollution in street canyons, yet optimum GI design is currently unclear. This review consolidates findings from previous research on GI in street canyons and assesses the suitability of different GI forms in terms of local air quality improvement. Studies on the effects of various GI options (trees, hedges, green walls, green screens and green roofs) are critically evaluated, findings are synthesised, and possible recommendations are summarised. In addition, various measurement methods used for quantifying the effectiveness of street greening for air pollution reduction are analysed. Finally, we explore the findings of studies that have compared plant species for pollution mitigation. We conclude that the influences of different GI options on air quality in street canyons depend on street canyon geometry, meteorological conditions and vegetation characteristics. Green walls, green screens and green roofs are potentially viable GI options in existing street canyons, where there is typically a lack of available planting space. Particle deposition to leaves is usually quantified by leaf washing experiments or by microscopy imaging techniques, the latter of which indicates size distribution and is more accurate. The pollutant reduction capacity of a plant species largely depends on its macromorphology in relation to the physical environment. Certain micromorphological leaf traits also positively correlate with deposition, including grooves, ridges, trichomes, stomatal density and epicuticular wax amount. The complexity of street canyon environments and the limited number of previous studies on novel forms of GI in street canyons mean that offering specific recommendations is currently unfeasible. This review highlights a need for further research, particularly on green walls and green screens, to substantiate their efficacy and investigate technical considerations. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Green roofs; Green screens; Green walls; Street greening","Air quality; Deposition; Imaging techniques; Plants (botany); Roofs; Air quality improvement; Green infrastructure; Measurement methods; Meteorological condition; Particle depositions; Passive control system; Physical environments; Pollution mitigation; Air pollution control; accuracy assessment; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; street canyon; traffic emission; urban atmosphere; air pollution; air quality; drug efficacy; geometry; meteorology; microscopy; pollutant; quantitative analysis; review; trichome; vegetation; air pollutant; city; exhaust gas; pollution; prevention and control; total quality management; tree; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Pollution; Quality Improvement; Trees; Vehicle Emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097637126

Incentives that encourage consumers to adopt MOW disposal strategies that minimize environmental impacts are needed. Policymakers must ensure that incentive programs align with environmental objectives and are economically competitive. The MOW disposal infrastructure in the city of Milwaukee, WI, was evaluated using a coordinated market model capturing the inherent value of environmental indicators (estimated with partial life cycle assessment methods) in the context of the city's MOW supply chain. Tax programs are identified that incentivize consumers to reduce emissions through MOW disposal patterns. Results indicate that the existing MOW management infrastructure in Milwaukee incentivizes residents to minimize MOW GHG emissions by sending MOW to composting and digestion sites that have lower tipping fees and are located closer to the city (have lower transport costs). Therefore, limitations associated with MOW collection likely decrease alternative landfill disposal options. GHG reduction policy prioritizes anaerobic digestion systems for MOW disposal, but the outcome can be altered depending upon the tipping fees and transport distances. Composting and digestion hold few opportunities for reducing ammonia emissions from landfills, but there is a need to expand ammonia emissions measurements from landfill systems to improve model predictions as ammonia losses can redeposit, resulting in environmental issues and indirect formation of N2O. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

While reports of topsoil magnetic enhancement after fires vary widely, recent evidence suggests that plant ashes provide the most significant source of magnetic enhancement after burning. To investigate the magnetic properties of burnt plant material, samples of individual plant species from Iceland and Germany were cleaned and combusted at various temperatures prior to rock magnetic and geochemical characterization. Mass-normalized saturation magnetization values for burnt plant residues increase with the extent of burning in nearly all samples. However, when normalized to the loss on ignition, fewer than half of ash and charcoal samples display magnetic enhancement relative to intact plant material. Thus, while magnetic mineral concentrations generally increase, changes in the total amount of magnetic material are much more variable. Elemental analyses of Icelandic samples reveal that both total plant Fe and saturation magnetization are strongly correlated with Ti and Al, indicating that most of the Fe-bearing magnetic phases originate from inorganic material such as soil and atmospheric dust. Electron microscopy confirmed that inorganic particulate matter remains on most plant surfaces after cleaning. Plants with more textured leaf surfaces retain more dust, and ash from these samples tend to exhibit higher saturation magnetization and metal concentrations. Magnetic properties of plant ash therefore result from the thermal transformation of Fe in both organic compounds and inorganic particulate matter, which become concentrated on a mass basis when organic matter is combusted. These results indicate that the soil magnetic response to burning will vary among sites and regions as a function of 1) fire intensity, 2) the local composition of dust and soil particles on leaf surfaces, and 3) vegetation type and consequent differences in leaf morphologies. © Copyright © 2021 Till, Moskowitz and Poulton.","fire; rock magnetism; soil magnetism; soils; vegetation","Charcoal; Dust; Fires; Geomagnetism; Incineration; Iron compounds; Lithology; Magnetic materials; Magnetic properties; Organic compounds; Particles (particulate matter); Soils; Textures; Geochemical characterization; Inorganic materials; Inorganic particulates; Magnetic enhancement; Magnetic signatures; Metal concentrations; Terrestrial ecosystems; Thermal transformations; Saturation magnetization; ash; fire; geochemistry; magnetic property; rock property; soil property; temperature effect; vegetation; Germany; Iceland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100066249

The research uses a questionnaire survey to analyze the residents’ willingness to purchase new energy vehicles in Jinan City of China, and utilizes the binomial logistic regression model and Global Moran's I to explain the impact of three factors (including respondents’ personal characteristics and subjective cognition, products, and social environment) on the purchase willingness of new energy vehicles. According to the survey, 75.12% of the respondents consider buying new energy vehicles in the future, but only 11.66% of the respondents know new energy vehicles well. It can be seen that the respondents in Jinan City generally have an insufficient understanding of new energy vehicles. It may lead to a decline in residents’ trust in new energy vehicles, which will in turn affect their purchase willingness. Based on the survey, we find that women who live far from the city center enjoy high incomes and have a low-carbon awareness, generally exhibit a higher willingness to purchase new energy vehicles. Spatial distribution of the purchase willingness has certain aggregation characteristics, showing a positive spatial correlation pattern. Purchase willingness has a certain positive diffusion effect in space, and areas with a higher purchase willingness have a positive driving effect on their surrounding regions. Spatial distribution of the purchase willingness can be used as one of the breakthroughs in promoting new energy vehicles. In addition, safety, price, after-sales service, and infrastructure of new energy vehicles are important determinants of people's purchase willingness. Among the types of subsidies, financial subsidy is most effective on the residents’ purchase willingness.

This study evaluates the critical processes, patterns, and impact factors of the carbon footprint of grain production in China based on a new scale data set: agricultural statistics data of over 300 prefecture-level regions. Results show that fertilizer application, straw burning, and methane emissions in rice paddy are the main causes of GHG emissions. High production carbon footprint (PCF) typically appears in areas with low crop yield, whereas low PCF appears in areas with intensive production. Longitude, altitude, and per unit yield are significant correlated with the methane emissions in rice paddy. The increase in GHG emissions from fertilizer application on per unit crop yield highly contributes to the increase in PCF. Moreover, longitude, latitude, and soil properties are the most important factors in PCF variation. Promoting large-scale and intensive modern agriculture production remains a key measure to mitigate GHG emission.

This paper examines how investor-owned electricity companies in North Carolina have turned the threat of energy efficiency – or “negawatts” – into a new arena of accumulation. They have done this by exploiting features of the North Carolina Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (REPS), a law passed in 2007 that encourages energy efficiency. I argue that under REPS, electricity companies have positioned themselves, counter-intuitively, as the primary producers of less of their main product. As such, these companies have been awarded high rates of return for creating energy efficiency projects. This paper builds on previous research into how environmental crises like climate change have been turned into new opportunities for accumulation in the neoliberal era. It focuses on neoliberal accumulation in an understudied system (electricity), socio-nature (energy efficiency), and political economic context (the regulated monopoly). Through reregulation, REPS creates negawatts as a new monopoly product for IOUs, contrary to what might be expected from previous research on green neoliberalism which often emphasizes the processes of commodification. This case study offers insights into the kinds of accumulation tactics that may occur in other regulated monopoly political economic contexts. Illuminating these tactics can inform more equitable and sustainable energy efficiency policies and programs by focusing attention on the need for transparency, alternative energy efficiency producers, and diverse energy efficiency programs aimed at reducing energy poverty. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Environmental governance; Neoliberalism; Regulated monopoly","climate change; electricity; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental management; monopoly; neoliberalism; North Carolina; United States; Rosa carolina carolina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098149072

For this purpose, we perform a complete description of the EU heating sector compliant with official statistics and decompose the EU power demand in different uses to define and assess different levels of heat electrification. We find that heat electrification is an effective decarbonisation option, which can reduce the total energy related emissions by up to 17%, if paired with simultaneous expansion of low-carbon energy. Due to the relative sizes of heat and power demands, we find that most national power systems could cope with higher heat-electrification rates. Specifically, an additional heat pump capacity in the order of 1.1–1.6 TWth can be deployed based on the existing firm power capacity, which would correspond to a heat pump share of 29–45% in space heating. Based on their current power capacity, 12 Member States are prepared for even full electrification scenarios, whereas three Member States could get their power system stressed if 40–60% of all fossil-fuelled technologies are substituted.

Existing CO2 mitigation measures are primarily oriented towards wider deployment of low-carbon technologies of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, focusing on energy production, distribution and energy use sectors, as well as the transport sector. Due to higher CO2 reduction efficiency and the cost aspect, the direct CO2 mitigation options currently applied are mostly oriented on large scale CO2 generators.

In this study, three sustainable transportation designs and an on-grid power plant design using photovoltaic (PV) panels were analyzed for their feasibility as an alternative to diesel-powered tourist boats. Various financial and technical aspects were considered, such as the local irradiation, energy yield, and system energy loss. As a case study, a solar-aided boat was considered, where an off-grid rooftop PV system with 9.8 kWh batteries was installed to meet the energy requirements for internal services and reduce diesel usage. The solar-aided boat was demonstrated to be an economical solution, where the PV system reduced the diesel consumption of the boat by 15% and produced an annual energy output of 5540 kWh. For fully electric solar boats, simulation results showed that a 60 kWh battery system covers the initial investment within 9 years, while a solar boat with 120 kWh a battery system covers it in 13 years. A 300 kW on-grid PV plant was analyzed for its ability to meet the energy demands of an entire tourist boat fleet, and the plant was estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by 330 tons each year. These findings show that various off-grid rooftop PV systems can be adapted for sustainable transportation while reducing the operating costs of the boat.

Stakeholder participation has been hailed as a facilitated approach in climate change adaptation that supports social learning, depolarization of perceptions, and fosters collective action. But stakeholder participation remains loosely interpreted and evaluating measures are limited. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to investigate how social relations among stakeholders, which emerge as a result of participation, are associated with stakeholder learning, as changes in perceptions of climate change. We hypothesized that reciprocal ties of understanding, respect, and influence can predict changes in perceptions of climate change. This approach was applied to a case study in Deal Island Peninsula, Maryland (USA) where local residents, scientists, and government officials met from 2016 to 2018 to collaboratively manage the impacts of sea-level rise in their communities. We found that social relations based on mutual understanding, respect, and influence are positively associated with perceptions of climate change. We provide a detailed conceptualization and implementation of a network-based approach that may serve as a potential quantitative performance measure of stakeholder participation processes in climate change adaptation.

Several strategies have been considered to mitigate the impact of agriculture on climate, among these the utilization of fertilizers added with nitrification inhibitors such as DMPP (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate) may represent a suitable solution. DMPP inhibits the growth and activity of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms, particularly the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, which are involved in N2O production. At present, little information is available on the effects of DMPP on the catabolic diversity of soil microbial community. In this study, the N2O emission by soil was performed by using the static chamber technique. The biological determinations of the microbial biomass carbon and the catabolic profile were assessed by measuring the substrate-induced respiration during the entire growing season of a potato crop under two nitrogen treatments: fertilization with and without DMPP. Our results did not show a clear mitigation of N2O emission by DMPP, even if a tendency to lower N2O fluxes in DMPP plots occurred when soil temperatures were lower than 20◦C. Conversely, DMPP deeply affected the microbial biomass and the catabolism of soil microorganisms, exerting a negative effect when it accumulated in excessive doses in the soil, limiting the growth and the capacity of soil microorganism communities to use different substrates. © 2020 by the authors.

Efforts are oriented towards developing and adopting sustainable solutions. Palestinian territories depend on imported energy (100% fossil fuel and 89% electricity) from Israel, and suffer from MSW accumulation environmental consequences due to improper disposal method. West Bank MSW generation rate reached 2600 ton per day (0.91 kg per capita per day) in 2019, and it increases 4% annually. Three MSW dumping sites are currently operating, namely; Zahrat Al-Finjan to serve middle and northern West Bank area (of 88% utilization rate), Al-Menia (of 9% utilization rate) to serve southern area, and one in the city of Jericho (overloaded). Palestinian government strategic plans (2017–2022) aim to reduce imported energy dependency, reduce CO2eq emissions, and adopt sustainable solutions for MSW disposal. WTE is considered a promising solution to achieve these objectives. This research investigates three WTE options for the West Bank, two of them assume producing electricity by incineration, which are building a plant in Zahrat Al-Finjan (1500 ton/day), or building a smaller plant in a transfer station (750 ton/day), the third option assumes waste-to-heat option for local industrial loads. To perform the study, all MSW, energy, and population data were collected and analyzed spatially. After that, considered options were analyzed from economic and environmental point of view, and different operational incentives were proposed to enhance its feasibility. Results show that waste to heat plant is the most feasible. Unfortunately, this option is impractical due to demand unavailability. For electric generation plants in Zahrat Al-Finjan and the transfer station, MARR and plant life time were assumed 10% and 30 years, respectively. If the proposed plants will be responsible for handling MSW collection and transferring costs, NPV for it will be 25.2 and −2.63 million U.S dollars, RoR equals to 12% and 9.7%, and SPP equals to 8.5 and 11 years, respectively. While if the Palestinian government will continue taking this burden, Zahrat Al-Finjan and transfer station WtE plants NPV will be 207 and 12.5 million U.S dollars, RoR equals to 22% and 11.3%, and SPP equals to 4.6 and 9 years, LCOE equals to 0.0486 and 0.0497 $/kWh, and annual saved CO2eq equals to 1.23 and 0.58 Mt CO2eq, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy recovery; Feasibility analysis; Landfill; Municipal solid waste; Sustainable assessment; Waste to energy","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Industrial research; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Transfer stations; Waste incineration; Waste management; Electric generation; Energy dependency; Environmental consequences; Global energy demand; MSW generation rates; Palestinian territories; Sustainable solution; Utilization rates; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089946672

This study investigated the space-time distribution of BC concentrations and compared the BC pollution profiles between traffics and toll collection lanes of an urban highway toll plaza in Shanghai. Experiments were carried out between August 15 and August 22, 2019. The mean BC concentrations at east-westbound manual toll collection (MTC) lanes were 17.8 and 14.8 μg m−3, respectively, while the counterpart values for the electronic toll collection (ETC) lanes were 7.7 and 9.2 μg m−3, respectively. Moreover, parallel measurements at urban background site yielded mean BC level ranges between 3.4 and 2.8 μg m−3. The traffic volumes through the east-westbound ETC and MTC lanes were estimated as 489 and 347 vehicles h−1, respectively. Although ETC-lane traffic was ~1.4 times higher than that of the MTC lanes, owing to the toll collection method, the BC concentrations at the MTC lanes were 1.6–2.3 times higher than those at the ETC lanes and 4.8–5.9 times higher than that of the urban background site. As per multivariate regression analysis, it was found that the variations in BC concentrations were caused by traffic emissions and influenced by the local background BC levels, influences of wind speed and humidity were also determined. This study found that at highway toll plazas, when compared with MTC lanes, ETC lanes can contribute to reducing BC emissions by ~50%. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Black carbon; ETC/MTC lanes; Highway toll plaza; Traffic emission; Traffic volume",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092186430

The development of low-GHG-emission and water-conserving agriculture will inevitably be the trend in the future. Because of the physiological differences among crops and their response efficiency to external changes, changes in planting structure, climate and input of production factors will have an impact on regional agricultural water use and GHG emissions. This paper systematically analyzed the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of crop planting structure, climate, and production factor inputs in Heilongjiang Province, the main grain-producing region of China, from 2000 to 2015, and quantified the regional agricultural water use and GHG emissions characteristics under different scenarios by using the Penman-Monteith formula and the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model. The results showed that the global warming potential (GWP) increased by 15% due to the change in planting structure. A large increase in the proportion of rice and corn sown was the main reason. During the study period, regional climate change had a positive impact on the water-saving and emission reduction of the agricultural industry. The annual water demand per unit area decreased by 19%, and the GWP decreased by 12% compared with that in 2000. The input of fertilizer and other means of production will have a significant impact on GHG emissions from farmlands. The increase in N fertilizer input significantly increased N2O emissions, with a 5% increase in GWP. Agricultural water consumption and carbon emissions are affected by changes in climate, input of means of production, and planting structure. Therefore, multiple regulatory measures should be taken in combination with regional characteristics to realize a new layout of planting structure with low emissions, water conservation, and sustainability. © 2020","climate change; greenhouse gas; planting structure; the Denitrification-Decomposition model (DNDC); water demand","carbon emission; climate change; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; human activity; intensive agriculture; nature-society relations; regional climate; water demand; water use efficiency; China; Heilongjiang; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093977144

There have been many studies on air quality improvement and transmission mechanisms, showing that proper measures can improve air quality efficiently. Under the unexpected COVID-19 time, lots of measures were taken by the government, and the question of whether those strict measures have somehow influenced the local air quality remains. This article mainly combines some relevant policies and behaviors during the outbreak of COVID-19 to explore whether this epidemic has an impact on emissions, and to observe whether the sub-index PM2.5 representing air quality is changed. Based on assessing the cause of air pollution in each city and evaluating the policy implemented to prevent COVID-19 from spreading, the topmost effective policies that reduce air pollution are preventing residents' transportation, reducing deliveries, and shutting down heavy industry factories. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.",,"Environmental protection; Air quality improvement; Heavy industries; Transmission mechanisms; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100778842

Employing the super-efficiency SBM model, we first estimate the carbon emissions efficiency (CEE) of 262 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2016. Then we study and explain the club convergence of CEE combining Markov and spatial Markov models and Moran’s I test method. The results show that CEE has improved, especially for the western and northeastern cities. The efficiency of the northwest cities is low, while those of the central and coastal cities are relatively high. Club convergence exists in China’s urban CEE. Cities with high- and low-level efficiency have much higher convergence levels. There are significant spatial agglomeration and spillover effects in China’s urban CEE, contributing to the club convergence. Our analysis suggests that “cross-border” cooperation and communication between cities in different clubs should be highly promoted. Cities in high-level efficiency clubs are encouraged to play its role in radiating the lower-level cities. And the Chinese government is encouraged to strengthen carbon emissions mitigation in low-level areas through combining the green “Belt and Road” construction with the establishment of a national carbon market. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions efficiency; Chinese cities; Club convergence; Markov model; Spatial Markov model; Super SBM model","agglomeration; carbon emission; convergence; efficiency measurement; energy market; performance assessment; spillover effect; trend analysis; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; Asian continental ancestry group; China; city; human; sustainable development; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Humans; Sustainable Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089859130

To investigate the synergistic results of emission control and meteorological environment, PM2.5 samples collected from October 2013 to July 2016 and November 2018 to October 2019 in Jiaozuo city were analyzed for their compositions, secondary species (Ss) variations, and factors changing for Ss formation. The results showed that the concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) generally decreased over the same seasonal period during these years. In addition, the concentrations and proportions of each Ss increased with the increase in the PM2.5 level in these years, implying that although PM2.5 levels have been reduced by various control policies, Ss formation would remain the major contributor to PM elevations. The enhanced effects of gas-phase reactions on intensification of sulfate, SOA, and PM were observed in 2018-2019, which was consistent with the elevation of nitrate and SOA at PM levels of >150 μg/m3. Only sulfate in all PM levels sharply decreased after 2015, showing the fine effect of coal-related pollution control and the importance of collaborative control of NOx, volatile organic compounds, and organic aerosol emissions with SO2 emissions in the future. © 2021 The Authors.

Preserving the carbon stocks in peatland is therefore crucial for climate change mitigation. Under natural conditions, peatland carbon storage is maintained by moist peat conditions, which decreases decomposition and encourages peat formation. However, conversion of peatlands to drainage-based agriculture in the form of industrial plantations and smallholder farming has resulted in globally significant greenhouse gas emissions. Paludiculture, loosely conceptualized as biomass production on wet peatlands with the potential to maintain carbon storage, is proposed as a sustainable, non-drainage-based agriculture alternative for peatland use. However, while the concept of paludiculture was developed in temperate ecoregions, its application in the tropics is poorly understood. In this review, we examine common definitions of paludiculture used in literature to derive key themes and future directions. We found three common themes: ecosystem services benefits of paludiculture, hydrological conditions of peatlands, and vegetation selection for planting. Ambiguities surrounding these themes have led to questions on whether paludiculture applications are sustainable in the context of carbon sequestration in peat soil. This review aims to evaluate and advance current understanding of paludiculture in the context of tropical peatlands, which is especially pertinent given expanding agriculture development into Central Africa and South America, where large reserves of peatlands were recently discovered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass production; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Ecosystem service; Peatlands; Sustainable agriculture","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Land use; Peat; Soils; Tropics; Agriculture development; Biomass productions; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem services; Hydrological condition; Industrial plantations; Sustainable land use; Wetlands; agricultural development; alternative agriculture; biomass allocation; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem service; paludification; peatland; terrestrial ecosystem; agricultural worker; biogeographic region; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; Central Africa; climate change; human; land use; peatland; plantation; review; soil; South America; sustainable agriculture; tropics; vegetation; Central Africa; South America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091100671

The framework integrated the superiority of bi-level programming (BLP), two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), mix-integer programming (MIP), interval parameter programming (IPP) models and carbon emission trading (CET) mechanism, which could effectively deal with the planning problems in the EWEN optimization process. BLP helped decision makers make leader-follower choices when they have conflicting preferences. TSP with IPP could validly address the uncertain information expressed as interval values with unknown distribution. MIP was introduced as an efficacious tool to evaluate the capacity expansion potential in EPS. CET mechanism was applied to reinforce the CO2 mitigation effect during the EWEN optimization process. Then the proposed framework was applied into a case study in Shanxi Province, a main thermal power base in China to optimize the EWEN. Results indicated that the power supply structure was inclined to show a low-carbon transition trend in the planning periods. Meanwhile, coupled with the strict water conservation policy, every 5% reduction in carbon emission density would lead to an average decreasing rate of 8% for SO2, 3% for NOx and 12% for PM.

The effectivenes of policies aiming to enhance the financial viability of low-carbon hydrogen production was quantified. A spatially explicit, multi-period cost optimization model was developed for light duty hydrogen hydrogen vehicle deployment in British Columbia under three demand scenarios. Subsidies and regulations were coupled to current provincial policies (a carbon tax and a low carbon fuel standard). The results indicated that production tax credits and electricity incentives were up to 24 times more effective in facilitating low-carbon hydrogen production compared to capital subsidies, bans on steam methane reforming or the adoption of higher carbon taxes. The strategic deployment of policies over time was found to be more effective than cumulative subsidies. © 2020","Carbon tax; Low carbon fuel standard; Low-carbon hydrogen; Policy effectiveness; Production tax credit; Supply chain optimization","Carbon; Cost reduction; Emission control; Hydrogen economy; Light weight vehicles; Steam reforming; Supply chains; Taxation; Cost optimization; Economic instruments; Financial viability; Hydrogen supply chains; Hydrogen vehicles; Production tax credit; Spatially explicit; Strategic deployment; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094851001

Implementing adaptation strategies is thus crucial to secure future agricultural production and rural livelihoods. To support effective adaptation, it is necessary to understand how farmers, as primary land-use decision-makers, perceive and respond to climate change. We conducted semi-structured interviews to examine climate change adaptation behaviour by commercial grain and wine grape farmers in a water-scarce, recently drought-stricken agricultural region of South Africa's Western Cape. Specifically, we investigated (1) how farmers perceive climate change, (2) which factors influence their adaptive behaviour and (3) which adaptation strategies they apply in their farming practices, and whether these are medium to long-term or short-term coping strategies. Through the resulting discourses, we found that most farmers have observed long-term regional changes in climate, such as changes in rainfall patterns, increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events. Farmers' adaptive behaviour is influenced by previous experience of climatic stresses and internal factors, including risk perception, perceived adaptive capacity and cognitive biases. Institutional and biophysical constraints including perceived lack of government support and soil composition are external barriers to adaptation. Most farmers have implemented adaptive strategies on their farms, including alterations to soil and crop management, such as changes of harvest and planting time, crop rotations and water conservation techniques. However, farmers have planned fewer adaptive strategies to future impacts of climate change than current implemented strategies. Current strategies are mostly technological and address direct impacts of climate stressors, although climate change impacts go beyond the farm scale into society. These findings may have important implications for future policy making and climate change adaptation in this region, given the place-specific institutional and biophysical barriers identified by farmers, and the strategic importance of the Western Cape in South African agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive behaviour; Cape Floristic Region; Drought; Risk perception; South Africa","adaptive management; climate change; development strategy; drought; farmers attitude; perception; rural area; South Africa; Western Cape; Vitis vinifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096376658

Nevertheless, all of the reports are limited compared to data from the same period over the past few years, providing mainly an overview of past events, with no future predictions. Lockdown level can be directly related to the number of new COVID-19 cases, air pollution, and economic restriction. As lockdown status varies considerably across the globe, there is a window for mega-cities to determine the optimum lockdown flexibility. To that end, firstly, we employed four different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to examine the compatibility to the original levels of CO, O3, NO2, NO, PM2.5, and PM10, for São Paulo City, the current Pandemic epicenter in South America. After checking compatibility, we simulated four hypothetical scenarios: 10%, 30%, 70%, and 90% lockdown to predict air pollution levels. To our knowledge, ANN have not been applied to air pollution prediction by lockdown level. Using a limited database, the Multilayer Perceptron neural network has proven to be robust (with Mean Absolute Percentage Error ∼ 30%), with acceptable predictive power to estimate air pollution changes. We illustrate that air pollutant levels can effectively be controlled and predicted when flexible lockdown measures are implemented. The models will be a useful tool for governments to manage the delicate balance among lockdown, number of COVID-19 cases, and air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Artificial neural networks; Lockdown flexibility; SARS-CoV-2","Air quality; Forecasting; Air pollutants; Air pollution predictions; Future predictions; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Pollution level; Predictive power; South America; Multilayer neural networks; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease control; disease spread; epidemic; global perspective; governance approach; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; artificial neural network; Brazil; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; human; lockdown; measurement error; multilayer perceptron; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; South America; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095781851

In the operation, AE signals were captured by the AE sensor and converted into digital signal data by AE data acquisition module. The digital data were denoised to remove ambient and wheel/rail contact noises, and the denoised data were processed and classified to localize cracks in the steel rail using a deep learning algorithmic model. The AE signals of pencil lead break at the head, web, and foot of steel rail were used to train and test the algorithmic model. In training and testing the algorithm, the AE signals were divided into two groupings (150 and 300 AE signals) and the classification accuracy compared. The deep learning-based AE scheme was also implemented onsite to detect cracks in the steel rail. The total accuracy (average F1 score) under the first and second groupings were 86.6% and 96.6%, and that of the onsite experiment was 77.33%. The novelty of this research lies in the use of a single AE sensor and AE signal-based deep learning algorithm to efficiently detect and localize cracks in the steel rail, unlike existing AE crack-localization technology that relies on two or more sensors and human interpretation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, water is closely intertwined with energy. Carbon taxes are an essential policy tool for managing energy use, and could therefore indirectly change the water footprint. Previous research on water footprints has revealed the historical characteristics of water footprints, but has not predicted how these characteristics would change under a carbon tax. Identifying the indirect impacts of carbon taxes on water footprints could therefore offer important information to support more effective energy and water policies. In the present study, we explored the impacts of carbon taxes on water footprints. We established a computable general equilibrium model to predict the effects of carbon taxes on the socioeconomic system, and adopted an input-output model to account for changes in the water footprint. We then used China as a case study. We found that a carbon tax could reduce the total water footprint, even though the water footprint for primary industries increased. In addition, the tax could decrease the virtual water content, and the reduction of virtual water content is the greatest for the secondary industries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; CGE; Virtual water; Water footprint","carbon; coal; natural gas; water; water; computable general equilibrium analysis; energy planning; environmental protection; policy making; pollution tax; socioeconomic status; water footprint; water management; water stress; Article; case study; China; electricity; plant water use; tax; water conservation; water content; carbon footprint; tax; China; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; China; Conservation of Water Resources; Taxes; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097449764

However, insufficient electron donor limited its denitrification efficiency. Iron scraps from lathe cutting waste consist of more than 95% iron could be used as electron donors to enhance denitrification. In this study, EFBs with and without iron scraps supplementation (EFB-Fe and EFB, respectively) were conducted to explore the impacts of iron scraps addition on nitrogen removal, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and microbial communities. Results showed the total nitrogen (TN) removal in EFB-Fe improved to 79% while that in EFB was 56%. N2O emission was 0–6.20 mg m−2 d−1 (EFB-Fe) and 1.74–15.2 mg m−2 d−1 (EFB). Iron scraps could not only improve nitrogen removal efficiency, but also reduce N2O emissions. In addition, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that adding iron scraps could improve the sum of denitrification related genera, among which Novosphingobium accounted for the highest proportion (6.75% of PFe1, 4.24% of PFe2, 3.18% of PFe3). Iron-oxidizing bacteria and iron-respiring bacteria associated with and nitrate reducing bacteria mainly concentrated on the surface of iron scraps. Principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated that iron scraps were the key factor affecting microbial community composition. The mechanism of iron scraps enhanced nitrogen removal was realized by enhanced biological denitrification process. Iron release dynamic from iron scraps was detected in bench-scale experiment and the electron transfer mechanism was that Fe0 transferred electrons directly to NO3−-N, and biological iron nitrogen cycle occurred in EFB-Fe without secondary pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological floating beds; Iron cycle; Iron release dynamic; Nitrogen removal; Nitrous oxide emission","Bacteria; Denitrification; Efficiency; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Electron transitions; Electron transport properties; Emission control; Iron scrap; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Biological denitrification; Denitrification efficiencies; Electron transfer mechanisms; Enhanced nitrogen removal; High-throughput sequencing; Microbial community composition; Nitrogen removal efficiency; Wastewater treatment plants; Iron; iron; nitrogen; biological product; iron; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; denitrification; emission control; iron; microbial community; nitrate; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; Article; denitrification; ecological floating bed; electron transport; environmental aspects and related phenomena; high throughput sequencing; iron oxidizing bacterium; iron respiring bacterium; microbial community; nitrate reducing bacterium; nitrous oxide emission; organisms by metabolism; species composition; surface property; waste component removal; water temperature; bioreactor; Novosphingobium; Biological Products; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Iron; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093670756

As a carbon-neutral energy resource, biomass is regarded as a promising substitute of coal to reduce carbon emissions in power generation. For the purposes of low-carbon power generation, this paper develops a bi-level programming approach to seek an optimal biomass-coal co-firing method under a carbon emissions allowance allocation scheme, in which the local government on the upper level determines the carbon emissions allowance scheme based on economic and environmental targets as the leader, and the power plants on the lower level develop power generation plans to maximize profits under the upper-level restrictions. Different from previous papers, this optimization approach fully considers the hierarchy of multiple decision makers and environmental-economic equilibrium for global optimization. A practical case in Heilongjiang Province is presented to verify the efficiency and practicality of the proposed optimization method in carbon emissions control and biomass fuel utilization. The calculation results under various scenarios are analyzed, and the analysis indicates that power plants with lower biomass utilization are more sensitive to carbon emissions constraints.

Therefore, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP) for the protocol experiment in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) has been developed. Our analysis focuses on the regional response in the hydrological cycle, especially in East Asia (EA). The peak temperature changes in EA (5.9 K) and the Korean peninsula (KO) (6.1 K) are larger than the global mean surface air temperature (GSAT) response. The precipitation changes are approximately 9.4% (EA) and 23.2% (KO) at the phase change time (130–150 years); however, the largest increase is approximately 16.6% (EA) and 36.5% (KO) in the ramp-down period (150–160 years). In addition, the differences are below 5 mm/day and 1 day for the precipitation intensity indices (Rx1day and Rx5day) and frequency indices (R95 and R99), respectively. Furthermore, the monsoon rainband of the ramp-down period moves northward as the earlier onset with high confidence compared to the ramp-up period; however, it does not move north to the KO region. The results suggest that reducing CO2 moves the rainband southward. However, a detailed interpretation in terms of the mechanism needs to be carried out in further research. © 2021 by the authors.

It turns out that the city-to-city network has not been able to adapt well to the development of the society, and the hub-and-spoke network came into being. The hub-and-spoke network demonstrates the advantages of reducing the operating costs of airlines to keep a competitive advantage, and by maintaining the interests of airlines in the rapidly developing context. However, during the operation of aircrafts, they consume fuel and spew a great deal of harmful pollutants into the air, which has an adverse impact on the living environment. This paper explores the impact and external costs associated with hub-and-spoke network in air transport from an environmental perspective. With some mathematical models, we construct a hub-and-spoke network and take a quantitative study on the environmental impact of air transport. For calculating pollutant emissions, meteorological conditions were considered to revise the pollutant emission factors of the Engine Emissions Data Base (EEDB) published by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The environmental external costs measurement model is employed to calculate the externality of toxic gas and greenhouse gas (GHG). In order to make the study more convincing, two alternative networks are computed: hub-and-spoke network and city-to-city network. It is found that the hub-and-spoke network is associated with poorer environmental impact and environmental external costs because of the different network characteristics and the scale of the fleets. Therefore, under the general trend of green aviation, the environmental impact and environmental external costs associated with hub-and-spoke network in air transport provides a certain reference for airlines’ strategic decision-making. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the half-filled or isolated impurity state can also be the new recombination center for photogenerated electrons/holes, which seriously influence the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst in the visible-light region. Therefore, how to prolong the photogenerated carrier life of nonmetallic doping metal oxides is the difficult and challenging topic in the field of photocatalysis. In this work, the hexagonal nanosheets assembled by N-doped C (N-C)-coated N-doped In2O3 (N-In2O3) nanoparticles (N-C/N-In2O3 HS) was obtained by simply pyrolyzing the In(2,5-PDC) hexagonal sheets. The N-C/N-In2O3 HS catalyst exhibit good photocatalytic activity and cycle stability in the long-wavelength region of visible light (λ = 520 and 595 nm). The effective utilization of long-wavelength visible light for N-C/N-In2O3 HS was mainly attributed to the acceptor-donor-acceptor compensation mechanism between the oxygen vacancy (VO) and substitutional N-doping (Ns) sites, which made the N-C/N-In2O3 HS possess a continuous band structure, without the half-filled or isolated impurity state in the band gap, and extended its light absorption edge to 733 nm. The compensation mechanism of nitrogen doping on In2O3 can promote the photocatalytic activity under longer-wavelength yellow light (595 nm) irradiation. The N-C layer coated on the N-In2O3 nanoparticles acted as a good acceptor of photogenerated electrons, facilitating the effective spatial separation of photogenerated carriers and extend photogenerated carrier lifetimes. The comparative photocatalytic experiments (N-In2O3 HS and N-C/N-In2O3 HS) show that the presence of N-doped C layer can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency by nearly 10-fold. This double-doping and carbon-coating strategy provided a novel research idea to solve the problem that nonmetal atoms doped metal oxides led to the secondary combination of photogenerated electrons/holes. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carrier lifetime; Catalyst activity; Doping (additives); Energy gap; Hydraulic structures; Light; Light absorption; Nanoparticles; Nonmetals; Photocatalytic activity; Compensation mechanism; Long-wavelength regions; Photocatalytic efficiency; Photogenerated carriers; Photogenerated electrons; Recombination centers; Visible light region; Visible-light response; Indium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099296850

In order to clarify the source contribution and formation mechanism of O3, the critical precursors of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured with both on-line and off-line methods in Luoyang City in summer of 2019. The concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx, sum of NO and NO2) and O3 were simultaneously monitored. Fifty-seven VOCs measured in U.S. Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Station (PAMS) showed daily concentrations in a range of 14.5 ± 5.33 to 29.2 ± 11.2 ppbv in Luoyang, which were comparable with those in other Chinese megacities. The mass compositions of VOCs were determined, with comparatively low proportions of alkanes (&lt;50%) but high fractions of photoreactive alkenes and alkyne. Source apportionment of VOCs was conducted by Hybrid Environmental Receptor Model (HERM). The results indicated that industrial (38.5%) and traffic (32.0%) were the two dominated pollution sources of VOCs in the urban, while the biogenic and residential sources had contributions of 15.8% and 13.8%, respectively. To further measure the O3 formation sensitivity and its source attribution, the WRF-CHEM model was adopted in this study. The variation of O3 between the observation and the stimulation using the local emission inventory showed an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.85. The simulation conducted by WRF-CHEM indicated an average of 43.5% of the O3 was associated with the regional transportation, revealing the importance of inter-regional prevention and control policy. Traffic and biogenic emissions were the two major pollution sources to an O3 episode occurred from July 21 to July 27, 2019 (when O3 concentration over 150 μg m−3) in Luoyang, with average contributions of 22.9% and 18.3%, respectively. The O3 isopleths proved that its formation in the atmosphere of Luoyang was in transitional regime and collectively controlled by both VOCs and NOx. This was different from the observations in main cities of NCP before implantations of strict emission controls. The isopleths additionally designated that the O3 formation regime would move forward or shift to NOx regime after a reduction of over 45% during the episode. Similar patterns were also reported in other Chinese megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai, due to the tightening of the NOx control policies. Our results do support that the simultaneous controls of NOx and VOCs were effective in reductions of tropospheric O3 in Luoyang. Meanwhile, joint regional control policies on the emissions of NOx and VOCs can potentially overwhelm the current O3 pollutions in China. © 2020 The Authors","NOx; Pollution control; Tropospheric ozone; VOCs; WRF-CHEM","Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Troposphere; Volatile organic compounds; Environmental receptors; Photochemical assessment monitoring stations; Prevention and controls; Regional transportation; Simultaneous control; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Transitional regimes; Air pollution; alkane; alkene; alkyne; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; megacity; nitrogen oxides; ozone; pollution control; source apportionment; summer; troposphere; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; environmental aspects and related phenomena; priority journal; source apportionment; summer; traffic pollution; troposphere; urban area; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Henan; Luoyang; North China Plain; Shanghai; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097130959

This approach can effectively reduce the biases inherent to precipitation projections from different RCMs and thus provide more reliable ensemble projections. The proposed approach was applied to RCM projections over the Loess Plateau of China, which features complex topography and various climatic zones. Precipitation projections from 7 RCMs were used, and 21 sets of downscaling results were obtained. The performance of the VCED in reproducing historical precipitation across the Loess Plateau was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), the Taylor diagram, and the rank histogram (RH). The proposed VCED approach was found to be more effective than quantile mapping and bivariate copula methods in achieving robust precipitation projections. Overall flat RH diagrams indicate that the ensemble prediction and observations have strong consistency in distribution. Future precipitation changes of two 30-year periods (i.e., the 2050s and 2080s) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) over the Loess Plateau were then analyzed after postdownscaling processes. The results show that the average annual precipitation over the Loess Plateau may increase by 8.4%–11.4% under the RCP 4.5 scenario and by 9.3%–17.5% under RCP 8.5. The projected precipitation in the south-central parts of the Loess Plateau would be significantly reduced whereas those of the other parts be significantly increased. © 2020.

Fisheries management is highly dependent on the stability or predictability of targeted fish populations. Oceanic changes occurring as a result of climate change will see continuing and potentially irreversible deviations from the conditions of fisheries past. These changes present challenges to fisheries management at all scales – from local to international – relating to food security, sustainability, and ecological integrity. Areas of measurably warmer ocean, or ‘hotspots’, are a very clear indicator of direct climate change effects. RFBs with hotspots in their areas of competence were chosen for this study. Three levels of institutional engagement were developed: Awareness of climate change; Learning about climate change; Action taken by the institutions. While 94% of institutions demonstrated awareness of climate change and 82% demonstrated learning about climate change, only 41% demonstrated some form of action; and these were mainly procedural and administrative. Only two of the RFBs considered made explicit statements about incorporating climate change into future fishing management plans. The inference is that RFBs are largely practising business-as-usual, with the implication that many exploited fish populations will face additional survival pressure as the sea around them alters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Fisheries management; Governance; Hotspots; Regional fisheries bodies","climate change; climate effect; fishery management; governance approach; regional planning; survival; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096161521

Therefore, it is important to regularly reassess the relevance of emissions scenarios in light of changing global circumstances and compare them with long-term developments to determine if they are still plausible, considering the newest insights. Four scenario series, SA90, IS92, SRES, and RCP/SSP, were central in the scenario-based literature informing the five Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the sixth assessment cycle. Here we analyze the historical trends of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industry and emissions drivers between 1960 and 2017. We then compare the emission scenario series with historical trends for the period 1990–2017/2018. The results show that historical trends are quite consistent with medium scenarios in each series. As a result, they can be regarded as valid inputs for past and future analyses of climate change and impacts. Global CO2 emissions 1960–2018 (and 1990–2018) comprised six (and three) overall subperiods of emissions growth significantly higher and lower than average. Historically, CO2 emissions (in absolute numbers and growth rate) are tightly coupled with primary energy and indirectly with GDP. Global emissions generally followed a medium-high pathway, captured by “middle-of-the-road” scenario narratives in the earlier series, and by combinations of “global-sustainability” and “middle-of-the-road” narratives in the most recent series (SRES and SSP-baselines). Historical non-OECD trends were best captured by “rapid-growth” and “regional-competition” scenarios, while OECD trends were close to regional-sustainability and global-sustainability scenarios. Areas where the emissions scenarios captured the historical trends less well, are renewable and nuclear primary energy supply. The fact that the actual historical development is consistent with rapid-growth narratives in the non-OECD regions might have important implications for future greenhouse gas emissions and associated climatic change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emission scenarios against historical trends; Emissions scenarios; Global; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Non-OECD/OECD; Socioeconomic trends","carbon dioxide; climate change; fossil fuel; global change; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; OECD; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097636895

In the early stages of the pandemic, social distancing measures, such as lockdown restrictions, were applied in a non-uniform way across the world to reduce the spread of the virus. While such restrictions contributed to flattening the curve in places like Italy, Germany, and South Korea, it plunged the economy in the United States to a level of recession not seen since WWII, while also improving air quality due to the reduced mobility. Using daily Earth observation data (Day/Night Band (DNB) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Suomi-NPP and NO2 measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument TROPOMI) along with monthly averaged cell phone derived mobility data, we examined the economic and environmental impacts of lockdowns in Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; Washington DC from February to April 2020— encompassing the most profound shutdown measures taken in the U.S. The preliminary analysis revealed that the reduction in mobility involved two major observable impacts: (i) improved air quality (a reduction in NO2 and PM2.5 concentration), but (ii) reduced economic activity (a decrease in energy consumption as measured by the radiance from the DNB data) that impacted on gross domestic product, poverty levels, and the unemployment rate. With the continuing rise of COVID-19 cases and declining economic conditions, such knowledge can be combined with unemployment and demographic data to develop policies and strategies for the safe reopening of the economy while preserving our environment and protecting vulnerable populations susceptible to COVID-19 infection. © 2020 by the authors.

Bees are important for terrestrial biodiversity as they provide native plant species with pollination services. However, little information is available regarding their mutualistic interactions with woody plant species. In the first network study from sub-Saharan West Africa, we investigated the effects of land-use intensity and climatic seasonality on plant–bee communities and their interaction networks. In total, we recorded 5686 interactions between 53 flowering woody plant species and 100 bee species. Bee-species richness and the number of interactions were higher in the low compared to medium and high land-use intensity sites. Bee-and plant-species richness and the number of interactions were higher in the dry compared to the rainy season. Plant–bee visitation networks were not strongly affected by land-use intensity; however, climatic seasonality had a strong effect on network architecture. Null-model corrected connectance and nestedness were higher in the dry compared to the rainy season. In addition, network specialization and null-model corrected modularity were lower in the dry compared to the rainy season. Our results suggest that in our study region, seasonal effects on mutualistic network architecture are more pronounced compared to land-use change effects. Nonetheless, the decrease in bee-species richness and the number of plant–bee interactions with an increase in land-use intensity highlights the importance of savanna conservation for maintaining bee diversity and the concomitant provision of ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

The set in 2007 targets are on the way to be even exceeded till the end of 2020 when EU is expecting to report at least a 20% greenhouse emission reduction from their levels in 1990, 20 % gross final energy consumption by renewable energy sources and 20% energy efficiency improvement. That satisfactory result isn't enough to reflect the climate changes with the speed of their consequences. Namely, because of this the EU has put in place a legislation frames to achieve new climate and energy targets up to 2030. While the EU is working on fulfilling a decarbonisation strategy and insuring a legislative framework via Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources for all EU member states, Bulgarian parliament transposed the Directive into a Law for energy from renewable sources which from 2011 after its' first acceptance till 2019 was changes 18 times, 4 of which in only 1 year (2013).

But there is a huge unexplored area of research where phosphorene-based catalysts could find new applications. Among these are the urgency of making new functionalized phosphorene materials and studying their catalytic (including photo and electrocatalytic) activities in various types of reactions. Phosphorene has a wide range of emerging applications in the field of energy conversion and storage, photovoltaic devices, and biomedical applications. However, the application of 2D phosphorene-based catalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reduction of CO2 into green fuels, and the nitrogen electroreduction reaction (N2RR) have not been explored further. Herein, state-of-the-art synthetic strategies of 2D phosphorene produced from allotropes of black phosphorus with their significant role as nanocatalysts in the HER, OER, hydrogen storage, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into valuable green fuels, and the N2RR are focused on.

However, the relative impact of these various factors on SMV has been difficult to evaluate due to limited availability of field data. In addition, only a limited number of studies have analysed the role of landscape morphology on SMV. Here we use numerical simulations of a simple hydrological model, the Bucket Grassland Model, to systematically analyse the effect of each contributing factor on SMV on two different landscape morphologies. The two different landform morphologies represent landscapes dominated respectively by either diffusive erosion or fluvial erosion processes. We conducted various simulations driven by a stochastically generated 100-year climate time series, which is long enough to capture climatic fluctuations, in order to understand the effect of various soil moisture controlling factors on the spatiotemporal SMV. Our modelling results show that the fluvial dominated landscapes promote higher spatial SMV than the diffusive dominated ones. Further, the role of landform morphology on SMV is more pronounced in regions where the spatial variability of incoming solar radiation and precipitation is high. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","landscape morphology; latitudinal variations; soil moisture variability; solar radiation","Erosion; Landforms; Moisture control; Morphology; Radiation effects; Soil moisture; Solar radiation; Climatic fluctuations; Contributing factor; Controlling factors; Hydrological modeling; Moisture variability; Semi-arid ecosystems; Spatial variability; Vegetation properties; Ecosystems; geomorphology; hydrological modeling; landscape change; latitude; semiarid region; soil moisture; solar radiation; spatial variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097219095

Atmospheric parameters such as type of pollutants and local weather play an important role in COVID-19 cases and mortality. Many studies were carried out to understand the impact of weather on spread and severity of COVID-19 and vice-versa. A review study is conducted to understand the impact of weather and atmospheric pollution on morbidity and mortality. Studies show that aerosols containing corona virus generated by sneezes and coughs are major route for spread of virus. Viability and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 stuck on the surface of particulate matter is not yet confirmed. Studies found that an increase in particulate matter concentration causes more COVID-19 cases and mortality. Gaseous pollutant and COVID-19 cases are positively correlated. Local meteorology plays crucial role in the spread of corona virus and thus mortality. Decline in number of cases with rising temperature observed. Few studies also find that lowest and highest temperatures were related to lesser number of cases. Similarly humidity shows negative or no relationship with COVID-19 cases. Rainfall was not related whilst wind-speed plays positive role in spread of COVID-19. Solar radiation threats survival of virus, areas with lower solar radiation showed high exposure rate.

Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, North Macedonia","A major concern in urban areas is the low quality of air, with high levels of particulate matter (PM), consisting of black carbons, volatile organic compounds and various pollutants that are hazardous for the human health and the global environment. Thus, there is an urgent need to decrease air pollution by implementing various short and long-term measures. One of the methods for decreasing air pollution in urban areas is increasing the green infrastructure as plants absorb the particulate matter through their leaves and stems. The initial step in dealing with this problem is raising the public awareness, which is generally low in Skopje and the Balkan region. The aim of the research is to quantify the positive effects on green infrastructure on air pollution and provide research-based inputs that can be used by local governments and decision makers. This paper presents data from continuous measurements on a location in Skopje, provides an assessment of the influence of green zones on air quality in urban areas and correlates it with meteorological factors. This is achieved by using an innovative, low-cost, easy replicable and energy-efficient system, consisted of green wall and stations for monitoring the air quality which are based on wireless sensor network technology. By using statistical tools as Freidman and Mann-Whitney tests, the impact of the relative position of the measurement sensors and the green areas and other objects to the PM concentrations is quantified. The performed analyses confirm that green areas, including green walls, have a high impact in the reduction of PM concentrations in their proximity. The differences in measured values obtained by measurement nodes positioned in relatively small distances are not negligible, thus implying that the relative position of the measurement nodes to the green infrastructure influences the measured PM concentrations. Therefore, the measurement location should be carefully considered for any air quality monitoring system. Measurements with higher spatial granularity should be used for modelling and air quality forecasting purposes. The results in this paper show that the green area mitigates the PM of 2.5 or less micrometers (PM2.5) on average by 25% and PM of 10 or less micrometers (PM10) on average by 37% compared to the neighboring non-green areas. The results show a strong correlation between PM2.5 and PM10. In Skopje, the combination of low temperatures, high humidity and no, or low wind speed lead to high PM concentrations. The presented algorithm compares the statistically obtained data to the reference categories from WHO (from very low to very high, with reference to PM2.5). The described methodology is used to develop a simple decision-making support algorithm for local governments to support their decisions on applying PM mitigation measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution reduction; Green wall; Meteorological factors; Particulate matter; Sensor network","Air quality; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Micrometers; Plants (botany); Sensor nodes; Statistical mechanics; Volatile organic compounds; Wind; Air quality forecasting; Air quality monitoring; Continuous measurements; Decision making support; Energy efficient systems; Green infrastructure; Measurement locations; Meteorological factors; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091955254

Based on extensive, original mixed methods empirical research – including expert interviews, focus groups, internet forums, community interviews, and extended site visits and naturalistic observation – it asks: How are four specific decarbonisation pathways linked to negative impacts within specific communities? Relatedly, what vulnerabilities do these transitions exacerbate in these communities? Lastly, how can such vulnerabilities be better addressed with policy? The paper documents a troublesome cohabitation between French wineries and nuclear power, the negative effects on labor groups and workers in Eastern Germany by a transition to solar energy, the stark embodied externalities in electronic waste (e-waste) flows from smart meters accumulating in Ghana, and the precarious exploitation of children involved in cobalt mining for electric vehicle batteries in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The aims and objectives of the study are threefold: (1) to showcase how four very different vulnerable communities have been affected by the negative impacts of decarbonisation; (2) to reveal tensions and tradeoffs between European transitions and local and global justice concerns; and (3) to inform energy and climate policy. In identifying these objectives, our goal is not to stop or slow down all low-carbon transitions. Rather, the study suggests that the research and policy communities ought to account for, and seek to minimize, a broader range of social and environmental sustainability risks.

To unravel these changes, we performed spectroscopic measurements in the solid state on two stages at temperatures ranging from 303 to 453 K. For the first heating stage, the emission spectrum showed a 20 nm red shift and a new absorption band at 350 nm, possibly related to new bonds and/or nitrogenous molecular fractions. For the second heating stage in the same temperature range, no displacements in the emission spectrum were observed and both the energy gap and bandwidths for the two emission bands are practically constant, indicating a change nitrogen moiety exposed on the surface. Furthermore, through atomic force microscopy it was noted that the morphology and size of the CDs were not significantly affected by the increase in temperature. It is noteworthy that the values of the Huang-Rhys factor, respectively, 2.584 × 10-10 and 2.315 × 10-9 for band I and II emission after the second heating indicate a mechanism of weak electron-phonon interactions.

In the present study, a test is conducted on the non-linear relationship between economy and environment, which are represented as real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita and carbon emissions per capita, respectively. Based on the data of a non-dynamic panel that covers 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2016, the threshold regression model is applied with fixed effects to understand how the mentioned transitions impact on such relationship as structural breaks, in particular since its “New Normal” era. In brief, according to the estimation results, economic growth with a sustained high level of investment in technology (e.g., Northwest and Southwest China) and environmental protection activities are of empirical significance to cutting down on carbon emissions in China. Moreover, given the emissions reduction during China's economic growth, “Economically significant provinces” concentrated in East China (e.g., Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Shandong in the present study) ought to develop and transfer their energy structure in a more renewable manner.

Coastal wetlands, one of the major habitats of SRB, exhibit high sulfate-reducing activity and thus play significant roles in organic carbon remineralization, benthic geochemical action, and plant-microbe interactions. Recent studies have provided credible evidence that the functional rather than the taxonomic composition of microbes responds more closely to environmental factors. Therefore, in this study, functional gene prediction based on PacBio single molecular real-time sequencing of 16S rDNA was applied to determine the sulfate-reducing and organic substrate-decomposing activities of SRB in the rhizospheres of two typical coastal wetland plants in North and South China: Zostera japonica and Scirpus mariqueter. To this end, some physicochemical characteristics of the sediments as well as the phylogenetic structure, community composition, diversity, and proportions of several functional genes of the SRB in the two plant rhizospheres were analyzed. The Z. japonica meadow had a higher dissimilatory sulfate reduction capability than the S. mariqueter-comprising saltmarsh, owing to its larger proportion of SRB in the microbial community, larger proportions of functional genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and the stronger ability of the SRB to degrade organic substrates completely. This study confirmed the feasibility of applying microbial community function prediction in research on the metabolic features of SRB, which will be helpful for gaining new knowledge of the biogeochemical and ecological roles of these bacteria in coastal wetlands. © 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","16S rDNA PacBio SMRT sequencing; microbial community function prediction; rhizosphere; Scirpus mariqueter; sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB); Zostera japonica",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081569712

The impact of traffic signal timing and meteorological variables on size-resolved PM in the 0.25–10 μm range at the signalized intersection was investigated. The PMs, particle number concentrations (PNCs), and particle mass concentrations (PMCs) in the given size distribution were obtained at the signalized intersection in Xi'an. A comprehensive analysis method involving statistical analysis, regression analysis, simulation was used. The results demonstrated that the fine particles (PMC0.25-2.5 and PNC0.25-2.5) have a positive relationship with wind speed and vehicles per cycle, and a size ranges of PM, ranging from 2.5 to 10 μm, was greatly affected by those factors. Moreover, the regression findings via multivariate multiple linear regression (MMLR) showed that the coefficients of independent variables (temperature, and delay) were statistically significant, which indicated that those factors enormously affect fine particles.

Policymakers thus need to formulate vehicular emission reduction policies to improve urban air-quality. This study used different vehicle control scenarios to predict the associated potential of mitigating carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) in Xi'an China, in 2020 and 2025. One business-as-usual scenario and six control scenarios were established, and vehicular emission inventory was developed according to each scenario. The results revealed that eliminating high-emission vehicles and optimizing after-treatment devices would effectively reduce vehicular emissions. In addition, increasing the number of alternative fuel vehicles, restraining vehicle use, and restraining the growth of the vehicle population would all have certain effects on CO and VOCs emissions, but the effects would not be significant for NOx, PM2.5, and PM10. The results also indicated that if all control measures were stringently applied together, emissions of CO, VOCs, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10 would be reduced by 51.66%, 51.58%, 30.19%,71.12%, and 71.81% in 2020, and 53.55%, 51.44%, 19.09%, 54.88%, and 55.51%, in 2025, respectively.

Yet much of the research and policy developments in sustainable transportation are concentrated in high-investment areas, with sparse attention to travel conditions in low-income localities. Drawing from ethnographic methods, this paper explores socio-spatial inequalities and struggles for transportation space within the Mexican bajío. Focusing on the city of Aguascalientes and its outskirts, I explore the implementation of cycling facilities in a context of rapid-freeway expansion, neoliberal restructuring and public-transit divestment. Specifically, this paper analyzes the fragmented implementation of cycling lanes in certain areas of the city, while drawing attention to the experiences of low-income and peri-urban cyclists who operate at the margins of broader motor-vehicle infrastructure. In contexts of widespread spatial exclusions, I suggest that a focus on these commuters' mobility is needed to account for both the planned and inadvertent strategies that they assemble to bypass transportation barriers.

In Norway alone production of this industry is projected to expand from 1.2 million tons today to 5 million tons by 2050, implying a rapid increase in the demand for sustainable salmon feed alternatives to conventional feed resources such as fish meal and fish oil. Yeast produced from nonfood resources such as wood can serve as a high-quality protein source for farmed fish. In this study we analyze how commercial wood-based feed production in Norway using softwood chips from roundwood and sawmill residues will influence wood fiber prices. Such production will have to compete for wood fiber with wood-based bioenergy in particular, and the analyses were done assuming three main scenarios of expected global consumption of wood for bioenergy. The first scenario (Base) assumes a modest use of wood-based bioenergy reflecting the EU climate mitigation target for 2030. The second (MaxEnergy) and third (MaxEnergyLowRes) scenarios assume using bioenergy at a scale sufficient to fulfill IPCC's 2 °C climate mitigation target, with the only difference that in the MaxBio scenario tree stump utilization is allowed in Europe and USA. The bio-economic global partial equilibrium model EFI-GTM was applied to assess the economic impacts. Yeast production from wood in Norway could be able to pay from 37 to 64 euro/m3 of wood delivered mill site, the large variation depending on the yeast production costs other than wood biomass and the price of alternative fish feed resources. Other factors e.g. improved salmon health due to using wood-based yeast and environmental policy regulations of soya meal productions may increase this paying ability. To get 3 million m3 of wood per year during the period 2020–2030 for producing 330 t yeast it would be necessary to pay about 54, 47 and 55 euro/m3 in the scenarios Base, Bio and BioLowRes, respectively. The wood quantity supplied to the salmon feed production from additional Norwegian harvest will be rather low. If production of wood-based yeast for fish feed proves to be viable in Norway, it is likely to be attractive also in other aquaculture regions like North- and South America and Scotland, implying increased wood demand and higher wood prices than estimated above. Microbial ingredients like yeast produced from non-food biomass such as wood, offer potentials for commercial production. However, the present costs of producing yeast from lignocellulosic biomass may still be too high, and there is a need to develop more efficient processes for economic utilization. © 2020","Aquaculture; Bioeconomy modelling; Climate target impacts; EFI-GTM; Forest product markets; Forest sector model; Land-use policies; Non-food biomass; Wood competition","Aquaculture; Costs; Decision trees; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Fish; Meats; Oils and fats; Wood products; Yeast; Annual growth rate; Climate mitigations; Commercial productions; Economic utilizations; Efficient process; Environmental policy; Global consumption; Partial equilibrium model; Biomass; Biomass; Environmental Regulations; Feeds; Fishes; Norway; Operating Costs; Wood Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094326365

Current waste disposal methods in Pakistan and other developing countries are not meeting standards of any proper waste management system opted for in the developed world. This mismanagement of waste is leading to serious environmental problems at local as well as global levels. This study aims to investigate the methane emissions from waste dumpsites in the city of Karachi, Pakistan, and to propose an effective approach to enhance their environmental sustainability. The methane emissions from waste disposal sites were assessed by simulating four different landfill situations during the landfill simulation reactor experiment. The residual methane reduction potential of each waste disposal approach was assessed by a biochemical methane test of waste after the experiment. It is estimated that in the present situation, about 11,500 tons of CO2-eq methane is released annually from waste disposal sites in Karachi. The convectional anaerobic landfill with methane capturing facilities and post-aeration operation was found to be the most environmentally sustainable approach with controlling 65% of residual methane emissions in comparison with the present scenario. For the development of new landfill sites, we recommend the bioreactor landfill approach with methane recovery and post-care (in-situ aeration). © 2020 by the authors.

Beside this, the cities in developing Asia are deficient in adequate waste management and facing energy shortage as well. The ineffectual waste management practice is one of the main causative factors behind the negative repercussions on public health and environment. This paper provides an estimation of power generation potential along with economic and environmental benefits of biochemical methane production from MSW. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test of the MSW generated in Karachi, Pakistan was conducted by using the fresh synthetic waste sample. Through the analysis of the results obtained in this study and available data of the MSW generation (quantity, organic fraction and moisture content) in Karachi it is estimated that, every year about 5600 tons of methane are being wasted to atmosphere adding enormous share in global climate change. This study estimated that, about 63 MWe electric power can be generated by establishing biowaste digestion plants with power generation facilities in the city. The generated power can contribute 2.1% share in daily power supply and 21% power shortage can be reduced as well. Additionally, about 401.3 million-PKRs (2.6 million-US$) revenue can be earned every year by selling the power generated by utilizing the MSW in waste to energy plants. Moreover, 0.13 Mt CO2-eq/annum greenhouse effect caused by methane emissions from open disposal of MSW can be eliminated. © 2020","Anaerobic digestion; Asian cities; Biochemical methane production; Renewable energy; Synthetic MSW; Waste to energy","Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Public health; Waste management; Biochemical methane potential; Economic and environmental benefits; Global climate changes; Health and environment; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Power generation potential; Waste management practices; Waste-to-energy plants; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089150702

We confirm that, for intermediate cathode temperature, the local current density from low work function regions can exceed the space-charge limit for the entire cathode. As the cathode temperature rises, space-charge effects lead to homogeneous current density from the interior of the emitting area and a higher current density from its periphery. We show how beam emittance and brightness are affected, and show that the operating temperature for optimal brightness is such that it corresponds to the transition region between source-limited and space-charge-limited emissions.

The main benefit of our application is to help experts reduce the time needed for making the relevant measurements and to increase the lifecycles of sensors in bioreactors. The novelty of this research is the flexibility of the developed application, the use of a great number of variables, and the comparative presentation of the results obtained with different NNs (feedback vs. feed-forward) and different learning algorithms (Back-Propagation vs. Levenberg–Marquardt). The simulation results show that the feedback neural network outperformed the feed-forward neural network. The NN configuration is relatively flexible (with hidden layers and a number of nodes on each of them), but the number of input and output nodes depends on the fermentation process parameters. After laborious simulations, we determined that using pH and CO2 as inputs reduces the prediction errors of the NN. Thus, besides the most commonly used process parameters like fermentation temperature, time, the initial concentration of the substrate, the substrate concentration, and the biomass concentration, by adding pH and CO2, we obtained the optimum number of input nodes for the network. The optimal configuration in our case was obtained after 1500 iterations using a NN with one hidden layer and 12 neurons on it, seven neurons on the input layer, and one neuron as the output. If properly trained and validated, this model can be used in future research to accurately predict steady-state and dynamic alcoholic fermentation process behaviour and thereby improve process control performance. © 2020 by the authors.

We have utilized cobalt chloride as the precursor for doping ions. The emission wavelength can be regulated from green to cyan color with the increase in doping concentration without negotiating on color quality, which is believed to be the modification of band gap and corresponding electron density estimated from the density functional theory. A high PLQY of 95% is observed even after the incorporation of cobalt and chloride ions into host PQDs. We demonstrate white light-emitting diode (LED) prototypes for backlight applications using a PQDs/PMMA composite on a blue LED chip, which exhibits excellent stability toward an ambient and robust atmosphere and provides a wide-color gamut of 124% of the NTSC standard. This research paves a way for the research community to synthesize highly efficient, color-tunable PQDs for wide-color backlighting applications. ©","backlight; color gamut; high PLQY; lead deficient hybrid perovskite; stable quantum dot","Chlorine compounds; Color; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Esters; Light emitting diodes; Metal ions; Nanocrystals; Perovskite; Semiconductor quantum dots; Transition metals; Cobalt chlorides; Doping concentration; Emission wavelength; Photoluminescence quantum yields; Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA); Research communities; White light emitting diodes; Wide color gamut; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099807710

To bring robustness in climate adaptation planning, evaluation of resilience across homogenous regions is essential for developing and scaling suitable location-need-context specific interventions and policies that build the resilience of the agricultural system. In this paper, we present an analysis and discussion of multi-scalar and multi-indicator assessment, by profiling resilience across agro-climatic zones of India, based on the development of a Climate-Resilient Agriculture Index embracing environmental, technological, socio-economic, and institutional and infrastructural dimension. A total of 26 indicators, spread across these four dimensions, were employed to purport inter- and intra-agro-climatic zone differentials in the level of resilience. Among the zones, it was found that West Coast Plains & Ghats and Tans-Gangetic Plains had the highest degree of resilience to manage climate risks. Most of the districts lying within Eastern Himalayan Region, Middle Gangetic Plains, Eastern Plateau & Hills, and Western Dry Region had a lower degree of resilience. The study places greater emphasis on deciphering region-specific drivers and barriers to resilience at a further disaggregated scale for improving rural well-beings. It is construed that devising action plans emphasizing awareness, preservation of natural resources, diversification, building physical infrastructure, strengthening of grass-root institutions, and mainstreaming climate adaptation in the developmental policy is crucial for climate-resilient pathways. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Agro-Climatic Zones; Climate change; Index; India; Indictors; Resilience","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Historic preservation; Sustainable development; Agricultural system; Climatic zone; Food security; Four dimensions; Homogenous region; Multi scalars; Preservation of natural resources; Socio-economics; Climate change; adaptive management; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; farming system; food security; livelihood; nature-society relations; sustainability; trade-off; vulnerability; Gangetic Plain; West Coast [South Island]; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099753871

There is a dire need for a conformed policy framework that quantizes monetary losses caused by the climate change on crops and suggests response policies under realistic climatic projections. The present study develops a climate change response policy framework for Ganges river basin by projecting climatic scenarios (temperature, rainfall, potential evapotranspiration) under intergovernmental panel on climate change representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 for carbon dioxide emission. The study uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) based spatiotemporal-trend approach and evaluates economic loss using Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop simulation for the Ganges river basin. The policies have been derived by using fuzzy entropy decision making method. The novelty of the study is that it evaluates impact of climate change on crop yield under multiple scenarios expectations i.e. optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic. A case study of Ganges basin, India is taken and various indices (CSI- Climate Sustainability Index and CRS- Climate Risk Security) has been introduced that can be used by the planners to implement sustainable climatic response policies. Results show that winter crops (Rabi season) in the Ganges river basin are most vulnerable to future climate change risks as the basin is expected to be heated more in winter season as compared to summer. The expected reduction in seasonal rainfall is likely to nullify any carbon fertilization benefits on winter crop yields. Crop field in south-west Ganges basin (i.e. Chambal, Betwa, Ken and Son catchments) came out to be the most vulnerable. Based on the results, sustainable crop insurance policy has been suggested. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","APSIM crop Simulation; Climate change; Climatic trend model; Ganges river basin; Sustainable policy","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Food supply; Global warming; Insurance; Losses; Planning; Rain; Rivers; Sustainable development; Watersheds; Agricultural production system; Carbon dioxide emissions; Decision-making method; Economic sustainability; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Potential evapotranspiration; Spatiotemporal trends; Sustainability index; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089690360

This has a significant effect not only on marine biodiversity, but also on public safety and numerous infectious diseases found in both aquatic and human species. A huge amount of money was spent worldwide on plastic waste. In the 1940s, plastics development began and is increasing massively. This crucial analysis intends to accomplish goals such as defining plastic materials, origins, detecting aggregation, and validating appropriate techniques to analyze plastic abundance spatio-temporal trends. This further addresses the possible impacts of plastics on marine species, humans, and future chemical emission control strategies together with advice. Plastics are primarily distributed along the coasts and mid-ocean vortex in large amounts. The broad variety of plastics, as eaten by aquatic animals finds their way to the human body through the food chain. Research articles should help learn the origins, deterioration mechanisms, and harmful effects of plastics on both the human body and the ecosystem. Until recently, the science community and politicians have generally ignored plastic waste, but ecological implications, as well as plastic pollution's economic/health effects, have now gained greater global interest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental pollution; Marine environment; Plastic trash; Plastics; Pollution",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096518205

However, using land-based strategies to support aggressive subnational greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets is challenging due to competing land use priorities and uncertainty in ecosystem carbon dynamics and climate change effects. We used the California natural and working lands carbon and greenhouse gas model to quantify the direct ecosystem carbon emissions (CO2 and CH4) impacts, trade-offs, and climate change interactions of two policy scenarios identified by the State of California for fulfilling multiple land use goals, including the competing goals of mitigating wildfire severity and landscape carbon emissions, among others. Here we show that emissions from desired forest management to reduce the amount of combustible biomass (fuel reduction) initially outweighed emissions reductions from other strategies (e.g. less intensive forest management, restoration, land conservation); however, avoided emissions and enhanced carbon sequestration from the other strategies gradually outweighed fuel reduction emissions. Thus, in jurisdictions with large-scale wildfire mitigation goals, practices that reduce emissions and/or increase carbon sequestration can simultaneously offset fuel reduction emissions. Our analysis highlights the comp lexities inherent in LUCC planning, underscoring the need for governments to begin the task now. © 2021 The Author(s).

Considering the ecological limits of work and the necessity of reducing the working time to mitigate GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, this paper aims to assess the impact of the labor market on GHG emissions in the EU-28 countries. Using panel data models for 2007–2019, a positive effect of working time for employed persons on GHG emissions was detected. Labor productivity has a positive impact on emissions for most of the developed countries in the EU (old member states), while the effect is negative in the case of most of the new member states, which suggests that more efforts should be made by old member states to correlate labor productivity with a sustainable level of GHG emissions. As a novelty for research in the field, we assessed also the effect of targeted labor utilization on GHG emissions in order to describe the context of a sustainable economy that is an objective for each country in the EU. These results suggest that progress in GHG emissions mitigation might be achieved by reducing the working time for employed persons, which will also improve well-being. These recommendations could be useful also for other developed countries outside the EU that encounter the same difficulties. © 2021 by the authors.

The underutilization of solid waste resources, from the viewpoint of their heating value, contributes to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and abiotic resources depletion. MSW as a resource, however, is capable of a coupe with the existing demand of the local cement industry as refuse-derived fuel (RDF). This paper analyzes the application of life-cycle assessment as the basis for improved MSW management in the Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. This study compared four scenarios of MSW management, in which three of them are characterized as an expansion of the ongoing practice by incorporating RDF production while another considers only the landfilling of solid waste. The results indicated that the current MSW management system contributes 267.44 Gg CO2-eq/year to GHG emissions, and the study showed that scenarios based on RDF production imply an increase in energy demand, with higher total GHG emissions, compared to the current management practice. However, gains are archived in environmental terms when the avoided emissions resulting from the substitution of fossil fuels are included in the analysis. The production and use of RDF outperformed the conventional systems by providing emission reductions of 2% to about 23%. Besides, this implies that the implementation of RDF oriented management could significantly reduce the impact on current disposal capacity at the local landfill site. From the perspective of impact related to abiotic resource depletion, it has been found that recycling and composting in the current scenario produces a reduction of 0.12 Gg Sb-eq/year. It constitutes a minimal fraction compared to the reduction in fossil fuel when considering the avoided coke extraction, that provides reductions from 3.63 to 13.73 Gg Sb-eq/year. It was concluded that the environmental advantages of RDF base scenarios in this context arise when the assessment is expanded to include the reduction of GHG indirect emissions and the use of resources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Refuse-derived fuel","Cement industry; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Refuse derived fuels; Waste management; Avoided emissions; Conventional systems; Emission reduction; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management practices; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Resource depletion; Resources depletion; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090015765

The use of vinasse biogas (VBG) for power generation is evaluated and the potential of this energy source is compared with fossil oil power plants in terms of energy, costs and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in Brazil, suggesting a program where the most expensive oil power plants are replaced by biogas plants with benefits in all aspects. Secondly, the use of vinasse biomethane (VBM) to replace natural gas (NG) in the state of São Paulo is examined, presenting an incentive program that could make this alternative fuel feasible even in smaller scale plants with minimal impact on NG costs in this state, while providing considerable emission reduction. The impact of VBG considering the increase in ethanol production over the next ten years is also evaluated, showing that substantial additional energy can be obtained and larger amounts of fossil fuels can be replaced. By crossing vinasse biogas potential with selected fossil fuels demand, the article brings insights to help the transition to a low-carbon society in a novel approach. The conclusions are that VBG and VBM can provide great benefits, such as USD 1 billion/year cost reductions and 6.7 million tons CO2e/year emissions avoided by replacing fossil oil by biogas in power generation in Brazil and 3.2 million tons CO2e/year avoided with biomethane replacing natural gas in the state of São Paulo, which, with specific programs and policies, could be achieved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Biomethane; Vinasse","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Cost reduction; Electric power plants; Emission control; Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Biogas plants; Emission reduction; Energy source; Ethanol production; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Incentive programs; Low-carbon societies; Potential impacts; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089822223

This research sought to determine the distribution and potential health effects of aerially deposited PAHs in soil within the urban core of metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. as part of a soil regulatory standards reevaluation. Park areas (n = 27) identified as undisturbed for 80+ years, containing no fill material, and receiving only atmospheric deposition were selected for composite surface and 92 cm core soil sample collection (n = 295). Samples were analyzed for the 16 USEPA priority PAHs, 1- and 2- methylnapthalene and ancillary soil properties. Soil core and ancillary data confirm lack of site disturbance. PAH diagnostic ratios and homologue summations indicate that diffuse multiple point source emissions contribute equally to PAH deposition throughout the area. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and dibenz(a,h)anthracene mean concentrations exceed health-based clean up levels. Risk assessment shows only a worst-case exposure scenario (BaP at the 95% upper confidence limit) increasing cancer risk (1.67 × 10−6) over current regulatory thresholds (1.0 × 10−6). Health quotients show potential health risks from fluoranthene and pyrene for daily park users and from BaP for all others. Mean soil PAH values are similar to New Orleans, but lower than Chicago, Boston, and London reflecting industrial history and site selection protocols. The soil PAH results presented here for sites selected for non-manipulated soils combined with an almost 100-year uninterrupted atmospheric exposure effectively show the maximum potential PAH values that can be found at any given undisturbed location within the Milwaukee urban core due solely to atmospheric deposition. © 2020 Elsevier LtdAnthropogenically introduced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in undisturbed urban soils above regulatory action levels complicate remediation and regulation development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic pollution; Benzo(a)pyrene; Environmental policy; Hydrocarbons; Polycyclic aromatic; Risk assessment; Soil pollution","Aromatization; Atmospheric chemistry; Barium compounds; Deposition; Health; Health risks; Meteorological problems; Mineral oils; Pyrene; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Site selection; Soils; Urban growth; 1-and 2-Methylnapthalene; Atmospheric depositions; Background concentration; Multiple point sources; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Potential health risks; Regulation development; Soil pollution; benzo[a]pyrene; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; methylnapthalene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; unclassified drug; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); environmental policy; PAH; pyrene; risk assessment; soil pollution; threshold; topsoil; Article; atmospheric deposition; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; molecular weight; particle size; risk assessment; soil; soil property; surface property; Wisconsin; England; environmental monitoring; Massachusetts; risk assessment; soil; soil pollutant; Milwaukee; United States; Wisconsin; Boston; Environmental Monitoring; London; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092524328

This is particularly true for the Northwest Atlantic which is a key region with an essential role in global climate regulation. Over the past two decades, coralline red algae have been increasingly used as environmental and climatic archives for the marine realm and hold the potential to extend long-term instrumental measurements. Here, we investigate the possibility to extract climate and environmental information from annual growth patterns and geochemical composition of the coralline red algae, Clathromorphum compactum, from Saint-Pierre & Miquelon (SPM), a French archipelago southwest of Newfoundland. However, measurements of C. compactum growth trends is challenging due to difficulties in identifying annual growth lines directly. So far, growth pattern investigations were commonly performed based on geochemical data of coralline calcite matrix. Nonetheless, this method is expensive and therefore prevents from analyzing a large number of specimens that would be representative of the population. For this reason, we enhanced the growth line readability by staining polished sections with Mutvei's solution and performed growth analysis based on direct increment width measurements. Geochemical analyses were also carried out in order to validate the assumption that growth lines observed after staining were formed on an annual basis. Moreover, growth pattern and trace element composition were measured on multiple axes of several individuals in order to assess the intra- and inter-specimen variability and validate their use for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Finally, relationships between the C. compactum sclerochronological records from SPM and environmental datasets covering different geographical areas allow a better knowledge of flow dynamics in the Northwest Atlantic and confirm the findings related to Arctica islandica from the same location. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Coralline algae; Environmental proxy; Environmental reconstruction; Sclerochronology","alga; archipelago; atmosphere-ocean system; biochemical composition; climate variation; geochemistry; global climate; growth; historical record; hydrometeorology; paleoenvironment; reconstruction; trace element; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Canada; Mascarene Islands; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Reunion; Saint Pierre; Arctica islandica; Clathromorphum compactum; Rhodophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097088283

Maria di Galeria, Italy","The representation of air quality and meteorology over Asia remains challenging for chemical transport models as a result of the complex interactions between the East Asian monsoons and the large uncertainty (in space and time) of the high anthropogenic emissions levels over the region. High spatial resolution models allow resolving small-scale features induced by the complex topography of this region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was used to simulate the spatial and seasonal variability of main physical and chemical variables over Asia for the year 2015 at 8-km horizontal resolution to enable resolving small-scale features induced by the region complex topography. The simulated atmospheric composition was evaluated against satellite retrievals (MOPITT, IASI + GOME2, MODIS and OMI) in addition to ground-based observations in China for the year 2015, while the meteorological variables were evaluated by several observational-based datasets (ERA5, CRU, MODIS, MTE). Results showed low to moderate seasonal biases for major meteorological variables, i.e. air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, latent heat, sensible heat and snow cover fraction. Overall, WRF-Chem reproduced well the spatial and seasonal variability of lowermost tropospheric ozone content, total column carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth, while large discrepancies were found for tropospheric nitrogen dioxide content, mainly during the warm season. In consistency with previous studies, the different biases between model-simulated and satellite-retrieved values can be mainly attributed to i) the large uncertainties in anthropogenic and natural nitrogen oxides emission estimates, as well as dust and sea salt emissions in the case of aerosol optical depth, and ii) some coarse parameterizations used to reproduce main small-scale features (e.g. meteorology, chemical processes, dry deposition to vegetation). Compared to ground-based observations, the WRF-Chem model reproduced well the mean annual cycle of surface nitrogen dioxide, ozone and fine particles concentrations in all seasons across China. Our results suggest that WRF-Chem provides reliable spatio-temporal patterns for most of the meteorological and chemical variables, adding thus confidence to its applicability in the context of air pollution risk assessment to human and ecosystems health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asia; Regional climate model; Remote sensing; Satellite; WRF-Chem","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon monoxide; Health risks; Image resolution; Nitrogen oxides; Optical properties; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Radiometers; Risk assessment; Satellite imagery; Small satellites; Snow; Temperature measurement; Topography; Troposphere; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Uncertainty analysis; Air pollution risk assessments; Chemical transport models; Ground-based observations; Meteorological variables; Nitrogen oxides emission; Spatiotemporal patterns; Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide; Weather research and forecasting models; Weather forecasting; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; annual cycle; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; emission; GOME; IASI; instrumentation; MODIS; monsoon; MOPITT; physicochemical property; satellite altimetry; spatial resolution; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; Article; Asia; chemical parameters; chemical reaction; chemistry; China; circannual rhythm; climate; controlled study; dry deposition; heat; human; humidity; meteorology; optical depth; physics; precipitation; priority journal; risk assessment; seasonal variation; simulation; snow cover; troposphere; weather research and forecasting model; Asia; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092662259

Endoscopy is the third highest generator of waste in healthcare, a sector with significant contributions to carbon emissions worldwide. Endoscopy carries a substantial carbon footprint owing to its resource-heavy decontamination processes, complex waste streams, high throughput caseloads and its heavy reliance on single-use, nonrecyclable consumables. In this review, we aim to identify sources of waste within endoscopy, provide a framework approach for measuring the carbon footprint, and propose actionable steps that can be delivered to mitigate endoscopy's carbon footprint. Based on operational energy usage and plastic waste from endoscopic procedures alone, we estimate the carbon footprint of endoscopy in the United States at 85,768 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, equivalent to more than 9 million gallons of gasoline consumed, 94 million pounds of coal burned and 212 million miles driven in average nonelectric car. Sequestering these CO2 emissions would require an additional 112,000 acres of new forests per year. Urgent action is therefore needed within endoscopy units. Units should start by embracing the 3R's of sustainability—“Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.” Patient and administrative pathways in endoscopy should be process mapped to identify opportunities for sustainability interventions at each step. Finally, we propose a taxonomy of sustainability interventions where a pragmatic “Review, Research, and Reinvent” approach can be applied at all levels, ranging from the individual to international societies, to minimize the carbon footprint of endoscopy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon footprint; Endoscopy; Sustainability",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120616228

Nanoindentation experiments on single crystal Al, Al 1350 parent alloys, and Al 1350 NCMCs revealed variable mechanical properties, caused by an interplay between microstructure and graphitic reinforcements. TEM and AFM studies also reveal nanoscale structural changes based on the incorporation of a carbon nanophase. In order to decouple the effects of the aforementioned mechanical behaviors, molecular dynamics nanoindentation simulations were performed on the (111) surface of Al and Al NCMC samples containing semi-infinite graphene nanoribbons to examine the evolution of plasticity over time. Findings indicate that the arrangement of a finite graphene nanophase within a host matrix can alter plasticity mechanisms and therefore yield strength in near-surface mechanical behaviors with little effect on elastic properties. This understanding should enable further study into tunable bulk properties of Al-based NCMCs while isolating microstructural effects and reinforcement effects of the carbon phase. Such an understanding could lead to application-specific material geometries ranging from high-performing vehicle structures to next-generation electrical devices. © 2020","Aluminum alloys; Graphene; Hybrid material; Interfacial behaviors; Metal matrix composite; Micromechanics; Nanocomposite; Nanoindentation simulations","Graphene; Graphene nanoribbon; Mechanisms; Molecular dynamics; Nanoindentation; Nanoribbons; Reinforcement; Single crystals; Application-specific materials; Electrical devices; Graphene nanoribbons; Mechanical behavior; Micro-structural effects; Nanoindentation experiments; Reinforcement effects; Vehicle structures; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091667351

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on the Kulekhani Hydropower Project (KHP), Nepal and evaluate the adaptation options to maximize hydropower generation under climate change scenarios. Three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) namely ACCESS, CNRM and MPI were bias-corrected by linear scaling method for future periods of 2020s (2010–2039), 2050s (2040–2069) and 2080s (2070–2099) with the baseline period of 1976–2005. The increase in maximum and minimum temperatures were found to vary from 0.4–3.8 °C and 0.4–4.2 °C respectively with a magnitude of rise higher for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. However, precipitation was found to be erratic showing no specific trends but rather found to increase in the dry season and decrease in the wet season, along with the shifts in the time of peak. Additionally, hydrological models were used to simulate future discharge and hydropower generation under climate change scenarios. Besides, the hydropower generation was projected to decrease by 0.5–13% for different periods compared with the baseline. Further, several reservoir rule curves were examined as an adaptation option to minimize the impacts of climate change on hydropower generation and it was found that the modification of existing rule can offset the negative impacts.

We propose an approach based on a probability density function (PDF) that utilizes cloud condensates and saturation ratios to replace the assumption of critical relative humidity (RH). We test this approach, called the Global Forecast System (GFS) - Taiwan Earth System Model (TaiESM) - Sundqvist (GTS) scheme, using the macrophysics scheme within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) framework. Via single-column model results, the new approach simulates the cloud fraction (CF)-RH distributions closer to those of the observations when compared to those of the default CAM5.3 scheme. We also validate the impact of the GTS scheme on global climate simulations with satellite observations. The simulated CF is comparable to CloudSat/Cloud- Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data. Comparisons of the vertical distributions of CF and cloud water content (CWC), as functions of large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic parameters, with the CloudSat/CALIPSO data suggest that the GTS scheme can closely simulate observations. This is particularly noticeable for thermodynamic parameters, such as RH, uppertropospheric temperature, and total precipitable water, implying that our scheme can simulate variation in CF associated with RH more reliably than the default scheme. Changes in CF and CWC would affect climatic fields and large-scale circulation via cloud-radiation interaction. Both climatological means and annual cycles of many of the GTS-simulated variables are improved compared with the default scheme, particularly with respect to water vapor and RH fields. Different PDF shapes in the GTS scheme also significantly affect global simulations. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

RISESAT is equipped with multiple scientific instruments including Ocean Observation Camera (OOC). OOC is a wide field of view camera system and sweeps the ocean surface to evaluate the amount of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), which influences the carbon cycle in this planet, which is closely related to climate change. Constraint conditions exist mainly in terms of cloud coverage and the elevation angle of the satellite at a targeted point because OOC observation is conducted in the range of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, we developed an automatic mission planning system based on cloud forecasts for efficient ocean observation. In this system, we use Open Weather Map (OWM) to create cloud forecasts, and Two Line Element (TLE) and Simplified General Perturbations Satellite Orbit Model (SGP4) for orbit prediction of the satellite. Then, we propose an algorithm to output an optimised mission plan maximising the total profit. Furthermore, the performance of the system was evaluated by actual images taken by OOC and we confirmed that this system captured targeted regions properly. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Cameras; Climate change; DNA sequences; Forecasting; Micro satellites; Oceanography; Colored dissolved organic matter; Constraint conditions; General perturbations; Mission Planning System; Ocean observations; Scientific instrument; Two line elements; Wide field of view; Orbits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103741202

However, quantifying the influence of diffuse films is challenging owing to the complicated optical interactions between climatic factors inside and outside greenhouses. Thus, versatile methods for evaluating the effect of diffuse films are required. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of diffuse films on the improvement of the light profile and photosynthesis of tomatoes in greenhouses according to film diffuseness and regional solar radiation using ray-tracing simulation. The structural and optical properties of the greenhouse components were applied in a 3D-framework combined with a ray-tracing module. The light transmission patterns of diffuse films and solar radiation properties were incorporated. The reliability of the simulation was confirmed by comparing measured and estimated irradiances inside greenhouses covered with films having different haze factors. For scenarios, the diffuse film efficiency was assessed under typically different solar radiations, a low irradiance, high diffuse radiation fraction (LIHD) and a high irradiance, low diffuse radiation fraction (HILD). The light interception was estimated through the simulation and used to calculate the photosynthesis using the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model. The simulation was found to be reliable with R2 of 0.95 and 0.94 for the two greenhouses covered with different diffuse films. The light distribution on the tomato plants were less affected by film diffuseness under LIHD than HILD. With increasing film diffuseness, carbon uptake and light use efficiency increased by 5.30% and 4.58% under HILD, but did not change under LIHD. The light distribution and photosynthesis in diffuse film-covered greenhouses under different light environments could be reasonably estimated by the simulation. Thus, this method can be used to evaluate the applicability of diffuse films to various regions with diverse meteorological characteristics. © 2020","3D scanned plant model; FvCB model; Haze factor; Regional solar radiation; Scattered light","carbon; environmental factor; greenhouse ecosystem; herb; interception; irradiance; light intensity; light use efficiency; optical property; photosynthesis; ray tracing; simulation; solar radiation; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094557413

Specific data, including the efficiency, emission rate of nitrogen oxides (NOx ), fuel consumption, and electronic vehicle technology, will be developed. Since the first invention of the automobile engine in the late 19th century, companies came up with unique innovations, including its structure, control systems, and additional mechanical installations to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Numerous companies, including Ford, Toyota, and Mercedes-Benz, compete in the automobile industry to improve their engine’s efficiency and emission rates to create a clean environment. In addition, each country has its regulations on emission rates and automobile structure. Therefore, to meet these regulations, the structure and the system of the engines vary between companies in different countries. A variety of variable valve timing (VVT) systems, which is a mechanical part installed in the engine, are being developed by several companies. The VVT controls the opening and closing of the air inlet valve and the exhaust valve, which improves the reduction of fuel consumption and thermal efficiency. Furthermore, changing the engine structure is also another method that automobile companies are developing. Changing the engine’s shape can improve the vehicle’s performance (e.g., the engine vibration while running, the power output, and the smoothness of driving). Due to the emissions caused by petrol and diesel engines, the electrified vehicles have been developing to achieve a cleaner environment. This includes battery electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles. By comparing these features in the engine, it is possible to understand what the companies in the US, Japan, and the European countries are working on to improve their engines and provide a clean environment. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we quantitatively evaluate changes in ambient NO2, O3, and PM2.5concentrations arising from these emission changes in 11 cities globally by applying a deweathering machine learning technique. Sudden decreases in deweathered NO2concentrations and increases in O3 were observed in almost all cities. However, the decline in NO2concentrations attributable to the lockdowns was not as large as expected, at reductions of 10 to 50%. Accordingly, O3increased by 2 to 30% (except for London), the total gaseous oxidant (Ox= NO2+ O3) showed limited change, and PM2.5concentrations decreased in most cities studied but increased in London and Paris.

Clean development mechanism (CDM) project implementation provides an opportunity for more developing countries to actively participate in global climate governance. As the largest global emitter of carbon dioxide, have China’s CDM projects slowed down carbon dioxide emissions? In order to answer this question, the study constructs panel data at the provincial level from 2000 to 2017 to investigate the emission-reduction effects of China’s CDM projects. Results showed that China’s CDM projects’ implementation significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) and the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions. The emission reduction effects of different types of CDM projects have obvious heterogeneity. In addition, this study further found that China’s CDM projects’ implementation can not only effectively substitute traditional fossil energy, but also improve energy-utilization efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study based on hourly NO2 observations from June 2014 to May 2019 and a regional air quality model (WRF−CMAQ), we comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of NO2 concentrations throughout China and in 12 urban agglomerations (UAs) and quantitatively showed the anthropogenic and meteorological factors controlling the interannual variations (IAVs). The ground observations and tropospheric columns show that high NO2 concentrations are predominantly concentrated in UAs such as Beijing−Tianjin−Hebei (BTH), the Shandong Peninsula (SP), the Central Plain (CP), Central Shaanxi (CS), and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). For different UAs, the NO2 IAVs are different. The NO2 increased first and then decreased in 2016 or 2017 in BTH, YRD, CS, and Cheng−Yu, and decreased from 2014 to 2019 in Harbin−Changchun, CP, SP, Northern Slope of Tianshan Mountain, and Beibu−Gulf, while increased slightly in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Hohhot−Baotou−Erdos−Yulin (HBEY). The NO2 IAVs were primarily dominated by emission changes. The net wintertime decreases of NO2 in BTH, Yangtze River Middle−Reach, and PRD were mostly contributed by emission reductions from 2014 to 2018, and the significant increase in the wintertime in HBEY was also dominated by emission changes (93%). Weather conditions also have an important effect on the NO2 IAVS. In BTH and HBEY, the increases of NO2 in winter of 2016 are mainly attributed to the unfavorable weather conditions and for the significant decreases in the winter of 2017, the favorable weather conditions also play a very important role. This study provides a basic understanding on the current situation of NO2 pollution and are helpful for policymakers as well as those interested in the study of tropospheric ozone changes in China and downwind areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","NO2; Quantitative impacts; Spatiotemporal pattern; Urban agglomeration; WRF−CMAQ","Air quality; Emission control; Meteorology; Ozone; River pollution; Rivers; Troposphere; Interannual variation; Meteorological factors; Northern slope of Tianshan mountains; Regional air quality modeling; Spatio-temporal variation; Tropospheric columns; Urban agglomerations; Yangtze river delta; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); emission; nitrogen dioxide; spatial variation; temporal variation; urban region; weather; air quality; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; meteorological phenomena; nitrous oxide emission; ozone layer; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; troposphere; urban area; weather; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; weather; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097226822

In this study, FeCl3 was selected as an additive for sludge pyrolysis. The results indicated that the FeCl3-addition strategy not only enhanced carbon retention but also enhanced the nitrogen retention of sludge-based biochar. The best enhancement effect both occurred at 500°C, and the enhanced amount reached 29.7 mg C/g sludge and 1.33 mg N/g sludge, respectively. This enhancement may be attributed to the physical isolation provided by newly formed metallic complexes or oxides. Besides, the added FeCl3 improved the polarity and aromaticity of modified biochar by retaining more oxygen-containing functional groups, and could also catalyze the decomposition of tar, resulting in the release of more small molecular substances.

Based on the review of 35 papers that studied the tourism industry in the wake of the pandemic, we propose a resilience-based framework for reviving the global tourism industry post-COVID-19. Our framework outlines four prominent factors for building resilience in the industry: government response, technology innovation, local belongingness, and consumer and employee confidence. We argue that using such inclusive resilience; the tourism industry may transform into a new global economic order characterized by sustainable tourism, society's well-being, climate action, and the involvement of local communities. We also offer directions for future research in the area. © 2020","Climate action; COVID-19; Global economic order; Innovation; Local belongingness; Resilience; Sustainable tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098556586

This condition is much more detrimental in the Himalaya, where the rate of warming and thus the glacier meltdown is much higher than elsewhere. The Himalayan coldwater species are concerningly most vulnerable to these changes because of their limited thermal range. Whilst climate studies strongly prognosticate the altered distribution of plants and mammals in this region, the impact on coldwater fishes still remains unknown. We used snow trout (Schizothorax richardsonii), a Himalayan coldwater specialist as a model organism to predict the current suitability and climate-driven potential range shift in an ensemble-based modeling framework. We collated occurrence data from a long term, extensive field-based sampling with additional records derived from an in-depth literature survey. A comprehensive input data set including topographic, hydrogeomorphic and climatic variables were used to build correlative species distribution models for the current and future time-periods (2050 and 2070) under three-carbon emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) by integrating five General Circulation Models. Furthermore, we predicted the elevation-specific range shifts of the snow trout in response to climate change. We predict that a wide-ranging mid-elevation river network is currently suitable for the snow trout in Himalaya, however a significant part of its current distributional range would be lost over time. Our results highlight that snow trout would expand their range upwards into the high-altitude streams with a concurrent predominant range contraction in most of their lagging edges, ultimately creating a high-altitude squeeze. The net habitat loss under three RCP scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) was estimated to range from 7.41% to 16.29% for the year 2050 which would further increase in the year 2070 ranging from 9.46% to 26.56%. These results provide a strategic information on prioritizing climate-adaptive actions to target the currently suitable habitats and future refugia identified. Our modeling framework also provides a foremost basis to conserve not only the snow trout but also to evaluate the climate impact on several other coldwater species, which are equally vulnerable and ecologically important in the Himalaya. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coldwater; Himalaya; Range shift; Species distribution modeling","Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Mammals; Snow; Altitude streams; Carbon emissions; Climatic variables; Ensemble modeling; General circulation model; Literature survey; Species distribution models; Suitable habitat; Climate models; action plan; altitude; climate effect; estimation method; general circulation model; habitat loss; prioritization; range size; salmonid; strategic approach; vulnerability; Himalayas; Mammalia; Pisces; Schizothorax richardsonii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090228831

Acknowledging this, urban climate change adaptation and mitigation plans are increasingly developed to make progress toward enhancing climate resilience. While there is consensus that focusing on both adaptation and mitigation is necessary for addressing climate change impacts, better understanding of their interactions is needed to efficiently maximize their potentials. This paper, first, provides a bibliographic analysis to map existing knowledge regarding adaptation-mitigation interactions. This is done using methods such as bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. Then, drawing on the literature, this study explores two types of interactions between adaptation and mitigation measures, namely co-benefits and synergies. These interactions are explored through analyzing evidence reported in the literature on different measures related to sectors such as energy, transportation, waste, water, green infrastructure, urban planning, and governance. Results of the bibliographic analysis show that there is a lack of research in the Global South. Results of the detailed content analysis show that many measures can provide co-benefits and synergies. Measures related to green infrastructure, buildings, energy systems, and, transportation are particularly capable of providing co-benefits. In addition, it was found that appropriate levels of density, promotion of public transportation, and urban greenery are measures that are more likely to provide synergistic benefits if combined with other adaptation and/or mitigation measures. This study highlights the need for more empirical research to better understand the magnitude of synergistic benefits between different measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Co-benefit; Energy; Green infrastructure; Interaction; Mitigation; Synergy","Bibliographies; Information analysis; Urban transportation; Bibliographic analysis; Bibliographic couplings; Climate change impact; Co-Citation Analysis; Co-occurrence analysis; Green infrastructure; Mitigation measures; Public transportation; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; environmental planning; environmental policy; literature review; mitigation; research work; citation analysis; city planning; climate change; content analysis; drawing; empirical research; human; human experiment; review; waste water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089809155

The launched hybrid vehicles are facing challenges regarding the cost-fuel benefit trade-off as well as the complexity in packaging the E-Machine between Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and transmission system. The P3 hybrid configuration with AMT system is a way to achieve better drivability and fuel benefit. This paper focuses on development of Dual Control Strategy (DCS) for performance improvement in retrofitted 48 V P3 hybrid AMT vehicle. The DCS is developed based on rule based approach and Adaptive-Equivalent fuel Consumption Minimization Strategy (A-ECMS). The proposed control strategy includes decision making of mode shift between electric and ICE mode, optimal torque distribution between ICE and E-machine, equivalence cost factor computation with kinetic energy at the wheel and drivability consistency subjective to system limits during E-Creep, E-Launch and mode shift. The overall energy transfer efficiency to the wheels is improved by considering the global constraint, State of Charge (SOC) difference and the local constraint of 48 V battery, E-Machine and ICE. The 48 V P3 hybrid AMT vehicle with DCS can provide 10 kW power during torque assist or electric drive and −12 kW during recuperation or ICE mode, which results an elevated real time fuel economy by 66.7% and promises a improved driving performance in Bangalore city Driving Cycle (BDC). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","48V Technology; City driving cycle; Control strategy; Emissions; Fuel economy; Hybrid vehicle; Recuperation","Automobile drivers; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electric drives; Electric power transmission; Energy transfer; Facings; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Fuels; Ice; Ice control; Internal combustion engines; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Powertrains; Vehicle performance; Vehicle transmissions; Wheels; Driving performance; Energy transfer efficiency; Equivalent fuel consumption; Hybrid configurations; Performance optimizations; Rule-based approach; Torque distribution; Transmission systems; Hybrid vehicles; automobile industry; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; kinetic energy; optimization; performance assessment; real time; regulatory approach; torque; trade-off; Bengaluru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092152169

Given cities' heterogeneity, they need specific low-carbon roadmaps instead of one-size-fits-all approaches. Here, we present the most detailed and up-to-date accounts of CO2 emissions for 294 cities in China and examine the extent to which their economic growth was decoupled from emissions. Results show that from 2005 to 2015, only 11% of cities exhibited strong decoupling, whereas 65.6% showed weak decoupling, and 23.4% showed no decoupling. We attribute the economic-emission decoupling in cities to several socioeconomic factors (i.e., structure and size of the economy, emission intensity, and population size) and find that the decline in emission intensity via improvement in production and carbon efficiency (e.g., decarbonizing the energy mix via building a renewable energy system) is the most important one. The experience and status quo of carbon emissions and emission-GDP (gross domestic product) decoupling in Chinese cities may have implications for other developing economies to design low-carbon development pathways. © 2020 The AuthorsThis study presents emission inventories of 294 Chinese cities and examines the extent to which economic growth has decoupled from emissions from 2005 to 2015. We further explored the driving forces of cities' emission-GDP decoupling and conclude that improvement in production and carbon efficiency is the most important driver. The emission-GDP decoupling lessons in China may have significant implications for other developing and fast-growing economies in pursuit of low-carbon development. © 2020 The AuthorsCities contribute to over 80% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and account for at least 75% of global CO2 emissions. As such, they are well placed to lead climate change mitigation efforts. Decoupling economic growth from emissions is key to low-carbon development, particularly in fast-growing countries, such as China. In this work, we estimated CO2 emissions for 294 Chinese cities and examined the extent to which economic development is decoupled from emissions. Results show that 11% of the cities have negative emission growth between 2005 and 2015, whereas their economy continued to grow (i.e., strong decoupling). A total of 65.6% of cities exhibit slower growth of emissions than economic growth (i.e., weak decoupling). We find that decline in emission intensity via improvement in production and energy use efficiency is the most important driver that leads to a decoupled economy. Other developing economies could learn from China's experience in emission-GDP decoupling to design their own low-carbon development pathways. © 2020 The Authors","cities; decoupling; drivers; emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; emission inventory; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099859929

Farming community can minimize the impact of climate change on agriculture by adopting climate change strategies at their farms. Therefore, this study analyzed how farmers perceive climate change, which strategies they adopt to minimize the impact of climate change at their farms, and the influential factors affecting the adoption of these strategies. For this purpose, cross sectional data of 195 farmers selected through multi stage purposive and random sampling techniques were collected in a face to face survey and multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the factors affecting adoption of climate change strategies. Climate change is no more a mystery for the farmers and farming community perceive this variability very well. Majority of the farmers perceived an increase in both summer as well as winter temperatures. Farming community in the area was adopting conventional climate change strategies such as changing in crop cultivation dates, new crop varieties, crop diversification, mix farming, and intensified use of chemicals at their farms in order to minimize the climate changes. Adoption of climate change strategies at farm level was influenced by schooling years, age, machinery ownership, market distance, agricultural labor force, extension services and total land of the farmers. Therefore, extension services, and improving road infrastructure to enhance market access are essential to increase adoption of climate change strategies among farmers. © by PSP","Adaptation strategies; Adoption; Agriculture; Climate change; Perception; Punjab","adaptive management; agricultural market; climate change; cross section; farmers attitude; food security; perception; regression analysis; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101537749

However, to date, the underlying mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of PM remain unclear. Our objective was to explore how exposure to relatively low doses of urban air PM alters innate responses to bacterial and viral stimuli in vitro. We used secondary alveolar epithelial cell line along with monocyte-derived macrophages to replicate innate lung barrier in vitro. Co-cultured cells were first exposed for 24 h to PM2.5-1 (particle aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 2.5 μm) and subsequently for an additional 24 h to lipopolysaccharide (TLR4), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (TLR3), and synthetic single-stranded RNA oligoribonucleotides (TLR7/8) to mimic bacterial or viral stimulation. Toxicological endpoints included pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α), cellular metabolic activity, and cell cycle phase distribution. We show that cells exposed to PM2.5-1 produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with bacterial TLR4 ligand than cells exposed to PM2.5-1 or bacterial ligand alone. On the contrary, PM2.5-1 exposure reduced pro-inflammatory responses to viral ligands TLR3 and TLR7/8. Cell cycle analysis indicated that viral ligands induced cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase. In PM-primed co-cultures, however, they failed to induce the G2-M phase arrest. Contrarily, bacterial stimulation caused a slight increase in cells in the sub-G1 phase but in PM2.5-1 primed co-cultures the effect of bacterial stimulation was masked by PM2.5-1.

This study examines the metabolic transition of resource use and CO2 emissions in nine of the largest economies of East, South, and Southeast Asia. A data envelopment model has been developed to assess the efficiency of domestic material consumption and CO2 emissions during 1971–2016 at three levels of analysis. The single-country analysis results reveal that China has made the most rapid efficiency transformation during 1971–2016 followed by Japan and South Korea, while the rest of the countries in South and Southeast Asia have not illustrated significant improvements. Results from the analysis of socio-economically grouped countries show that Japan and Bangladesh are the relatively efficient economies in East and South Asia, respectively. Among Southeast Asian countries, both Indonesia and Malaysia were found to be efficient. Based on the regional analysis comparing all nine countries, Japan has consistently remained a relatively efficient economy while China—despite rapid improvements—remains a relatively inefficient economy. To this end, Japan had the lowest material and CO2 intensities compared to all other countries. Based on our results, technological advancement, industry structure, and scale of traded goods and services were found to have a significant impact (the impact of per capita income was less pronounced) on a country’s effective resource utilization and carbon mitigation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asia; Carbon mitigation; Developing countries; Industrial ecology; Resource efficiency; Sustainable development","carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; industrial development; material flow analysis; resource use; trade-environment relations; Bangladesh; China; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Malaysia; South Korea; carbon; carbon dioxide; Asia; Bangladesh; China; developing country; Indonesia; Japan; Malaysia; South Korea; Southeast Asia; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Bangladesh; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Developing Countries; Indonesia; Japan; Malaysia; Republic of Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090302282

The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the power of the Inclusive Multiple Model (IMM) as a novel approach to predict CO2 emission in the agriculture sector of Iran. For the same, we implemented the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) specification and data from 2003 to 2017 for 28 provinces of Iran. In the first level, various specifications were implemented for each of the Multiple Regression (MLR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. In the second level, an IMM model was implemented for treating the outputs of the best specification out of the MLR, GPR, and ANN models as inputs to an ANN model. The performance of the models was compared with the Taylor diagram and innovation and unique graphs. Findings indicated that the IMM model with CC=0.81, RMSE = 0.69, the highest residuals between −5 and 5 (37.84%), and the lowest distance from observation points (1.857) estimated CO2 emission values more precisely. These improvements indicate that there are possible directions for future research activities.

In addition, the high costs of the battery pack and electric components suppose a challenge to the vehicle manufacturers. However, the internal combustion engine complexity can be reduced due to its lower use as compared to the no-hybrid vehicles. This work evaluates the use of a new opposed piston 2-stroke engine, based on rod-less innovative kinematics, in a series PHEV architecture based on rod-less innovative kinematics along different driving routes in Europe. A 0D-vehicle model fed with experimental tests is used. The battery size is optimized under homologation conditions for two different vehicle types. The optimum case is tested in several real driving conditions under different vehicle modes and battery states of charge. The main contribution of this work is the demonstration of the potential to reduce the vehicle CO2 emissions and cost with an innovative 2-stroke engine. The results show that 24 kWh is the optimum battery size for both vehicle platforms. Charge depleting mode shows 70% of CO2 tailpipe reduction in urban cycles and 22% in long travels compared to the no-hybrid version. Charge sustaining mode results show a CO2 tailpipe reduction of 20% in urban cycles and 2% in long distance travels with respect to the no-hybrid version.

Additionally, various rhizoremediation factors can affect methane emissions by altering soil ecosystem carbon cycles. Nonetheless, greenhouse gas emissions from soil have not been given due importance as a potentially relevant parameter in rhizoremediation techniques. Therefore, in this study we sought to investigate the effects of different plant and soil amendments on both remediation efficiencies and methane emission characteristics in diesel-contaminated soil. An indoor pot experiment consisting of three plant treatments (control, maize, tall fescue) and two soil amendments (chemical nutrient, compost) was performed for 95 days. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal efficiency, dehydrogenase activity, and alkB (i.e., an alkane compound-degrading enzyme) gene abundance were the highest in the tall fescue and maize soil system amended with compost. Compost addition enhanced both the overall remediation efficiencies, as well as pmoA (i.e., a methane-oxidizing enzyme) gene abundance in soils. Moreover, the potential methane emission of diesel-contaminated soil was relatively low when maize was introduced to the soil system. After microbial community analysis, various TPH-degrading microorganisms (Nocardioides, Marinobacter, Immitisolibacter, Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Alcanivorax) and methane-oxidizing microorganisms (Methylocapsa, Methylosarcina) were observed in the rhizosphere soil. The effects of major rhizoremediation factors on soil remediation efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions discussed herein are expected to contribute to the development of sustainable biological remediation technologies in response to global climate change.

However, their areal extent has declined by over one-third in recent decades. Degraded mangrove forests result in reduced carbon captured and lead to release of stored carbon into the atmosphere by CO2 emission. The aim of this study was to assess changes in carbon dynamics in a gradually degrading mangrove forest on Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Remote sensing techniques were applied to estimate the distribution of intact and degraded mangroves. Forest structure, sediment carbon storage, sediment CO2 effluxes and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon in pore and surface waters across intact and degraded parts were assessed. On average intact mangroves showed 31% sediment organic carbon in the upper 30 cm compared to 20% in degraded mangrove areas. A loss of 1.51 MgCO2 ha−1 yr−1 for degraded sites was calculated. Water samples showed a hypersaline environment in the degraded mangrove area averaging 93 which may have caused mangrove dieback. Sediment CO2 efflux within degraded sites was lower than values from other studies where degradation was caused by clearing or cutting, giving new insights into carbon dynamics in slowly degrading mangrove systems. Results of water samples agreed with previous studies where inorganic carbon outwelled from mangroves might enhance ecosystem connectivity by potentially buffering ocean acidification locally. Wetlands will be impacted by a variety of stressors resulting from a changing climate. Results from this study could inform scientists and stakeholders on how combined stresses, such as climate change with salinity intrusion may impact mangrove's blue carbon sink potential and highlight the need of future comparative studies of intact versus degraded mangrove stands. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Blue carbon; Bonaire; Carbon stocks; Dissolved organic and inorganic carbon; Greenhouse gases; Remote sensing","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Magnesium compounds; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Sediments; Wetlands; Changing climate; Comparative studies; Dissolved organic and inorganic carbon; Hypersaline environment; Ocean acidifications; Remote sensing techniques; Salinity intrusion; Sediment organic carbon; Forestry; carbon; carbon dioxide; dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved organic carbon; organic carbon; surface water; unclassified drug; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sink; carbon storage; comparative study; environmental degradation; mangrove; wetland; acidification; Article; carbon dynamics; carbon storage; Caribbean; climate change; comparative study; controlled study; degradation; environmental impact; environmental stress; forest structure; mangrove; nonhuman; priority journal; remote sensing; sea; sediment; water sampling; wetland; Bonaire; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090054050

Therefore, there is a demand for estimating future changes in the statistics of the occurrence of these rare events. These are often projected using data from regional climate model (RCM) simulations combined with extreme value analysis to obtain selected return levels of precipitation intensity. However, due to imperfections in the formulation of the physical parameterisations in the RCMs, the simulated present-day climate usually has biases relative to observations; these biases can be in the mean and/or in the higher moments. Therefore, the RCM results are adjusted to account for these deficiencies. However, this does not guarantee that the adjusted projected results will match the future reality better, since the bias may not be stationary in a changing climate. In the present work, we evaluate different adjustment techniques in a changing climate. This is done in an inter-model cross-validation set-up in which each model simulation, in turn, performs pseudo-observations against which the remaining model simulations are adjusted and validated. The study uses hourly data from historical and RCP8.5 scenario runs from 19 model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble at a 0.11<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula resolution. Fields of return levels for selected return periods are calculated for hourly and daily timescales based on 25-year-long time slices representing the present-day (1981-2005) and end-21st-century (2075-2099). The adjustment techniques applied to the return levels are based on extreme value analysis and include climate factor and quantile-mapping approaches. Generally, we find that future return levels can be improved by adjustment, compared to obtaining them from raw scenario model data. The performance of the different methods depends on the timescale considered. On hourly timescales, the climate factor approach performs better than the quantile-mapping approaches. On daily timescales, the superior approach is to simply deduce future return levels from pseudo-observations, and the second-best choice is using the quantile-mapping approaches. These results are found in all European subregions considered. Applying the inter-model cross-validation against model ensemble medians instead of individual models does not change the overall conclusions much. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

This is the first study to compare these approaches across a large set of hydro-climatologically diverse basins located throughout the contiguous United States, grouped into distinct clusters based on catchment and flood characteristics. The comparison is achieved using a split-sample test conducted over the historic period; the climate (specifically, precipitation) informed and hydrologic simulation (specifically, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model) approaches are forced with observations and downscaled general circulation model (GCM) simulations. The results provide a quantitative perspective on key long-term flood projection issues. The precipitation informed approach can be informative for projections of regional change; the hydrologic simulation approach can be informative for direction of change for a single basin. When forced with GCM outputs, precipitation informed is both more accurate and more precise than hydrologic simulation, after accounting for model error. For hydrologic simulation, forcing with GCMs will add positive bias for basins in the Rocky Mountains and Southwest and will add negative bias with large uncertainty across GCMs for basins in the lower Midwest, the South, and the mid-Atlantic seaboard.

The PC-SAFT equation of state is used as thermodynamic model to calculate both equilibrium and transport properties. Computer-aided molecular design allows designing the solvent as a degree of freedom of the process optimization. To allow for ease of use, we implemented the method in the process flowsheeting software gPROMS ProcessBuilder, enabling the convenient definition of the flowsheet.

For π + ρ → π + γ and π + π → ρ + γ processes, these cross sections have been implemented into a novel hadronic transport approach (SMASH), which is suitable for collisions at low and intermediate energies. The implementation is verified by systematically comparing the thermal photon rate to theoretical expectations. The photon rates we obtain are compared to previous works, where scattering processes mediated by ω mesons are found to contribute significantly to the total photon production. Finally, the impact of considering the finite width of the ρ meson is investigated, and a significant enhancement of photon production in the low-energy region is observed. This work is the first step towards a consistent treatment of photon emission in hybrid hydrodynamics+transport approaches. The quantification of the importance of the hadronic stage for the resolution of the direct photon flow puzzle is a next step and can be applied to identify equilibrium and non-equilibrium effects in the hadronic afterburner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","electromagnetic probes; heavy-ion collisions; photons",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097665843

We use a methodological framework involving four steps: transport demand estimation, traffic simulation, emissions calculation and emissions environmental social cost calculation. Based on five scenarios, depending on the scale of the shift to OHD, and applied to the case of the Lyon urban area, we find that OHDs lead to a reduction in CO2 and pollutant emissions. However, their impact is rather small. The maximum reduction in CO2 emissions is 3.4% for 100% OHD for the whole urban area of Lyon (1.9 million inhabitants and 3325 km2). Some factors (population size, density, traffic conditions, research methodology, vehicle fleet composition, etc.) limit the comparability of the results obtained from other case studies. One of the reasons for this low environmental impact of OHDs is that the LUA is a small and not very congested metropolitan area. This impact is 5% when we focus on the densest area (core of area with 0.7 million inhabitants on 2.2% of surface area) which is more important than in the least dense area (outskirts of area with 0.6 million inhabitants on 83.6% of surface area) with 2.6%. These results confirm the limited impacts of OHDs in smaller, less congested urban areas. It also reaffirms the need for OHDs to be implemented in the densest parts of metropolitan areas. The maximum decrease in the environmental social cost is 4.25 million euros per year. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the adoption of OHD makes it possible to achieve gains of 2.5 million hours per year in travel time that augur a productivity gain for all the actors involved in urban goods movement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impacts; Large-scale simulation; Off-hour deliveries; Urban goods movements","Fleet operations; Pollution; Population statistics; Productivity; Traffic control; Travel time; Large-scale deployment; Methodological frameworks; Pollutant emission; Productivity gain; Research methodologies; Traffic conditions; Traffic simulations; Urban goods movement; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental impact assessment; metropolitan area; Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Grand Lyon; Lyons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096828808

Although the necessity of biological post-treatment for oxidation by-product (OBP) removal is widely accepted, there is still discussion about the appropriate design and operation. The presented pilot-study investigates the impact of filter material and contact time on the removal efficiency of bulk organics, OMP, and OBP in three different deep-bed filters operated in parallel as post-treatment after ozonation (biological activated carbon (BAC) filter, dual-media filter sand/BAC and dual-media filter sand/anthracite). The use of BAC instead of non-adsorptive filter material resulted in higher removal of DOC and dissolved oxygen which indicates increased biological activity. Moreover, both BAC containing filters showed additional removal for a number of OMP even at high treated bed volumes of >50 000 whereas no removal was observed in the sand/anthracite filter. Analysis of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and several carbonyl compounds revealed a clear formation of these biodegradable OBP during ozonation. A strong correlation was found between carbonyl formation and the specific ozone dose. Removal of OBP in the sand/BAC and the sand/anthracite filter was tested at different empty bed contact times (EBCT). While NDMA was efficiently removed independent of EBCT changes, there was a slightly negative impact of shorter EBCT on the reduction of carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the integration of enhanced phosphorus removal into post-treatment is feasible with relatively low efforts by inline coagulant dosing (FeCl3) in the filter influent. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activated carbon treatment; Bioactivity; Biological filter beds; Biological water treatment; Carbonyl compounds; Chlorine compounds; Dissolved oxygen; Iron compounds; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Product design; Sand; Biological activated carbon; Biological post-treatment; Design and operations; Enhanced phosphorus removals; Municipal wastewater treatment; N-nitrosodimethylamine; Organic micro-pollutants; Oxidation by-products; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099087799

The electron transfer from a photoactive semiconductor to the metal-complex catalyst is a key process for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with hybrid photocatalysts. Herein, the excited-state dynamics of several hybrid photocatalysts are described by using time-resolved emission and infrared absorption spectroscopies to understand the mechanism of electron transfer from a semiconductor to the metal-complex catalyst. The results show that electron transfer from the semiconductor to the metal-complex catalyst does not occur directly upon photoexcitation, but that the photoexcited electron transfers to a new excited state.

So today’s attention to our research community is finding an eco-friendly material that gives high strength at an affordable cost. The circular economy and sustainability can be achieved by clean energy production, recycling of materials and use of green materials from crop residue. Ligno cellulosic fibers are a healthy and high tech choice for reinforcement in different kinds of polymer matricesto obtain high-performance composites. In 2015, the NFC market worth was USD 3.36 million and is expected to reach USD 6.50 billion in 2021. The market dominance of the natural fiber segment is owing to its advantages of being lightweight, having environmental benefits and strong mechanical performance. The automobile sector uses biocomposites from centuries ago and its interest increases due to the concerns about sustainable and environmental issues. As per the demand of European regulations, the automobile industry took initiative to design and utilization of sustainable, feasible environment, cost-effective materials for its parts manufacturing dates back to the 1940s when the first biomaterial component using hemp fiber produced by Henry Ford. The global trends towards CO2 reduction and fuel economy have significantly increased the importance of vehicle Lightweighting. The use of fiber-reinforced composite offers lightweighting advantages, helping automakers create vehicle parts with reduced weight and improved performance and strength.50% weight reduction giving a massive 40% energy saving and reduced CO2emissions. Bio-based materials can compete with traditional materials and offer the greatest mass reduction for the equivalent strength and are well suited for both interior and exterior applications.

Two-year baseline GOM dry deposition measurements at the same six sites in the Four Corners area, taken before the implementation of U.S.A. power plant mercury control regulations, were conducted earlier from August 2009–August 2011.

In light of the unexpected increases in GOM dry deposition rates at the non-remote sites, it is suggested that large regional wildfires and local anthropogenic mercury emission sources from cities and oil/gas production areas are possible notable contributors to the GOM dry deposition measurements collected in the Four Corners area. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air Pollution; Arid area; Dry deposition; Gaseous oxidized mercury; Surrogate surface passive sampling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090311016

This manuscript reviews the recent works related to the application of DSM in SG through discussing the techniques and algorithms and their associated challenges for effective implementation. This paper also critically discusses the operation mode of DSM, the profile of energy production, storage and consumption, and finally the benefit obtained by the DSM implementation. Previous literature suggested that DSM practice reduced peak-to-average ratio, energy cost and carbon emission by approximately 10% to 65%, 5% to 50%, and 14%, respectively. The implementation of DSM in SG deals with a number of challenges such as security and privacy, tariff regulation, energy transmission, distribution, and effective utilization of energy resources. A number of international organizations have taken various measures and solutions to guarantee the security and privacy of the DSM in SG discussed. So far, a number of algorithms have been used as optimization approach to solve the DSM optimization problems; however hybrid algorithms have showed better performance than single algorithms due to their faster convergence speed.

Vac. Sci. Technol. B 38, 023208 (2020)]. Due to the large variation in length scales even in a 2-stage compound structure consisting of a macroscopic base and a microscopic protrusion, the simulation methodology of a gated field emitting compound diode needs to be revisited. As part of this strategy, the authors investigate the variation of local field on the surface of a compound emitter near its apex and find that the generalized cosine law continues to hold locally near the tip of a multi-scale gated cathode. This is used to emit electrons with appropriate distributions in position and velocity components with a knowledge of only the electric field at the apex. The distributions are consistent with contemporary free-electron field emission model and follow from the joint distribution of launch angle, total energy, and normal energy. For a compound geometry with local field enhancement by a factor of around 1000, a hybrid model is used where the vacuum field calculated using COMSOL is imported into the Particle-In-Cell code PASUPAT, where the emission module is implemented. Space charge effects are incorporated in a multi-scale adaptation of PASUPAT using a truncated geometry with ""open electrostatic boundary""condition. The space charge field, combined with the vacuum field, is used for particle-emission and tracking. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Electric fields; Electrons; Field emission; Field emission displays; Compound structures; Joint distributions; Local field enhancement; Multiplicative effects; Particle in cell codes; Simulation methodology; Space charge effects; Velocity components; Field emission cathodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099783518

The carbon isotopic composition of soil carbonates (δ13CSC), soil organic matter (δ13CSOM), organic matter occluded in soil carbonate nodules (δ13CNOM) and biomarkers in paleosol organic matter (long-chain fatty acid; δ13CFAME) are often used to estimate changes in the past-vegetational composition. However, it has been observed that depending on the type of proxy, the estimated abundance of C3-C4 plants varies, which can lead to uncertainty in paleovegetational records. Hence, the present study aims to comprehend the factors affecting the δ13CSC, δ13CSOM, δ13CNOM and δ13CFAME values within a paleosol. In this context, available δ13CSC, δ13CSOM, δ13CFAME and newly measured δ13CNOM values from the late Quaternary sequences of the Ganga Plain, India has been used. The abundance of C4 plants calculated from the δ13CSC and δ13CFAME values is ~2% to 89% higher compared to the δ13CSOM and δ13CNOM values-based estimates. Even with a common source of organic matter, the δ13CSOM values indicate a higher abundance of C4 plants (~2% to 50%) compared to the estimates from δ13CNOM values. We suggest that the disparity is due to the variation in the response of proxies to perturbations in the paleovegetational regime, growing season condition, and isotopic fractionation during decomposition and incorporation of organic matter into the soil. For example, the organic matter is incorporated into the soil throughout the year and represents average annual biomass, whereas SC precipitates under warmer and often drier condition when the ratio of C4 to C3 plant respiration is higher. Additionally, preferential degradation of 13C enriched labile compounds and C4 plants derived organic matter may lower the δ13CNOM values resulting in an under estimation of C4 plants in a mixed C3-C4 environment. The higher abundance of C4 plants estimated from the δ13CFAME values is due to the isotopic fractionation (13C enrichment of ~2‰ to 7‰) during incorporation of plant-derived long-chain fatty acids into the soil. The disparity in the abundance of C4 plants estimated from δ13CSOM and δ13CNOM values is due to the difference in the preservation of SOM and NOM. Contrary to the NOM (which is in a closed system), SOM in open system within the soil matrix is subjected to 13C enrichment due to the long-term humification of organic matter. Various factors such as grain size and pedogenesis that are inherent to the depositional environment also control the δ13C values of paleosol components. Considering the uncertainties associated with the δ13C values of paleosol components, reporting the absolute abundance of C4 plants would be uncertain. Therefore, we recommend presenting the relative change in abundance of C3-C4 plants during paleovegetational reconstruction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fatty acids; Ganga Plain; Nodule organic matter; Paleovegetation; Soil carbonates; Soil organic matter","abundance; C4 plant; carbon isotope; depositional environment; historical record; isotopic composition; long-term change; paleosol; proxy climate record; reconstruction; soil organic matter; vegetation history; Gangetic Plain; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093662159

A major challenge for the scientific community is to identify, quantify and characterize the sources of atmospheric particles in the aspect of proposing effective control strategies. In the frame of ICARUS EU2020 project, a comprehensive database including PM2.5 concentration and chemical composition (ions, metals, organic/elemental carbon, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) from three sites (traffic, urban background, rural) of five European cities (Athens, Brno, Ljubljana, Madrid, Thessaloniki) was created. The common and synchronous sampling (two seasons involved) and analysis procedure offered the prospect of a harmonized Positive Matrix Factorization model approach, with the scope of identifying the similarities and differences of PM2.5 key-source chemical fingerprints across the sampling sites. The results indicated that the average contribution of traffic exhausts to PM2.5 concentration was 23.3% (traffic sites), 13.3% (urban background sites) and 8.8% (rural sites). The average contribution of traffic non-exhausts was 12.6% (traffic), 13.5% (urban background) and 6.1% (rural sites). The contribution of fuel oil combustion was 3.8% at traffic, 11.6% at urban background and 18.7% at rural sites. Biomass burning contribution was 22% at traffic sites, 30% at urban background sites and 28% at rural sites. Regarding soil dust, the average contribution was 5% and 8% at traffic and urban background sites respectively and 16% at rural sites. Sea salt contribution was low (1–4%) while secondary aerosols corresponded to the 16–34% of PM2.5. The homogeneity of the chemical profiles as well as their relationship with prevailing meteorological parameters were investigated. The results showed that fuel oil combustion, traffic non-exhausts and soil dust profiles are considered as dissimilar while biomass burning, sea salt and traffic exhaust can be characterized as relatively homogenous among the sites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical composition; Multi-city study; Particulate matter; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source apportionment; Sources homogeneity","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Combustion; Dust; Factorization; Fuel oils; Organic carbon; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Atmospheric particles; Chemical compositions; Chemical fingerprint; Meteorological parameters; Positive matrix factorization models; Scientific community; Source apportionment; Synchronous sampling; Urban growth; ion; metal; oil; organic carbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; comparative study; dust; European Union; particulate matter; source apportionment; traffic emission; aerosol; air pollution; Article; biomass; chemical composition; combustion; data base; Europe; particle size; priority journal; rural area; suspended particulate matter; traffic pollution; urban area; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090046617

A growing literature involving “climate governance” is evolving and should advance the discussion on transformations and the involvement of different actors in climate action. However, it is unclear that the Global South's particularities are being integrated. This study has a three-fold goal: (a) identify the different approaches to climate governance found in the mainstream literature, (b) explore the degree of integration of the Global South in those approaches, and (c) contribute to the ongoing discussion on this issue from a southern perspective. A systematic literature review on “climate governance” was conducted, distinguishing different approaches and their significance for the Global South. Results clustered in six groups use the characterizations: multi-level, global, adaptive, transnational, polycentric, and experimental/transformative. These terms account for different levels of decision-making, emerging values, and the importance of non-State and sub-national actors. Approaches vary, in relation to change and participation, from an incremental improvement focus to a more transformative perspective and from the promotion of community influence to processes based on traditional institutions. In the Global South, multi-level, multi-actor climate governance occurs in a context of deep inequality and asymmetric power relations, rising environmental conflicts, and a lack of adequate mechanisms for community participation. Addressing climate change here will require, acknowledging the State alone cannot solve the issue, that different views must be considered and that contextualized perspectives from the Global South must be integrated. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; climate governance; Global South; interdisciplinary; literature review","climate change; climate modeling; decision making; governance approach; literature review; participatory approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091214106

The presence of polar co-adsorbates, such as substituted phenols, enhances the hydrogenation rate of the aldehyde by two effects, that is, polarizing the carbonyl group and increasing the probability of forming a transition state for H addition. These two effects enable a hydrogenation route, in which phenol acts as a conduit for proton addition, with a higher rate than the direct proton transfer from hydronium ions. The fast hydrogenation enabled by the presence of phenol and applied potential overcompensates for the decrease in coverage of benzaldehyde caused by competitive adsorption.

The structure, diversity and activity of soil microbial communities are influenced by the quantity and quality of organic compounds entering soils through the contribution of their root exudates and plant litter, which the microorganisms use as a substrate for biosynthesis and energy source. However, grazing effect on the soil microorganisms showed variable results dependent on the ecosystem under study. One of the main challenges of this millennium is the sustainability of agricultural production, especially in fragile soils such as those present in Patagonia. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the responses of microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil basal respiration (SBR), the derived coefficients and the abundance of fungi and bacteria under contrasting long-term grazing intensities in an environmental gradient. The study was established in three ecological areas Mata Negra Thicket (MNT), Dry Magellanic Steppe (DMS) and Humid Magellanic Steppe (HMS) with two grazing intensities. Soil samples were taken over two years in different seasons (autumn, winter, spring and summer). Results showed that biotic and abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation), plant communities and soil characteristics modulated the microbial structure and function in ecological area. On the other hand, high grazing intensity decreased the MBC and microbial coefficient (qM). There was a seasonal and interannual dynamic in the MBC and the bacteria and fungal communities, attributed mainly to temperature and precipitation. The results indicated that the effect of grazing intensity in soil microbial communities depends largely on intrinsic characteristics of each ecological area defined by the environmental gradient. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fungi and bacteria; Grassland; Livestock stocking; Microbial biomass carbon; Microbial coefficient; Soil respiration","abundance; community structure; environmental gradient; fungus; microbial activity; microbial community; plant community; seasonal variation; soil microorganism; species diversity; terrestrial ecosystem; Argentina; Patagonia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090282555

Such imagery measurements will be provided by the future Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Mission (CO2M). While the modeling framework retains the complexity of previous studies focused on individual and large cities, this system encompasses a wide range of sources to extend the scope of the analysis. This atmospheric inversion system uses a zoomed configuration of the CHIMERE regional transport model which covers most of western Europe with a 2 km resolution grid over northern France, western Germany and Benelux. For each day of March and May 2016, over the 6 h before a given satellite overpass, the inversion separately controls the hourly budgets of anthropogenic emissions in this area from span classCombining double low line inline-formula g1/4 300 cities, power plants and regions. The inversion also controls hourly regional budgets of the natural fluxes. This enables the analysis of results at the local to regional scales for a wide range of sources in terms of emission budget and spatial extent while accounting for the uncertainties associated with natural fluxes and the overlapping of plumes from different sources. The potential of satellite data for monitoring CO span classCombining double low line inline-formula 2 fluxes is quantified with posterior uncertainties or uncertainty reductions (URs) from prior inventory-based statistical knowledge./p pA first analysis focuses on the hourly to 6 h budgets of the emissions of the Paris urban area and on the sensitivity of the results to different characteristics of the images of vertically integrated CO span classCombining double low line inline-formula 2 (XCO span classCombining double low line inline-formula 2 ) corresponding to the spaceborne instrument: the pixel spatial resolution, the precision of the XCO span classCombining double low line inline-formula 2 retrievals per pixel and the swath width. This sensitivity analysis provides a correspondence between these parameters and thresholds on the targeted precisions of emission estimates. However, the results indicate a large sensitivity to the wind speed and to the prior flux uncertainties. The analysis is then extended to the large ensemble of point sources, cities and regions in the study domain, with a focus on the inversion system's ability to separately monitor neighboring sources whose atmospheric signatures overlap and are also mixed with those produced by natural fluxes. Results highlight the strong dependence of uncertainty reductions on the emission budgets, on the wind speed and on whether the focus is on point or area sources. With the system hypothesis that the atmospheric transport is perfectly known, the results indicate that the atmospheric signal overlap is not a critical issue. All of the tests are conducted considering clear-sky conditions, and the limitations from cloud cover are ignored. Furthermore, in these tests, the inversion system is perfectly informed about the statistical properties of the various sources of errors that are accounted for, and systematic errors in the XCO span classCombining double low line inline-formula 2 retrievals are ignored; thus, the scores of URs are assumed to be optimistic. For the emissions within the 6 h before a satellite overpass, URs of more span idCombining double low line page404/ than 50 % can only be achieved for power plants and cities whose annual emissions are more than span classCombining double low line inline-formula g1/4 2 MtC yr span classCombining double low line inline-formula-1 . For regional budgets encompassing more diffuse emissions, this threshold increases up to span classCombining double low line inline-formula g1/4 10 MtC yr span classCombining double low line inline-formula-1 .

The ‘Green Revolution’ (GR) has substantial impact on the agricultural landscape and ESs in India. However, the effects of GR on ESs have not been adequately documented and analyzed. This leads to the main hypothesis of this work – ‘the incremental trend of ESs in India is mainly prompted by GR led agricultural innovations that took place during 1960 - 1970’. The analysis was carried out through five successive steps. First, the spatiotemporal Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) in Billion US$ for 1985, 1995, and 2005 were estimated using several value transfer approaches. Second, the sensitivity and elasticity of different ESs to land conversion were carried out using coefficient of sensitivity and coefficient of elasticity. Third, the Geographically Weighted Regression model was performed using five explanatory factors, i.e., total crop area, crop production, crop yield, net irrigated area, and cropping intensity, to explore the cumulative and individual effects of these driving factors on ESVs. Fourth, Multi-Layer Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network was employed to estimate the normalized importance of these explanatory factors. Fifth, simple and multiple linear regression modeling was done to assess the linear associations between the driving factors and the ESs. During the observation periods, cropland, forestland and water bodies contributed to 80%–90% of ESVs, followed by grassland, mangrove, wetland and urban built-up. In all three evaluation years, the highest estimated ESVs among the nine ES categories was provided by water regulation, followed by soil formation and soil-water retention, biodiversity maintenance, waste treatment, climate regulation, and greenhouse gas regulation. Among the five explanatory factors, total crop area, crop production, and net irrigated area showed strong positive associations with ESVs, while cropping intensity exhibited a negative association. Therefore, the study reveals a strong association between GR led agricultural expansion and ESVs in India. This study suggests that there should be an urgent need for formulation of rigorous ecosystem management strategies and policies to preserve ecological integrity and flow of uninterrupted ESs and to sustain human well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)","Ecology; Ecosystem service value; Green revolution; India; Land use change; Value transfer","soil water; water; agricultural economics; agricultural intensification; agricultural land; crop production; ecosystem service; green revolution; net ecosystem production; regulatory framework; agricultural management; Article; artificial neural network; association; biodiversity; climate; crop; crop production; cropland; ecosystem; elasticity; environmental management; food industry; forest; geographically weighted regression; grassland; green chemistry; greenhouse gas; harvest; India; irrigation (agriculture); land use; mangrove; multilayer perceptron; multiple linear regression analysis; pedogenesis (soil); spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; urban area; waste management; water quality; water retention; wetland; agriculture; environmental protection; human; India; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092008745

However, these patterns are still unstudied for many plant communities. This study aimed to evaluate the structure (species richness, Shannon's diversity index, Simpson´s dominance index, abundance of each species, average height of species, species cover (%), species composition, and indicator values) of a low thorn forest fragment and to analyze its relation with microclimate along a successional gradient. Four stages of succession were delimited by the analysis of Landsat images, in the state of Tamaulipas, northeast Mexico. Statistical models incorporated species richness, diversity indices, abundance, height, and cover, as variables for searching differences between stages, or to evaluate microclimate associations. A total of 70 species, 54 genera, and 27 families were determined. Height of tree layer was the most important variable for discrimination of the successional stages. Conserved areas differed floristically from other stages, associated mainly with the lowest values of wind speed originated by tree layer characteristics. A significant association between species and microclimate was found, being wind speed and relative humidity the most important variables. Some species, due to their high importance values and their patterns of association with microclimate, may be considered as key taxa for low thorn forest, which is a threatened semitropical community in northeast Mexico. Conserved and late successional areas account for climatic regulation of this plant community, and the importance of these forest patches may be considered when establishing biodiversity protection areas. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Chronosequence; Ecological niche; Low thorn forest; Microclimate; Secondary succession; Vegetation structure","abundance; biodiversity; conservation status; land cover; microclimate; plant community; relative humidity; satellite imagery; secondary succession; species richness; Mexico [North America]; Tamaulipas; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092341589

Here, we combine the strengths of proxies and models through coral-based paleoclimate data assimilation. We combine coral archives (d18O, Sr/Ca) with the dynamics, spatial teleconnections, and intervariable relationships of the CMIP5/PMIP3 Past1000 experiments using the Last Millennium Reanalysis data assimilation framework. This analysis creates skillful reconstructions of tropical Pacific temperatures over the observational era. However, during the period of intense volcanism in the early nineteenth century, southwestern Pacific corals produce El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) reconstructions that are of opposite sign from those from eastern Pacific corals and tree ring records. We systematically evaluate the source of this discrepancy using 1) single-proxy experiments, 2) varied proxy system models (PSMs), and 3) diverse covariance patterns from the Past1000 simulations. We find that individual proxy records and coral PSMs do not significantly contribute to the discrepancy. However, following major eruptions, the southwestern Pacific corals locally record more persistent cold anomalies than found in the Past1000 experiments and canonical ENSO teleconnections to the southwest Pacific strongly control the reconstruction response. Furthermore, using covariance patterns independent of ENSO yields reconstructions consistent with coral archives across the Pacific. These results show that model bias can strongly affect how proxy information is processed in paleoclimate data assimilation. As we illustrate here, model bias influences the magnitude and persistence of the response of the tropical Pacific to volcanic eruptions. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

For this purpose, a multiscale modelling system has been implemented that includes a mesoscale model (WRF/Chem) up to a horizontal resolution of 1 km and a computational fluid dynamics model (CFD; MICROSYS) with a resolution of 5 m. For the calculation of traffic emissions, a traffic simulation has been previously conducted with the SUMO microscopic model, calibrated from data measured with traffic counters. We show a substantial improvement in the results obtained with 5 m resolution with respect to those of 1 km, reproducing very closely the daily peaks of NO2 concentrations since a very detailed traffic emission source is being used and the CFD reproduces the interactions between the air flow and the buildings. The modelling system presented can be used as a tool to evaluate different emission reduction strategies at street level, as it would allow to have an orientation on their effectiveness without having to implement them. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CFD model; Traffic emissions; Urban air pollution","Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Emission reduction strategy; Horizontal resolution; Meso-scale modeling; Microscale simulation; Microscopic modeling; Multi-scale modelling; Traffic simulations; Computational fluid dynamics; nitrogen dioxide; accuracy assessment; air quality; atmospheric pollution; calibration; computational fluid dynamics; mesoscale meteorology; nitrogen oxides; traffic congestion; urban atmosphere; airflow; Article; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (parameter); data accuracy; exhaust gas; model; priority journal; simulation; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090721094

Policies to address air pollution have reduced criteria pollutant emissions, improved regional air quality, and benefited public health. To this end, California has imposed strict regulations on light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles to reduce ambient concentrations of health-damaging pollutants such as ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Here, we compare the impact on air quality in California should California not have adopted on-road vehicle regulations (No Regulations Case) with the air quality associated with current regulations (Regulated Case). Simulations of atmospheric chemistry and transport are conducted to evaluate the impact of emissions on ambient levels of ozone and PM2.5, and a health impact assessment tool is used to quantify and monetize societal impairment. Compared with the ""Regulated Case,""the ""No Regulations Case""results in a maximum peak 8 h ozone level of 162 ppb and 24 h PM2.5 of 42.7 μg/m3 in summer, and 107 μg/m3 and 24 h PM2.5 in winter. The associated increases in the daily incidence of human health outcomes are $66 million per day and $116 million per day during peak pollutant formation periods in summer and winter, respectively.

Knowing whether cities set ambitious climate and energy targets is critical for determining their contribution towards the global 1.5 °C target, partly because it helps to identify areas where further action is necessary. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the mitigation targets of 327 European cities, as declared in their local climate plans. The sample encompasses over 25% of the EU population and includes cities of all sizes across all Member States, plus the UK. The study analyses whether the type of plan, city size, membership of climate networks, and its regional location are associated with different levels of mitigation ambition. Results reveal that 78% of the cities have a GHG emissions reduction target. However, with an average target of 47%, European cities are not on track to reach the Paris Agreement: they need to roughly double their ambitions and efforts. Some cities are ambitious, e.g. 25% of our sample (81) aim to reach carbon neutrality, with the earliest target date being 2020.90% of these cities are members of the Climate Alliance and 75% of the Covenant of Mayors. City size is the strongest predictor for carbon neutrality, whilst climate network(s) membership, combining adaptation and mitigation into a single strategy, and local motivation also play a role. The methods, data, results and analysis of this study can serve as a reference and baseline for tracking climate mitigation ambitions across European and global cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Energy policy; EURO LCP Initiative; Europe; Local climate plans; Mitigation","Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Carbon emissions; Carbon neutralities; Climate mitigations; Comparative analysis; Energy targets; European cities; Local climate; Regional locations; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089754484

First, the effect of passivating AGNR on the sensing performance toward CO and CO2 gases has been investigated, where AGNR was passivated with hydrogen (H-AGNR) and nitrogen (N-AGNR). The obtained results reflected no significant changes in the adsorption parameters of CO and CO2 molecules on H-AGNR and N-AGNR. Particularly, the adsorption energies between H-AGNR and N-AGNR systems and CO were found to be −0.446 and −0.436 eV, while for the case of CO2, the adsorption energies were found to be −0.426 and −0.432 eV, respectively. To enhance the sensing performance, both H-AGNR and N-AGNR systems were doped with platinum (Pt) forming another two systems: Pt–H-AGNR, and Pt–N-AGNR. After doping, the results revealed a significant increase in the adsorption energy to almost 9 times than the non-doped systems for the cases of CO on Pt–N-AGNR as well as CO2 on both Pt–H-AGNR and Pt–N-AGNR. Moreover, an increase of almost 13 times was observed in the adsorption energy for the case of CO on Pt–H-AGNR. Besides to the adsorption energy (Eads), the adsorption distance ((D), charge transfer (ΔQ), the density of states (DOS), as well as the band structure have been examined to confirm the adsorption of CO and CO2 on the four systems. © 2020 The Authors","Adsorption energy; DFT; Graphene nanoribbon; Passivation; Platinum","Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Charge transfer; Graphene; Graphene nanoribbon; Nanoribbons; Adsorption energies; Adsorption parameters; Density of state; DFT study; Non-doped; Sensing performance; Sensor materials; Platinum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089936199

For this reason, it is necessary to control the increase in the volume of waste and its implications for the environment. The scenario used in this research is to design a power plant that can be used to control the increase in the volume of waste, namely PLTSa (Waste Power Plant). PLTSa uses organic waste from trash to generate clean, renewable energy, powering communities, and reducing emissions. At the PLTSa, the organic waste is fed into a digester tank, where it is converted into methane by bacteria. The gas is then sent to the waste power plant, which generates 0.9 MW of power. The PLTSa supports the Indonesian government's plan to increase electricity in the country by 35,000 MW from 2015 to 2019, and for 25% of that electricity to be generated from renewable sources. The government's plan was in response to a shortage of electricity generation capacity as demand in the country grows. The data analysis method used to analyze the research data is an analysis using the IPCC Inventory software and the LFGcost-Web Landfill Gas Emission Model (LandGEM). Data analysis results in the form of projections of biogas potential and electrical energy will be used to build PLTSa. Waste-to-energy generation is being increasingly looked at as a potential energy diversification strategy, especially in Indonesia and PLTSa (Waste Power Plants) in several cities in Indonesia. © 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science",,"Biogas; Data handling; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Information analysis; Land fill; Potential energy; Sustainable development; Wastes; Data analysis methods; Electrical energy; Electricity generation capacity; Energy diversification; Landfill gas emissions; Reducing emissions; Renewable energies; Renewable sources; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100739047

Because of the psychological connections (cognitive and emotional) with the frequency, intensity and age of a climatic event, people may have the capacity to recognize key variations at lower scales, especially those from which they perceive risk. Yet, the anticipatory actions and social engagement to respond or adapt to climate change are difficult to achieve, mostly when there exists a long psychological distance to climatic phenomena. Research about climate change communication provides clues about the relevance of place-based discussion to gauge risk perception and improve response protocols, their design and prioritization. It argues that strategies and actions required to face climate risks may widely differ depending on the scale and accuracy of the local representations displayed during discussions of climate impacts. This work examines how local attributes (from climate to social) operate and control place-specific risks and priorities, by comparing coastal communities in two locations, Cabo Pulmo, Mexico and Zanzibar, Tanzania, which are subject to different climate dynamics. This paper discusses the need to identify relevant climate risks/responses at the local level and how psycho-social factors (e.g., psychological distance, collective memory, and social engagement) may operate positively for building climate resilience. We also illustrate a workflow to increase and enhance collaboration between researchers and local people by promoting dialogue, participation and narratives that rigorously consider the local knowledge. © Copyright © 2021 Saldívar-Lucio, Trasviña-Castro, Jiddawi, Chuenpagdee, Lindström, Jentoft, Fraga and de la Torre-Castro.","adaptive capacity; anticipatory governance; climate adaptation; climate risk; coastal communities; risk perception; socio-ecological resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100581709

In this paper, the analysis and performance of integrated standalone hybrid solar PV, fuel cell and diesel generator power system with battery energy storage system (BESS) or supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) in Khorfakkan city, Sharjah were presented. HOMER Pro software was used to model and simulate the hybrid energy system (HES) based on the daily energy consumption for Khorfakkan city. The simulation results show that using SCESS as an energy storage system will help the performance of HES based on the Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The HES with SCESS has renewable fraction (68.1%) and 0.346 $/kWh LCOE. The HES meets the annual AC primary load of the city (13.6 GWh) with negligible electricity excess and with an unmet electrical load of 1.38%. The reduction in GHG emissions for HES with SCESS was 83.2%, equivalent to saving 814,428 gallons of diesel. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Battery storage system; Diesel; Fuel cell; Renewable energy; Solar PV; Super Capacitor storage system hybrid energy system","Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Solar cells; Supercapacitor; Battery energy storage systems; Conventional energy systems; Diesel generators; Energy storage systems; Hybrid energy system; Supercapacitor energy storages; Supercapacitor storage; United Arab Emirates; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090981745

Doing so requires a good understanding of the costs associated with lowering emissions and factors that may influence this cost. This study estimated the marginal abatement cost of reducing both direct and indirect CO2 emissions in the provision of drinking water by several water companies in England and Wales. The results indicated that during the years 2013–2018, the average cost to the English and Welsh water industry to prevent 1 kg of CO2 emissions was 0.264₤ which was equivalent to 61% of the price of the delivered drinking water The results of the Morishima elasticity of substitution between water delivered and carbon emissions revealed that on average it was costly for the water companies to reduce CO2 emissions. Furthermore, a positive correlation existed between the marginal abatement cost of CO2 and a set of company's operational factors. These included: i) water taken from boreholes and reservoirs, ii) high levels of drinking water treatment, and iii) the need for pumping to abstract, treat, and distribute drinking water. Finally, policy implications were discussed based on these findings. © 2020","CO2; directional distance function; greenhouse gas; marginal abatement cost; shadow price; water industry","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Sustainable development; Water treatment; Carbon dioxide emissions; Elasticity of substitution; England and Wales; Environmental sustainability; Marginal abatement costs; Operational factors; Policy implications; Positive correlations; Potable water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097572339

The present characterization fills this knowledge gap for carbon nanomaterial surface properties with respect to chemical states and functionalization. We present an overview of the chemical trends that can be extracted from soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra on an extended set of nonideal carbon nanomaterials as a function of sp2 bonded carbon and bond ordering. In particular, the surface chemical state, the presence of long-range order in the carbon matrix, and a qualitative estimation of the amount of oxygen and nitrogen and their respective functional group formation on the material surface, together with the detailed material fabrication parameters, are reported. The results expand our understanding of carbon nanomaterial functionalization, which can support material selection in practice, provided that the specifications of the application are known. ©",,"Energy storage; Nanostructured materials; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Predictive analytics; Surface properties; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X rays; Carbon nano-materials; Functionalizations; Material fabrication; Oxygen and nitrogens; Qualitative estimation; Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopies; Surface chemical state; Surface Functionalization; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099024106

The single crystal structures of the two complexes confirmed their distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry attained by three equatorial N-Atoms from the ligand and two axially positioned water molecules to give [Cu(BPIMe)(H2O)2]ClO4 and [Ni(BPIMe)(H2O)2]ClO4. Electrochemical studies of Cu(ii) and Ni(ii) complexes have been performed in acetonitrile to identify metal-based and ligand-based redox activity. When subjected to a saturated CO2 atmosphere, both complexes displayed catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 with the Cu(ii) complex displaying higher activity than the Ni(ii) analogue. However, both complexes were shown to decompose into catalytically active heterogeneous materials on the electrode surface over extended reductive electrolysis periods. Surface analysis of these materials using energy dispersive spectroscopy as well as their physical appearance suggests the reductive deposition of copper and nickel metal on the electrode surface. Electrocatalysis and decomposition are proposed to be triggered by ligand reduction, where complex stability is believed to be tied to fluxional ligand coordination in the reduced state. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Copper compounds; Copper metallography; Crystal atomic structure; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ligands; Molecules; Nickel metallography; Redox reactions; Reduction; Single crystals; Surface analysis; Synthesis (chemical); Complex stability; Distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometries; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrochemical studies; Electrode surfaces; Heterogeneous materials; Ligand coordination; Pincer complexes; Nickel compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100060226

One such hypothesis is the presence of low-shear wave velocity, hydrous and carbonate mineral phases. Although, the presence of hydrous silicates and carbonates can cause a reduction in the shear wave velocity of mantle domains, the contribution of volatile metasomatism to the origins of MLDs has remained incompletely evaluated. To assess the metasomatic origin of MLDs, we compiled experimental phase assemblages, phase proportions, and phase compositions from the literature in peridotite + H2O, peridotite + CO2, and peridotite + H2O + CO2 systems at P-T conditions where hydrous silicate and/or carbonate minerals are stable. By comparing the experimental assemblages with the compiled bulk peridotite compositions for cratons, we bracket plausible proportions and compositions of hydrous silicate and carbonate mineral phases that can be expected in cratonic SCLMs. Based on the CaO and K2O contents of cratonic peridotite xenoliths and the estimated upper limit of CO2 content in SCLM, ≤∼10 vol.% pargasitic amphibole, ≤∼2.1 vol.% phlogopite and ≤∼0.2 vol.% magnesite solid solution can be stable in the SCLM. We also present new elasticity data for the pargasite end member of amphibole based on first principles simulations for more accurate estimates of aggregate VS for metasomatized domains in cratonic mantle. Using the bracketed phase compositions, phase proportions, and updated values of elastic constants for relevant mineral end members, we further calculate aggregate VS at MLD depths for three seismic stations in the northern continental U.S. Depending on the choice of background wave speeds of unmetasomatized peridotite and the cratonic geotherm, the composition and abundance of volatile-bearing mineral phases bracketed here can explain as much as 2.01 to 3.01% reduction in VS. While various craton formation scenarios allow formation of the amphibole and phlogopite abundances bracketed here, presence of volatile-bearing phases in an average cratonic SCLM composition cannot explain the entire range of velocity reductions observed at MLDs. Other possible velocity reduction mechanisms thus must be considered to explain the full estimated range of shear wave speed reduction at MLD depths globally. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","cratons; elastic moduli; mid-lithospheric discontinuities; pargasite; phlogopite; shear wave velocity","Acoustic wave velocity; Aggregates; Calcium oxide; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Magnesite; Mica; Phase composition; Seismology; Shear waves; Silicates; Wave propagation; Craton formations; First-principles simulations; Hydrous silicate; Peridotite xenoliths; Phase assemblages; Reduction mechanisms; Shear wave velocity; Sub-continental lithospheric mantles; Shear flow; craton; discontinuity; elastic modulus; lithospheric structure; mantle structure; metasomatism; pargasite; phlogopite; S-wave; seismic velocity; volatile substance; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092187372

In this work, we use a non-linear deep learning-based feature reduction scheme for the discovery of skilful predictors for monsoon rainfall with climatic variables from various regions of the globe. We use a stacked autoencoder network along with two advanced machine learning techniques to forecast the Indian summer monsoon. We show that the predictors such as the sea surface temperature and zonal wind can predict the Indian summer monsoon one month ahead, whereas the sea level pressure can predict ten months before the season. Further, we also show that the predictors derived from a combination of climatic variables can outperform the predictors derived from an individual variable. The stacked autoencoder model with combined predictors of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure can predict the monsoon (June-September) two months ahead with a 2.8% error. The accuracy of the identified predictors is found to be superior to the state-of-the-art predictions of the Indian monsoon. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Automated feature learning; Ensemble regression model; Indian summer monsoon; Monsoon prediction; Predictor identification; Stacked autoencoder",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089134431

We conclude that: (a) negative impacts of climate change on productivity of Picea glauca × P. engelmannii may be mitigated by planting seed sources from locations that are 3◦C mean coldest month temperature warmer than the plantation; (b) it is possible to establish Pinus albicaulis outside of its current natural distribution at sites that have climates that are within the species’ modelled historic climatic niche, although developing disease-resistant trees through selective breeding is a higher priority in the short term; (c) Abies religiosa performs well when moved 400 m upward in elevation and local shrubs (such as Baccharis conferta Kunth) are used as nurse plants; (d) new assisted migration field trials that contain populations from a wide range of climates tested in multiple disparate climates are needed, despite the costs; and (e) where naturalization of a migrated tree species in recipient ecosystem is viewed as undesirable, the invasive potential of the tree species should be assessed prior to large scale establishment, and stands should be monitored regularly following establishment. © 2020 by the authors.

One way to do so is to crosscheck the predicted wavelengths of resonance transitions in He-and Li-like ions against precise spectroscopic measurements that use the spectral lines of H-like ions for spectra calibration; these reference data can be modeled with outstanding precision. However, for elements with Z of at least 15, it is quite difficult to create a hot dense plasma with a large concentration of H-like charge states. To mitigate this issue, the suggestion here is to use as laser targets particular minerals comprising elements with moderate (between 15 and 30) and low (less than 15) Z, with emission from the latter delivering perfect reference lines over a whole range of He-and Li-like moderate-Z emission under examination. This approach is implemented to measure the wavelengths of resonance transitions (1snp → 1s2 for n = 2, 3) in He-like K ions and their dielectronic satellites by irradiating plates of orthoclase (KAlSi3O8) with 0.5-kJ subnanosecond laser pulses. X-ray spectra of the laser-generated plasma contain the investigated lines of highly charged K ions together with precisely known reference lines of H-like Al and Si atoms. The K-shell spectral line wavelengths are measured with a precision of around 0.3 mÅ. © 2020 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097786796

Alternatively, good communication and sensitivity to community feelings are pathways to success. While literature referencing the social aspects of wind power siting have become widespread, analyses which include individuals’ affect or emotional dimensions are rarer. Appreciation for emotional as well as cognitive perceptions is crucial for adequate understanding of not just consumptive or productive aspects of energy, but entire systems. We use a US national cross-sectional data set of 1705 individuals who live within 8 km of a wind turbine collected in a research project led by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in a random probability-based phone, mail, and online survey in 2016. We hypothesize that individuals who moved-in prior to commencement of project construction will differ markedly from those who move in afterwards in terms of the cognitive and affective aspects of their attitude formation, and in particular, that negative emotions will be distinct. Variables include emotions such as pride, anger, and annoyance, perceptions of fit with the landscape, descriptions of the turbines as industrial and whether they added to or detracted from the community. We find affect is the stronger driver of attitude, but not merely by negative emotions. When we include both cognitive and affective variables, individual emotions are generally more predictive of attitude for pre-construction neighbors and cognitive variables such as wind being an effective means of climate mitigation and perception of property value change are stronger post-construction. © 2020 The Authors","Attitudes; Emotions; Onshore wind; Perception; Survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095415392

In a 9-year experiment, we surveyed the yearly performance of 108 ex situ pre-grown sporophytes of D. carthusiana, D. dilatata, and D. expansa in six forests in Estonia. We used multi-factorial models to assess species-specific responses of frond traits and population parameters to seasonal temperature, precipitation, and snow cover, and also considered the effects of continentality and overstory density. Frond length was highly limited by plant age, and even the 11-year-old plants did not reach their mature size. The number of fronds stabilized already in the first few years. Climate effects on leaf traits accumulated over 2 years, as their growth benefited from the abundant precipitation during two growing seasons and the presence of dry cold winters. Milder climate near the coast and semi-open overstory provided some extra support for the growth. Species-specific effects were rare. The species’ responses to habitat and climate effects only partly mirrored their present biogeographic distribution. Evidently, possible effects of climate change might go unnoticed for decades in these ferns since it would be mitigated by (1) their slow ontogenesis, (2) organ preformation during preceding year(s), and (3) region-specific and habitat-specific effects of environmental conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Dryopteris carthusiana group; Leaf traits; Long-term experiment; Organ preformation; Plant ontogeny; Plant–climate interactions","Ecosystems; Snow; Climatic effects; Environmental conditions; Factorial models; Future performance; Habitat specifics; Long-term growths; Seasonal temperature; Species specifics; Climate change; air temperature; biogeography; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; environmental conditions; growing season; growth rate; ontogeny; overstory; precipitation (chemistry); snow cover; Estonia; Dryopteris; Dryopteris carthusiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099766936

The study was carried out in the Segura Hydrographic Demarcation (SE of Spain), a typical Mediterranean semiarid area. ET0 was estimated in the historical scenario (1970–2000) using a spatially calibrated Hargreaves model. MMEs obtained better results than any individual model for reproducing daily ET0 . In validation, RF resulted more accurate than other MMEs (Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) M = 0.903, SD = 0.034 for KGE and M = 3.17, SD = 2.97 for absolute percent bias). A statistically significant positive trend was observed along the 21st century for RCP8.5, but this trend stabilizes in the middle of the century for RCP4.5.

All this is a consequence of the massive urbanization verified since the 1950s and which is expected to continue in the coming decades. A crucial issue will therefore concern the management of existing cities and the planning of future ones, and this was also emphasized by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and communities). Smart Cities are often seen as ideal urban environments in which the different dimensions of a city (economy, education, energy, environment, etc.) are managed successfully and proactively. So, one of the most important challenges cities will have to face, is to guide citizens towards a form of “clean” energy consumption, and the dimension on which decision-makers will be able to work is the decarbonization of transport. To achieve this, electric mobility could help reduce polluting emissions on the road. Within this research, the strategies that six Smart Cities (London, Hamburg, Oslo, Milan, Florence, and Bologna) have implemented to encourage the transition to this form of mobility have been studied. Through a systematic review of the literature (Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science) and through the study of the main political/energy documents of the cities, their policies on electric mobility have been evaluated. Then, for each city, SDG 11.6.2 was analyzed to assess the air quality in the last four years (2016–2019) and, therefore, the effectiveness of the policies. The analysis showed, in general, that the policies have worked, inducing reductions in the pollutants of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 . In particular, the cities showed the most significant reduction in pollutant (above 20%) were Hamburg (−28% PM2.5 and −2%6 NO2 ), Milan (−25% PM2.5 and −52% NO2 ), and London (−26% NO2 ). © 2021 by the authors.

However, appraisals of it tend to focus on the claim that life is a feedback self-regulator that controls Earth's chemistry and climate dynamics, yet, self-regulation by feedbacks is not a definitive characteristic of living systems. Here, we consider the characterization of biological systems as autopoietic systems (causally organized to self-produce through metabolic efficient closure) and then ask whether the Gaia hypothesis is a tractable question from this standpoint. A proof-of-concept based on Chemical Organization Theory (COT) and the Zero Deficiency Theorem (ZDT) applied on a simple but representative Earth's molecular reaction network supports the thesis of Gaia as an autopoietic system. We identify the formation of self-producing organizations within the reaction network, corresponding to recognizable scenarios of Earth's history.

The primary experimental diagnostic is the streaked optical pyrometer, which images a narrow band of radiation from the rear surface of the heated material. Presented are xRAGE modeling results for both solid aluminum targets and carbonized resorcinol-formaldehyde foam targets, showing that the foam appears to cool slowly on the pyrometer because of partial transparency. So that simulations of cooling foam are processed properly, it is necessary to account for finite optical depth in the photosphere calculation, and the methods for performing that calculation are presented in depth. © 2021 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099705804

This uncertainty is amplified if drought stress is accompanied by changes in other drivers such as the increases in canopy light exposure that might be induced by tree mortality or other disturbances. Photosynthetic capacity, leaf respiration, non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) storage and stomatal conductance were measured on 162 trees at the world's longest running (15 years) tropical forest drought experiment. We test whether surviving trees have altered strategies for carbon storage and carbon use in the drier and elevated light conditions present following drought-related tree mortality. Relative to control trees, the surviving trees experiencing the drought treatment showed functional responses including: (a) moderately reduced photosynthetic capacity; (b) increased total leaf NSC; and (c) a switch from starch to soluble sugars as the main store of branch NSC. This contrasts with earlier findings at this experiment of no change in photosynthetic capacity or NSC storage. The changes detected here only occurred in the subset of drought-stressed trees with canopies exposed to high radiation and were absent in trees with less-exposed canopies and also in the community average. In contrast to previous results acquired through less intensive species sampling from this experiment, we also observe no species-average drought-induced change in leaf respiration. Our results suggest that long-term responses to drought stress are strongly influenced by a tree's full-canopy light environment and therefore that disturbance-induced changes in stand density and dynamics are likely to substantially impact tropical forest responses to climate change. We also demonstrate that, while challenging, intensive sampling is essential in tropical forests to avoid sampling biases caused by limited taxonomic coverage.

Despite their high carbon sequestration efficiency and long-term storage capacity, few countries have assembled detailed mangrove carbon inventories. For example, Brazil, which detains the second largest mangrove area in the world, still lacks a detailed inventory on its blue carbon resources, largely due to the scarcity of integrated ecosystem-level (that is, carbon stored in biomass and soil combined) carbon assessments. Here we combine published and unpublished data to derive an inventory on ecosystem-level carbon stocks and carbon sequestration rates in the Cananéia-Iguape lagoon estuarine system, southeastern Brazil. We find that mangroves in the study area have the largest per-unit-area ecosystem-level carbon stocks at 380 MgC ha−1 when compared to other Brazilian mangroves. Soil organic carbon stocks (top meter) account for 70% of this total. Annual carbon sequestration in mangrove soils and woody biomass combined with carbon fluxes via litterfall total 0.16 TgC yr−1. Degradation of mangrove ecosystems in this region could lead to CO2e emissions up to 1,395 MgCO2 ha−1 and reduce annual carbon sequestration in soil and biomass combined, and carbon flux via litterfall by 27 and 12 MgCO2 ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Our results provide coastal wetlands managers and scientists with novel information on mangrove carbon stocks and sequestration rates in the study area, which is useful to strengthen regional blue carbon and potential CO2e emission inventories. These estimates can also be used to establish performance measures to inform restoration targets as well as to serve as a baseline for comparison with current and future measurements of carbon stocks and fluxes in response to environmental change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Blue carbon; Carbon accretion; Carbon burial; Carbon fluxes; Net primary productivity","Biomass; Carbon capture; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Magnesium compounds; Organic carbon; Soils; Wetlands; Carbon inventories; Carbon sequestration; Emission inventories; Environmental change; Mangrove ecosystems; Performance measure; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Southeastern Brazil; Forestry; biomass; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; ecosystem dynamics; estuarine ecosystem; forest ecosystem; mangrove; soil organic matter; Biomass; Carbon; Chelation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Magnesium Compounds; Mangrove; Wetlands; Brazil; Cananeia Lagoon; Iguape; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090412009

Even though cultural heritage has passed through decades and centuries, it has never experienced such unexpected and variable events as those forecasted by climate change for the foreseeable future, making it a sensitive element of the living environment. By selecting the city of Ravenna and the cultural heritage site of the Santa Croce Church and archaeological area as a case study, the paper aims at providing an insight into the role that urban planning tools have when it comes to improving the resilience of historical areas, coping with climate change through improvements to the disaster risk management of cultural heritage. Starting from a deep analysis of the existing spatial and urban planning tools that operate at different scales on the Ravenna territory, the adaptive capacity of the historical area toward the identified risks was assessed. The results may lead, on the one hand, to improving the integration of cultural heritage risk management into urban planning tools; on the other hand, they contribute to improving the scope and the governance of the heritage management plans in order to cope with climate change risks and their effects. © 2021 by the authors.

Renewable self-consumption, in addition to savings in the electricity bill of consumers, also unlocks a variety of benefits such as the reduction of CO2 emissions and electrical power losses in the transmission network, the reduction of electricity price in the wholesale market, the energy dependence rate or the creation of local work. In spite of all these advantages, many barriers have prevented the development of renewable self-consumption in Spain until October 2018, when a new regulation introduced the right to self-consume renewable electrical energy without charges. This work is intended to assess the profitability of residential PV self-consumption in Spain. To achieve that goal the hourly profiles of demand and PV self-production for an average dwelling have been elaborated based on one-year data from the System Operator. Our findings highlight that a 1.5–2 kW-peak PV commercial self-consumption kit yields to an optimum net billing situation for an average dwelling, which means an effective saving of the previous electricity bill. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-benefit analysis; Economic key performance indicators; Photovoltaic systems; Prosumers; Renewable energy; Renewable self-consumption","Housing; Profitability; CO2 emissions; Electrical energy; Electrical power; Electricity bill; Electricity prices; Energy dependence; System operator; Wholesale markets; Electric power transmission networks",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090209555

However, very little of this work has occurred in islands, which may have different vulnerabilities and capacities for adaptation. Data of surveyed farmers throughout Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (n = 405, 87% response rate) were used in a structural equation model to explore the extent to which their adoption of agricultural practices and management strategies was driven by perceptions of motivation, vulnerability, and capacity as a function of their psychological distance of climate change. Our results show that half of farmers did not adopt any practice or strategy, even though the majority perceived themselves capable and motivated to adapt to climate change, and understood their farms to be vulnerable to future extreme events. Furthermore, adoption was neither linked to these adaptation perceptions, nor to their psychological distance of climate change, which we found to be both near and far. Puerto Rican farmers’ showed a broad awareness of climate change’s impacts both locally and globally in different dimensions (temporal, spatial, and social), and climate distance was not linked to reported damages from Hurricane Maria or to previous extreme weather events. These results suggest that we may be reaching a tipping point for extreme events as a driver for climate belief and action, especially in places where there is a high level of climate change awareness and continued experience of compounded impacts. Further, high perceived capacity and motivation are not linked to actual adaptation behaviors, suggesting that broadening adaptation analyses beyond individual perceptions and capacities as drivers of climate adaptation may give us a better understanding of the determinants to strengthen farmers’ adaptive capacity.

In the last decades, many Mediterranean forests have undergone a decreasing level of direct human pressure and a growing exposure to environmental stress factors (e.g. wildfires and droughts). However, the degree to which these processes have affected the provision of ES remains largely unexplored. We used an extensive database of 3417 permanent plots (period 1990–2015, 25 years) from the Spanish National Forest Inventory in Catalonia (North-Eastern Spain) and a range of four ecological models to measure and estimate changes in five different ES: wild mushrooms production, timber volume increment, water provision, carbon sequestration and erosion mitigation. We then assessed general trends in ES, their spatial–temporal patterns and searched for potential trade-offs in their delivery. Using mixed-effects models, we explored the differences among three biogeographical regions, as well as the effect of different environmental and site level drivers, including descriptors of stand structure and development, the legacies of management practices and disturbances, as well as the influence of historical climate conditions and their recent anomalies. Our results show a general decline of timber volume increment, water provision and carbon sequestration, along with an increase in erosion mitigation across inland and montane regions. Fitted model parameters suggest a predominant role of stand structure in driving changes in forest ES supply in the study area. In particular, stands with high basal areas were associated with steeper declines in most ES, whereas high mean tree diameter generally contributed to ES increases. Finally, our results showed a series of potential trade-offs among temporal changes in ES that were not reflected in exclusively static analyses, highlighting the relevance of including the temporal dimension in regional assessments of ES. Future forest management and planning could better account for overall ES value as well as expected changes in their future provision, paving the way to landscape planning that balances these two essential components of forest ES. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate anomalies; Forest management; Global change; Mediterranean Basin; National Forest Inventory","Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate models; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Erosion; Timber; Biogeographical regions; Environmental stress; Management practices; Mediterranean forest; Mediterranean forest ecosystems; Mediterranean region; Mixed effects models; National forest inventories; Forestry; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; disturbance; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; environmental stress; forest ecosystem; forest management; stand structure; temporal variation; Biodiversity; Carbon; Commerce; Ecosystems; Erosion; Forestry; Catalonia; Mediterranean Region; Spain; Basidiomycota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093931072

University Ave, Laramie, WY  82070, United States","The northern American Southwest provides one of the most well-documented cases of human population growth and decline in the world. The geographic extent of this decline in North America is unknown owing to the lack of high-resolution palaeodemographic data from regions across and beyond the greater Southwest, where archaeological radiocarbon data are often the only available proxy for investigating these palaeodemographic processes. Radiocarbon time series across and beyond the greater Southwest suggest widespread population collapses from AD 1300 to 1600. However, radiocarbon data have potential biases caused by variable radiocarbon sample preservation, sample collection and the nonlinearity of the radiocarbon calibration curve. In order to be confident in the wider trends seen in radiocarbon time series across and beyond the greater Southwest, here we focus on regions that have multiple palaeodemographic proxies and compare those proxies to radiocarbon time series. We develop a new method for time series analysis and comparison between dendrochronological data and radiocarbon data. Results confirm a multiple proxy decline in human populations across the Upland US Southwest, Central Mesa Verde and Northern Rio Grande from AD 1300 to 1600. These results lend confidence to single proxy radiocarbon-based reconstructions of palaeodemography outside the Southwest that suggest post-AD 1300 population declines in many parts of North America.

The issue of IAM transparency has been an ongoing concern for approximately two decades regarding the cloaking of value-laden assumptions and output uncertainties. Due to the opaque nature of IAMs, the credibility of modeling results and the associated policy recommendations are patently limited, with policymakers inevitably having reservations as to the robustness of modeling outcomes given the deficit of information regarding the underlying assumptions. In an attempt to address the issue of a lack of transparency concerning IAM usage by the IPCC, a database containing the climate mitigation scenario ensemble which underpinned the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C was made publicly available, the IAMC 1.5°C Scenario Explorer database. Despite this database, the omission of critical model input data and accompanying supporting documentation from its content fails to fulfill its raison d'être, that is to say, to ensure reproducibility and transparency. If the issue of IAM transparency is not fully addressed in the upcoming AR6 with respect to the provision of IAM input data, accompanied by supporting documentation, then the IPCC will have failed to meet its own declared commitment for this assessment cycle.

This paper introduces and defines minimobility that falls between a regular ridesourcing/taxi option and micromobility, and also providing critical logistics services during the era of COVID-19. In Central Stockholm the platform has provided a safe and environmentally friendly mode choice that occupies limited space and efficiently serves on the congested city network. We explore potential economic and environmental benefits of minimobility, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of deploying such a service. While we demonstrate a general increase in VMT, consistent with other work showing increased travel from new mobility, due to the electric platform this increase in customer access to mobility results in minimal GHG impacts. This informs how planners and engineers can explore minimobility platforms not only as reduced emissions solutions to urban transit issues but as tools to increase total mobility particularly for the most vulnerable. © 2021 William Riggs and Shivani Shukla.","Electric Vehicles; Minimobility; Operational Efficiency; Transit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118111404

The interaction of these ejecta with the surrounding medium may produce a weak isotropic radio remnant, detectable in relatively nearby events. We use late-time radio observations of short duration gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to constrain this model. Two samples of events were studied: four sGRBs that are possibly in the local (<200 Mpc) Universe were selected to constrain the remnant non-thermal emission from the sub-relativistic ejecta, whereas 17 sGRBs at cosmological distances were used to constrain the presence of a proto-magnetar central engine, possibly re-energizing the merger ejecta. We consider the case of GRB 170817A/GW170817 and find that in this case the early radio emission may be quenched by the jet blast-wave. In all cases, for ejecta mass range of Mej ≤ 10-2(5×10-2)M⊙, we can rule out very energetic merger ejecta Eej≥ 5×1052(1053)erg, thus excluding the presence of a powerful magnetar as a merger remnant. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","Gamma-ray burst: general; Stars: magnetars; Stars: neutron",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097488300

Although these applications have a positive contribution to port community health and global reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), especially when the energy is supplied from renewable sources, emissions during loading/unloading operations are directly related to the operating profiles of auxiliary engines of a ship. The present work evaluates a ship’s emission impact when applying cold-ironing technology using a bi-directional power flow control strategy while at berth, thus optimizing the auxiliary engine operating profile and enabling regeneration into the port installations. The methodology applied considers the establishment of the operational profile of the ship, the adaptation and use of carbon intensity indicators (CII) used by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to evaluate the impact of shipping, and the strategy considering the capacities of the ship to obtain and provide electric power from and to the port when at berth. Results show that the strategy can be applied to any ship with a high demand for electric power while at berth, and that the adaptation and use of different CIIs allows operational profiles of electric power generation on board to be optimized and to reduce emission generation, which affects port community health. © 2020 by the authors.

The implementation of small-scale nature-based solutions (NBS) such as bio(swales), green roofs, and green walls requires the involvement and enthusiasm of multiple stakeholders. This paper discusses how online citizen science platforms can stimulate stakeholder engagement and promote NBS, which is illustrated with the case of ClimateScan. Three main concerns related to online platforms are addressed: the period of relevance of the platform, the lack of knowledge about the inclusiveness and characteristics of the contributors, and the ability of sustaining a well-functioning community with limited resources. ClimateScan has adopted a “bottom–up” approach in which users have much freedom to create and update content. Within six years, this has resulted in an illustrated map with over 5000 NBS projects around the globe and an average of more than 100 visitors a day. However, points of concern are identified regarding the data quality and the aspect of community-building. Although the numbers of users are rising, only a few users have remained involved. Learning from these remaining top users and their motivations, we draw general lessons and make suggestions for stimulating long-term engagement on online knowledge-sharing platforms. © 2020 by the authors.

As a case-study, six regions across Canada were used, spanning 11°32′ latitude and 58°30′ longitude. Annual average air temperatures ranged from 3.9 °C (prairie climate) to 10.5 °C (maritime climate), with an overall average of 6.6 °C. A model predicted Tm over 30 years, using daily weather (1971–2000), and over one “normal” year (30-year average weather). Modelled Tm was then used in Manure-DNDC to model daily CH4 emissions. Two manure storage emptying scenarios were simulated: (i) early spring and autumn, or (ii) late spring and autumn. Regional differences were evident as average Tm ranged from 8.9 °C to 14.6 °C across the six locations. Early removal of stored manure led to warmer Tm in all regions, and the most warming occurred in colder regions. Regional climate had a large effect on CH4 emissions (e.g. 1.8× greater in the pacific maritime and great lakes regions than the prairie region). Inter-annual weather variability led to substantial variation in inter-annual CH4 emissions, with coefficient of variation being as high as 20%. The large inter-annual range suggests that field measurements of CH4 emissions need to compare the weather during measurements to historical normals. Early manure storage emptying reduced CH4 emissions (vs late removal) in some regions but had little effect or the opposite effect in other regions. Overall, the results from this modelling study suggest: i) Tm differs substantially from air temperature at all locations, ii) accurate estimates of manure storage CH4 emissions require region-specific calculations using Tm (e.g. in emission inventories), iii) field measurements of CH4 emissions need to consider weather conditions relative to climate normal, and iv) emission mitigation practices will require region-specific measurements to determine impacts. © 2020","Climate; Manure; Methane; Region; Storage; Temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Fertilizers; Manures; Coefficient of variation; Emission inventories; Emission mitigation; Great Lakes regions; Modelling studies; Regional differences; Substantial variations; Weather variability; Thulium; methane; air temperature; annual variation; climate modeling; field method; global warming; manure; methane; regional climate; storage; air temperature; Article; autumn; calculation; Canada; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; environmental parameters; latitude; manure; prairie; prediction; priority journal; simulation; spring; warming; weather; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091235101

We apply the fixed-effects dynamic spatial Durbin error model to empirically gauge the magnitude of the spatial impacts and dynamic impacts for a sample of 26 EU countries throughout 1990–2015. By analyzing the empirical results, we conclude that: (1) Compared with dynamic spatial Durbin error model, the traditional dynamic panel model over-estimates the parameters because traditional regression methods only capture the direct impacts, and neglect the indirect impacts. (2) A significant positive spatial spillover of CO2 emissions from neighboring countries to the local country is recognized, justifying the use of our spatial model. (3) Economic growth has positive impacts on CO2 emissions, while the spatial effects of economic growth exert negative impacts. Moreover, the total effects of economic growth are positive in both short-term and long-term. (4) Although the spatial effects of renewable energy are not significant, renewable energy has negative influences on CO2 emissions. (5) The impacts and spatial effects of natural gas are positive; therefore, its total effects are positive in both short-run and long-run.

Using the two-stage dynamic DEA model, we evaluate total efficiency value, two-stage efficiency value, and the efficiencies of energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and crop disaster areas, setting CO2 as the link between the production stage (first stage) and the crop damage stage (second stage). The research findings show that overall efficiency in China is generally low, whereby the total efficiencies of eastern and northeastern China are higher than those of central and western China. The efficiency value of the first stage (production stage) is greater than that of the second stage (crop damage stage), and the efficiency of most administrative regions’ second stage is below 0.3, which is the main reason for the country’s low overall efficiency. There is little difference between China’s CO2 and energy consumption efficiency scores, but the efficiency values of crop disaster areas fluctuate greatly. The efficiency scores of various indicators in the eastern region are generally higher and more balanced, and the total efficiency scores exhibit a decreasing trend from east to west. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the environmental policy of controlling energy consumption and early warning of natural disasters in the central and western regions, and promote the R&D industry and technological innovation of carbon dioxide emission reduction and disaster control in the economically developed eastern regions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural disaster; CO2 emission; Efficiency; Energy consumption; Two-stage dynamic DEA","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; crop damage; emission control; energy use; environmental policy; innovation; natural disaster; China; carbon dioxide; agriculture; China; disaster; economic development; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; China; Disasters; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089995566

In particular, the threat of accelerated sea level rise (SLR) has increasingly gained the attention of the scientific community recently. However, studies investigating the effect of SLR on plants and vertical marsh accretion are usually restricted to the species or community level and do not consider phenotypic plasticity or genetic diversity. To investigate the response of genotypes within the same salt-marsh species to SLR, we used two known genotypes of <i>Elymus athericus</i> (Link) Kerguélen (low-marsh and high-marsh genotypes). In a factorial marsh organ experiment we exposed both genotypes to different flooding frequencies and quantified plant growth parameters. With increasing flooding frequency, the low-marsh genotype showed higher aboveground biomass production compared to the high-marsh genotype. Additionally, the low-marsh genotype generally formed longer rhizomes, shoots and leaves, regardless of flooding frequency. Belowground biomass of both genotypes decreased with increasing flooding frequency. We conclude that the low-marsh genotype is better adapted to higher flooding frequencies through its ability to allocate resources from below-to aboveground biomass. Given the strong control of plant biomass production on salt-marsh accretion, we argue that these findings yield important implications for our understanding of ecosystem resilience to SLR as well as plant species distribution in salt marshes.</p>. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

When these two types of disturbance occur in concert it complicates our ability to accurately predict future forest mortality. The recent extreme California USA drought and bark beetle outbreaks resulted in extensive tree mortality and provides a unique opportunity to examine questions of why some trees die while others survive these co-occurring disturbances. We use plot-level data combined with a three-proxy tree-level approach using radial growth, carbon isotopes, and resin duct metrics to evaluate 1) whether variability in stand structure, tree growth or size, carbon isotope discrimination, or defenses precede mortality, 2) how relationships between these proxies differ for surviving and now-dead trees, and 3) whether generalizable risk factors for tree mortality exist across pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), white fir (Abies concolor), and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) affected by the combination of drought and beetle outbreaks. We find that risk factors associated with mortality differ between species, and that few generalizable patterns exist when bark beetle outbreaks occur in concert with a particularly long, hot drought. We see evidence that both long-term differences in physiology and shorter-term beetle-related selection and variability in defenses influence mortality susceptibility for ponderosa pine, whereas beetle dynamics may play a more prominent role in mortality patterns for white fir and pinyon pine. In contrast, incense cedar mortality appears to be attributable to long-term effects of growth suppression. Risk factors that predispose some trees to drought and beetle-related mortality likely reflect species-specific strategies for dealing with these particular disturbance types. The combined influence of beetles and drought necessitates the consideration of multiple, species-specific risk factors to more accurately model forest mortality in the face of similar extreme events more likely under future climates. © 2020","Carbon isotopes; Climate change; Dendroecology; Resin ducts; Tree growth; Tree mortality","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Drought; Isotopes; Odors; Carbon isotope discrimination; Carbon isotopes; Growth suppressions; Long-term effects; Mortality patterns; Related selections; Species specifics; Stand structures; Forestry; carbon 13; beetle; carbon isotope; climate change; disturbance; drought; environmental factor; extreme event; mortality; pest damage; pest outbreak; risk factor; tree; Abies; Abies concolor; Article; California; Calocedrus decurrens; climate change; drought; mortality rate; nonhuman; pine; Pinus monophylla; plant defense; ponderosa pine; priority journal; Scolytinae; species difference; tree; tree growth; animal; bark; beetle; drought; epidemic; pine; tree; California; United States; Abies concolor; Abies grandis; Calocedrus decurrens; Coleoptera; Pinus edulis; Pinus monophylla; Scolytinae; Animals; Coleoptera; Disease Outbreaks; Droughts; Pinus; Plant Bark; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089691797

Many researchers have focused on the environmental sustainability of rubber plantations, with rubber-legume systems better approach for ameliorating soil environments. This study investigated the effect of introducing Flemingia macrophylla (a leguminous shrub) to different-aged rubber plantations on the emissions of CO2, N2O, and CH4. As trees aged in the rubber plantations, the annual emissions of CO2, N2O, and CH4 significantly decreased. The introduction of F. macrophylla to different-aged rubber plantations significantly decreased CO2 and CH4 flux but increased N2O flux. The CO2 and N2O fluxes were mainly affected by soil temperature at 10 cm depth, and CH4 flux was mainly affected by both soil water content in the 0–10 cm soil layer and soil temperature at 10 cm depth. Compared to the same-aged rubber plantations, annual total CO2 flux of young and mature rubber–F. macrophylla plantations decreased 154,000 and 64000 kg ha−1, CH4 flux decreased 0.50 and 0.78 kg ha−1 (17.0 and 26.5 kg CO2 eq ha−1), and N2O flux increased 0.15 and 0.55 kg ha−1 (44.7 and 163.9 kg CO2 eq ha−1), respectively. The rubber-leguminous shrub systems significantly improved soil organic carbon sequestration rate, relative to the same aged rubber plantations. In conclusion, the emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 decreased as the trees aged in the rubber plantations, and rubber-leguminous shrub systems could mitigate local climate warming by reducing reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improving soil organic sequestration rate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Rubber; Xishuangbanna","Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Rubber; Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Temperature; CO2 fluxes; Environmental sustainability; Local climate; Soil environment; Soil layer; Soil organic carbon sequestration; Soil temperature; Soil water content; Rubber plantations; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; radiocarbon dating; rubber; shrub; soil ecosystem; soil temperature; soil water; soil-vegetation interaction; Carbon Dioxide; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Plantations; Rubber; Systems; Temperature; Flemingia macrophylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092384700

Despite the presence of numerous FIs in Canada, there is still a lack of understanding on their distribution and effectiveness. This review first investigates the FIs available for residential and commercial buildings in Canada, and then performs a comprehensive review of studies related to FIs’ effectiveness evaluation. It is found that FIs for buildings in Canada can be distributed into four categories: tax, loans, grants, and rebates. Among these, rebates from utility providers are the most common and are administered in all provinces. In addition to these, special incentives are available for three end-users (low-income, aboriginal people, landlords and tenants) and for three types of buildings (heritage, non-profit and energy rated). A clear contrast is observed on FIs offered in three regulatory regimes (Federal, provincial and municipal). Four provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec) are leading in green building efforts. The in-depth literature review was also used to develop an understanding on the criteria used in effectiveness evaluation and the factors impacting effectiveness. Based on the findings of different studies on FIs effectiveness, a generic approach for evaluation of FIs is proposed that can help in deploying successful FIs programs. The results of this review are of importance to the policymakers, government authorities, and utilities engaged in designing and improving FIs for energy efficient buildings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Evaluation; Financial incentives; Price-based instruments","Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Planning; Aboriginal peoples; Commercial building; Effectiveness evaluation; Energy efficient building; Energy policy planning; Financial incentives; Government authorities; Literature reviews; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089657899

It is imperative that medical trainees understand the implications of climate change/planetary health on the physical and mental health and well-being of their patients. Medical professionals generally are not trained to consider climate change impacts in patient encounters. Hence, there is a need to train climate-aware providers who will be at the forefront of patient care in managing these current and emerging health impacts. Methods: We created a standardized patient (SP) case enhanced with details of risks and health impacts due to exposure to wildfire smoke. This session was deployed to 11 internal medicine clerkship students as part of a standard OSCE already included in our curriculum to evaluate core clinical and communication skills. Two cohorts, a group activity, and a one-on-one encounter were deployed and followed with a faculty debrief and learner assessments. Results: Students had increased awareness and knowledge of health impacts of climate change and potential actions for adaptation and mitigation. The improvements were statistically significant for the one-on-one cohort (p = .006). Postsimulation comments were favorable; students were more inclined to consider health impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities exacerbated by climate change. Discussion: Students had an increased recognition of climate change as a force impacting their patients' health which should be considered in patient care. This format allowed retention of well established curricular content, but also the inclusion of other crucial emerging issues that will impact public health locally and globally and foster the development of climate-aware health care providers. © 2021 Ramkumar et al.","Adaptation and Mitigation; Asthma; Climate Aware Providers; Climate Change; Objective Structured Clinical Exam; Pulmonary Medicine; Simulation; Standardized Patient","asthma; climate change; curriculum; human; internal medicine; wildfire; Asthma; Climate Change; Curriculum; Humans; Internal Medicine; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099897671

Despite their importance, there are few available VOC measurements in the area. In this paper, we discuss continuous GC-MS measurements of 10 selected VOCs between February (summer in the southern hemisphere) and June (winter in the southern hemisphere) of 2019 in a semi-urban area between natural eucalypt forest and the Sydney metropolitan fringe. Combined, isoprene, methacrolein, methyl-vinyl-ketone, α-pinene, p-cymene, eucalyptol, benzene, toluene xylene and tri-methylbenzene provide a reasonable representation of variability in the total biogenic VOC (BVOC) and anthropogenic VOC (AVOC) loading in the area. Seasonal changes in environmental conditions were reflected in observed BVOC concentrations, with a summer peak of 8 ppb, dropping to approximately 0.1 ppb in winter. Isoprene, and its immediate oxidation products methacrolein (MACR) and methyl-vinyl-ketone (MVK), dominated BVOC concentrations during summer and early autumn, while monoterpenes comprised the larger fraction during winter. Temperature and solar radiation drive most of the seasonal variation observed in BVOCs. Observed levels of isoprene, MACR and MVK in the atmosphere are closely related with variations in temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), but chemistry and meteorology may play a more important role for the monoterpenes. Using a nonlinear model, temperature explains 51% and PAR 38% of the isoprene, MACR and MVK variation. Eucalyptol dominated the observed monoterpene fraction (contributing ~75%), with p-cymene (20%) and α-pinene (5%) also present. AVOCs maintain an average concentration of ~0.4 ppb, with a slight decrease during autumn–winter. The low AVOC concentrations observed indicate a relatively small anthropogenic influence, generally occurring when (rare) northerly winds transport Sydney emissions to the measurement site. The site is influenced by domestic, commercial and vehicle AVOC emissions. Our observed AVOC concentrations can be explained by the seasonal changes in meteorology and the emissions in the area as listed in the NSW emissions inventory and thereby act as an independent validation of this inventory. We conclude that the variations in atmospheric composition observed during the seasons are an important variable to consider when formulating air pollution control policies over Sydney given the influence of biogenic sources during summer, autumn and winter. © 2020 by the authors.

The prime reason for this includes efficient redox abilities and effective space separation along with the migration of photoinduced charge carriers over conventional heterojunction systems. Herein we foreground the stumbling blocks of traditional heterojunction systems and enlighten the generations of Z-scheme photocatalysis originating from liquid-phase to direct Z-scheme photocatalytic systems. We provide substantial criteria and selection aspects of choosing reductive type photocatalysts as a potential aspirant for the Z-scheme photocatalytic system. As Z-scheme photocatalytic systems render effective space separation of photogenerated carriers, active species generation, wide optical absorption and amended redox ability. We focus on comprehensive illustration of all solid-state and direct Z-scheme photocatalysts by coupling reductive type photocatalysts with other semiconductor material and explored their potential for efficacious conversion of solar energy into functional energy. Herein, we aim to provide in-depth and updated criteria for selecting Z-scheme photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, water splitting, and nitrogen fixation.

Despite international attempts to mobilize governments and relevant stakeholders to address disaster risk more holistically, disaster risk reduction and human development remain detached from each other in many countries and communities. This paper explores government practitioners’ views on an integration of disaster risk reduction and human development in the context of floods and droughts in Canada and Australia. The paper draws from a comparative case study analysis involving two Delphi studies and semi-structured interviews with Canadian and Australian practitioners at local, provincial/state, and federal levels. The findings from this study show a dominant view among participants that disaster risk reduction requires a broader engagement with human development systems that is adaptable to local contexts. This includes considerations – such as poverty, health and well-being, climate action, social equity and equality, and human agency – as well as mainstreaming disaster risk information in human development processes and activities. The research identifies mechanisms perceived as being critical to developing integrated approaches, including in effective legislation, policy frameworks, evidence-based decision-making, and cross-sector collaboration. While an integrated approach to disaster risk reduction and human development challenges the political and programmatic complexities for flood and drought risk reduction, approaches to disaster risk governance that reflect the capacities and needs of individuals and vulnerable populations must be developed. © 2021 The Authors","Disaster risk governance; Disaster risk reduction; Drought management; Flood management; Human development; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102151188

This expansion has led to the conversion of carbon-rich land-use types to oil palm plantations with a range of negative environmental impacts, including loss of carbon from aboveground biomass and soil. Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) in existing oil palm plantations is an important strategy to limit carbon losses. The aim of this study was to investigate SOC stocks of oil palm plantations under different management systems. Soil samples were collected from three different management systems (best management practices (BMP), current management practices typical of large plantations (CMP) and smallholder management practices (SHMP)) in north Sumatra, Indonesia. Plantations were divided into four management zones that were sampled separately with four replicate profiles in the weeded circle, frond stack, harvesting path and interrow zones. All the soil samples were collected from five (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–50 and 50–70 cm) soil depths. Soil samples were analysed for concentration of SOC, soil texture, soil bulk density and pH. Calculations of SOC stocks in the soils were undertaken according to the fixed-depth and equivalent soil mass approaches. Results showed that SOC stocks of plantations under BMP (68 t ha−1) were 31% and 18% higher than under CMP (57 t ha−1) and SHMP (46 t ha−1) respectively. In the BMP system, soils under the interrow zone that received enriched mulch and frond stack positions stored significantly more SOC than the harvesting path of the BMP system (77, 73 and 57 t ha−1 respectively). BMP also had a 33% higher fresh fruit bunch yield compared to the SHMP system. This study shows that residue incorporation or retention as a part of BMP could be an effective strategy for increasing SOC stocks of oil palm plantations and confirms that these management practices could improve yields from SHMP systems. © 2020 The Author(s)","Best management practices; Residue management; Smallholder; SOC stock; Yield","nitrogen; organic carbon; palm oil; carbon; aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; environmental impact; management practice; monoculture; organic carbon; plantation; smallholder; soil carbon; agricultural management; Article; bulk density; controlled study; environmental impact; forest soil; frond; harvesting; Indonesia; plantation; soil acidity; soil compaction; soil fertility; soil texture; agriculture; forest; soil; Greater Sunda Islands; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; Elaeis; Matthiola; Agriculture; Carbon; Forests; Indonesia; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096210667

Heavy metals include a broad spectrum of compounds with very different toxicological effects on human health. However, in the European Union (EU), the current legislation does not consider the specific health effects of each heavy metal. In fact, with the only exception of mercury, the legislation sets an aggregated emission limit value for cadmium and thallium and an aggregated emission limit value for eight metals including total chromium (Cr). This simplification becomes even more critical when considering that total Cr includes hexavalent Cr (Cr VI), whose cancer potency is higher than other metals by &gt; 2 orders of magnitude. The aim of this paper is to highlight and solve this critical legislation gap, and propose an innovative way to manage the emissions of Cr VI at the stack of waste incinerators. By analyzing the case study of a waste gasifier, the paper demonstrates that Cr VI to total Cr ratios higher than 10% may contribute to more than 95% of the total cancer risk in the nearby territory. In the view of cleaner strategies for energy production and waste management, a Cr VI concentration limit value of 0.005 mg/Nm3 at the stack level could be assumed in a first discussion phase to reduce the potential impacts from WtE plants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Cancer risk; Chromium VI; Emissions; Environmental health; Environmental legislation","Diseases; Emission control; Heavy metals; Laws and legislation; Waste management; Concentration limits; Emission limit values; Energy productions; Hexavalent chromium; Orders of magnitude; Potential impacts; Toxicological effects; Waste-to-energy plants; Chromium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089498682

Although transdisciplinary approaches in the “blue carbon” discourse and collaborative actions are gaining momentum in the international and national arenas, more work is still needed at the local level. The study pursues how BCE initiatives permeate through the local communities in the Philippines and Indonesia, as part of CTR. Using perception surveys, the coastal residents from Busuanga, Philippines, and Kari-munjawa, Indonesia were interviewed on their awareness, utilization, perceived threats, and management strategies for BCEs. Potential factors affecting residents’ perceptions were explored using multivariate regression and correlation analyses. Also, a comparative analysis was done to deter-mine distinctions and commonalities in perceptions as influenced by site‐specific scenarios. Results show that, despite respondents presenting relatively high awareness of BCE services, levels of utilization are low with 42.9–92.9% and 23.4–85.1% respondents in Busuanga and Karimunjawa, re-spectively, not directly utilizing BCE resources. Regression analysis showed that respondents’ oc-cupation significantly influenced their utilization rate and observed opposite correlations in Busuanga (positive) and Karimunjawa (negative). Perceived threats are found to be driven by per-sonal experiences—occurrence of natural disasters in Busuanga whereas discerned anthropogenic activities (i.e., land‐use conversion) in Karimunjawa. Meanwhile, recognized management strategies are influenced by the strong presence of relevant agencies like non‐government and people’s organizations in Busuanga and the local government in Karimunjawa.

However, the process has been rarely studied, which limits its comprehensive understanding. We applied the CMAQ model to study the contributions and mechanisms of pNO3 transport during autumn in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), a metropolitan region under the growing influence of cross-regional transport on PM2.5 pollution. Results showed that cross-regional transport contributed to 58% pNO3 monthly in the PRD, and this mostly occurred as indirect transport contributions (accounting for 43% among all contributions). For the first time, we identified the mechanism of indirect pNO3 transport in the PRD, which mainly involves transported O3 and locally emitted NOx reacting to produce pNO3 through N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis. pNO3 contributions in different periods and regions indicated differences in the indirect transport contributions to N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis under varying O3 availability conditions, which are determined by wind fields and the intensity of NOx emissions. On the regional scale, the pNO3 level is controlled by both transported O3 and local NOx emissions, but pNO3 sensitivity to these two precursors varies among cities. This study demonstrates the notable effect and complex process of cross-regional pNO3 transport in the PRD. Considering the important role of transported O3 for pNO3, O3 reduction within a larger scale is required to achieve PM2.5 pollution control target. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Contributions; Cross-regional transport; Mechanism; Pearl River Delta; PM2.5 nitrate","Hydrolysis; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Complex Processes; Metropolitan regions; Pearl River delta; PM2.5 nitrate; Pm2.5 pollutions; Regional scale; Regional transport; Transport contributions; River pollution; nitrate; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution control; article; China; city; hydrolysis; particulate matter 2.5; pollution control; river; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091747941

Design/methodology/approach: After agricultural GHG accounting and a pre-analysis of inter-provincial heterogeneity, improved gravity model and the Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods are introduced to construct the network, being carried out from three aspects of the whole network, individual provincial characteristics and cluster analysis. Findings: (1) There are significant regional variations in agricultural GHG scale among provinces owing to the layout of agricultural production, and the temporal trends show that the direction and speed of agricultural GHG scale change vary among provinces; (2) In terms of inter-provincial correlations, there exists a complex spatial network of agricultural GHG among provinces, which tends to be more complex, intensive and stable, while the status of the provinces in the network also has gradually become more balanced. All provinces played their respective roles in the four clusters of the network with agricultural layout and comparative advantages, and the distribution has continuously optimized. Practical implications: The inter-provincial network characteristics of agricultural GHG emissions and its evolution have practical implications for differentiated and coordinated agricultural GHG reduction policies at the provincial levels. Originality/value: This paper innovatively study inter-provincial agricultural GHG correlations in China with the SNA methods used to study economic and social connections in the past. There is some originality in the introduction of network theory and application of the SNA methods, which can provide some reference for researches in similar fields. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agricultural GHG emissions; Inter-provincial heterogeneity; Inter-provincial spatial correlations; Social network analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094142040

We used a global climate model (GCM) to investigate the impact on atmospheric chemistry from a change to the contemporary DMS flux to that which has been projected for the late 21st century. The perturbed simulation corresponded to conditions that pertained to a tripling of equivalent CO2 , which was estimated to occur by year 2090 based on current worst-case greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The changes in zonal mean DMS flux were applied to 50°S–70°S Antarctic (ANT) and 65°N–80°N Arctic (ARC) regions. The results indicate that there are clearly different impacts after perturbation in the southern and northern polar regions. Most quantities related to the sulfur cycle show a higher increase in ANT. However, most sulfur compounds have higher peaks in ARC. The perturbation in DMS flux leads to an increase of atmospheric DMS of about 45% in ANT and 33.6% in ARC. The sulfur dioxide (SO2) vertical integral increases around 43% in ANT and 7.5% in ARC. Sulfate (SO4) vertical integral increases by 17% in ANT and increases around 6% in ARC. Sulfur emissions increases by 21% in ANT and increases by 9.7% in ARC. However, oxidation of DMS by OH increases by 38.2% in ARC and by 15.17% in ANT. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) increases by 4% in the ARC and by 17.5% in the ANT, and increases by 22.8% in austral summer. The importance of the perturbation of the biogenic source to future aerosol burden in polar regions leads to a cooling in surface temperature of 1 K in the ANT and 0.8 K in the ARC. Generally, polar regions in the Antarctic Ocean will have a higher off setting effect on warming after DMS flux perturbation. © 2021, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","dimethylsulfide (DMS); DMS sea-to-air flux; global climate model (GCM); perturbation; polar region; sulfur dioxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102390615

The results show that tandem heterojunctions formed by the Z-Scheme heterojunction between CdS QDs and KPW and the type-II heterojunction between CdS QDs and meso-g-C3N4 can extend the optical response into visible light region. Importantly, under visible light irradiation, photocatalytic hydrogen production rate and photocatalytic Cr6+ removal rate over CdS/KPW/meso-g-C3N4 is higher than that of KPW and CdS/KPW.

However, the current research on room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mainly focuses on fixed molecular conformation, such as that in single crystals and rigid hosts. Herein, by linking the phenothiazine moiety with nitrogen heterocycles, we constructed four phenothiazine derivates having planar structure in the ground state. In the excited state, a large conformation relaxation occurs to give a dynamically tunable fluorescence and phosphorescence by the extent of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). In systems with a reduced ICT character, multiple emissions consisting of fluorescence and phosphorescence were observed and a white light emission was obtained in the amorphous film state. When increasing the ICT, strong spin mixing between the singlet and triplet occurs in the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state, which is favorable for a short triplet lifetime. The emission of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or short RTP depends on the allowance or forbidden of fluorescence in the twisted excited state conformation. This work demonstrates the adjustment of the singlet and triplet emission behaviors through controlling the extent of TICT and provides an insight into the relationship between the molecular conformation and triplet exciton dynamics for future applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Amorphous films; Charge transfer; Fluorescence; Ground state; Insecticides; Phosphorescence; Intramolecular charge transfers; Molecular conformation; Nitrogen heterocycles; Phenothiazine moiety; Room temperature phosphorescence; Thermally activated delayed fluorescences; Twisted intra-molecular charge transfers; White light emission; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100490112

However, implementation of effective policies is not straightforward, while one may even argue that the policy goal is by far not ambitious enough. Hence, it is useful to look at experiences of other countries that have gone through a similar process. In this paper, the authors explicitly consider the case of European Union's (EU’s) policies aimed at greening agriculture. The choice for the EU is motivated by the fact that the EU is about 35 years ahead of China in implementing a policy agenda to counter the problems China is facing now. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors focus on agricultural inputs, in particular fertilizer and pesticides, as well as land use and their impact on food safety, air and water quality, soil degradation, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and biodiversity. Policies related to those issues are discussed for both, China and the EU. Given that implementation and monitoring are critical for the success of policies, the authors also discuss how policies are implemented and monitored under different governance and institutional conditions. Findings: From the EU experiences, positive and negative, three central lessons are drawn: (1) China should strive for cross compliance but in two steps. In the first step, arrangements for on-farm monitoring must be made, coupled with a pilot program of cross-compliance conditions for large farms in selected counties; in the second step, cross-compliance requirements must be introduced for all farmers, with additional funds for rural development in vulnerable areas. (2) Strong stakeholder commitment should be sought in the formulation as well as implementation of greening policies. (3) Monitoring of greening results should be harmonized and standardized across the country, with a limited number of indicators. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the policy discussion by comparing the agricultural greening measures in the EU (which was some 35 years ago in the same situation as China now) with the measures taken in China so far. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CAP reform; China’s Agricultural Reform; Greening agriculture; Pollution control; Rural development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091047450

Mechanical strength, volume deformation, and mass change of PC-CG blends were examined after different durations of sulfate solution immersion. On the other hand, the microstructure deterioration mechanism was determined using X-ray diffraction (QXRD/Rietveld), thermogravimetry differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP), scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements. Experimental results showed that accelerated carbonation improved the initial compressive strength before sulfate attack and alleviated the compressive strength loss with exposure to sulfate solution. The final compressive strength of carbonated specimens containing 0% or 10% coal gangue after 6 months of sulfate exposure retained 6.55% or 3.61% higher than those of the corresponding control mixtures before sulfate attack. In addition, the final compressive strength reduction of all carbonated specimens is much lower than those of the control specimens (8.69%∼34.19% VS. 12.93%∼47.52%).

In this study, we used the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model and a source-oriented version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to quantify the contributions from different sectors and regions to PM2.5 for the SCB in 2015. The annual PM2.5 concentrations in the 18 SCB urban centers (i.e., the central urban areas) are 42–112 μg m−3, much higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline (10 μg m−3) and having 20–86, 6–17, and 6–10 μg m−3 due to SCB, non-SCB, and unidentified emissions, respectively. Non-SCB emissions can contribute up to 87 μg m−3 to 24-h PM2.5 concentrations for an urban center. Industrial and residential activities are the largest sectors for annual PM2.5 concentrations in the urban centers, and each of them contributes ~25%–50%.

Based on this mechanism, in the well-designed topological photonic structure containing a resonant plasmon nanoantenna, an obvious absorption reduction in the spontaneous emission spectra appears due to the near-field deformation around the antenna induced by the edge state. Because a plasmon antenna with ultrasmall mode volume provides large Purcell enhancement and simultaneously the photonic crystal guides almost all scattering light into its edge state, the rate of nonscattering single photons reaches more than 104γ0. This topological state-led mode coupling mechanism and induced absorption reduction, which arebased on topological protection, will have a profound effect on the study of composite topological photonic structures and related micro- and nanoscale cavity quantum electrodynamics. Also, nonscattering large Purcell enhancement will provide practical use for on-chip quantum light sources, such as single-photon sources and nanolasers. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,"Antennas; Composite structures; Electrodynamics; Emission spectroscopy; Light; Light sources; Particle beams; Photons; Spontaneous emission; Topology; Induced absorption; Local field distribution; Localized surface plasmon; Nanoscale cavities; Photonic structure; Single-photon source; Spontaneous emission spectrum; Topological state; Surface plasmons; article; crystal; light",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099814557

However, wind energy resources are vulnerable to climate change, which might have a huge impact on the area under consideration. In this research, we used the wind speed data obtained from the seven coupled global climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to quantitatively analyze the differences in wind energy resource (WER) between the future and the historical period, geared toward understanding the impact of climate change on wind energy sources. Relevant results show that the future WER would decreases below 20% in the region south of the Northwest Passage, while would significantly increase in the north region of 72°N (specifically in the Beaufort Sea). Further, reports predict that by the end of the 21st century, if no interventions are made to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, the northern region's WER would increase even more with some grid points exceeding 30% and have a significant growth trend, but at the same time the intra-annual variability in these region would also increase significantly with some grid points exceeding 140% of that in the historical period. Moreover, the maximum wind speed values would encounter a noteworthy increase of up to 20%, which will bring great challenge to the development of wind energy in these region. Although the current models still have great uncertainties in the future climate prediction, our work still has certain guiding significance for the future development of wind energy over the Northwest Passage. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CMIP6; future change; Northwest Passage; wind energy resource","Climate models; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Wind; Wind power; Climate projection; Coupled global climate model; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Guiding significances; Intra-annual variability; Maximum wind speed; Use of renewable energies; Wind energy sources; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096778284

Using a sample of 33 industries in 30 provinces in China from 2009 to 2016 with a difference-in-difference-in-difference model (DDD) and a series of robustness tests, we find evidence of a significant positive influence of a carbon trading pilot policy on the low-carbon international competitiveness of industries covered by the pilot programs. Research on its influencing mechanism reveals that a carbon trading pilot policy promotes the low-carbon international competitiveness of industries by driving low-carbon technological progress. Furthermore, a heterogeneity analysis of industry characteristics and carbon allowance allocation methods in different pilots indicates that the impact of a carbon trading pilot policy on industry low-carbon international competitiveness is reflected mainly in industries with low-carbon emissions, high state-owned capital, and high export intensity. Compared with the grandfather method and the historical intensity method, the low-carbon international competitiveness of an industry is significantly increased when the benchmarking method is used.

Using the province-level panel data during the 2008–2016 period. we employ the DID model to compare carbon emissions and economic development between the ETS and non-ETS regions and between the pre- and post-ETS periods. Some novel empirical findings emerge. First, compared with the non-ETS areas, the ETS policy has significantly reduced carbon emission in the ETS areas. This emission reduction has not come at the cost of economic development. Second, the ETS policy leads to a decline in carbon intensity and fossil fuel energy consumption relative to all energy types. Lastly, some heterogeneity across markets arise.

Here, we studied the effect of biochar addition on CH4 emissions, and the abundance and community composition of methanogens and methanotrophs over two rice cultivation seasons. The experiment had the following five treatments: control (CK), chemical fertilizer application only (BC0), and 0.5% (w/w) (BC1), 1% (BC2), and 2% of biochar applied with chemical fertilizers (BC3). The season-wide CH4 emissions were decreased (P &lt; 0.05) by 22.2–95.7% in biochar application compared with BC0 in the two rice seasons (2017 and 2018). In 2017, biochar application decreased methanogenic archaea (mcrA) but increased methanotrophic bacteria (pmoA) abundances, and decreased the ratio of mcrA/pmoA, as compared with BC0 (P &lt; 0.05). In 2018, the abundance of mcrA was lower in BC2 and BC3 than in BC0 (P &lt; 0.05) but was not different between BC0 and BC1, and the abundance of pmoA was lower in BC1, BC2 and BC3 than in BC0 (P &lt; 0.05).

China is starting an energy transition with the aim of building an energy system for the future. China has made tremendous progress in increasing the amount of renewable energy and reducing the cost of renewable energy over the last 20 years. According to the 14th 5 year plan, China aims to incorporate 20% of renewable energy to the primary energy mix and attain 27% reduction in CO2 emissions. Bioenergy crops constitute a significant proportion of biomass-based bioenergy and have recently been promoted by the Chinese Government to help overcome food and fuel conflict. Steps are being taken to promote bioenergy crops on marginal lands in China, and various regions across the country with soil marginality have been evaluated for bioenergy crop cultivation. The present paper reviews the status of bioenergy in China and the potential status of marginal lands from different regions of China. It also elaborates on some of the policies, subsidies and incentives allocated by the Chinese Government for the promotion of biomass-based energy. Land management and plant improvement strategies were discussed, which are effective in making marginal lands suitable for bioenergy crop cultivation. Managing planting strategies, intercropping and crop rotation are effective management practices used in China for the utilization of marginal lands. A national investigation is desirable for creating an inventory of technical and economic potential of biomass feedstocks that could be planted on marginal lands. This would assist with highlighting the pros and cons of using marginal lands for bioenergy production and effective policy making. © 2020 The Authors.

Bio-CNG and bio-LNG fuels are considered a valid solutions for freight, and the European biomethane sector displays an interesting production potential, supported by a growing demand. A key asset for sector deployment is represented by an appropriate refuelling infrastructure. To promote alternative fuels in the EU, Member States have been adopting national policy frameworks (NPFs), setting targets for 2020–2030. This work aims to investigate how bottlenecks, such as infrastructure fragmentation, can hamper the diffusion of alternative fuels. The NPFs analysis reveals divergent countries' expectations for natural gas in transport, leading to a possible infrastructure fragmentation. Pushing biomethane to decarbonise transport requires a careful assessment: while it can potentially reduce GHG emissions, it can also trigger fugitive emissions, e.g. through gas transport and combustion, thus compromising the advantages. Additionally, current high costs can restrain a larger diffusion of this alternative fuel. This study highlights the need of a policy perspective aiming to target a synchronised deployment of CNG and LNG vehicles, related refuelling infrastructure and bio-CNG/LNG production. This is paramount to prevent the infrastructure from becoming a barrier to the development of biomethane, at least as in the short-to medium-term. © 2020 The AuthorsThe views expressed here are purely those of the authors and may not, under any circumstances, be regarded as an official position of the European Commission. © 2020 The Authors","Biogas; Biomethane; CNG; LNG; Refuelling infrastructure","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Biogas upgrading; Energy sector; European Commission; Fugitive emissions; Gas transport; GHG emission; Growing demand; National policy framework; Alternative fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098617905

Despite the vulnerability of freshwater habitats to human impacts, most climate change projections have focused on terrestrial systems. Here, we examined how the current distributions and biodiversity of stream taxa might change under mitigated, stabilizing and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Location: Conterminous USA. Time period: Present day to 2070. Major taxa studied: Stream diatoms, insects and fish. Methods: We developed species distribution models for 336 freshwater taxa from 1,227 distinct stream localities using water chemistry, watershed and climatic variables. Models based only on climate were used to project changes in the distributions and biodiversity of cold- versus warm-water taxa under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) ranging from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. Results: In all three organismal groups, climate emerged as the strongest predictor of species distributions, providing comparable explanatory power to water chemistry and watershed variables combined. The RCP-based projections suggested a widespread expansion of warm-water taxa, outpacing the decline of cold-water taxa. Consequently, overall species richness would increase, but beta diversity would decrease drastically with the severity of climate change. A closer look at individual taxa and functional guilds revealed that vulnerable cold-water taxa included: (a) diatom guilds forming the base and bulk of the biofilm; (b) environmentally sensitive insects, characteristic of unimpacted streams; and (c) ecologically and recreationally important salmonids, which were forecast to diminish dramatically in source habitats. Warm-water fish projected to increase their distributions include bait bucket release minnows and dominant predators. Main conclusions: Our results suggest potentially devastating impacts of climate change on stream ecosystems, with the restructuring of diatom, insect and fish communities, diminished distributions of functionally important taxa and widespread expansion of warm-water taxa, giving rise to biotic homogenization. Given that the magnitude of these biotic shifts depends on the severity of climate change, appropriate current policy decisions are necessary to preserve freshwater ecosystems. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aquatic insects; beta diversity; biodiversity; biotic homogenization; climate change; diatoms; fish; representative concentration pathways; species distribution models","aquatic organism; biodiversity; biotic factor; climate change; diatom; ecological modeling; fish; freshwater ecosystem; insect; spatial distribution; stream; United States; Bacillariophyta; Cyprinidae; Hexapoda; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092642502

This phenomenon incurred increased amounts of teleworking and time spent at home, fewer trips to shops, closure of retail outlets selling non-essential goods, and the near disappearance of leisure and recreational activities. This paper presents a novel method for an economy-wide estimate of the emissions reductions caused by the restriction of movement. Using a global multiregional macro-economic model complemented by Google Community Mobility Reports (CMRs) and national transport data, we cover 129 individual countries and quantify direct and indirect global emissions reductions of greenhouse gases (GHG; 1173 Mt), PM2.5 (0.23 Mt), SO2 (1.57 Mt), and NOx (3.69 Mt). A statistically significant correlation is observed between cross-country emission reductions and the stringency of mobility restriction policies. Due to the aggregated nature of the CMRs, we develop different scenarios linked to consumption, work, and lifestyle aspects. Global reductions are on the order of 1-3% (GHG), 1-2% (PM2.5), 0.5-2.8% (SO2), and 3-4% (NOx).

This is motivated by questions regarding the relevance of investing in local renewable production (mainly from PV) in a power system dominated by renewable hydropower. Further, it contributes to the existing literature regarding ZENs and ZEBs by highlighting the importance of the choice of the CO2 factor of electricity for the design of ZENs’ energy system. A case study illustrates the impact of those choices on the resulting energy system design using the existing ZENIT model. Three CO2 factors for electricity are used in the case study: a yearly average CO2 factor for Norway (18 gCO2∕kWh), an hourly average CO2 factor for Norway and a yearly average European factor (at 132 gCO2∕kWh). The energy system design of the ZEN is little affected when using hourly CO2-factors compared to yearly average factors, while the European factor leads to less investment in PV. Hourly marginal CO2 emission factors are also investigated using three accounting methods. There large differences in energy system design and emissions depending on where the factor is applied. The price of external compensation is varied between 0–2000 €/tonCO2. A lower price of external CO2 compensations mainly reduces the amount of PV investment. Allowing the purchase of CO2 compensations at 250 €/tonCO2 could reduce the total costs by more than 10%. © 2020 The Authors","Electricity emission factor; Energy system design; Low carbon buildings; Net zero emission","Air pollution; Investments; Purchasing; Systems analysis; Accounting methods; CO2 emissions; Energy system design; Energy systems; Local renewable; Zero emission; Carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; design; electricity generation; emissions trading; environmental economics; hydroelectric power; photovoltaic system; pollution tax; residential energy; targeting; willingness to pay; Europe; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095411715

Satellite derived data showed a substantial increase in the extent of the alien Nelumbo nucifera, and Ludwigia hexapetala, and the native Trapa natans over a timescale of decades, possibly caused by the temporary absence of macrophyte removal and altered hydrology. According to spectral proxies, N. nucifera recorded consistently the highest density in the system.

Several studies have shown that storage operation can increase emissions even if the storage has 100% turnaround efficiency. Furthermore, previous studies have relied on national-level data and given very little attention to the impacts of storage on emissions at local scales. This is an important omission, as carbon intensities can vary very significantly at sub-national scales. We introduce a novel approach to calculating regional marginal emissions factors, based on a validated power system model and regression analysis. The techniques are used to investigate the impacts of storage operation on CO2 emissions in Great Britain in 2019, under a range of operating scenarios. It is found that there are significant regional differences in storage emissions factors, with storage tending to increase emissions when used for wind balancing in areas with little wind curtailment. In contrast, the greatest emissions reductions are achieved when charging storage with otherwise-curtailed renewables and discharging to reduce peak demands in areas consuming high volumes of fossil fuel power. Over all regions and operating modes studied, the difference between the highest reduction in emissions and the highest increase in emissions is considerable, at 741 gCO2 per kWh discharged. We conclude that power system regulators should pay increased attention to the impact of storage operation on system CO2 emissions. © 2020","Demand side response; Emissions factors; Energy storage; Regional emissions; Renewables integration","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Carbon intensity; Electricity storages; Emissions factors; Emissions reduction; Operating modes; Power system model; Regional differences; Storage operations; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity generation; emission control; energy storage; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; regression analysis; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096686041

The goal is to facilitate the communication on climate information between climate modelling communities and adaptation or mitigation initiatives from vulnerable countries that are applying for funds from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). A participatory process was ensured during four workshops in four pilot countries, with an audience of national and international experts. During this process it was made clear that in all countries there is a strong need for knowledge in climate science, while in most countries there was also an increasing need of capacity in hydrological modelling and water management. The active interaction during the workshops was found necessary to facilitate the dialogue between service developers and users. Understanding the users, transparency on potentials and limitations of climate services together with capacity development in climate science and methods were required components in the development of the service. © 2021 by the authors.

The RGR, a measure of fitness, drives population dynamics and shapes lichens’ large-scale distributions. In a climate change scenario, we need to know how external (macro- and microclimate, and nitrogen deposition) and internal factors (cortical pigments, chlorophyll and specimen size) affect RGR in these ecologically important canopy organisms. We used dominant pendulous hair lichens widely distributed across the boreal biome to test the hypothesis that precipitation drives RGR of pale (Alectoria sarmentosa, Usnea dasopoga) and dark species Bryoria fuscescensdifferently across a large-scale gradient from continental to oceanic climates (precipitation: 450–2,600 mm) in Scandinavia (60–64°N, 5–19°E). After transplanting lichens to lower branches of Picea abies in nine boreal forest sites for 1 year, we used linear mixed effects models to analyse how total precipitation, rainfall, number of days with rain, temperature sum, nitrogen deposition, light, chlorophyll a (an indicator of photosynthetic capacity) and size influenced their RGR. RGR was highest in the pale species (Alectoria and Usnea) and increased with amount and frequency of precipitation, with >3 times higher RGR in the wettest compared to the driest site. The number of days with rain was a better predictor of RGR than total precipitation or rain. By contrast, RGR of the dark Bryoria weakly increased with precipitation. RGR in all species increased with light and decreased with size. Chlorophyll a concentration, boosted by moderate nitrogen deposition, increased RGR of all species. In conclusion, rainfall likely drives the distribution of the pale species due to their higher RGR and abundance in wet climates but cannot explain why Bryoria dominates drier inland forests. Our results highlight that the functional links between rainfall and RGR depends on both colour of the lichens (pale vs. dark pigments) and water storage traits. Synthesis. Our findings may explain the global, regional and local distribution patterns of hair lichens and help us to predict how environmental hazards such as climate change and forestry influence these important boreal canopy components. © 2020 The Authors.

To achieve this objective, we measured a suite of physical, biotic and inorganic proxies of a lacustrine sequence. In general, between ~4130 to ~2640 cal yr BP proxy records reveal climate variability following a typical pattern of the northern hemispheric climate and appear to be dominated by westerlies. Thereafter, the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) forcing appears to dominate regional climate. The former period appears to have experienced human presence as evidenced by an invasive species of diatom –Didymosphenia and charcoal, likely originating from human activities on trading routes with Central Asia, China and Tibet. After ~2640 cal yr BP, when ISM started governing the climate of the Ladakh- Karakoram region, it probably induced high-frequency climate variability leading to disasters related to landslides, debris flows, avalanches etc., eventually reducing the intra-boundary trade.

Under a constant forcing, this feedback becomes less negative (increasing) over time in comprehensive climate models, which has been attributed to increases in cloud and lapse-rate feedbacks. However, out of eight Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) not featuring interactive clouds, two also simulate such a feedback increase: Bern3D-LPX and LOVECLIM. Using these two models, we investigate the causes of the global-mean feedback increase in the absence of cloud feedbacks. In both models, the increase is predominantly driven by processes in the Southern Ocean region. In LOVECLIM, the global-mean increase is mainly due to a local longwave feedback increase in that region, which can be attributed to lapse-rate changes. It is enhanced by the slow atmospheric warming above the Southern Ocean, which is delayed due to regional ocean heat uptake. In Bern3D-LPX, this delayed regional warming is the main driver of the global-mean feedback increase. It acts on a near-constant local feedback pattern mainly determined by the sea ice-albedo feedback. The global-mean feedback increase is limited by the availability of sea ice: faster Southern Ocean sea ice melting due to either stronger forcing or higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) reduces the increase of the global mean feedback in Bern3D-LPX. In the highest-ECS simulation with 4 3 CO2 forcing, the feedback even becomes more negative (decreasing) over time. This reduced ice-albedo feedback due to sea ice depletion is a plausible mechanism for a decreasing feedback also in high-forcing simulations of other models. © 2020 American Meteorological Society","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Climate models; Climate prediction; Coupled models; Energy transport; Sea ice","Carbon dioxide; Oceanography; Sea ice; Solar radiation; Atmospheric warming; Climate sensitivity; CO2 concentration; Earth system model; Ice albedo feedback; Intermediate complexity; Ocean heat uptake; Plausible mechanisms; Climate models; air-sea interaction; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; climate prediction; complexity; global climate; sea ice; sensitivity analysis; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099655741

De-carbonising our entire civilisation will come at a great cost and requires vast amounts of knowledge, initiative and innovation; yet, no matter how much time or money is spent, some sectors simply cannot be de-carbonised without the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. The technical challenges associated with the removal of CO2 are not universal – there exists no single solution. Capturing the CO2 on solid sorbents has been gaining traction in recent years given its cost-effectiveness as a result of its ease of application, relatively small energy requirements and applicability in a wide range of processes. Even with the myriad materials such as zeolites, carbons, metal organic frameworks, mesoporous silicas and polymers, the challenge to identify a sorbent with optimal capacity, kinetics, selectivity, stability and ultimately, viability, still persists. By tailoring these solid materials through comprehensive campaigns of surface modification, the pitfalls of each can be mollified and the strengths enhanced. This highly specific tailoring must be well informed so as to understand the mechanisms by which the CO2 is adsorbed, the surface chemistry that has influence on this process, and what methods exist to facilitate the improvement of this. This review endeavours to identify the surface functional groups that interact with the CO2 molecules during adsorption and the methods by which these functional groups can be introduced. It also provides a comprehensive review of the recent attempts and advancements made within the scientific community in the experimental applications of such methods to enhance CO2 capture via adsorption processes.

To predict the effect of plant emissions on air quality and potential feedback effects on climate, the study of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions under stress is of great importance. Trees can often be subject to a combination of abiotic stresses, for example due to drought or ozone. Even though there is a large body of knowledge on individual stress factors, the effects of combined stressors are not much explored. This study aimed to investigate changes of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions and physiological parameters in Quercus robur L. during moderate to severe drought in combination with ozone stress. Results: show that isoprene emissions decreased while monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions increased during the progression of drought. We exposed plants with daily ozone concentrations of 100 ppb for 1 h for 7 d, which resulted in faster stomatal closure (e.g., a mean value of -31.3 % at an average stem water potential of -1 MPa), partially mitigating drought stress effects. Evidence of this was found in enhanced green leaf volatiles in trees without ozone fumigation, indicating cellular damage. In addition we observed an enhancement in (C8H8O3)H+ emissions likely corresponding to methyl-salicylate in trees with ozone treatment. Individual plant stress factors are not necessarily additive, and atmospheric models should implement stress feedback loops to study regional-scale effects. © Author(s) 2021.",,"biogenic emission; biogenic material; climate change; deciduous tree; drought stress; ozone; physiological response; prediction; terpene; volatile organic compound; Quercus robur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100080533

Plant heat tolerances are phenotypically plastic and thus common garden experiments are needed to test if species from hotter environments have consistently higher heat tolerance than species from colder environments. Past studies that have measured heat tolerance from species grown in common gardens have found conflicting relationships between species' climatic origins and their heat tolerance, possibly due to phylogenetic non-independence of study species. In this study, we test the hypothesis that phylogenetic structure can help to explain variation in heat tolerance in order to resolve the confliciting relationships between climate and plant heat tolerance. Location: Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and the Gifford Arboretum, Miami, FL, USA. Taxon: Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. Methods: We tested for phylogenetic signal in the photosynthetic heat tolerance of 123 species of ferns, gymnosperms, magnoliids, monocots and eudicots by calculating Blomberg's K. Phylogenetic independent contrasts of heat tolerance and climatic distributions for >100 species were used to test the hypothesis that climate can predict variation in heat tolerance. Results: Species' heat tolerances were not phylogenetically conserved according to Blomberg's K, but we found significant differences in the heat tolerance of ferns, gymnosperms, magnoliids, monocots and eudicots. When controlling for phylogenetic non-independence, we found a significant, but weak relationship between the mean maximum temperature of the warmest month of species' climatic distributions and their photosynthetic heat tolerance. Main conclusions: We conclude that phylogeny and climate are weak predictors of photosynthetic heat tolerance.

This study evaluates the sensitivity of simulated maize and soybean production from the CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean modules of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to daily solar radiation estimates obtained from traditional (stochastic, empirical, and mechanistic models) and non-traditional (satellite estimation, reanalysis datasets, and regional climate model simula-tions) approaches, using as an example radiation estimates for Hancock, Wisconsin, USA. When compared to observations, radiation estimates obtained from empirical and mechanistic models and a satellite-based dataset generally had smaller biases than other approaches. Daily solar radiation estimates from a reanalysis dataset and regional climate model simulations overestimate incoming daily solar radiation. When the radiation estimates were used as an input to CERES-Maize, no significant differences were found for maize yield obtained from the different radiation estimates compared to yield from observed radiation, even though differences were found in the daily values of leaf area index, crop evapotranspiration, and crop dry weight (biomass). In contrast, significant differences were found in simulated soybean yield from CROPGRO-Soybean for the majority of the radiation estimates. © 2020 by the authors.

The baseline experiments without ARF with all three PBL schemes can reproduce the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of surface PM2.5 on the whole and show that the model can capture the PM2.5 variation better in unstable conditions (clean days) than in stable conditions (pollution days). The three PBL schemes show differences in the simulations of meteorological factors, e.g., the MRF scheme produces the best 10-m wind speed, the MYJ scheme produces the best 2-m temperature, and the YSU scheme produces the lowest PBL height (PBLH) and vertical diffusivity. Consequently, there is no significant difference among the three PBL schemes in surface PM2.5 simulations due to the combined action of the surface and the PBL structure. However, all the baseline experiments massively underestimate PM2.5 during severe pollution days. The online computing of ARF in the three PBL schemes can substantially improve the underestimation of PM2.5 by reducing sensible heat fluxes, 2-m temperature, friction velocity, and the PBL height. More importantly, the response intensity of three PBL schemes to ARF is very different. For PM2.5 simulations, MYJ has the weakest response, whereas MRF and YSU have similar responses. During the heavy pollution days with more intense aerosol-radiation effect, the increase of PM2.5 induced by ARF in MRF and YSU is about twice that in MYJ, making the PM2.5 simulated by MRF and YSU more consistent with the observations. This result shows the ARF dependence on the PBL processes and suggests the importance of PBL-ARF interaction to the PM2.5 numerical prediction during haze episodes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol-radiation-PBL interaction; Atmosphere chemical model; Meteorological elements; PBL scheme; PM2.5","Aerosols; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric chemistry; Forecasting; Magnetorheological fluids; Pollution; Wind; Medium range forecast; Meteorological factors; Numerical experiments; Numerical predictions; Planetary boundary layers; Spatial and temporal distribution; Unstable conditions; Vertical diffusivity; Simulation platform; aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; computer simulation; haze; particulate matter; sensible heat flux; solar radiation; weather forecasting; wind velocity; China; Jingjinji; Vitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091917384

The operating conditions include different temperatures, relative humidities, and particle states. However, typical filter testing conditions do not strictly regulate the aforementioned parameters; hence there is always a discrepancy between the lab filter testing and the actual operating conditions. Air filter loading results are valuable to predict the filter life, whereas it could be affected by testing conditions. In this study, the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the air filter loading by hygroscopic salts were studied. Potassium chloride, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium nitrate are used to represent the dry solid particles and wet particles in the atmosphere. The testing temperature covers from 5 ℃ to 50 ℃ and the testing RH covers from 30% to 75%. Importantly, the absolute humidity is considered in this study, which depends on both temperature and RH. Besides the experiments, the possible reasons that could affect the filter loading were also discussed. Based on the experiment results and theories discussed, it could be concluded that the testing RH is a major factor while the testing temperature is a minor factor, which affects the hygroscopic particle filter loading, regardless of the particle state (dry/wet). This article not only suggests the need of revising current filter testing standards by considering the air filter operating temperature and relative humidity but also offers an insight into how the atmospheric particles hygroscopicity can be linked with ambient particulate matter mitigation technologies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air filter loading; Hygroscopic salt; Relative humidity; Temperature","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Chlorine compounds; Nitrogen compounds; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Potash; Potassium chloride; Salts; Sulfur compounds; Ambient particulate Matter; Atmospheric particles; Control technologies; Effects of temperature; Hygroscopic particles; Operating condition; Operating temperature; Testing temperature; Air filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090575850

The subject of this research was to assess the level of provision of five selected ecosystem functions (climate regulation and regulation of short water cycle, biomass production, oxygen production, and carbon sequestration) and biodiversity by relevant groups of forest habitats, and their mutual comparison. Assessment of ecosystem functions was performed in biophysical units based on published data, our own research, and expert knowledge. The results showed the high importance of floodplain forests. In the majority of the services that were studied, this habitat reached high values and, in comparison with the other habitats, took one of the leading positions. When comparing the ranking in the provision of individual ecosystem functions per unit area, the best-assessed habitat in all assessed functions was floodplain and wetland forests, followed by ravine forests and beech forests, but the analysis of the rate of ecosystem function provision, related to the total area of interest, showed a different order of values. Understanding the context of the individual ecosystem functions of natural ecosystems and those close to nature, in comparison with anthropogenically altered ecosystems is a suggested route for ecologically and economically balanced landscape decision-making, which may increase the efficiency of nature and landscape protection. © 2021 by the authors.

Considering the significant amount of conducted research and development on RCCI concept, the majority of the work has been performed under steady-state conditions. However, most thermal propulsion systems in transportation applications require operation under transient conditions. In the RCCI concept, it is crucial to investigate transient behavior over entire load conditions in order to minimize the engine-out emissions and meet new real driving emissions (RDE) legislation. This would help further close the gap between steady-state and transient operation in order to implement the RCCI concept into mass production. This work provides a comprehensive review of the performance and emissions analyses of the RCCI engines with the consideration of transient effects and vehicular applications. For this purpose, various simulation and experimental studies have been reviewed implementing different control strategies like control-oriented models particularly in dual-mode operating conditions. In addition, the application of the RCCI strategy in hybrid electric vehicle platforms using renewable fuels is also discussed. The discussion of the present review paper provides important insights for future research on the RCCI concept as a commercially viable energy conversion strategy for automotive applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Control; Emissions; Hybrid vehicles; Performance; Reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI); Transient behavior","Conversion efficiency; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Propulsion; Automotive applications; Compression ignition engine; Control oriented models; In-cylinder combustion; Performance and emissions; Research and development; Steady state and transients; Steady-state condition; Diesel engines; alternative energy; combustion; compression; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; nitrogen oxides; research and development; soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095999454

At the same time, confronting the cause of climate change - reducing greenhouse gas emissions - offers health and financial benefits, especially by reducing chronic diseases. First, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) more than seven million people die prematurely every year from air pollution. Therefore, departing from fossil fuel-based energy can save millions of lives. Second, a diet with less red meat (particularly in wealthy countries) will both mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduce saturated fat and the risk of cardiac disease. And third, over five million people are dying annually from lack of exercise due to a growing trend in sedentary lifestyles - caused in large part by overreliance on motorized transportation. Thus, opportunities abound to enhance physical fitness through smart urban design that promotes safe, low-carbon, “active” transportation (via walking and biking) that will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, depression and colon, and breast cancer. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

PM2.5, NO2, and O3 as one of the influencing factors for the increased rate of fatality. However, most of these studies lacked a comprehensive international outlook. A strong correlation on a regional scale might require further investigations to evaluate the transboundary validity. Therefore, the current study aims to explore the statistical soundness of association of COVID-19 fatality with PM2.5, NO2, and O3 concentration levels across 463 air quality monitoring stations located in 35 selected cities from USA, India and European Regions (France, Germany and Italy). An aggregated open-source air quality data source was used to download the PM2.5, NO2, and O3 concentration for &gt; 900 days in the selected cities. The median of this long-term exposure was tested against the COVID-19 fatality rates. A strength of association parameter, ω2, and the coefficient of determination, R2, were used to evaluate the transboundary association. ω2 results indicated that only 24.6%, 0.03% and 15.4% of the variation in COVID-19 fatality rates could be explained using PM2.5, NO2, and O3 concentrations respectively for all the analyzed cities. Further, low values of R2 between pollutant concentrations and COVID-19 fatality rates corroborated the results (0.27 for PM2.5, 0.00038 for NO2 and 0.18 for O3). These observations strongly suggest a focal shift towards the inclusion of more explanatory variables and an extensive multi-disciplinary work is required in order to understand the cause of COVID-19 fatality. © The Author(s).","Air quality; COVID-19; Fatality rate","Air quality; Air quality monitoring stations; Coefficient of determination; Concentration levels; Explanatory variables; Long term exposure; Pollutant concentration; Statistical evidence; Strong correlation; Nitrogen oxides; air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; pollution exposure; statistical analysis; urban pollution; Europe; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100510762

However, more fundamental knowledge is required to understand how nutrient turnover in wetlands is affected. In this study, we deployed a mechanistic biogeochemical model of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) cycles at 0.25◦ × 0.25◦ spatial resolution across wetlands in Australia. Our modeling was used to assess nutrient inputs to soil, elemental nutrient fluxes across the soil organic and mineral pools, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different climatic areas. In the decade 2008–2017, we estimated an average annual emission of 5.12 Tg-CH4, 90.89 Tg-CO2, and 2.34 × 10−2 Tg-N2O. Temperate wetlands in Australia have three times more N2O emissions than tropical wetlands as a result of fertilization, despite similar total area extension. Tasmania wetlands have the highest areal GHG emission rates. C fluxes in soil depend strongly on hydroclimatic factors; they are mainly controlled by anaerobic respiration in temperate and tropical regions and by aerobic respiration in arid regions. In contrast, N and S fluxes are mostly governed by plant uptake regardless of the region and season. The new knowledge from this study may help design conservation and adaptation plans to climate change and better protect the Australian wetland ecosystem. © 2020 by the authors.

These ontological assumptions are not necessarily shared by communities that are targeted for implementing projects developed under such agendas. This article provides an ethnographic account of the tensions around a REDD+ Pilot Project and a Save the Forest conservation program in Central Suau, Papua New Guinea. Despite efforts by project proponents to conduct 'awareness' on the programs to local communities, people feared these interventions as attempts to steal their air and land to sell to other countries. The study shows that differing assumptions of reality between project proponents and communities are related to the politics of translation that are embedded in past histories of colonisation, missionisation, and ongoing resource extraction. The ensuing disagreements highlight failures to mediate ontological intersections, which are manifested in local fears of new forms of power and external appropriation of their land and air through global environmental governance mechanisms. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The recent integration of dynamic crop growth in the Noah land surface model with multiparameterization (Noah-MP-Crop) has the potential to substantially advance Earth system modeling and is included in the latest release of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model. The addition of dynamic crop growth to WRF provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously evaluate biases associated with a crop model coupled to a regional climate model and address outstanding questions regarding the role of agroecosystems in modulating regional climate. Here, we analyze dynamic crop growth in WRF across three simulated spatial scales (25km, 5km, and 1km) for growing seasons with precipitation above (2010), below (2012), and approximately equal (2015) to the seasonal average. Including dynamic crop growth in WRF significantly reduces biases in simulated leaf area index over croplands in the central U.S. relative to observations. However, there is no substantial difference in calculated daily evapotranspiration, average growing season temperature, or total growing season precipitation between WRF simulations with dynamic crops (WRF-Crop) compared to the dynamic vegetation module without crops (WRF-DV). Simulated corn (soy) mean absolute error (MAE), as a percentage of observed annual average yield, ranges from 24.7% -101% (28.1% - 109%) depending on year and spatial resolution, with the most significant biases in highly irrigated counties. Forcing Noah-MP-Crop with observed climate substantially reduces the range of corn (soy) yield MAE to 9.5% - 55.1% (15.0% - 37.5). Increased model resolution consistently leads to lower corn and soy yield estimates within WRF-Crop. © 2020","Agriculture; Crop model; Land-atmosphere interactions; Regional climate model","climate modeling; crop yield; growing season; growth; land-atmosphere interaction; maize; regional climate; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095706702

However, there is a high possibility that surface cover increases export of dissolved organic C (DOC) though relevant field studies under natural rainfall are lacking. In this study, the effects of surface cover with rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw on soil and CNP losses in both dissolved and sediment-bound forms from maize (Zea mays L.) fields were investigated under two fertilization levels (standard and double) × two types of runoff experiments (natural rainfall and artificial irrigation). Changes in soil properties including moisture, temperature, nutrients, and C concentration as well as maize yield were also examined. Surface cover decreased soil and total CNP losses by up to 82% across the experimental plots with some exceptions. However, surface cover increased DOC export in both natural (by 68–82% in total across all events) and artificial (by 3–4 fold) runoff, suggesting that crop residue cover may act as a DOC pollution source of water bodies. The contribution of rice straw to DOC, which was calculated using the δ13C of DOC from covered plots (−24.1 to −28.0‰) and control plots (−19.6 to −25.1‰), was 52.5–95.8%. The concentrations of K2SO4-extractable and microbial biomass C of the soils did not differ between covered and control plots, suggesting that DOC produced from rice straw was not incorporated into the soils, but rather, was washed out with surface runoff in this study. Surface cover increased maize growth and yield, particularly in double fertilization plots, through improved soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient conditions. To take full advantage of surface cover with crop residue, a further study on reducing DOC loss from crop residue needs to be conducted. © 2020","Crop residue; Soil erosion; Stable carbon isotope; Surface cover; Surface runoff","Agricultural wastes; Crops; Dissolution; Erosion; Nutrients; Potash; Rain; Runoff; Soil moisture; Water pollution; Dissolved organic C; Experimental plots; Maize (Zea mays L.); Microbial biomass c; Natural rainfalls; Nutrient conditions; Pollution sources; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Grain (agricultural product); carbon; carbon 13; dissolved organic matter; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; potassium sulfate; rain; phosphorus; carbon; crop residue; dissolved organic carbon; maize; nitrogen; runoff; soil erosion; stable isotope; upland region; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; crop; decomposition; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); maize; microbial biomass; nutrient; plant growth; priority journal; rice; runoff; sediment; self fertilization; soil erosion; soil moisture; soil property; soil temperature; water pollution; agriculture; maize; Oryza; soil; Oryza sativa; Zea mays; Agriculture; Oryza; Phosphorus; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090241878

The heating degree-day (HDD) method is a powerful tool for anticipating a national climate or annual heating demand for a heating period. The accuracy of the HDD method depends on the accuracy of balance-point temperatures, which represent regional building thermal performance and climate conditions. However, accurate local balance-point temperatures have not been determined for most countries. This paper examines a method of calculating balance-point temperatures based on local building thermal performance and climate. Detailed calculation procedures for heat gains and losses in buildings are described and corresponding issues are discussed. Regional building thermal performance and climate are the main factors involved in the process, which requires appropriate regional balance-point temperatures. To reflect changes in climate, and subsequent policy changes, many countries will require more consideration of regional balance-point temperatures. Balance-point temperatures were revised in Korea as a case study. The colder and the more intense the building insulation standards, the lower the balance-point temperature turned out to be, compared with what the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers recommends. There was a 2 °C difference in balance-point temperature between the coldest and warmest regions in Korea. Insulation standards that demonstrated the greatest impact on balance-point temperature and severity of climate were also not negligible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building-energy policy; Calculation method; HDD (Heating degree-day); Local balance-point temperature; Local building code; Local climate","Air conditioning; Energy policy; Heating; Building energy policies; Building insulations; Building thermal performance; Calculation procedure; Climate condition; Heating degree-days; Heating demand; Policy changes; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089483928

We evaluate the impact of the decline in human activities as a result of social distancing on the urban CO2 concentrations and air quality in Seoul during February and March of 2020 compared to 2019. Due to the reduction in human activity in 2020, local measurements of CO and NO2 show a decrease in background concentration (up to –11.9% and –41.7%, respectively) and urban enhancement (up to –16.7% and –38.1%, respectively) compared to the previous year. In contrast, the background concentration of CO2 increases by 3.9% in 2020. Ratios of CO:CO2 and NO2:CO2 also show a decrease in 2020 compared to the previous year, signaling an improvement in the urban air quality of Seoul. Moreover, the insignificant change in wind speed and wind direction during the months of February and March 2020 compared to 2019 implies that CO2, CO, and NO2 concentrations have not been influenced by meteorological conditions, but mainly by changes in emissions from decreased human activity. Despite the rise in background CO2 concentration, urban contributions of CO2 show a decline of –12.6%, indicating that cities with high emissions have the potential to reduce urban CO2 enhancements and air pollutant concentrations, and ultimately impact the global atmosphere. © The Author(s).","Air quality; COVID-19; Social distancing; Urban emissions","Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Wind; Air pollutant concentrations; Background concentration; CO2 concentration; Local measurement; Meteorological condition; Urban air quality; Urban atmospheres; Urban enhancement; Carbon dioxide; air quality; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); human activity; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; wind direction; wind velocity; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096999869

In this study, we developed a novel method to estimate the contribution of long-range transport (LRT, aerosols are transported from any regions except local area near Seoul) and local pollution (LP, aerosols are originated from local area near Seoul) cases to the PM10 concentration in Seoul, Korea, using the PM10 concentration ratio between surface (PM10S) and mountaintop (PM10M) sites and the lidar-derived mixing layer height. The overall contributions of LRT and LP events to nighttime high-PM10 episodes (PM10 &gt; 50 μg m−3) during the period of May 2008–April 2019 were estimated to be approximately 32% and 47%, respectively. The monthly contribution of LRT events to the PM10 concentration varied from approximately 18% (July) to 43% (January), whereas the contribution of LP events was estimated between 39% (March) and 69% (July); this pattern was associated with seasonal synoptic circulations. The similar PM10S values between the LRT (71 ± 22 μg m−3) and LP (73 ± 26 μg m−3) cases during the nighttime suggest that a reduction in local PM10 emissions is crucial to decrease the PM10 concentration during high-PM10 events. The high PM10S for daytime LRT cases can be explained by the combined effects of increased local emissions and LRT aerosols. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","High-PM10 event; Long-range transport; Mixing layer height; Particulate air pollution; PM10 concentration","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Optical radar; Combined effect; Lidar observation; Local emissions; Local pollutions; Long range transport; Mixing layer height; PM10 concentration; Synoptic circulations; Air pollution; aerosol; concentration (composition); emission inventory; haze; lidar; long range transport; particle size; reduction; seasonal variation; urban atmosphere; aerosol; air pollution; article; clinical article; concentration ratio; controlled study; South Korea; particulate matter 10; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089952600

We propose a simple analysis framework to examine critical intersections between land-management choices and the life-history conditions of selected species of concern, thereby facilitating the identification of mitigation practices that can reduce negative impacts on species at risk. We test the proposed framework through application to gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a keystone species that is the focus of conservation efforts across the southeastern region of United States of America, where wood pellets are being produced for bioenergy. Production of these wood pellets for export to Europe and Asia has drastically increased in the past decade, raising concerns about potential harm to biodiversity since many species in the forests sourcing pellet production were already at risk prior to the development of this new commodity. Identifying the mechanisms of potential impacts of wood pellet production on species of concern is essential to establishing meaningful management recommendations that can enhance conservation efforts while supporting sustainable bioenergy. By considering the intersections between life-history conditions of gopher tortoise and forest-management practices related to woody biomass extraction for pellet production, we identify several mechanisms by which the wood-pellet industry might affect this species of concern, both positively and negatively. We then identify mitigation practices that can help offset the potential impacts of logging, thinning, and dead wood removal on gopher tortoise. Our analysis framework may be transferable to other species of concern and land-management practices across diverse landscapes.

Several studies have explored energy consumption prediction, and the value of the knowledge extracted is directly related to the quality of the data used. The massive growth in the scale of data affects data quality and poses a challenge to traditional data mining methods, as these methods have difficulties coping with such large amounts of data. Expanded algorithms need to be utilized to improve prediction performance considering the ever-increasing large data sets. In this paper, a preprocessing method to remove noisy features is coupled with predication methods to improve the performance of the energy consumption prediction models. The proposed preprocessing method is based on the well-known principal component analysis (PCA) and treats the historical meteorological and energy data of buildings. The cleaned and processed data are used in five prediction models including linear regression, support vector regression, regression tree, random forest and K-nearest neighbors. The proposed methodology is applied to four case studies with different climate zones (cold, mild, warm-dry and hot-humid) to study the effect of dataset patterns on the feature reduction and prediction performance. The results show that the proposed method enables practitioners to efficiently acquire a smart dataset from any big dataset for energy consumption prediction problems.

Through ICT applications, active mobility can be promoted and established as a viable transport mode. This can be achieved by providing relevant information for fostering social capital and promoting physical activity, thus contributing to a higher quality of life. Further, active mobility can greatly contribute to reducing air pollution and improving health status. For this purpose, the implementation of a Smart Pedestrian Network (SPN) information system is proposed. Such an implementation requires the collaboration of various stakeholders including the public, local authorities and local businesses. To convince stakeholders of the viability of implementing SPN, the benefits of active mobility should be clear. This paper proposes a framework to quantify active mobility benefits so that stakeholders can assess the investment that can be realized from implementing SPN.

This has led to a higher water demand and lower air quality. Over the last 3 decades, most of the region has experienced decreasing rainfall during the little dry season (LDS; mid-July to end of August) and more recently also during the second rainy season (SRS; September-October), while trends during the first rainy season (FRS; mid-May to mid-July) are insignificant. Here we analyse spatio-Temporal variations in precipitation, aerosol, radiation, cloud, and visibility observations from surface stations and from space to find indications for a potential contribution of anthropogenic air pollution to these rainfall trends. The proposed mechanism is that the dimming of incoming solar radiation by aerosol extinction contributes to reducing vertical instability and thus convective precipitation. To separate a potential aerosol influence from large-scale climatic drivers, a multilinear-regression model based on sea-surface temperature (SST) indices is used. During both LDS and SRS, weakly statistically significant but accelerating negative rainfall trends unrelated to known climatic factors are found. These are accompanied by a strong increase in pollution over the upstream tropical Atlantic caused by fire aerosol from Central Africa, particularly during the LDS. Over southern West Africa, no long-Term aerosol records are available, inhibiting a direct quantification of the local man-made effect. However, significant decreases in horizontal visibility and incoming surface solar radiation are strong indicators for an increasing aerosol burden, in line with the hypothesized pollution impact on rainfall. The radiation trend is further enhanced by an increase in low-level cloudiness. The large spatial extent of potentially aerosol-related trends during the LDS is consistent with the stronger monsoon flow and less wet deposition during this season. Negligible aerosol impacts during the FRS are likely due to the high degree of convective organization, which makes rainfall less sensitive to surface radiation. The overall coherent picture and the accelerating trends-some of which are concealed by SST effects-should alarm policymakers in West Africa to prevent a further increase in air pollution as this could endanger water supply and food and energy production for a large and growing population. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Results showed that PM2.5, SO2, NO2, NH3, O3 and CO concentrations decreased by 40.9%, 46.0%, 29.0%, 40.6%, 11.0% and 44.4%, respectively. Significant decreases were also observed for NO3− (32.5%), SO42− (52.9%), NH4+ (56.0%), Cl− (64.6%) and K+ (68.2%), on average. Enhanced PM2.5 pollution has changed from sulfate-driven to nitrate-driven. The decrease in SO2 was more significant than NO2 as a response to one reason of the larger decrease in SO42− concentration. The formation of sulfate was dominated by heterogeneous reactions in two heating seasons. Low pH could facilitate more efficient conversion of SO2 to sulfate. Photochemical reactions played a much more important role in the formation of nitrate in the second heating season, especially in the daytime. The major source regions for sulfate and nitrate were identified by back trajectories and the potential source function (PSCF). More nitrate was brought into Beijing when air masses coming from polluted regions in the southwest prevailed in 2017–2018 heating season. Thus, regional joint prevention and control are of great importance in the achievement of an effective reduction in PM2.5 pollution in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical composition; Clean air action; Formation mechanism; Heating season; Regional transport","Ammonia; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical reactions; Pollution control; Sulfur compounds; Aerosol chemistry; Back trajectories; Beijing , China; CO concentrations; Heterogeneous reactions; Pm2.5 pollutions; Potential sources; Prevention and controls; Heating; nitrate; sulfate; air; nitric acid derivative; sulfate; action plan; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; heating; particulate matter; pollution effect; aerosol; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; chemical composition; China; heating; measurement; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; season; urban area; water content; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; pollution; Beijing [China]; China; Aerosols; Air; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Heating; Nitrates; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089733815

The dynamics of social forestry in Indonesia are characterized by policies and regulations, but in various regions, people have succeeded in increasing their welfare while making forests sustainable. It was concluded that social forestry builds ecological strategic values that guarantee the sustainability of forest functions managed by the community.

Hu et al. (2018) reported unexpectedly large methane enhancements over South Sudan in these observations. Here we assess methane emissions from the wetlands of South Sudan using 2 years (December 2017-November 2019) of TROPOMI total column methane observations. We estimate annual wetland emissions of 7.4±3.2 Tg yr-1, which agrees with the multiyear GOSAT inversions of Lunt et al. (2019) but is an order of magnitude larger than estimates from wetland process models. This disagreement may be explained by the underestimation (by up to 4 times) of inundation extent by the hydrological schemes used in those models. We investigate the seasonal cycle of the emissions and find the lowest emissions during the June-August season when the process models show the largest emissions. Using satellite-altimetry-based river water height measurements, we infer that this seasonal mismatch is likely due to a seasonal mismatch in inundation extent. In models, inundation extent is controlled by regional precipitation scaled to static wetland extent maps, whereas the actual inundation extent is driven by water inflow from rivers like the White Nile and the Sobat. We find the lowest emissions in the highest precipitation and lowest temperature season (June-August, JJA) when models estimate large emissions. In general, our emission estimates show better agreement in terms of both seasonal cycle and annual mean with model estimates that use a stronger temperature dependence. This suggests that temperature might be a stronger control for the South Sudan wetlands emissions than currently assumed by models. Our findings demonstrate the use of satellite instruments for quantifying emissions from inaccessible and uncertain tropical wetlands, providing clues for the improvement of process models and thereby improving our understanding of the currently uncertain contribution of wetlands to the global methane budget. © Author(s) 2021.",,"carbon budget; carbon emission; emission control; GOSAT; methane; precipitation assessment; satellite data; seasonality; temperature effect; wetland; Sudan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100106741

We used a mixed method approach, which included 479 household surveys, eight city water forums and 16 interviews with the city-level water stakeholders and users in the two case study cities. We found that impacts of climate change and haphazard urbanization in supply side and increased population, and changing lifestyle patterns and socioeconomic practices in demand side are constantly putting pressures on water resources and urban water security.

It is important to elucidate this impact for the states of India. Methods: We estimated exposure to ambient particulate matter pollution, household air pollution, and ambient ozone pollution, and their attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. We estimated the economic impact of air pollution as the cost of lost output due to premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution for every state of India, using the cost-of-illness method. Findings: 1·67 million (95% uncertainty interval 1·42–1·92) deaths were attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, accounting for 17·8% (15·8–19·5) of the total deaths in the country. The majority of these deaths were from ambient particulate matter pollution (0·98 million [0·77–1·19]) and household air pollution (0·61 million [0·39–0·86]). The death rate due to household air pollution decreased by 64·2% (52·2–74·2) from 1990 to 2019, while that due to ambient particulate matter pollution increased by 115·3% (28·3–344·4) and that due to ambient ozone pollution increased by 139·2% (96·5–195·8). Lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution accounted for economic losses of US$28·8 billion (21·4–37·4) and $8·0 billion (5·9–10·3), respectively, in India in 2019. This total loss of $36·8 billion (27·4–47·7) was 1·36% of India's gross domestic product (GDP). The economic loss as a proportion of the state GDP varied 3·2 times between the states, ranging from 0·67% (0·47–0·91) to 2·15% (1·60–2·77), and was highest in the low per-capita GDP states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. Delhi had the highest per-capita economic loss due to air pollution, followed by Haryana in 2019, with 5·4 times variation across all states. Interpretation: The high burden of death and disease due to air pollution and its associated substantial adverse economic impact from loss of output could impede India's aspiration to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024. Successful reduction of air pollution in India through state-specific strategies would lead to substantial benefits for both the health of the population and the economy.

This study reports change in air quality and its impact on the environment during the unique lockdown scenario at Bhubaneswar, a coastal smart city in east India. The urban air shows a remarkable reduction in the mean pollutant levels influenced by traffic emission viz. NOx (~ 67 %) and BC (~ 47 %) during lockdown over the pre-lockdown. Comparatively, a lower reduction of CO (~ 14 %) is attributed to the dominance of natural atmospheric chemical regulation and biogenic sources in addition to anthropogenic contributions. In addition to the lockdown, frequent rain events due to depression in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) also had a significant role in the reduction of the primary pollutants over the study site. An enhancement of secondary pollutant viz. O3 (~ 3%) with a distinct diurnal pattern was observed during the first phase of lockdown over the pre-lockdown period. An anti-correlation between O3 and NOx during pre-lockdown points to a higher O3 production potential with decreasing NOx. While a reduction in the titration of O3 due to suppression of fresh NO emissions led to accumulation of O3 in the first phase of lockdown, inhibited photochemistry due to cloudy skies as well as reduction in precursors led to lower O3 values during the later phases of lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; BC; CO; Lockdown; NOx; O3","air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; nitric oxide; ozone; smart city; traffic emission; urban pollution; Bay of Bengal; Bhubaneswar; India; Indian Ocean; Odisha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089784993

Data manipulation should be deterred, while developing countries are generally weaker than developed countries in compiling bottom-up CO2 emission inventories due to less adequate data collection capacity. This paper assesses the capabilities of CO2 satellites as objective, independent, potentially low-cost and external data sources for monitoring energy-related anthropogenic CO2 emissions at regional/national, megacity and point-source geographical scales. After overviewing all major CO2 satellites, SCIAMACHY, GOSAT and OCO-2 are focused on due to their wider research applications and higher CO2 sensitivity in total column measurements that include near surface emissions. Nighttime light satellite data for proxy CO2 monitoring are also brought into comparison to distinguish the importance of direct CO2 satellite monitoring. Studies are reviewed from the perspectives of spatial and temporal capability and accuracy to comprehend the current statuses of applications, assess the strengths and weaknesses of research methods, investigate major challenges and propose suggestions for future progress. We conclude that CO2 satellite monitoring can strengthen the data foundation for implementing international climate treaties and domestic climate policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy and governance; Enforcement and compliance monitoring; GOSAT; OCO-2; Remote sensing; SCIAMACHY","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; emission inventory; environmental policy; GOSAT; governance approach; megacity; policy implementation; satellite data; climate change; controlled study; environmental monitoring; human; measurement; measurement accuracy; microclimate; Review; climate; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Environmental Monitoring",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092031720

The phase analysis results indicate that WO2.72 undergoes different reaction paths to form tungsten carbide in different temperature ranges. Especially, when the reaction temperature is in the range of 900-950 °C, the reaction process follows the following reaction route: WO2.72 → WO2 → W2C → WC, while no W2C is produced in the reported literatures. XPS and TEM results show that solid carbon can be formed by the decomposition of carbon monoxide in both high- and low-temperature regions. The reaction process from WO2.72 to WO2 or W mainly depends on the gas-solid heterogeneous reaction in the initial stage. In the deep reduction or carbonization stage, both gas-solid heterogeneous reaction and solid-phase homogeneous reaction are included in the lower temperature region, while the formation of WC mainly depends on the homogeneous reaction between solid carbon and metallic tungsten in the higher temperature region. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon monoxide; Carbonization; Fluidized bed process; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Tungsten carbide; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Heterogeneous reactions; Homogeneous reaction; Low temperature regions; Lower temperatures; Reaction temperature; Temperature range; Temperature regions; Thermo dynamic analysis; Fluidized beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100099005

Agricultural canals are artificial, widespread elements in irrigated floodplains, and regularly subjected to water level fluctuations. The aim of this study was to quantify the CO2 emissions along water saturation gradients in artificial canals to understand the environmental factors regulating these fluxes. CO2 measurements were performed in five replicated canals within the Po River basin (Northern Italy). In each canal we analysed three sites: (i) a spot with exposed, dry sediments; (ii) a spot with inundated, saturated sediments and (iii) a spot with an intermediate level of saturation. Besides dark CO2 flux measurements, net potential nitrification and denitrification rates were measured as proxies of sediment redox potential and due to their CO2 sink and source role, respectively. We hypothesized a site-specific regulation of CO2 emission, depending on the interplay among water saturation, sediment oxidation and organic matter content. Our results suggest that desiccation stimulates mineralization processes and CO2 fluxes, that were mainly dependant on water and organic matter content and correlated with microbial N transformations. CO2 emissions tended to increase along the considered water saturation gradients, almost tripling rates from inundated, saturated (158.2 ± 24.1 mmol CO2 m−2 days−1) to dry, exposed sediments (416.5 ± 78.9 mmol CO2 m−2 days−1). Results also suggest that net potential nitrification and denitrification allow tracing the effects of drying on N microbial communities involved in CO2 fluxes. Net potential nitrification rates produce little effects on CO2 fluxes, but is a good proxy of oxygen (O2) availability, whereas potential denitrification may be responsible for variable fractions (up to 100%) of CO2 production, in wetter sediments. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agricultural canals; Air-exposed sediments; CO2 emission; Net potential nitrification; Potential denitrification","biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; dark; environmental factor; floodplain; irrigation; metabolism; mineralization; nitrification; organic carbon; saturation; sediment chemistry; Italy; Po Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100115136

It is an EU plan for the transition to zero greenhouse gas emissions. The overall data analyses of GHG emissions per capita and GDP value in different EU countries show that the GDP increase in 2010-2017 has not increased GHG emissions. Therefore, the link between the GDP increase through energy resource usage increase has been eliminated. However, not all of the EU 27 member states contributed to the overall EU green policy equally. The article presents the methodology for the energy and environmental performance status analyses by evaluating nine different indicators (share of renewable energy, greenhouse gases per GDP, energy intensity, primary efficiency, industry efficiency, energy consumption in households, space heating efficiency, pollutant emissions from transport and specific energy consumption of transport sector) for EU member states. Indicators have been tested through correlation analyses. The use of multidimensional Energy and climate policy indicator has been proposed to rank the performance of different EU countries. The results show that the countries with the highest score in climate and energy indicator values are Sweden, Denmark, Latvia, Austria, Finland, Ireland, and Lithuania.

Exposure to PAHs can encourage biodegradation, which can improve the performance of capping. This study investigates biodegradation of naphthalene (a model PAH) in highly reducing, sediment-like environments with amendment of different capping materials (PAC and sand). Microcosms were prepared with sediment enrichments, sulfate as an electron acceptor, and naphthalene. Results show that PAC stimulates naphthalene biodegradation and mineralization, as indicated by production of 14CO2 from radiolabeled naphthalene. Mineralization in PAC systems correlates with the enrichment of genera (Geobacter and Desulfovirga) previously identified to biodegrade naphthalene (Spearman's, p &lt; 0.05). Naphthalene decay in sand and media-free systems was not linked to biodegradation activity (ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05), and microbial communities were correlated to biomass yields rather than metabolites. Naphthalene decay in PAC systems consists of three stages with respect to time: latent (0–88 days), exponential decay (88–210 days), and inactive (210–480 days). This study shows that PAC amendment enhances naphthalene biodegradation under strictly sulfate-reducing conditions and provides a kinetic and metagenomic characterization of systems demonstrating naphthalene decay. © 2020 Elsevier LtdOur results provide a better understanding of the influence of capping materials on the biodegradation potential of indigenous microbial communities and show that PAC promotes biomineralization under conditions where biodegradation would otherwise not be observed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradation; Capping; PAC; PAH; Sediments; Sulfate-reduction","Activated carbon; Biodegradation; Biomineralization; Metabolites; Microorganisms; Mineralogy; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Biodegradation potentials; Exponential decays; Microbial communities; Naphthalene biodegradation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Powdered activated carbon; Sediment enrichments; Sulfate-reducing conditions; Naphthalene; activated carbon; naphthalene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfate; charcoal; naphthalene derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfate; activated carbon; biodegradation; capping; concentration (composition); naphthalene; PAH; pollution exposure; sediment pollution; abiotic stress; analysis of variance; Article; bioavailability; biodegradation; biodiversity; bioremediation; Deltaproteobacteria; Desulfobacteraceae; Desulfovibrio; ecosystem restoration; environmental enrichment; environmental management; Geobacter; hydrophobicity; metagenomics; microcosm; mineralization; radioactivity; radiolabeling; species richness; powder; Desulfovirga; Geobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Charcoal; Naphthalenes; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Powders; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092416844

Although reservoir operation is a potential adaptation option, earlier studies explicitly demonstrated only its historical quantitative effects. Therefore, this article evaluated the possibility of reservoir operation from an adaptation viewpoint for regulating the future flow using the H08 global hydrological model with the Chao Phraya River basin as a case study. This basin is the largest river system in Thailand and has often been affected by extreme weather challenges in the past. Future climate scenarios were constructed from the bias-corrected outputs of three general circulation models from 2080 to 2099 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The important conclusions that can be drawn from this study are as follows: (i) the operation of existing and hypothetical (i.e., construction under planning) reservoirs cannot reduce the future high flows below the channel carrying capacity, although it can increase low flows in the basin. This indicates that changes in the magnitude of future high flow due to climate change are likely to be larger than those achieved by reservoir operation and there is a need for other adaptation options. (ii) A combination of reservoir operation and afforestation was considered as an adaptation strategy, but the magnitude of the discharge reduction in the wet season was still smaller than the increase caused by warming. This further signifies the necessity of combining other structural, as well as non-structural, measures. Overall, this adaptation approach for assessing the effect of reservoir operation in reducing the climate change impacts using H08 model can be applied not only in the study area but also in other places where climate change signals are robust. © 2020 The Authors.

Countries engage in science diplomacy to access and promote knowledge, as well as influence public opinion. Despite the rising interest in science diplomacy, there is very little research on how science diplomacy can be utilized to tackle global challenges such as climate change. This paper aims to bring developing countries in front and show how science and technology cooperation among developing countries and between developing and developed countries can address climate change problems. Looking from a science and technology policy lens and highlighting the difference between science diplomacy and epistemic communities, we investigate structured government attempts in initiating cooperation toward specific ends. This paper looks at five cases: Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER), Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) Program, bilateral cooperation between Germany and China on electromobility, Islamic Development Bank (IDB) Reverse Linkage program, and The China South–South Climate Cooperation Fund. Then it builds a taxonomy on how science diplomacy is used in climate change mitigation and adaptation and attempts to make a synthesis of the cases. We argue that there is room for developing countries in international knowledge management if science diplomacy tools are properly designed and managed to take context-specific nature of countries into account. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; developing countries; energy; policy; science diplomacy","climate change; developing world; diplomatic relations; energy policy; international relations; knowledge based system; China; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091244688

Since discovery of high entropy alloys (HEAs) in 2004, the concept of high entropy has been enlarged to ceramic, sulfide, fluoride, and phosphide materials. Correspondingly, their nearly infinite compositional space has been expanded to refractories, lanthanides, and recently platinum group metals (PGMs). Among these types of alloys, PGM-based HEM nanoparticles (HEM-NPs) are of great scientific interest because of the ability to continuously tailor their properties by tuning the ratio of noble to non-noble metal species. Besides, the functional properties of bulk HEAs such as shape memory effect, magnetocaloric, and superconductivity are attracting more and more attentions. In this review, we discuss the progress in the PGM-based HEMs focusing on catalytic performance of nanoparticles and functional properties of bulk materials. We begin with the synthesis of HEM-NPs emphasizing on the ability of alloying immiscible elements into single phase NPs. Then, we summarize the reported catalytic/electrocatalytic applications of HEM-NPs for different types of reactions, including CO2/CO reduction reactions, CO oxidation, methanol oxidation, oxygen reduction reaction and electrochemical water splitting. We present a case-by-case discussion to clarify how various metal species can play distinct role in chemically complex structure of HEM-NPs under different reaction conditions. We further try to give a picture of the current state of shape memory, magnetocaloric, and superconductivity effects in the bulk PGM-based HEAs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Functional properties; High entropy materials; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Platinum group metals","Alloying elements; Catalytic oxidation; Electrolytic reduction; Entropy; Fluorine compounds; High-entropy alloys; Magnetocaloric effects; Oxygen reduction reaction; Platinum; Shape memory effect; Sulfur compounds; Catalytic performance; Complex structure; Functional properties; Methanol Oxidation; Platinum group metals; Reaction conditions; Reduction reaction; Water splitting; Metal nanoparticles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090204528

Local policy research acknowledges the role of local agency to develop and implement sustainability, but also acknowledges internal conflicts. This partly reflects tensions between different functions of the local level, and different governance models related to them. In addition, local dependency on higher level competencies, resources, and over-arching strategies is discussed. This article proposes a focus on political processes and power relationships between levels of governance, and among relevant domains within cities, to understand the dynamics of policy change towards sustainability. Researching these dynamics within local climate policy arrangements (LCPAs) is proposed as an approach to understanding the complexities of local constellations and contradictions within them. It makes the distinction between “weak” and “strong” ecological modernization, and relates it to two basic rationales for local governance. The re-sulting typology denotes constellations characterizing policy change ambitions towards local climate policy in crucial domains, including economic development, energy infrastructures, climate change management, town planning and housing, and transportation. This article argues that this approach overcomes the limitations of the predominating conceptualizations of urban carbon control strategies as consistent, and recognises the multi‐level dimension of such internal urban processes. © 2020 by the author.

This is to be achieved through the reuse of existing materials and structures, selection of lower-carbon materials purchased from local sources, installation of renewable energy systems, natural lighting and improved thermal insulation of the building's envelope, as well as developing a carbon offset strategy. The heritage designation of the building imposed restrictions on the design of the project (e.g., preventing insulation of exterior walls). In collaboration with the owner and constructor, the project team completed a life cycle assessment (LCA) consisting of an assessment of embodied emissions of the building's restoration from cradle to grave, accompanied by a scoping estimate of greenhouse gas emissions associated with its future operational energy use. Primary construction data for the newly-added materials, transport, and construction activities were used. Life cycle inventory analysis and impact assessment were implemented in the One Click LCA software. Use phase carbon intensity was estimated using design and literature data. In addition to the ‘core and shell’ LCA scope typically applied to buildings, the team also tracked materials and processes that are often not included in building LCA studies such as HVAC, plumbing, and renewable energy systems. Embodied carbon for the restoration project, assuming a 60-year lifetime, is calculated as 1250 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Sixty-nine percent of the carbon comes from the materials (extraction to manufacturing) used in construction, 20% is due to replacement of materials during the building's service life, and most of the remaining 11% is from on-site construction energy (5%) and waste disposal at end-of-life (4%). The main building elements contributing to the embodied carbon are the renewable energy systems (31%) and the raised concrete floor (26%). Building envelope and foundation play minor roles, as they are mostly pre-existing. The embodied carbon added to the building through the restoration project is forecast to be balanced by savings in operational energy related to heating, cooling and lighting, within 3–13 years, depending on whether natural gas or electricity use are avoided, respectively. Uncertainties in the analysis arise from partial or missing data, modeling assumptions and future scenario unknowns. The model is sensitive to the useable lifetime of the building, local or non-local sourcing of building materials, modeling of certain components used in large quantities, and changes in the recycled content of steel. This study of a net zero carbon refurbishment project of a heritage building provides insights for assessments of future projects as such refurbishments become more commonplace. The methods and recommendations regarding data sources, data collection, and approach to uncertainty evaluation will be useful for LCA of any construction project. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data collection; Embodied carbon; LCA; Net zero carbon; Refurbishment; Sensitivity analysis","Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Lighting; Office buildings; Restoration; Thermal insulation; Uncertainty analysis; Waste disposal; Building restorations; Construction activities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventory analysis; Materials and process; Refurbishment projects; Renewable energy systems; Uncertainty evaluation; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090220223

We conducted a comparative analysis of mineralogical, geochemical, and physicochemical parameters as well as the metal contents (Ca, Fe, Pb, Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu, Cd, Sc, V, Co, and Ba) of environmental components across a 32-km pollution gradient. The mineralogical and chemical composition of soil, snow aerosols, and Sphagnum fallax moss bags all corresponded to the metallogeny of the research area and the ore specialisation of the enterprise (Ni, Cu, Co, and V). Solid aerosols consisted of rock-forming and accessory minerals as well as technogenic formations (slag particles and aggregates composed of Ni–Fe–Co ± Cu). The concentration of metals in soils, aerosols, snow water, and pine bark significantly exceeded their background values. The reconstruction of new technologies in the Severonickel smelter and recent reduction in emissions did not significantly improve the state of the different landscape components. The calculation of dust, metal, and ionic loads from snow surveys and moss bags showed comparable results. Technogenic emissions were higher in summer due to the increase in atmospheric dust. The low pH of soils and snow water reflected the geochemical conditions of the landscape and increased metal mobility in the environment. The high total content of Ni, Cu, and Co and their mobile forms in soils contributed to the high accumulation of metals in pine bark; this method can therefore be used as an accurate indicator of environmental degradation. © 2020","Aerosols; Air pollution; Metals; Mining; Pine bark; Snow water; Soils; Sphagnum fallax moss Bags",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090153925

The transportation sector is indeed one of the leading and most challenging greenhouse gas polluters, and e-mobility is seen as one of the potential solutions; however, a social perspective must be further investigated to improve the perception of and acceptance of electric vehicles. This could consequently lead to the European Green Deal’s holy grail: faster decarbonization of the transportation sector. Another way to achieve it is by promoting more comprehensive sustainable development goals. Therefore, this paper combines a systematic review of recent research with research emphasis focused on social aspects of electric vehicles and their interconnection with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. By knowing the current research focus mainly related with “perception” of electric vehicles and assessing their social “impact” as well as an emerging area of “user experience” and their relations with UN Sustainable Development Goals enables better insight on the current and future directions of electric vehicle social sustainability research. The current priority is identified as “climate actions”. Increasingly important “sustainable cities and communities” shows potential for becoming one of the future research, policy, and community priorities. © 2021 by the authors.

The RE3+ doping concentration was also varied to optimize the red or the green Er3+ emission or the Eu3+ red emission. Phosphors were obtained as high-crystalline and micro-sized particles, yet the doping concentration and the polymerizing agent influence the crystallite size and the lattice strain of the Y2O3 matrix that features optical band gap near to 5.6 eV. Under excitation at 378 nm, the downshifting emissions of Eu3+ and Er3+ are noticed, but under excitation at 463 nm, only the typical Eu3+ emission in the red spectral region is viewed. Contrarily, by exciting the phosphors at 980 nm within the IV spectral region, both green and red emissions of Er3+ plus the red emission of Eu3+ are seen through upconversion emission, and in this case, the pair Er3+/Yb3+ acts as sensitizers to the Eu3+ luminescence. Moreover, the use of sorbitol instead of ethylene glycol in the Pechini's synthesis enhances both downshifting and upconversion luminescence of phosphors due to a lowering of the Eu3+ local microssymmetry played by sorbitol, accordingly to the analyses of Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters of the phosphors. Finally, by varying the doping concentration, the polymerizing agent, and the excitation wavelength, the phosphor emission color may be tuned from the green towards the red spectral region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Luminescence; Photonic; Rare-earths; Spectroscopy; Upconversion","Aliphatic compounds; Crystallite size; Energy gap; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Luminescence; Optical lattices; Particle size analysis; Polymers; Polyols; Complexing agents; Doping concentration; Excitation wavelength; Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters; Micro-sized particles; Pechini's methods; Up-conversion emission; Up-conversion luminescence; Phosphors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091584326

Solar energy as a substitution for fossil fuel-based energy sources has the potential to aid in realizing this sustainable future. This research performs a geographic information systems (GIS)-based assessment of the solar energy potential in the Yangtze River Delta region (YRDR) of China using high-resolution solar radiation data combined with geographical, social, environmental and cultural constraints data. The solar energy potential is evaluated from the geographical and technical perspective, and the results reveal that the YRDR is endowed with rich solar energy resources, with the geographical potential in the suitable areas ranging from 1446 kWh/m2 to 1658 kWh/m2 . It is also estimated that the maximum solar capacity potential could be up to 4140.5 GW, illustrating the high potential available for future capacity development in this region. Realizing this significant potential as an alternative for fossil fuel-based electricity generation would result in a substantial mitigation of CO2 emissions in this region, where air pollution is severe. Potential evaluations found that Jiangsu and Anhui provinces provide the most optimal areas for the development of solar photovoltaics (PV) installations, as they have the highest geographical and technological solar energy potential. Further, findings of the case study undertaken at a solar PV plant show disparities between actual generated power and technical solar potential, highlighting the significance of utilizing solar radiation data from local ground-based meteorological stations. This study provides policy makers and potential investors with information on solar energy potential in the Yangtze River Delta region that would contribute to solar power generation development. © 2020 by the authors.

A case study of an independent microgrid supplied by a solid-oxide fuel cell triple combined-cycle power plant and large-scale photovoltaics is modeled to find the optimal specifications of energy storage and inertial components to provide stable power while maximizing the share of power generated from renewable resources. The combined-cycle generation plant with a fuel cell and turbines increases the inertial constant of the power-generation network so that the network can absorb fluctuations in supply and demand. The numerical model, which considers environmental factors and cost projections, allows designers to find the optimal distribution of fuel supplied to each component of the combined-cycle plant to allow maximum deployment of photovoltaics. In initial tests, the model suggests that the optimal proportion of photovoltaics in the microgrid's generation mix is 19.6%. This model also included energy storage solutions in the form of electric batteries and flywheels. The microgrid is also modeled for deployment in northern Japan's Kitami region, which has relatively high heat demand due to the cold climate. In this case, the acceptable proportion of rated capacity of large-scale photovoltaics is only 14.5% of the microgrid's generation mix. © 2020","Microgrid; Power system control; Power-generation planning; SOFC; Triple combined cycle","Combined cycle power plants; Economics; Electric energy storage; Fuel storage; Microgrids; Numerical models; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Combined cycle plant; Environmental factors; Large-scale photovoltaics; Optimal distributions; Optimal specifications; Renewable energies; Renewable resource; Thermal efficiency; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089216681

The performance of ten passive cooling control strategies was simulated for climatic conditions in two representative cities, Dublin and Budapest. Each strategy used different combinations of passive cooling systems such as day-time ventilation, night-time ventilation and dynamic solar shading. The effect of static and adaptive indoor temperature set-points and a limit on external relative humidity was also investigated. The thermal comfort performance of each strategy was assessed by using standardised thermal comfort, overheating and overcooling metrics. Findings from the study show that passive control strategies maintained comfortable internal conditions between 57% and 95% of the occupied hours, without the need for mechanical cooling. The most resilient strategies were those that combined multiple measures. Passive control strategies were found to be resilient in the medium-term in Dublin, however, the same systems were not able to maintain comfortable conditions in Budapest in 2050. The use of an external relative humidity limit resulted in increases overheating incidences and failure of some overheating criteria. Based on the reductions in mechanical cooling requirements, it was concluded that there is regulatory need to consider the use passive control strategies in the design of buildings. © 2020 The Authors","Control strategies; Extreme weather; Passive cooling; Resilience; Simulation","Cooling systems; Housing; Office buildings; Thermal comfort; Climatic conditions; Comfort performance; Cooling requirements; Design of buildings; Extreme conditions; Night-time ventilation; Operational performance; Residential building; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096829796

We examine whether the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa. Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality. African countries are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change. Our results imply that in order to address differences in the burden of climate change in Africa, a re-evaluation of current policy actions is warranted. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate change policy; Climate justice; Mitigation; Socio-economic inequality; Sustainable development","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Adaptation policies; Climate change adaptation; Climate change policies; Data imputation methods; Food insecurity; Policy actions; Social inequalities; Statistical measures; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089652958

A major roadblock to implementing climate change adaptation measures is poor governance. Given their experience with governing organizations, farmers are highly suitable to assess the appropriateness of different governing organizations to implement adaptation measures on the ground. We surveyed 283 farmers in Makueni County in Kenya applying the choice experiment method to assess their preferences in relation to different attributes of a sand storage dam project – including the organization governing the dam construction. We find that farmers prefer an NGO as the governing organization, followed closely by a farmer network and, with some distance, a government institution. For the whole of Makueni County, we find that benefits of $ 320,426 are lost if farmer networks are the governing organizations instead of NGOs and $ 1,779,596 if government institutions govern the dam construction instead of NGOs. On a methodological level, our study contributes to improving the application of choice experiments in developing countries as it draws attention to the importance of carefully selecting the payment vehicle for successful project implementation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Choice modeling; Climate change adaptation measures; Good governance; Governing organizations; Payment vehicle; Willingness to pay","climate change; dam construction; developing world; discrete choice analysis; experiment; farmers attitude; governance approach; nongovernmental organization; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091954978

This review paper is focused on analysing the challenges and opportunities that are related to green and blue hydrogen, which are at the basis of different perspectives of a potential hydrogen society. While many governments and private companies are putting significant resources on the development of hydrogen technologies, there still remains a high number of unsolved issues, including technical challenges, economic and geopolitical implications. The hydrogen supply chain includes a large number of steps, resulting in additional energy losses, and while much focus is put on hydrogen generation costs, its transport and storage should not be neglected. A low-carbon hydrogen economy offers promising opportunities not only to fight climate change, but also to enhance energy security and develop local industries in many countries. However, to face the huge challenges of a transition towards a zero-carbon energy system, all available technologies should be allowed to contribute based on measurable indicators, which require a strong international consensus based on transparent standards and targets. © 2020 by the authors.

However, if environmental conditions do not support microbial communities performing complete denitrification, other N transformation processes will occur, resulting in the export of nitrite (NO2−), nitrous oxide (N2O), or ammonium (NH4+). To identify the factors controlling the relative accumulation of NO2−, N2O, and/or NH4+ in denitrifying woodchip bioreactors, porewater samples were collected over two operational years from a denitrifying woodchip bioreactor designed for removing NO3− from mine water. Woodchip samples were collected at the end of the operational period. Changes in the abundances of functional genes involved in denitrification, N2O reduction, and dissimilatory NO3− reduction to NH4+ were correlated with porewater chemistry and temperature. Temporal changes in the abundance of the denitrification gene nirS were significantly correlated with increases in porewater N2O concentrations and indicated the preferential selection of incomplete denitrifying pathways ending with N2O. Temperature and the total organic carbon/NO3− ratio were strongly correlated with NH4+ concentrations and inversely correlated with the ratio between denitrification genes and the genes indicative of ammonification (Σnir/nrfA), suggesting an environmental control on NO3− transformations. Overall, our results for a denitrifying woodchip bioreactor operated at hydraulic residence times of 1.0–2.6 d demonstrate the temporal development in the microbial community and indicate an increased potential for N2O emissions with time from the denitrifying woodchip bioreactor. © 2020 The Authors.

A pilot-scale plug-flow reactor was used to mimic thermophilic post-treatment of DDS from a WWTP in Linköping, Sweden. Process operation was evaluated with respect to biogas process performance, using both chemical and microbiological parameters. Initially, the process showed disturbance, with low methane yields and high volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation. However, after initiation of digestate recirculation performance improved and the specific methane production reached 46 mL CH4/g VS. Plug flow conditions were assessed with lithium chloride and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was determined to be 19–29 days, sufficient to reach successful pasteurization. Degradation rate of raw protein was high and resulted in ammonia-nitrogen levels of up to 2.0 g/L and a 30% lower protein content in the digestate as compared to DDS. Microbial analysis suggested a shift in the methane producing pathway, with dominance of syntrophic acetate oxidation and the candidate methanogen family WSA2 by the end of the experiment. Energy balance calculations based on annual DDS production of 10 000 ton/year showed that introduction of high-solid digestion as a post-treatment and pasteurization method would result in a positive energy output of 340 MWh/year. Post-digestion of DDS also decreased residual methane potential (RMP) by&gt;96% compared with fresh DDS. © 2020 The Authors","Ammonia; Digestate post treatment; Dry digestion; Microbial community structure; Residual methane potential","Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Degradation; Dewatering; Grain (agricultural product); Lithium Chloride; Methane; Pasteurization; Proteins; Risk assessment; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Volatile fatty acids; Wastewater treatment; Digested sewage sludge; Energy balance calculations; Hydraulic retention time; Micro-biological parameters; Plug flow conditions; Specific methane production; Syntrophic acetate oxidations; Wastewater treatment plants; Sludge digestion; acetic acid; ammonia; lithium chloride; methane; nitrogen; volatile fatty acid; methane; ammonia; anaerobic digestion; community structure; methane; microbial community; performance assessment; recirculating system; thermophilic bacterium; wastewater treatment; anaerobic digestion; Article; bioaccumulation; chemical parameters; community structure; energy balance; energy yield; experimental study; gas; hydraulic retention time; metabolic rate; methanogen; microbial community; microbiological examination; microbiological parameters; oxidation; pasteurization; priority journal; protein content; protein degradation; risk reduction; sludge digestion; sludge treatment; Sweden; synthesis; thermophilic anaerobic high solid digestion; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; digestion; pasteurization; sewage; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Digestion; Methane; Pasteurization; Sewage; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092114957

Preoperative and postoperative blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and intraoperative pain, anxiety, nausea, and memory were measured immediately after surgery using visual analog scale score (VASS). Additionally, perioperative side effects were examined. There was no significant difference in age, sex, and preoperative and postoperative margin reflex distance (MRD) between the 2 groups (all P &gt; .05). The intraoperative mean peripheral oxygen saturation was significantly higher (97.5% ± 1.6% vs 99.5% ± .6%, P &lt; .001), intraoperative HR was significantly lower (78.2 ± 12.8 vs 70.7 ± 11.6 bpm, P = .02), and operation time was significantly shorter (33.1 ± 8.1 vs 29.4 ± 10.3 minutes, P = .03) in the N2O group than in the air group.

VASS of intraoperative pain was significantly lower in the N2O group than in the air group (49.5 ± 24.7 vs 22.6 ± 14.9, P &lt; .001), whereas intraoperative anxiety and memory did not present significant differences between the groups (P = .09 and P = .45, respectively). Intraoperative nausea score was 0 for all cases in both groups. There was no other side effect.

The wet cooling system is commonly installed on plants located in areas with available water sources, while the dry system is typically preferred in areas where water is scarce. However, owing to the increasing regulations on water conservation, water usage costs and improvements on cooling system designs, a new approach is required for the optimal selection of plant cooling systems, incorporating site climatic conditions, amongst other considerations. This study presents a comparative techno-economic analysis of a steam turbine cycle with wet- and dry- cooling systems for five typical tropical locations in Nigeria with different climatic conditions and water usage costs. The results show that in the hot (ambient temperatures >33 °C) and dry regions (relative humidity <65%) namely Sahel, Sudan, and Guinea savannah, the plant with wet cooling generated more net power outputs with lower life-cycle costs, operating and maintenance costs than with dry cooling. Thus, for these three regions, the wet cooling system is the best option. But for the Tropical Rainforest and Coastal zones with low ambient temperatures (≤31 °C) and high relative humidity values (≥76%), the performance and cost implications of the plant with dry cooling was more favourable due to lower system sizes and costs requirements. Parametric investigations revealed that high ambient temperature increased the size and costs requirements of air-cooled systems while relative humidity significantly influenced the total power consumption of water-cooled systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air-cooled condenser; Climatic regions; Combined cycle power plant; Steam turbine cycle; Techno-economic analysis; Wet cooling tower","Coastal zones; Combined cycle power plants; Cooling towers; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Steam condensers; Steam power plants; Temperature; Thermoelectric equipment; Tropics; Water conservation; Different climatic zones; High relative humidities; Low ambient temperatures; Parametric investigations; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economic comparisons; Total power consumption; Tropical rain forest; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095415022

Diet diversity is especially critical for children as it correlates with macro and micronutrient intake important for child development. Despite these anticipated links, little empirical evidence has demonstrated a relationship between diet diversity and climate change, especially across large datasets spanning multiple global regions and with more recent climate data. Here we use survey data from 19 countries and more than 107 000 children, coupled with 30 years of precipitation and temperature data, to explore the relationship of climate to child diet diversity while controlling for other agroecological, geographic, and socioeconomic factors. We find that higher long-term temperatures are associated with decreases in overall child diet diversity, while higher rainfall in the previous year, compared to the long-term average rainfall, is associated with greater diet diversity. Examining six regions (Asia, Central America, North Africa, South America, Southeast Africa, and West Africa) individually, we find that five have significant reductions in diet diversity associated with higher temperatures while three have significant increases in diet diversity associated with higher precipitation. In West Africa, increasing rainfall appears to counterbalance the effect of rising temperature impacts on diet diversity. In some regions, the statistical effect of climate on diet diversity is comparable to, or greater than, other common development efforts including those focused on education, improved water and toilets, and poverty reduction. These results suggest that warming temperatures and increasing rainfall variability could have profound short- and long-term impacts on child diet diversity, potentially undermining widespread development interventions aimed at improving food security. © 2021 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Child health; Climate change; Malnutrition; Nutritional security","Food supply; Large dataset; Rain; Child development; Long-term impacts; Macro-and micronutrients; Poverty reduction; Rainfall variability; Rising temperatures; Socio-economic factor; Statistical effects; Climate change; agricultural ecosystem; child health; climate effect; dietary intake; empirical analysis; food security; nature-society relations; rainfall; socioeconomic status",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100065951

(55 mmHg) closes Cx26 gap junctions. This effect of CO2 is independent of changes in intra- or extracellular pH. The CO2-dependent closing effect depends on the same residues (K125 and R104) that are required for the CO2-dependent opening of Cx26 hemichannels. Pathological mutations of Cx26 abolish the CO2-dependent closing of the gap junction. Elastic network modelling suggests that the effect of CO2 on Cx26 hemichannels and gap junctions is mediated through changes in the lowest entropy state of the protein. Abstract: Cx26 hemichannels open in response to moderate elevations of CO2 ((Formula presented.) 55 mmHg) via a carbamylation reaction that depends on residues K125 and R104. Here we investigate the action of CO2 on Cx26 gap junctions. Using a dye transfer assay, we found that an elevated (Formula presented.) of 55 mmHg greatly delayed the permeation of a fluorescent glucose analogue (NBDG) between HeLa cells coupled by Cx26 gap junctions. However, the mutations K125R or R104A abolished this effect of CO2. Whole cell recordings demonstrated that elevated CO2 reduced the Cx26 gap junction conductance (median reduction 66.7%, 95% CI, 50.5–100.0%) but had no effect on Cx26K125R or Cx31 gap junctions. CO2 can cause intracellular acidification. Using 30 mm propionate, we found that acidification in the absence of a change in (Formula presented.) caused a median reduction in the gap junction conductance of 41.7% (95% CI, 26.6–53.7%). This effect of propionate was unaffected by the K125R mutation (median reduction 48.1%, 95% CI, 28.0–86.3%). pH-dependent and CO2-dependent closure of the gap junction are thus mechanistically independent. Mutations of Cx26 associated with the keratitis ichthyosis deafness syndrome (N14K, A40V and A88V), in combination with the mutation M151L, also abolished the CO2-dependent gap junction closure. Elastic network modelling suggests that the lowest entropy state when CO2 is bound is the closed configuration for the gap junction but the open state for the hemichannel. The opposing actions of CO2 on Cx26 gap junctions and hemichannels thus depend on the same residues and presumed carbamylation reaction. © 2020 The Authors.

The genomes of n-DAMO archaea show that they have the potential to couple anaerobic oxidation of methane to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). However, physiological details of DNRA for n-DAMO archaea were not reported yet. This work demonstrated n-DAMO archaea coupling the anaerobic oxidation of methane to DNRA, which fueled Anammox in a methane-fed membrane biofilm reactor with nitrate as only electron acceptor. Microelectrode analysis revealed that ammonium accumulated where nitrite built up in the biofilm. Ammonium production and significant upregulation of gene expression for DNRA were detected in suspended n-DAMO culture with nitrite exposure, indicating that nitrite triggered DNRA by n-DAMO archaea. 15N-labeling batch experiments revealed that n-DAMO archaea produced ammonium from nitrate rather than from external nitrite. Localized gradients of nitrite produced by n-DAMO archaea in biofilms induced ammonium production via the DNRA process, which promoted nitrite consumption by Anammox bacteria and in turn helped n-DAMO archaea resist stress from nitrite. As biofilms predominate in various ecosystems, anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled with DNRA could be an important link between the global carbon and nitrogen cycles that should be investigated in future research. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Biofilms; Gene expression; Methane; Microelectrodes; Microorganisms; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Carbon and nitrogen; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction; Membrane biofilm reactor; Methane emissions; Reactive nitrogen; Oxidation; ammonia; methane; nitrate; nitrite; ammonium derivative; methane; nitric acid derivative; ammonium compound; anoxic conditions; biofilm; bioreactor; genome; methane; microbial ecology; nitrate; oxidation; reduction; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; anaerobic metabolism; anammox bacterium; Article; biofilm; controlled study; flocculent sludge; gene expression; microbial community; nonhuman; physiological stress; reduction (chemistry); upregulation; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; denitrification; ecosystem; oxidation reduction reaction; Archaea; Ammonium Compounds; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Methane; Nitrates; Nitrites; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096554819

It is relied on the statistical trend analysis of tropical cyclone intensification (TCI) and sea level rise (SLR) considering temporally non-stationary and spatially non-uniform effects, numerical analysis taking into account the tide-surge-wave coupling effect and GIS-based analysis for inundation evaluation. The results show that the high sea surface elevation tends to occur in the bays and around the estuaries. The maximal sea surface elevations of the worst situation at present without considering TCI and SLR (i.e. scenario S2) are 6.06 m, 5.82 m and 5.67 m around Aojiang, Feiyunjiang and Oujiang river estuaries, respectively. Whereas, the maximal sea surface elevations for the three estuaries would increase to 7.02 m, 6.67 m and 6.44 m, respectively, when the non-stationary extreme wind speed of 100-year recurrence period and SLR equivalent to the situation of 2100s (i.e. scenario S4) are taking into account. The potential inundation area of scenario S4 would expand by 108% to about 798 km2 compared with scenario S2. In addition, the remotely sensed maps and inundation durations of the hardest hit regions are provided, which will aid the prevention and mitigation of storm tide inundation hazard and future coastal management there.

The study employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions and removal by plants and soil in different urban green typologies, namely afforested areas, tree rows, social allotments, lawns, hedges, referring to a life span of 50 years. The present study aims to evaluate the carbon balance connected with planning, planting, and maintaining an urban park, the Parco Nord Milano (PNM), a green area located in the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy. The different emission data took into consideration planting and maintenance interventions, including the effects of equipment and vehicle choices, main operational activities, and the fate of vegetal residue from pruning, shrub and tree removal, and lawn mowing. The best performances in terms of CO2e balance per surface unit was obtained with tree rows and afforested area typologies (- 789 and – 527 Mg CO2e ha−1 50yrs-1, respectively), while the hedges showed the worst CO2e balance, (+ 176 Mg CO2e ha−1 50yrs-1). Different planting options, different pruning or thinning intensities or species selection can change this balance. In addition, converting residues from removed trees into wood products can improve the storage of CO2 for long periods. LCA has proved to be an effective tool to support the planning and maintenance of urban parks and the types considered. However, rational planning must also have to take into account user preferences and needs, and which ecosystem services can be maximized to ensure a better quality of life. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Carbon; Ecosystem services; LCA; Sink; Soil","carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; greenspace; life cycle analysis; metropolitan area; pruning; shrub; urban ecosystem; Milan [Milano]; Milano",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094809888

Organic farming has been increasingly popular as it provides long-term environmental benefits including GHG mitigation. Judicious use of cover crops in crop rotation systems has been considered an effective approach to sustain crop productivity during organic transition period. Here, we examined effects of cover crops on soil CO2 and N2O fluxes after the first year of organic transition in corn-soybean-wheat rotation across three contrasting topographies, particularly depression, slope, and summit at Kellogg Biological Station located in Southwest Michigan, USA. Three cover cropping systems used in this study were (1) cereal rye; (2) a mixture of cold susceptible species, namely, oat, winter pea, and radish, frost-killed in winter (WK); and (3) a winter hardy mixture of cold tolerant species, namely annual ryegrass, Dwarf Essex rapeseed, and crimson clover (WH). We also examined the effect of the size of incorporated plant residue fragments on soil CO2 and N2O emissions. Soil GHG emissions were the lowest on slopes as compared to depressions and summits. Cover crop mixtures including WH and WK increased soil CO2 fluxes emitted from the soil while cereal rye decreased it. Cutting plant residues prior to incorporation tended to decrease CO2 emission, suggesting that reducing fragment size of incorporated residue has a potential to mitigate GHG emissions from agricultural soils.

Phrasing suitable land planning strategies requires assessing future flood risk and predicting the impact of urban sprawl. This study aims to develop an innovative approach combining land use change and hydraulic models to explore future urban flood risk, aiming to reduce it under different vulnerability and exposure scenarios. SPOT-3 and Sentinel-2 images were processed and classified to create land cover maps for 1995 and 2019, and these were used to predict the 2040 land cover using the Land Change Modeler Module of Terrset. Flood risk was computed by combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability using hydrodynamic modeling and the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. We have compared flood risk in 1995, 2019, and 2040. Although flood risk increases with urbanization, population density, and the number of hospitals in the flood plain, especially in the coastal region, the area exposed to high and very high risks decreases due to a reduction in poverty rate. This study can provide a theoretical framework supporting climate change related to risk assessment in other metropolitan regions. Methodologically, it underlines the importance of using satellite imagery and the continuity of data in the planning-related decision-making process. © 2021 by the authors.

Both the meteorological and the community perceptions were analyzed. Monthly rainfall and temperature data for Thika Meteorological Station were analyzed for trends using MAKESENS procedure. The community perceptions data obtained through household survey, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and content analysis. The study hypotheses were tested using chi-square tests. The community perceived inadequate rainfall during crop growth (79%), reduced rainfall intensity (77%) and erratic onset and cessation of seasonal rainfall (73%) had interrupted their crop productivity. These disagreed with MAKESENS rainfall trends that showed statistically insignificant rainfall variability (α > 0.1). The community's warmer temperature perceptions agreed with observed rising maximum temperature trend at 0.001 significance level. This study observed a significant relationship between the community's perceived local rainfall and temperature changes, and household food security. For robust and strategically designed climate policies and programs for food security, governments need to communicate to policy makers the perceptions of smallholder farmers involved in autonomous climate adaptation. © 2021 Mary W.

Despite attempts to mitigate climate risks (manifested via recurrent flooding) in line with international disaster risk reduction agendas, the impacts/effects of floods continue to increase in England. This is partly due to negligence in inculcating contemporary flood risk perceptions (FRP) into climate risk management (CRM) strategies. This research aims to investigate contemporary FRM in England through a qualitative case study approach in Wainfleet All Saints in Lincolnshire County that experienced unprecedented floods in June 2019. Empirical investigation was conducted with the flood-affected community members and flood managers with oversight of CRM in the region. Key findings reveal the June 2019 floods had both tangible and intangible impacts for the affected community with dreadful effects. Challenges to CRM revealed issues around limited funding; climate changes’ potential to increase flood risk and low community perception of their own risks reflected in poor/none-preparedness for contemporary floods. The multi-agency response to the June 2019 floods was found to be positive, albeit with a few concerns. Based on the analysis of the findings, a series of policy recommendations are proffered with the aim to spur organisational/institutional resilience to CRM. This article underscores the relevance to continuously include contemporary FRP into CRM strategies especially to enhance community participation and involvement in mitigating their own risks. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Climate risk management; England; Flood risk management; Flood risk perception; Flooding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105733471

In the early 2000s the search was on for fuels that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, spur economic development in rural regions, and diversify national energy supplies. Biofuels and fracking took center stage as promising commodities and technologies. But controversy quickly erupted. Global enthusiasm for these fuels and the widespread projections for their production around the world collided with local politics. Rural and remote places, such as coastal east Africa and Canada’s Yukon territory, became hotbeds of contention in these new energy politics. Opponents of biofuels in Kenya and of fracking in the Yukon activated specific identities, embraced scale shifts across transnational networks, brokered relationships between disparate communities and interests, and engaged in contentious performances with symbolic resonance. To explain these convergent dynamics of contention and resistance, the book argues that the emergence of grievances and the mechanisms of mobilization that are used to resist new fuel technologies depend less on the type of energy developed than on intersecting elements of the political economy of energy-specifically finance, ownership, and trade relations. Taken together, the intersecting elements of the political economy of energy shape patterns of resistance in new energy frontiers. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Biofuels; Contentious politics; Energy politics; Fracking; Kenya; Mobilization; Political economy; Resistance; Transnational; Yukon",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112254929

These models take climate and geographic variables as input and are therefore helpful for long-term decision support and climate adaptation planning. Generally, local processes of tree germination and seedling survival are resolved probabilistically with explanatory variables such as elevation, latitude, exposure, soil type, moisture availability, climate and weather inputs and ‘trained’ using landscape and regional presence-absence data and machine learning techniques. How seeds are distributed in these models, that is, determining the dispersal kernel, is far more problematic. The challenge is that variables conditioning vertebrate seed dispersal (motility and probability of utilization or caching in response to cover type) are not represented in large scale distribution models, and in fact vary on scales (10-100 meters) that are much smaller than the smallest pixel size for the distribution model (1-10 kilometers). We present a homogenized seed digestion kernel (HSDK) which incorporates this scale separation. Homogenization naturally links highly variable small-scale processes (like seed foraging and caching by birds and rodents) with large scale effects (like dispersal of seeds over tens of kilometers). We develop a homogenization strategy to predict seed dispersal on landscape scales, analytically linking small-scale variables (landscape fraction cover by tree type, gut residence times and cover type utilization by frugivorous birds) with large scale behaviors. Closed form approximations are developed in two dimensions for two limiting cases of seed handling behavior, and the approach is illustrated using landscape data and piñon-pine dispersal in a 630,000 square kilometer region in the southwestern US. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Homogenized seed digestion kernel; Landscape utilization; Motility; Residence time","Birds; Climate models; Decision support systems; Learning systems; Mammals; Residence time distribution; Cover types; Distribution models; Homogenized seed digestion kernel; Landscape utilization; Motility; Regional scale; Residence time; Seed dispersal; Seed dispersal kernel; Tree distribution; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113272441

Development and deployment of green energy technologies offer a natural conduit to meet the growing electricity needs of the Association of Southeast Asian Economies (ASEAN) region while also serving as a viable strategy to adapt to climate change. The aim of this study is to formulate the policy lessons for the ASEAN economies and governments in facilitating the development and deployment of green technologies and alternatives energy options based on a specific case review of the ASEAN. The ASEAN economic region is prioritizing sustainable economic growth while minimizing the regional impacts of climate change through decarbonization. The study undertakes a case-specific analysis in reviewing green energy deployment in the context of green growth and energy transition using secondary data sources and discusses the current status and future options of renewable energy development in the ASEAN. We find that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will allow the ASEAN to continue to use fossil fuels while achieving sustainable economic growth as coal demand increases in the region. The deployment of CCS technologies will also act as an enabler of hydrogen energy as a green energy solution in the region in the longer term. Boosting public acceptance to nuclear energy, implementing energy efficiency improvement policies and eliminating fossil fuels consumption subsidies are feasible short-term and medium-term policies. Increasing both the public and private sector energy investments and development of CCS technologies in the longer term are necessary complementary policies to maximize the benefits of greater deployment of renewable energy sources in the region and combat climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

While rigorous evaluations of adaptation strategies provide decision makers with valuable insights, those that are published often overlook major constraints, ignore local adaptive capacity, and suffer from a compartmentalization of disciplines and scales. The objective of our study was to identify current knowledge of evaluation methods and their limitations, reported in the literature. We reviewed 111 papers that evaluate adaptation strategies in the main vineyards worldwide. Evaluation approaches are analyzed through key features (e.g., climate data sources, methodology, evaluation criteria) to discuss their ability to address climate change issues, and to identify promising outcomes for climate change adaptations. We highlight the fact that combining adaptation levers in the short and long term (location, vine training, irrigation, soil, and canopy management, etc.) enables local compromises to be reached between future water availability and grapevine productivity. The main findings of the paper are three-fold: (1) the evaluation of a combination of adaptation strategies provides better solutions for adapting to climate change; (2) multi-scale studies allow local constraints and opportunities to be considered; and (3) only a small number of studies have developed multi-scale and multi-lever approaches to quantify feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation. In addition, we found that climate data sources were not systematically clearly presented, and that climate uncertainty was hardly accounted for. Moreover, only a small number of studies have assessed the economic impacts of adaptation, especially at farm scale. We conclude that the development of methodologies to evaluate adaptation strategies, considering both complementary adaptations and scales, is essential if relevant information is to be provided to the decision-makers of the wine industry. © Copyright © 2021 Naulleau, Gary, Prévot and Hossard.","adaptation evaluation; climate change; drought; management practices; multi-criteria; multi-scale; viticulture",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101975052

The presence of the conodont ensensis Zone points to the correlation with the global Kačák Episode whose onset coincided with the eustatic If transgression. The comprehensive study of the Kostyukovichi Fm. in 18 boreholes included sedimentological, palaeontological (conodonts, palynoflora, vertebrates) and geochemical analyses (C, O and Nd isotopes in carbonates and bioapatite). The results demonstrate that the sedimentation was characterised by intermittent hypoxic conditions and salinity fluctuations; it was controlled by increasing terrigenous and freshwater influx from the northern Scandinavian Land with carbonate sedimentation limited mostly to the early stage and southern part of the basin. The palynological study and occurrence of phytoclasts document terrestrial plant expansion, while the abundance of diverse fish taxa attests to the proliferation of vertebrates. These bioevents are attributed to transgression, climate humidization, and expansion of aquatic environments in surrounding land areas. Regional review suggests that such attributes of the Belarusian Kačák Episode as the initial If transgression, marine hypoxia, land plants blooms, carbonate decline and terminal regression, are characteristic also for other palaeogeographic settings of the episode worldwide. The Kačák Episode is here explained as a result of complex interrelations of various terrestrial and marine processes and events initiated by a global warming resulting in eustatic transgression and climate humidization. It is proposed that the important component of the terrestrial-marine teleconnections was the late Eifelian plant expansion presumably connected with the proliferation of progymnosperm arborescent plants with deepened root systems. It contributed to transiently increased denudation rates and, indirectly, to the development of marine hypoxia. The episode was terminated by the low-amplitude regression related to the enhanced CO2 sequestration and resulting climatic cooling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Arborescent plants; Balto-Moscovian Sea; Climate change; Devonian events; Epeiric sedimentation; Marine hypoxia","Eifelian; global warming; hypoxic conditions; marine environment; palynology; sedimentation; teleconnection; terrestrial environment; transgression; vertebrate; Belarus; Scandinavia; Embryophyta; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096859212

The main findings are as follows: (1) Renewable energy consumption negatively affects CO2 emissions, while economic and population growth positively affect CO2 emissions at the regional level. (2) The findings of asymmetric and symmetric linkages between CO2 emissions and its determinants (economic and population growth and renewable energy) are very volatile across the country levels. (3) The causality hypotheses are different across the country and regional levels. (4) This study shows the renewable energy growth nexus, wherein renewable energy positively affects economic growth at the regional level.

This knowledge is underpinned by a set of standardised rules of thumb (heuristics) that define what climate adaptation is and what it means. For example, it is widely accepted that adaptation is a local issue that is best achieved by urgent anticipatory action by using participatory processes. Yet, the validity and relevance of these heuristics have rarely been tested or questioned. If these heuristics are not based on sound empirical evidence, their inclusion and use in scientific studies, policy development, planning and implementation processes can generate inappropriate solutions for highly complex problems. This research critically examines and tests a set of common climate adaptation heuristics and investigates the extent to which they correspond to with the lived experiences of practitioners who are engaged in climate adaptation planning in Queensland, Australia. The findings provide new insights into the applicability of adaptation heuristics, and point to several new rules of thumb that underpin climate adaptation in practice. For example, adaptation was mainly seen as a regional/transboundary issue with broader stakeholder involvement that is best pursued through an incremental ‘learn-as-we-go’ approach. Retaining flexibility in the policy- and decision-making systems was preferred as were no-regret, value- and risk-based approaches. Future research is needed to explore further the different types of heuristics and how these best support adaptation science, policy, planning and decision-making processes. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation heuristics; Adaptation theory; Australia; Climate change adaptation; Decision-making",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102903419

This proportion of energy is expected to double in the coming decade. It is therefore important to correctly investigate the optimal use of energy in wastewater treatment facilities that can reduce their Greenhouse Gas emissions. A review was developed on modelling tools that can be used for the analysis of the water-energy nexus in wastewater facilities, from over 200 research articles collected from different scientific resources published in the last 15 years. The aim was to analyse the state of art of existing tools to provide an aid for researchers and professionals to identify the most suitable tool to investigate decarbonisation strategies for wastewater facilities. Studies were grouped on the basis of the main intervention analysed: i) reduction of energy demand, ii) energy production from wastewater and iii) integration of the available renewable sources on-site (e.g. PV, hydro). The work developed also provides an overview of the most applicable decarbonisation strategies and their potential to reduce the CO2 emissions of wastewater facilities. Results show that identifying the best tool strongly depends on the main aim of the intervention. Existing tools, in fact, can help to analyse separately either technologies to reduce the energy demand or the integration of the most common renewable sources from both wastewater (i.e. biogas and heat recover) and renewable sources exploitable on site. However, the full decarbonisation of wastewater facilities can only happen by integrating different energy savings and renewables solutions. There is, therefore, the need for a comprehensive energy-water optimization tool able to understand how key water parameters influence the energy demand and to identify, on a single platform, the best energy saving solutions and the benefits coming from integrating different renewable sources. Such platform could help in enhancing the benefits of combined solutions, helping to maximise the reuse of the renewable energy produced onsite and any opportunity of energy savings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy optimization; Energy recovery; Modelling tools; Renewable energy; Wastewater treatment","Decarbonization; Energy conservation; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Comprehensive energy; Energy optimization; Global energy demand; Proportion of energy; Scientific resources; Wastewater facilities; Wastewater treatment facilities; Wastewater treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090925668

Among the various factories, those having anode baking furnaces are working on reducing the pollutant emissions. The aerodynamics in the furnace influences the emissions due to the high dependence of combustion and radiation phenomena on the mixing characteristics. Therefore, this paper aims to establish the numerical simulation results for the three-dimensional turbulent flow in a single section of an anode baking furnace with a high rate of fuel injection. The stabilized non-linear finite element approach on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation is used with COMSOLMultiphysics. The turbulent viscosity ratio is highly sensitive to the mesh for the standard k-ε model. The requirements of the Cartesian and refined mesh near the jet development region is explained. The comparison of meshes generated by two meshing tools namely cfMesh and COMSOL Multiphysics default Mesher is carried out. The high numerical diffusion in the flow models due to the coarser mesh leads to convergence but deficit the precision in the results. This paper shows that the mesh generated by cfMesh with flow aligned refinement combined with the non-linear finite element solver in COMSOL Multiphysics proves to provide accurate results of turbulent quantities. © 2021 by the authors.

The total emission of greenhouse gases is called the carbon footprint and is expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) units. As a new educational institution, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) began to take part in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) programme that supports the reduction in carbon emissions. In this study, the total amount of CO2 produced from UTM during 4 years was measured under three categories: (1) the emissions from the fleet of university vehicles for public transportation, (2) the electricity and water emissions, and (3) the emissions produced by staff and student transportation, waste generation, paper, and maintenance by contractors. The special evaluation method is an alternative method to calculate greenhouse gases and measures all elements/sources of greenhouse gases under the same functional unit. This reference helps the assessor to avoid the double measurement of anthropogenic gases. The study results demonstrated that air transportation utilised by university students and employees and electricity usage contributed to 34.74%, 19.37%, and 18.19% of the carbon emissions, respectively. The total CO2 emissions from the three sources over 4 years were 48.442 MT. The data on the carbon footprint of the university can form the basis for monitoring, evaluation, and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in Malaysia. Moreover, the university constructed and operates a smart house, a large solar parking lot with a capacity of 10 MW, uses solar and wind-powered lighting, and encourages the use of bicycles and electric scooters to achieve an annual reduction in the total CO2 emissions intensity. The results of this study suggested that a carbon reduction project could encourage university members and public society to an understanding of the environment and allowing UTM to become a centre of excellence for the operation of a green campus for urban areas.

The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of brinzolamide in rabbit aqueous humor, iris-ciliary body, plasma, and whole blood. New Zealand White rabbits were dosed via intracameral, topical and intravenous administration. After intracameral administration (4.5 μg) of solubilized brinzolamide, aqueous humor concentrations were described with a two-compartment model, the estimated clearance was 4.12 μL/min, apparent volume of distribution at steady-state 673 μL, and terminal half-life 3.4 h. After topical administration of 1% brinzolamide suspension (500 μg), absolute bioavailability based on aqueous humor AUC0-∞ was 0.10%. After intravenous administration of brinzolamide solution (0.75 mg/kg) elimination half-life in plasma and whole blood appeared to be over two weeks. The ratios of the measured concentrations of irisciliary body to whole blood, to plasma, and to aqueous humor concentrations enabled direct comparisons, and helped identify the significant contribution of the conjunctival-scleral pathways of absorption to the ciliary body.

To reduce the yield gap, a randomized split-plot design set up with irrigation as a main and nitrogen (N) treatments as a sub-factor. The irrigation regimes were 100 % (I100), 80 % (I80) and 60 % (I60) of crop water requirements whilst nitrogen levels were 250 kg N/ha (F100), 187 kg N/ha (F75), 125 kg N/ha (F50) and 0 kgN/ha (F0). The study evaluated the effect of irrigation water and N on crop growth variables and yield, fruit quality, WUE and NUE. The study showed the importance of combining different irrigation performance indicators which responds to different levels of water and nitrogen to evaluate and assess suitable irrigation and fertilizer strategies for African eggplant. The crop growth variables (plant height and LAI) had a good correlation with fruit yield (R2 = 0.6 and 0.8). The fruit quality was best performed by 100 % water in combination with 75 % N treatment. The best WUE and NUE was attained at 80 % and 100 % levels of water in combination with 75 % N. However, minimizing trade-offs between the various indicators, the optimal application for African eggplant would likely be around 80 % of the total irrigation requirement and 75 % of the N requirement in sandy clay loam soils under tropical sub-humid conditions. © 2020 The Author(s)","African eggplant; Crop water-use efficiency (WUE); Drip irrigation; Fruit quality; Nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE); Yield","agrometeorology; clay loam; design method; fertilizer application; food quality; horticulture; humid environment; optimization; tropical region; vegetable; water use efficiency; Tanzania; Solanum aethiopicum; Solanum melongena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091975809

The greatest contributor to emissions of this gas to the atmosphere is agricultural activity. The main objective of the study was to assess the progress of sustainable management of ammonia emissions from agriculture in European Union countries. The specific objectives of the article were the following: to analyse and diagnose the level of ammonia emissions from agriculture, to study the diversity of emissions of this gas between countries, to analyse trends in the years 2010–2017 and, above all, to assess the relationship between the level of ammonia emissions from agriculture and the economic conditions of EU countries. The theoretical part of the article describes the causes and effects of, as well as preventive actions against, ammonia emissions from agriculture, whereas the empirical part analyses the problems, trends, variations, and the impact of economic conditions on emissions of this gas in 2010–2017. To evaluate the range of problems discussed, indicators describing ammonia emission levels Y01A and Y01B, as well as indicators characterising economic conditions X01, X02, and X03 have been employed. During the study, the following indicators were analysed: ammonia emissions from agriculture in kilograms per hectare (Y01A), ammonia emissions from agriculture—percentage of total emissions (Y01B), government appropriations or outlays on research and development in agriculture in EUR per capita (X01), agricultural factor income in EUR per annual work unit (AWU) (X02), and real GDP in EUR per capita (X03). The source for the empirical data was information from the European Statistical Office (Eurostat). The analysis covered 28 states of the European Union. In the article, among others, the rate of change indices, coefficients of variation (Vs), measures of distance (D) and range(R), coefficients of asymmetry (A) and kurtosis (K) were calculated, and correlation and regression analysis were performed. The share of agriculture in total ammonia emissions in European Union countries is very high and averages as high as 92%. Most of the countries maintain an upward tendency; a disturbing fact, considering such high ammonia emissions from agriculture. Based on the present analysis, it has also been confirmed that countries with the relatively highest levels of economy and agricultural research and development funding in fact emit more and increasingly more ammonia from agriculture. To avoid the intensification of the adverse effects of this phenomenon, all EU Member States should take effective, efficient, and sustained action to reduce ammonia emission levels. © 2021 by the authors.

Thermal comfort is one of the most important issues for both residential and commercial buildings. Out of the 40% of global energy consumed by buildings, a large fraction is used to maintain their thermal comfort. In this study, a comprehensive review of the recent advancements in building energy conservation and efficiency application is presented based on existing high-quality research papers. Additionally, the retrofit of the heating/cooling and hot water system for an entire community in Cyprus is presented. This study aims to analyze the technical and environmental benefits of replacing existing electric heaters for hot water with heat pump water heating systems and the use of heat pump air conditioners for thermal comfort in place of the existing ordinary air conditioners for space heating and cooling. One administrative building, 86 apartments (including residential and commercial) buildings, and a restaurant building is retrofitted, and the feasibility of the project is determined based on three economic indicators, namely; simple payback period (SPP), internal rate of return (IRR), and net present value (NPV). The electrical energy required by the hot water systems and the heating/cooling system is reduced by 263,564 kWh/yr and 144,825 kWh/yr, respectively. Additionally, the retrofit project will reduce Cyprus’ CO2 emission by 121,592.8 kg yearly.

It is shown that the response of SM communities to pollution has not fundamentally changed over 30 observation years. An increase in pollution caused a significant reduction in the total abundance and α-diversity of communities and their dominance index in each of the three periods; at the same time, the γ-diversity remained similar in the background (13 species) and polluted zones (12 species). The reduction of emissions had no significant influence on the SM communities in the background (conditionally clean) zone: the species structure fluctuated insignificantly, the dominance structure did not change, and the increase in the animal abundance by the end of observations (owing to forest voles but not insectivores) was due to successional changes in the vegetation. The reduction of emissions led to a succession of dominants near the smelter and the trends of changes in abundance in this area differed from those observed in the buffer and impact zones (increase and no change, respectively). The increase in the abundance of species of different trophic groups (phytophages, granivores, and zoophages) in the moderately polluted (buffer) zone can be considered a symptom of the initial stages of recovery due to the improvement of habitat quality. Positive shifts in the SM community from the highly polluted (impact) zone are less distinct, being expressed only as an increase in the proportion of shrews. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","industrial pollution; natural recovery; relative abundance; rodents; shrews; α-diversity; γ-diversity","abundance; copper; environmental impact; forest ecosystem; industrial emission; rodent; smelting; species diversity; Mammalia; Rodentia; Soricidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101274649

Methods: Measurements from lateral cephalograms taken at age 6 years of 44 patients (mucosal flap group) were obtained and compared with data reported in the literature for approximately age-matched children without cleft palate. We also compared maxillofacial growth in a subgroup analysis based on the anteroposterior length of the palatal bone defect. In addition, we examined velopharyngeal function at age 5–6 years. Results: Compared with the non-cleft group, the mucosal flap group had a shorter anteroposterior length of the anterior base of the skull, shorter maxillary alveolar base, shorter mandibular body, shorter posterior maxillary height, and posteroinferior rotation of the mandible. In the mucosal flap group, the anteroposterior length of the maxillary alveolar base was shorter when the palatal bone defect extended anteriorly than when it was limited to the posterior region. In the mucosal flap group, 88.6 % had favorable velopharyngeal function. In patients who developed anterior fistula after palatoplasty, expiratory nasal emission could be reduced using a speech plate. Conclusions: Use of a mucosal flap during palatoplasty is useful from the perspective of maxillofacial growth and velopharyngeal function in patients with isolated cleft palate. © 2020 Asian AOMS(+) ASOMP(+) JSOP(+) JSOMS(+) JSOM(+) and JAMI","Cleft palate; Maxillary development; Mucosal flap; Palatoplasty; Velopharyngeal function",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091519864

In this regard, international agreements and initiatives have been launched to accelerate the use of renewable energy and to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yemen is one of the countries signed on these agreements. However, Yemen is facing the problem that the structure of the power grid is fragile and the power shortage is serious. Accordingly, this paper aims to study the potential for renewable energy in Yemen and assess the technical and economic feasibility of hybrid energy systems. Firstly, this paper introduces the status and challenges of Yemen’s electricity sector, the status of renewable energy, and the status of GHG emission. Secondly, this study proposes the method of optimizing different configurations of off-grid hybrid (solar/wind/diesel engine) energy systems for electrifying various consumers in Taiz province, Yemen under three scenarios of energy strategies. The objective function is to seek the most optimal hybrid energy system that achieves the least cost and most advantageous technical performance, while instigating the best economic scenario of energy strategies. Finally, Homer pro software is used for simulation, optimization, and sensitivity analysis of the designed energy systems. The results found the best economically feasible scenario, the hybrid PV/wind/diesel energy system, among the other scenarios. A photovoltaic (PV)/wind energy system achieved the best technical performances of 100% CO2 reduction, with a 54.82% reduction in the net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE); while the hybrid energy system (PV/wind/diesel engine) achieved the best economic cost of 61.95% reduction in NPC and COE, with a 97.44% reduction of CO2 emission. © 2020 by the authors.

Data were collected from canola farming enterprises in the Mazandaran province of Iran and were used to test the application of the combined modeling algorithms. Life cycle assessment (LCA) for one ha functional unit of canola production from cradle to farm gate was conducted in order to evaluate the impacts of energy, materials used, and their environmental emissions. MOGA was applied to maximize the output energy and benefit‐cost ratio, and to minimize environmental emissions. The combined ANFIS–MOGA technique resulted in a 6.2% increase in energy output, a 144% rise in the benefit-cost ratio, and a 19.8% reduction in environmental emissions from the current canola production system in the studied region. A comparison of ANFIS–MOGA with the data envelopment analysis approach was also conducted and the results established that the former is a better system than the latter because of its ability to generate optimum conditions that allow for the assessment of a combination of parameters such as energy, economic, and environmental impacts of agricultural production systems. © 2020 by the authors.

The main objective of present investigation is to introduce feasible solutions in remote villages with different climate zones. Since Iran is a country with different climates, five remote villages are selected as case studies. The selected villages have different values of prime and deferrable loads. In continue, the decision-making between the utilization of hybrid renewable energy systems and grid extension is conducted. To assess the feasibility of grid extension scenario, the distance from the central grid for selected villages is determined using the Geographic Information System (GIS). To supply the required potable water, the Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination system is employed. By employing HOMER Pro software, several energy configurations for each village are simulated. The results illustrate that for all selected villages, the stand-alone (off-grid) system is the most cost-effective option. The pure grid extension scenario due to the high values of Net Present Cost (NPC) is not recommended for small and large villages. The CO2 emissions of pure extension are more than 105 kg/year for all selected villages. By using pure extension option, about 25–43% of the share of overall NPC is related to the grid extension cost. With the use of stand-alone systems instead of pure extension, about 10–19% of energy losses and 100000–200000 kg/year of CO2 emissions reduce. Finally, to determine the breakeven distance for each village, the sensitivity analysis on load demand and extension distance is implemented. For instance, for selected villages with the climates of Semi-Arid and Cold, the breakeven distance is computed to be 13.5 km and 10.3 km, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Economic feasibility; Grid extension; Hybrid energy system; RO desalination; Rural electrification","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Desalination; Energy dissipation; Information use; Potable water; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Water supply; Energy configurations; Feasibility studies; Feasible solution; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Renewable energies; Reverse osmosis desalination; Rural electrification; Standalone systems; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089815682

This strategy has the potential to alleviate peak period congestion, improve efficiency of delivery firms, and reduce emissions. This paper investigates benefits and challenges of a pilot OPD program in the Region of Peel, with the goal of informing potential broader implementations of OPD. In contrast to other previously implemented OPD projects, this OPD pilot focuses on deliveries in suburban areas. Three firms, delivering to 14 pilot retail stores, participated in the OPD pilot in the Region of Peel from March to August 2019. The analysis shows that during the six-month pilot, the average speed of the trips that were made in off-peak hours, from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. the next day, is 18.1% faster than those that happened in day-time hours. Furthermore, the total greenhouse gas emissions/km decreased by 10.6%, and emissions factors for air quality pollutants, including CO, NOx, PM10, and PM2.5 reduced by 10.8% to 15.0% in off-peak hours. Results for service times varied between firms, but on average increased by 15.2%, indicating activities in the off-peak hours at the retail stores that prevented overall improvements in service time compared to day-time deliveries. A post-pilot interview was done with logistics managers of the three firms, which provides rich insights about challenges, successes, and ways that the OPD program could be improved. © 2020 by the authors.

Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015–2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Absorbing aerosol index; Carbon monoxide and ozone; COVID-19; Environmental impacts in Egypt; Medical and municipal solid wastes; Nitrogen dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions","carbon monoxide; ground water; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; disease prevalence; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; groundwater pollution; nitrogen dioxide; recycling; satellite data; solid waste; viral disease; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; Egypt; energy consumption; environmental indicator; government; greenhouse gas; hospital waste; human; municipal solid waste; noise; pandemic; particulate matter; quarantine; recycling; seashore; solid waste management; surface property; sustainable growth; water pollution; air pollutant; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Alexandria [Egypt]; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Egypt; Environmental Indicators; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092499268

We explore how climate and water policy interact to influence water availability for cannabis (Cannabis sativa), a newly regulated crop in California, as well as how public discourse frames these interactions. Grower access to surface water covaries with precipitation frequency and oscillates consistently in an energetic 11–17 year wet-dry cycle. Assessing contemporary cannabis water policies against historic streamflow data showed that legal surface water access was most reliable for cannabis growers with small water rights (&lt;600 m3 ) and limited during relatively dry years. Climate variability either facilitates or limits water access in cycles of 10–15 years—rendering cultivators with larger water rights vulnerable to periods of drought. However, news media coverage excludes growers’ perspectives and rarely mentions climate and weather, while public debate over growers’ irrigation water use presumes illegal diversion. This complicates efforts to improve growers’ legal water access, which are further challenged by climate. To promote a socially, politically, and environmentally viable cannabis industry, water policy should better represent growers’ voices and explicitly address stakeholder controversies as it adapts to this new and legal agricultural water user. © 2020 by the authors.

It was confirmed that PACs are being emitted from the pond to air. © 2020Alberta's oil sands tailings ponds are suspected to be a source of fugitive emissions of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) to the atmosphere. Here we report, for the first time, fluxes of 6 parent and 21 alkylated PACs based on the measured co-located air and water concentrations using a two-film fugacity-based model (FUG), an inverse dispersion model (DISP) and a simple box model (BOX). Air samples were collected at the Suncor Tailings Pond 2/3 using a high volume air sampler from the “pond” and towards the pond (“non-pond”) directions separately. Mean ∑27PACs in air from the “pond” direction was greater than the “non-pond” direction by a factor of 17. Water-air fugacity ratio of 20 PACs quantifiable in water indicated net volatilization from water. Dispersion and box model results also indicated upward fluxes of 22 PACs. Correlation between the estimated flux results of BOX and DISP model was statistically significant (r = 0.99 and p &lt; 0.05), and correlation between FUG and DISP results ranged from 0.54 to 0.85. In this first-ever assessment of PAC fluxes from tailings pond, the three models confirmed volatilization fluxes of PACs indicating Suncor Tailings Pond 2/3 is a source of PAC emissions to the atmosphere. This study addressed a key data gap identified in the Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Emissions Inventory Compilation Report (Government of Alberta and Canada, 2016) which is the lack of consistent real-world tailings pond fugitive emission monitoring of organic chemicals. Our findings highlight the need for measurements from other tailings ponds to determine their overall contribution in releasing PACs to the atmosphere. This paper presents a practical method for estimating PAC emissions from other tailings ponds, which can provide a better understanding of these fugitive emissions, and thereby help to improve the overall characterization of emissions in the oil sands region. © 2020","Flux; High volume air sampler; Oil sands; Polycyclic aromatic compounds; Tailings ponds","Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Dispersions; Inverse problems; Oil sands; Organic chemicals; Sand; Emissions inventory; Fugacity-based model; Fugitive emissions; Inverse-dispersion; Oil sands tailings; Polycyclic aromatic compounds; Water concentrations; Water measurements; Lakes; oil; polycyclic aromatic compound; water; organic compound; polycyclic hydrocarbon; concentration (composition); dispersion; emission; fugacity; numerical model; oil sand; sampling; tailings; air monitoring; air pollution; air sampling; Alberta; alkylation; atmospheric dispersion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; exhaust gas; inverse dispersion model; mine tailings; pond; simple box model; statistical model; statistical significance; tar sand; two film fugacity based model; volatilization; water pollution; oil and gas field; pond; Alberta; Canada; Alberta; Oil and Gas Fields; Organic Chemicals; Polycyclic Compounds; Ponds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097202268

The equipment involved in gas sweetening generally consume a considerable amount of energy, leading to negative impacts in terms of economic and environmental prospects. This research work includes simulation, analytical, and numerical modeling approaches to evaluate exergy, energy, economic, and environmental analysis of a gas sweetening plant (GSP). Various compositions of methyl-di-ethanolamine (MDEA) and di-ethanolamine (DEA) blend are studied to mitigate exergy destruction, energy loss, and CO2 emissions in the sweetening process. According to the results, the absorber and stripper are responsible for 37% of the total exergy destruction and 29% of the total energy loss, respectively. DEA concentration plays an imperative role in exergy and energy management of the GSP. The optimum amine concentration of 40 wt% decreases the total exergy destruction from 6.6 MW to 4.8 MW and lowers the energy loss by 36.7%. This optimization strategy then results in a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions by 2893.6 tons per year (t/y), compared to the current operation state. The economic assessment confirms the profitability of the plant to be operated at the optimal amine concentration.

Our hybrid method, the novel CAMS (The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) ozone improvement (CAO3_I) method, is the first attempt to predict ambient ozone by improving CAMS ozone (CAO3) products. For this novel framework, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) has been adopted for classification through the most significant regional ozone patterns which were extracted through the REOF (Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function) technique. For each classified region, meteorological data, geographical data, CAMS ozone and ground-sites ozone are fed into random forest for regional regulation training and prediction. The CAO3_I method has shown its great feasibility in daily ozone surface distribution prediction. Based on daily averaged ozone concentrations for each station (STO3), the performance of CAO3 products (R2 = 0.35, RMSE = 25.77 μg/m3, MAPE = 42.06) have significantly improved to CAO3_I (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 14.10 μg/m3, MAPE = 22.37), which shows above 97.4% R2 and RMSE have been improved. Our model is also capable to predict high level ozone concentrations in summer where the R2 has improved from 0.37 (for CAO3) to 0.81. In comparison with ground monitoring stations, the CAMS ozone improvement results can excellently reflect the distribution of daily ground-level ozone concentration and outperform previous statistical models in predicting ambient O3 concentrations. Therefore, the prediction results and our proposed model can be used for future epidemiological studies and air pollution controlling programs. © 2020","Air pollution; CAMS products; Random forest; Rotated empirical orthogonal function; Spatiotemporal prediction of ambient ozone",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095785030

Of these GHGs, CH4, in particular, constitutes a major component of the GHG emitted by the agricultural sector. Along with environmental concerns, CH4 emission also leads to losses in gross energy intake with economic implications. While ruminants are considered the main source of CH4 from agriculture, nonruminant animals also contribute substantially, and the CH4 emission intensity of nonruminants remains comparable to that of ruminants. Means of mitigating CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation have therefore been sought. Methane is produced by methanogens—archaeal microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tracts of animals and participate in fermentation processes. As the diversity of methanogen communities is thought to be responsible for the differences in CH4 production among nonruminant animals, it is necessary to investigate the archaeal composition of specific animal species. Methanogens play an important role in energy metabolism and adipose tissue deposition in animals. Higher abundances of methanogens, along with their higher diversity, have been reported to contribute to lean phenotype in pigs. In particular, a greater abundance of Methanosphaera spp. and early dominance of Methanobrevibacter smithii have been reported to correlate with lower body fat formation in pigs. Besides the contribution of methanogens to the metabolic phenotype of their hosts, CH4 release reduces the productivity that could be achieved through other hydrogen (H2) disposal pathways. Enhanced participation of acetogenesis in H2 disposal, leading to acetate formation, could be a more favorable direction for animal production and the environment. Better knowledge and understanding of the archaeal communities of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), including their metabolism and interactions with other microorganisms, would thus allow the development of new strategies for inhibiting methanogens and shifting toward acetogenesis. There are a variety of approaches to inhibiting methanogens and mitigating methanogenesis in ruminants, which can find an application for nonruminants, such as nutritional changes through supplementation with biologically active compounds and management changes. We summarize the available reports and provide a comprehensive review of methanogens living in the GIT of various nonruminants, such as swine, horses, donkeys, rabbits, and poultry. This review will help in a better understanding of the populations and diversity of methanogens and the implications of their presence in nonruminant animals. © 2020","Digestive tract; Methanogenesis; Methanogens; Mitigation; Monogastric","methane; animal; domestic animal; horse; Leporidae; Methanobrevibacter; pig; rumen; ruminant; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Horses; Methane; Methanobrevibacter; Rabbits; Rumen; Ruminants; Swine",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100568062

These processes influence the local microclimate, air quality and can mitigate temperature extremes and sequester carbon dioxide. Despite such importance, currently only 5 out of 15 atmospheric chemistry climate models even partially account for the presence of cropland trees. We first show that the tree cover over intensely farmed regions in Asia, Australia and South America is significantly underestimated (e.g. only 1–3% tree cover over north-India) in the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosol from Nature (MEGAN) and absent in Noah land-surface module of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Chem) Model. By including the actual tree cover (~10%) over the north-west Indo Gangetic Plain in the Noah land-surface module of the WRF-Chem and the MEGAN module, during the rice growing monsoon season in August, we find that the latent heat flux alone increases by 100%–300% while sensible heat flux reduces by 50%–100%, leading to a reduction in daytime boundary layer height by 200–400 m. This greatly improves agreement between the modelled and measured temperature, boundary layer height and surface ozone, which were earlier overestimated and isoprene and its oxidation products which were earlier underestimated. Mitigating peak daytime temperatures and ozone improves rice production by 10 to 20%. Our findings from north west Indo-Gangetic Plain establish that such plantations mitigate heat stress, and have beneficial effects on crop yields while also sequestering carbon. Expanding agroforestry practices to 50% of the cropland area could result in up to 40% yield gain regionally. Implementing such strategies globally could increase crop production and sequester 0.3–30 GtC per year, and therefore future climate mitigation and food security efforts should consider stakeholder participation for increased cropland agroforestry in view of its beneficial effects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry; Air quality; Crop yield; Heat stress; Land-atmosphere interactions","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Food supply; Forestry; Heat flux; Isoprene; Landforms; Ozone; Ozone layer; Surface measurement; Weather forecasting; Boundary layer heights; Chemistry-climate models; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Measured temperatures; Sequestering carbon; Stakeholder participation; Temperature extremes; Weather research and forecasting; Atmospheric temperature; isoprene; ozone; ozone; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; agroforestry; boundary layer; carbon sequestration; climate effect; computer simulation; feedback mechanism; forest cover; land-atmosphere interaction; latent heat flux; microclimate; model test; numerical model; oxidation; ozone; sensible heat flux; stakeholder; temperature profile; agroforestry; Article; Asia; Australia; boundary layer; controlled study; crop production; cropland; environmental temperature; harvest; heat stress; heat transfer; mathematical model; priority journal; rainy season; rice; South America; tree; air pollutant; atmosphere; crop; environmental monitoring; India; temperature; tree; Asia; Australia; Gangetic Plain; South America; Air Pollutants; Asia; Atmosphere; Australia; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; India; Ozone; South America; Temperature; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090032298

However, owing to the multidimensional and multi-scalar nature of water management and climate change, it is needed to integrate tools to analyze impacts and adaptation. Accordingly, the current study presents an economic-hydrological-behavioral modeling to evaluate potential effects of climate change and adaptation strategies on irrigated agriculture and to manage water resources conflicts among different water users and uses in basins. This model has an iterative framework between a farm-based multi-objectives optimization model, a water evaluating and planning model (WEAP), and an agent-based model, which can represent socio-economic, hydrologic, agronomic and behavioral systems covering all dimensions and scales related to climate change. For this purpose, the economic-hydrological-behavioral modelling was applied in a case study in the Halilrud Basin in Kerman Province, Iran. Results revealed that adoption of suitable adaptive strategies and measures could mitigate the effects of climate change and provide more water to restore the Jazmourian Wetland in this basin. Additionally, the results indicated that different forms of rigidity in the individual behavior of farmers slowed down the adaptation of the agricultural sector, so that implementation of adaptive strategies led to only 14% less water consumption. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Economic-hydrological-behavioral modelling; Wetland","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Climate models; Computational methods; Economic analysis; Multi agent systems; Service industry; Water management; Wetlands; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural sector; Behavioral systems; Impacts and adaptation; Individual behavior; Irrigated agriculture; Iterative framework; Multi-objectives optimization; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; hydrological modeling; optimization; water management; water resource; wetland; Halil Basin; Iran; Kerman [Iran]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096054296

Climate change is increasing the interdependence of different states and economic activities, as the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions from somewhere are felt everywhere. This has prompted an international climate politics in which diverse actors grapple with growing interdependencies. The transnational nature of the climate crisis is however but partially reflected in international climate law. The chapter argues that the Paris Agreement has the potential, as a central node in a still-heterarchical climate governance, to interlink instruments and mechanisms from different levels of law and from the public and private sectors. The chapter also draws attention to interactions with often-overlooked sites of climate governance, including transnational commercial law, private international law, and contractual dispute resolution.

We argue in this article that Cape Town's crisis of water scarcity was a product of the convergence of ongoing contradictions in South African water governance as they came into contact with shifting infrastructural priorities associated with climate change. In its response to the possibility of a financial crisis brought on by reduced water consumption, the city withdrew the universal provision of free basic water (FBW) and reconfigured existing tariff structures. Both changes meant that the city moved further into commercialization and valuation practices in the context of restricted monetary flows. Based on an understanding of contemporary governance in South Africa as reflective of an often contradictory need to balance municipal budgets while also correcting for apartheid inequities, we argue that ongoing experiences of climate change are stretching existing municipal budgets in ways that threaten to deepen existing inequalities. Ultimately, we suggest that Cape Town's crisis is critical for understanding how climate change is reconfiguring existing governance dynamics at a planetary scale, thus offering insights into what form urban climate change adaptation may take in the future. © 2020 The Authors.

To examine the contribution of MSW management to GHG emissions, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Waste Model was used by deploying Tier 2 method. It estimated that 6,898,167 tonnes CO2-eq of GHG emissions were released in 2016 from solid waste disposal sites (SWDS) and are projected to increase to 9,991,486 tonnes CO2-eq in 2030. To reduce GHG emissions from MSW management, Solid-Waste-Management Greenhouse-Gas (SWM-GHG) calculator was used to compare different approaches. SWM-GHG calculator focused on three settings including recycling approach, incineration approach and integrated approach. According to SWM-GHG calculator, in 2016, 15,906,614 tonnes CO2-eq of GHG emissions were released by recycling approximately 16% of MSW and disposing of 84% of MSW in SWDS. Out of the three approaches, integrated approach can result in highest reduction of GHG emissions by 2050 (64%) from GHG emissions in 2016, as compared to recycling approach (50% reduction) and incineration approach (46% reduction). While, recycling has been the main national goal for last 14 years as it has increased up to 17.5% by 2016, the current Malaysian government aims to establish 8 incinerators in Malaysia that will treat approximately 32% of MSW annually. However, estimations of SWM-GHG calculator and some opportunities and threats highlighted by SWOT analysis suggest the integrated approach as the best suited approach for Malaysia for achieving significant and sustainable reductions in GHG emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; GHG emissions; IPCC 2006; MSW management; Recycling; SWOT analysis","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integrated control; Mathematical instruments; Recycling; Storm sewers; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; GHG emission; Integrated approach; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Malaysia; Malaysian governments; Msw managements; Municipal solid waste (MSW); SWOT analysis; Municipal solid waste; carbon dioxide; plastic; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste management; waste treatment; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; food waste; government; gross national product; incineration; intermethod comparison; Malaysia; municipal solid waste; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management; uncertainty; wood; gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Malaysia; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Malaysia; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Malaysia; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092391825

Despite increasing reports of yield responses of crops to S fertilization, there is limited information about changes in the soil test concentrations of S. This study used a soil chemical analysis dataset from 2002 to 2014 to evaluate changes in soil S and other nutrient levels. The soil-test database comprised 8,428 topsoil samples (0–20 cm depth layer) collected from 143 farm fields located in the northwest (NW) Ohio counties of Defiance, Paulding, and Williams. Except for S, the database showed no significant changes in soil chemical properties from NW Ohio between 2002 and 2014. Soil sulfate (SO42−) levels have linearly decreased by 63% from 2002 to 2014, reaching the range of concentration considered deficient for the main cereal crops. With no changes in soil organic matter (SOM) and pH, this result was attributed primarily to enactment of air quality regulations, since soil SO42− decreases were directly correlated with the reductions of SO2 emissions (−70%), SO42− in rainwater (−66%) and deposited (−52%) in NW Ohio between the years of 2002–2013. Furthermore, combined increasing crop yields and insufficient compensation by fertilization had role on decreasing soil SO42− levels. Current fertilization practices and wet deposition of S have not been sufficient to balance S removals from soil leading to the declines in the soil test S levels. It is imperative to paid more attention to practices that maintain soil S fertility levels to avoid yield penalties associated with soil S deficiencies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","atmospheric depositions; greenhouse gases; soil sulfur fertility; sulfur levels; temporal trends; wet deposition","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Crops; Nutrients; Soil testing; Soils; Statistical tests; Sulfur dioxide; Air quality regulations; Essential nutrients; Limited information; Nutrient levels; Soil chemical property; Soil organic matters; Temporal trends; Topsoil samples; Soil pollution; crop yield; greenhouse gas; soil chemistry; soil fertility; soil nutrient; sulfur; trend analysis; wet deposition; Defiance County; Ohio; Paulding County [Ohio]; United States; Williams County [Ohio]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091146378

While previous works predominantly focused on territorial context inhibiting or driving renewable energy development, the dynamics of incumbent energy systems remain understudied. This is particularly the case for nuclear power, which epitomizes the diversity of energy trajectories in decarbonization policies, swinging between “renaissance” and “decline”. Consistent with energy geographers’ call for new research characterizing the path dependencies which strengthen incumbent systems, this paper offers to assess the spatial embeddedness of nuclear power plants by comparing the closure of two facilities in Germany (Neckarwestheim) and France (Fessenheim). The two case studies were chosen for the divergent intensities of controversies triggered locally by their shutdown. We introduce Raffestin's conception of relational territoriality, different from the behavioralist and Sackian approach previously used in energy geography, in order to identify and describe the spatial elements of nuclear power path dependencies. Results show more robust relational territorialities in Fessenheim than in Neckarwestheim. Opposition against closures appears stronger where the facility induced deeper forms of spatial embeddedness. The path dependency of nuclear power plants is co-produced by their territory preexisting spatial characteristics and social representations, the spatial transformative power of the monetary flow occasioned by the plants, the actions of the site's workers and the normative elements governing its spatial existence. However, results show no direct influence of local communities on the elaboration of national nuclear policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decommissioning; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plant; Path dependency; Relational territoriality; Transition study",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094590909

Given the primary role that agriculture has to sustain cultural values, economic opportunities, and food security, it is crucial to identify specific risks in agriculture due to climate change, which can address more effective adaptation strategies and policies to cope with climate change. This study aims to evaluate the high-resolution impacts of climate change on the length of the growing cycle and yield of durum wheat, common wheat, and maize in Italy by using the CERES-Wheat and CERES-Maize crop models implemented in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software. A digital platform (GIS-DSSAT) was developed to couple crop simulation models with dynamically downscaled climate projections at high resolution for Italy, which can better represent the Italian landscape complexity and the spatial distribution of different pedological and crop management features, providing more detailed information on the expected impacts on crops respect to previous studies at a coarser resolution. The projections have been extended for two climate change scenarios and accounting for uncertainty, either considering or not the potential direct effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]). Results show that climate change may affect Italian cereal production in the medium to long term periods. Maize is the main affected crop, with yield reductions homogeneously distributed from North to South Italy. Wheat yield is expected to decrease mainly in southern Italy, while northern Italy may benefit from higher precipitation regimes. Higher levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations may partially offset the negative impact posed by climate change and increase the benefits in the northern regions, especially for common and durum wheat. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon dioxide effect; Crop models; Decision support; GIS-DSSAT; Gridded simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108455993

Though climate change is a global existential threat, we cannot wait for nation-states to solve the problem when there are actions we can take now to protect our own communities. In Climate Stewardship: Taking Collective Action to Protect California, readers are invited on a journey to discover that all life is interconnected and shaped by climate and to learn how communities can help tackle climate change. Climate Stewardship shares stories from everyday people and shows how their actions enhance the resilience of communities and ecosystems across ten distinct bioregions. Climate science that justifies these actions is woven throughout, making it easy to learn about Earth’s complex systems. The authors interpret and communicate these stories in a way that is enjoyable, inspiring, and even amusing. California is uniquely positioned to develop and implement novel solutions to widespread climate challenges, owing to the state’s remarkable biogeographic diversity and robust public science programs.

Operating conditions constrain the NOₓ reduction performance of aftertreatment devices. This study analysed real-world NOₓ emissions, tailpipe exhaust gas temperatures, and air-fuel ratios during cold start in a closed-loop urban route, followed by hot-start real driving emissions (RDE) tests. Five Euro-6b sport utility vehicles (SUV) were tested: two gasoline vehicles with three-way catalyst (TWC), namely, one gasoline direct injection (G-DI) and one hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); three diesel vehicles with different NOₓ control systems, namely, only exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean-burn NOₓ trap (LNT), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The only-EGR- and LNT-equipped diesel vehicles and the G-DI vehicle surpassed the NOₓ Euro 6 limits in all tested sections. For the same vehicles, the total RDE emission factors were 9.0, 7.4, and 5.0 times the Euro 6 limits, respectively. In contrast, the diesel vehicle with SCR had an RDE emission factor 1.0 times the limit, and the HEV exhibited very low emissions at approximately 2 mg NOₓ km−1. However, during the cold start phase (first 5 min), the emission levels of the SCR and HEV vehicles surpassed the Euro 6 limits by 2.7 and 1.1 times, respectively. Based on the measurements at the tailpipe, the results indicate that cold start, urban driving, and cooling conditions of aftertreatment devices can lead to a decrease in the NOₓ conversion efficiency of TWC and SCR systems. The air-fuel ratio was key for the NOₓ conversion in TWC aftertreatment. The large differences between G-DI and HEV vehicles were primarily attributed to the lean and rich operations of the G-DI and HEV engines, respectively. To comply with stringent future regulations, lean-burn engines would require diesel-like aftertreatment. SCR and hybrid vehicles would require a careful aftertreatment thermal management or heating to further exploit their potential for reducing emissions in urban areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aftertreatment; Cold start; NOₓ; Passenger cars; Portable emissions measurement system (PEMS); Real driving emissions","Automobile engines; Cooling systems; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Direct injection; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Vehicle performance; Exhaust aftertreatment; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Exhaust gas temperatures; Gasoline direct injection; Operating condition; Reducing emissions; Sport utility vehicles; Three way catalysts; Hybrid vehicles; ammonia; diesel fuel; fuel; gasoline; nitric oxide; zirconium; catalyst; cooling; detection method; electric vehicle; equipment; nitric oxide; performance assessment; reduction; temperature effect; air quality; Article; car; catalyst; combustion; cooling; cross allergy; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; heat loss; heat transfer; heating; highway; priority journal; temperature; thermodynamics; urban area; velocity; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090708190

Although best available techniques (BATs) have been recommended, large uncertainties still exist due to poorly targeted site-specific approaches that might compromise their effectiveness. Here we proposed and tested a conceptual framework designed to identify most effective BATs that reduce NH3 at the site-specific level. The study was conducted in the Veneto region, northeast Italy. After the mapping of NH3 emission potential areas, BATs and business-as-usual N fertilization scenarios were assessed using a modified version of the DNDC agroecosystem model and compared with urea broadcast distribution under different pedo-climatic conditions. The most promising practices were further tested in a field experiment using a wind tunnel combined with a FTIR gas analyzer. Results showed that closed-slot injection reduced NH3 emissions with any type of mineral or organic fertilizers. Injected application, with ammonium nitrate or organic fertilizers, reduced NH3 loss in maize by 75% and 96%, respectively, and in winter wheat by 87% and 98%, compared to surface broadcast. Injection was the most promising technology to support, being already available to farmers. However, some increase in nitrate leaching was observed, mostly in case of winter wheat (+24% for AN injection; +89% for organic fertilizers). By contrast, urea incorporation with hoeing, the most common technique used by farmers in spring crops, did not show satisfactory results, because the partial burial of urea caused strong NH3 emissions that were even higher compared to surface broadcast. Recommended NH3 reduction techniques should be tailored to local pedo-climatic and management conditions, and evaluated, in a holistic approach, considering all N fluxes in the environment. © 2020","Best available techniques; Fertilizer incorporation; Fertilizer injection; Mineral fertilizers; Stakeholder involvement","ammonia; ammonium nitrate; fertilizer; mineral; nitrogen; organic fertilizer; rain; urea; ammonia; fertilizer; nitrogen; agrometeorology; ammonia; climate conditions; fertilizer application; holistic approach; leaching; strategic approach; adsorption; agricultural worker; agroecosystem; air pollution; Article; best available technique; cation exchange; climate; conceptual framework; crop management; cropland; fertilization; field experiment; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; image analysis; Italy; maize; nitrate leaching; particle size; pH; simulation; soybean; temperature; volatilization; weather; winter wheat; agriculture; Europe; soil; volatilization; Italy; Veneto; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Ammonia; Europe; Fertilizers; Italy; Nitrogen; Soil; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092647792

These approaches, based largely upon behaviour change theories, have been criticised for their limited reach and effectiveness by practice theorists who have offered an alternative approach, broadening the focus beyond individuals. While practice theory has provided valuable insights into the energy consuming activities of households it has gained limited traction as a way to analyse and inform government practices and policy making. We address this by applying a practice lens to climate change community engagement practices performed by Australian local governments. Drawing on 29 interviews with practitioners and analysis of 37 Australian local government climate strategies, we examine the bundle of practices that constitute climate change community engagement: recruitment, engagement and evaluation. We consider how these practices are situated vis‐a‐vis other climate governance practices (regulation, service delivery, infrastructure provision and advocacy) as well as internal local government processes. Using a practice lens reveals the weaknesses in current engagement approaches which we contend are limiting efficacy. We draw upon Spurling et al.’s conceptualisation of re‐crafting, re‐integrating and substituting practices to consider how climate change community engagement practices might be reconfigured to improve their effectiveness. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on new mass-flow data, we perform a life cycle assessment that includes the recovery of iron, stainless steel, aluminium, copper, lead, silver and gold. Fraction-specific modelling allows for investigating the effect of the metal fraction quality on the subsequent secondary metal production as well as examining further metal recycling potentials in the residual IBA. In addition, the implications on the landfill emissions of IBA residues to water were quantified. The impact assessment considered climate change, eco- and human toxicity and abiotic resource depletion as indicators. Results indicate large environmental savings for every impact category, due to primary metal substitution and reduction of long-term emissions from landfills. Metal product substitution contributes between 75% and &gt;99% to these savings in a base scenario (1′000-year time horizon), depending on the impact category. Reductions in landfill emissions become important only when a much longer time horizon was adopted. The metal-based analysis further illustrates that recovering heavy non-ferrous metals – especially copper and gold – leads to large environmental benefits. Compared to the total net savings of energy recovery (215 kg CO2-eq per tonne of treated waste, average Swiss plant), enhanced metal recovery may save up to 140 kg CO2-eq per tonne of treated waste. © 2020 The Authors","Bottom ash treatment; Landfill emissions; Life cycle assessment; Metal recycling; Resource quality; Thermo-recycling; Waste management","Aluminum coated steel; Artificial life; Ash handling; Ashes; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Copper; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gold; Industrial waste treatment; Land fill; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Waste incineration; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Impact assessments; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Metal substitution; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Resource depletion; Treatment plants; Metal recovery; aluminum; copper; gold; iron; lead; silver; stainless steel; bottom ash; copper; emission; gold; incineration; landfill; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; performance assessment; recycling; waste management; waste treatment; abiotic resource depletion; Article; bottom ash; climate change; controlled study; ecotoxicity; enhanced metal recovery; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; human; incineration; landfill; leaching; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; recycling; Switzerland; fly ash; incineration; solid waste; waste disposal; Switzerland; Coal Ash; Humans; Incineration; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094171734

One area in which to improve performance is in the use of low embodied energy construction materials. Rammed earth (RE) is often considered to be one such material. However, many modern RE variations incorporate cement: a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions. RE materials with low greenhouse gas emissions have been developed as replacements for conventional construction materials. In this series, we examine the strength development, durability and sustainability, via life cycle assessment, of these new materials. This paper explores the cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions of RE materials incorporating recycled waste (crushed brick and concrete), industrial by-products (ground granulated blast furnace slag, fly ash and silica fume) and either NaOH or hydrated lime. These are then compared to construction techniques conventionally used in Australia (cavity brick and brick veneer). Attributional life cycle assessments were carried out for hypothetical building envelopes suitable for climate zones 1–7, assuming construction in metropolitan Perth and 600 km inland (Kalgoorlie, WA). Results showed that greenhouse gas emissions per vertical square metre of wall could be reduced by 73% or 57% respectively when compared to traditional cavity brickwork or brick veneer. This is in contrast to RE incorporating cement, which produced a saving of just 15% compared to brick veneer. If this construction technique were adopted across Australia for new, detached dwellings constructed during 2021–2030, this could represent a greenhouse gas reduction of 11.3 million tonnes CO2eq, or 1.2–1.3% of the cumulative emissions reductions required in 2021–2030 to meet Australia's Paris Agreement targets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali-activation; Circular economy; Earth building; Geopolymer; Industrial waste products; Recycled materials; Sustainability; Sustainable building","Blast furnaces; Brick construction; Cements; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Gas hydrates; Greenhouse gases; Hydrated lime; Industrial emissions; Lime; Lime brick; Recycling; Silica fume; Slags; Sodium hydroxide; Solar buildings; Veneers; Construction technique; Conventional constructions; Greenhouse gas reductions; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Industrial by-products; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Stabilised rammed earths; Strength development; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096168845

The soil seed bank as a recruit reservoir is a limiting factor for natural forest regeneration of such secondary forests and is decisive for the formation and restitution of the post-disturbance community. The aim of this study was to compare the composition of the soil seed bank along a natural regeneration chronosequence from the Caxiuanã National Forest, eastern Amazon, including old-growth reference sites. We sampled standing vegetation, soil properties and soil seed banks and compared the density and species richness of different life forms among different regeneration stages. Using nonmetric, multiple scaling, we compared the composition of the soil seed bank among different regeneration stages and with standing vegetation composition. Furthermore, we outlined the influence of stand age, vegetation structure and soil properties on the density, richness and functional characterization of the soil seed bank using mixed effect models. The soil seed bank was dominated by herb seeds in all regeneration stages, and the density and richness of tree seeds increased with regeneration time and recovery of vegetation structure. Seed bank composition changed gradually with regeneration advance and differed from standing vegetation, containing a high amount of allochthonous seeds, especially in older stands. This observation highlights the importance of dispersal and habitat connectivity for the natural regeneration of these secondary forests.

Recent research highlights the importance of reducing CO2 emissions in combination with implementing local management actions to support reef health and recovery, particularly actions that protect sites which are more resilient to extreme events. Resilience assessments quantify the ecological, social, and environmental context of reefs through the lens of resilience, i.e., the capacity of a system to absorb or withstand stressors such that the system maintains its structure and functions and has the capacity to adapt to future disturbances and changes. Resilience assessments are an important tool to help marine managers and decision makers anticipate changes, identify areas with high survival prospects, and prioritize management actions to support resilience. While being widely implemented, however, there has not yet been an evaluation of whether resilience assessments have informed coral reef management. Here, we assess the primary and gray literature and input from coral reef managers to map where resilience assessments have been conducted. We explore if and how they have been used to inform management actions and provide recommendations for improving the likelihood that resilience assessments will result in management actions and positive conservation outcomes. These recommendations are applicable to other ecosystems in which resilience assessments are applied and will become increasingly important as climate impacts intensify and reduce the window of opportunity for protecting natural ecosystems. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate change; Coral reef; Coral reef management; Monitoring; Resilience assessment","climate effect; conservation management; coral reef; ecosystem resilience; management practice; survival; climate change; coral reef; grey literature; human; manager; review; animal; Anthozoa; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; probability; Anthozoa; Animals; Anthozoa; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Probability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092492132

The nano-crystalline ferritic regions that make up the white etching area (WEA) are formed by crack surface rubbing leading to complete decomposition of the initial microstructure by severe plastic deformation. In order to analyze local carbon compositions on µm-nm length scales, we employ electron probe microanalysis, transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. We focus on a 100Cr6 wind turbine gearbox bearing which failed in service due to extensive formation of WEC networks below the raceway surface and subsequent spalling. Our results show a significantly lower carbon content in the WEA as compared to the nominal alloy composition. At the same time, we find carbon deposits with a carbon content of > 85 at%, which are heterogeneously distributed across WEAs. We explain this observation by assuming segregation of excess carbon from the WEA to the open crack surfaces during crack surface rubbing. Further, the presence of a “lubricating” carbon film at the WEC surfaces might explain the accelerated failure by WECs as compared to classical rolling contact fatigue. © 2020","atom probe tomography; bearing steels; crack propagation; rolling contact fatigue; White etching cracks","Carbon films; Electron probe microanalysis; Etching; Failure (mechanical); High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Probes; Surface segregation; Alloy compositions; Atom probe tomography; High carbon steels; Initial microstructures; Rolling contact fatigue; Severe plastic deformations; White etching areas; Wind turbine gearboxes; Cracks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096840713

However, its life-cycle environmental impacts should be accounted for during the design phase. This paper presents the first methodology to calculate the product environmental footprint (PEF) and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) based on a unified technical modeling framework of ground-mounted, grid-connected PV power plants. To test the model, we determined the single- and multiobjective optima of 8 main balance-of-system design parameters applying a genetic algorithm for a case study of two geographical locations with distinct solar resources. Results show that impacts can be reduced by 1–13% in each of the 16 different PEF environmental impact categories. Unfortunately, the different types of impacts cannot be reduced simultaneously with a single design solution, calling for the use of a weighted environmental footprint as the most favorable single-score environmental indicator. Pareto-optimal design solutions for multiple objectives show that increasing the AC/DC ratio, row distance, tilt angle, and cable losses compared to the economic optimum is beneficial for carbon and environmental footprint reduction. By accepting a small cost increase, the majority of the potential impact reduction can be achieved. Trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives are analyzed by assigning a price tag to environmental impacts. Based on the proposed weighting scheme, regions with polluting electricity production mix should choose the most profitable plant design for the largest environmental benefit. In other places eco-design could lead to a 1% overall impact reduction for just 0.1% extra cost. Balancing power requirements, copper recycling scenarios, the uncertainty of ecological impacts, and combined land use are identified as future research areas. © 2020 The Author(s)","Ecodesign; Genetic algorithm; Grid-connected photovoltaic plants; Life-cycle assessment; Multi-objective optimization; Product environmental footprint","Cost reduction; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Land use; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power plants; Environmental footprints; Environmental indicators; Environmental objectives; Geographical locations; Grid-connected PV power plants; Levelized cost of electricities; Life-cycle environmental impact; Photovoltaic power plant; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090739079

Our best constraints on the distribution of carbon within the upper mantle are derived from the carbon-trace element systematics of ultra-depleted glasses and melt inclusions from mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, carbon-trace element systematics are susceptible to modification by crustal processes, including concurrent degassing and mixing, and melt inclusion decrepitation. In this study we explore how the influence of these processes varies systematically with both the mantle source and melting process, thereby modulating both global and local carbon-trace element trends. We supplement the existing melt inclusion data from Iceland with four new datasets, significantly enhancing the spatial and geochemical coverage of melt inclusion datasets from the island. Within the combined Iceland dataset there is significant variation in melt inclusion C/Ba ratio, which is tightly correlated with trace element enrichment. The trends in C/Ba-Ba space displayed by our new data coincide with the same trends in data compiled from global ocean islands and mid-ocean ridges, forming a global array. The overall structure of the global C/Ba-Ba array is not a property of the source, instead it is controlled by CO2 vapour loss pre- and post-melt inclusion entrapment; i.e., the array is a consequence of degassing creating near-constant maximum melt-inclusion carbon contents over many orders of magnitude of Ba concentration. On Iceland, extremely high C/Ba (&gt;100) and C/Nb (&gt;1000) ratios are found in melt inclusions from the most depleted eruptions. The high C/Ba and C/Nb ratios are unlikely to be either analytical artefacts, or to be the product of extreme fractionation of the most incompatible elements during silicate melting. Whilst high C/Ba and C/Nb ratios could be generated by regassing of melt inclusions by CO2 vapour, or by mantle melting occurring in the presence of residual graphite, we suggest the high values most likely derive from an intrinsically high C/Ba and C/Nb mantle component that makes up a small fraction of the Icelandic mantle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Decrepitation; Heterogeneity; Iceland; Mantle; Melt Inclusions","barium; carbon; data set; degassing; heterogeneity; igneous geochemistry; mantle structure; melt inclusion; spatial analysis; trend analysis; Iceland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094144007

To elucidate the relationship between seismic wave propagation captured by various seismic methods at widely different frequencies and in highly heterogeneous zones (e.g. fractures, vuggy zones) developed in carbonate reservoirs, laboratory measurements have been conducted over a broad frequency range. However, existing laboratory methods measure the effective properties over an entire core sample. Furthermore, there are few laboratory measurements of individual fracture stiffnesses. We propose a method to indirectly estimate the local properties caused by local anomalies (e.g. fractures) in a core sample over a broad frequency range from the dynamic elastic properties of a dry core sample using synthetic seismic waveforms generated from a digital volume of the core sample. 3-D numerical simulations were conducted over a broad frequency range using a digital core model produced by X-ray computed tomography. The proposed method was applied to numerical models and two types (fractured and vuggy) of carbonate core plugs acquired in an Abu Dhabi oil field, with the frequency ranging from 200 Hz to 100 kHz in the tests. Local strain anomalies and their frequency dependencies were successfully detected in the fractured core plug. Such frequency-dependent local responses could be associated with the micromechanics of incomplete solid-solid contacts at fractures or the heterogeneity of core samples, and thus with the frequency-dependent fracture stiffness. It was also demonstrated that the heterogeneity-induced local strain in a vuggy core plug may affect the accuracy of existing low-frequency laboratory measurements. © 2020 The Author(s).

So far, few attempts have been made to combine both perspectives into plant eco-physiological strategies. Moreover, the relative contribution of different strategies to maintain both community structure and ecosystem functioning during drought has rarely been assessed. Thus, limiting our capacity to predict how extreme events caused by climate change will affect plant communities. Here, we present an integrated framework to identify plant eco-physiological strategies and to estimate their contribution to community originality (diversity of trait combinations), dominance (species relative frequency) and ecosystem functioning (productivity and evapotranspiration). We applied this framework in a tropical montane grassland in Brazil (Campos de Altitude) and found three eco-physiological strategies co-occurring in this community (S-tolerance/avoidance, CS-escape/tolerance and CR-escape/avoidance). While CS-species contributed more to dominance and functionality, CR- and S-species contributed more to originality. Therefore, all three strategies were important to support the grassland form and function. Synthesis. Plants exhibit different strategies, as well as different contributions to community and ecosystem attributes. We developed an integrated approach to both identify strategies and estimate their relative contribution. Thereby, as droughts intensify, we can better predict which plants are more likely to be lost and how their loss will impact the communities and ecosystem where they occur. This knowledge is necessary for specifying conservation priorities and for developing more efficient conservation practices. © 2020 British Ecological Society","Campos de Altitude; CSR triangle theory; dehydration avoidance; dehydration escape; dehydration tolerance; rare species; species loss; species originality","community structure; conservation management; conservation planning; dominance; drought resistance; ecophysiology; ecosystem function; environmental factor; grassland; mountain environment; plant community; tropical environment; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090561009

Policymakers and scholars debate how best to decarbonise the energy system, and what socio-economic changes might be necessary. Here we review the strengths, weaknesses, and synergies of two prominent climate change mitigation narratives: the Green New Deal and degrowth. Green New Deal advocates propose a plan to coordinate and finance a large-scale overhaul of the energy system. Some see economic growth as crucial to financing this transition, and claim that the Green New Deal will further stimulate growth. By contrast, proponents of degrowth maintain that growth makes it more difficult to accomplish emissions reductions, and argue for reducing the scale of energy use to enable a rapid energy transition. The two narratives converge on the importance of public investments for financing the energy transition, industrial policies to lead the decarbonisation of the economy, socializing the energy sector to allow longer investment horizons, and expanding the welfare state to increase social protection. We conclude that despite important tensions, there is room for synthesizing Green New Deal and degrowth-minded approaches into a ‘Green New Deal without growth’. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decarbonisation; Degrowth; Ecological economics; Green growth; Green new deal; Political ecology","carbon emission; climate change; economic growth; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; environmental protection; global warming; international organization; investment; mitigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091213530

Lasing networks made by connected multiple gain components and graphs of nanoscale random lasers (RLs) obtained from complex meshes of polymeric nanofibers are successful prototypes. However, in the reported research, mainly collective emission from a whole network of resonators is investigated, and only in a few cases, the emission from single points showing, although homogeneous and broad, spatial emission. In all cases, simultaneous activation of the miniaturized lasers are observed. Here, differently, we realize heterogeneous random lasers made of ribbon-like and highly porous fibers with evident RL action from separated micrometric domains that alternatively switch on and off by tuning the pumping light intensity. We visualize this novel effect by building for the first time replica symmetry breaking (RSB) maps of the emitting fibers with 2 μm spatial resolution. In addition, we calculate the spatial correlations of the laser regions showing clearly an average extension of 50 μm. The observed blinking effect is due to mode interaction along light guiding fibers and opens new avenues in the fabrication of flexible photonic networks with specific and adaptable activity. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","complex photonic network; electrospun fiber; random laser; replica symmetry breaking; topological optical network","Laser beams; MESH networking; Pumping (laser); Flexible photonics; Mode interactions; Photonic circuits; Polymeric nanofibers; Replica symmetry breakings; Spatial correlations; Spatial resolution; Switching activities; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099643425

These are attempted for India by considering 18 homogeneous ET0 regions formed in companion paper. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends Penman–Monteith (PM) equation for ET0 estimation, which requires information on several climate variables. The equation cannot be used in data-sparse areas where information/forecasts on one or more required climate variables is unavailable/unreliable. To address this, relevance vector regression (RVR) relationships are developed in this paper for the 18 homogeneous regions to arrive at FAO-PM estimate of ET0 from subsets of its predictor climate variables, which could be typically expected in data-sparse areas. The developed relationships are shown to be better in arriving at ET0 estimates when compared to multiple linear regression (MLR) relationships and three widely used empirical equations (Hargreaves, Mcguinness–Bordne, Priestly–Taylor). Regional trend analysis revealed that ET0 is significantly decreasing (increasing) in most regions located in north (south) India. Sensitivity of ET0 and surface runoff to changes in their predictor climate variables is determined for each region by considering third-order Taylor series approximation of their functional relationships. Key climate variable(s) that govern ET0 changes in each region are identified. Results indicate that at annual scale solar radiation and relative humidity govern ET0 changes in regions located in south and north-east India, whereas wind speed followed by relative humidity mostly influence the ET0 changes over other regions. Existence of evaporation paradox in four regions and validity of Bouchet's complementary relationship between ET0, actual evapotranspiration (ETa), and precipitation in 11 regions is also established. Significant divergence in trend of ET0 and ETa was evident in north-east India. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","Bouchet's hypothesis; Budyko hypothesis; evaporation paradox; hydrology; multivariate change points; relevance vector regression; sensitivity analysis; statistical methods","Agricultural robots; Evapotranspiration; Linear regression; Wind; Accurate estimation; Actual evapotranspiration; Complementary relationship; Evaporation paradoxes; Food and agriculture organizations; Functional relationship; Multiple linear regressions; Taylor series approximation; Climate change; cluster analysis; evaporation; evapotranspiration; fuzzy mathematics; hydrological response; multivariate analysis; regionalization; sensitivity analysis; statistical analysis; trend analysis; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090112941

Forestry and its management are determinant activities for sustainable development, specifically in the current context of urgent mitigation of climate change. In this perspective, one objective of this research was to survey the main insights from the literature about the forest and management dimensions put together, highlighting the contributions of these activities to mitigate climate change. Another objective was to explore indicators related to forest management (land, employment, output, and net emissions) in order to obtain a forest sustainability index through factor analysis. As main insights from this study, we can quote that the literature survey pinpoints the most relevant factors framing forest management: soil characteristics, ecology, ecosystems, biodiversity, deforestation, climate change, socioeconomic frameworks, local knowledge, public policies, institutional context, and new technologies. Forest indicators reveal a strong relationship between forest land, employment and output, and a weaker relation with net emissions. We concluded that there is a need for stakeholders to explore and improve the interlinkage with climate change impact, specifically with regard to improving the relationships of forestry greenhouse gas emissions impacts with forest size and output. © 2020 by the authors.

Pentagons, heptagons, and octagons are essential features of onion-like graphitic structures that could generate important properties for diverse applications such as anodes in Li metal batteries or the oxygen reduction reaction. These carbon nanomaterials are fullerenes organized in a nested fashion. In this work, we produced graphitic nano onion-like structures containing phosphorus and nitrogen (NP-GNOs), using the aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The NP-GNOs were grown at high temperature (1020 °C) using ferrocene, trioctylphosphine oxide, benzylamine, and tetrahydrofuran precursors. The morphology, structure, composition, and surface chemistry of NP-GNOs were characterized using different techniques. The NP-GNOs showed diameters of 110-780 nm with Fe-based nanoparticles inside. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that NP-GNOs are thermally stable with an oxidation temperature of 724 °C. The surface chemistry analysis by FTIR and XPS revealed phosphorus-nitrogen codoping, and several functionalities containing C-H, N-H, P-H, P-O, PO, CO, and C-O bonds. We show density functional theory calculations of phosphorus-nitrogen doping and functionalized C240 fullerenes. We present the optimized structures, electronic density of states, HOMO, and LUMO wave functions for P-doped and OH-functionalized fullerenes. The PO and P-O bonds attributed to phosphates or hydroxyl groups attached to phosphorus atoms doping the NP-GNOs could be useful in improving supercapacitor function.

We used the adaptive Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (aDGVM), which was originally developed and tested for Africa, to quantify sources of uncertainties in simulated African potential natural vegetation towards the end of the 21st century. We forced the aDGVM with regionally downscaled high-resolution climate scenarios based on an ensemble of six general circulation models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). Our study assessed the direct effects of climate change and elevated CO2 on vegetation change and its plant-physiological drivers. Total increase in carbon in aboveground biomass in Africa until the end of the century was between 18% to 43% (RCP4.5) and 37% to 61% (RCP8.5) and was associated with woody encroachment into grasslands and increased woody cover in savannas. When direct effects of CO2 on plants were omitted, woody encroachment was muted and carbon in aboveground vegetation changed between –8 to 11% (RCP 4.5) and –22 to –6% (RCP8.5). Simulated biome changes lacked consistent large-scale geographical patterns of change across scenarios. In Ethiopia and the Sahara/Sahel transition zone, the biome changes forecast by the aDGVM were consistent across GCMs and RCPs. Direct effects from elevated CO2 were associated with substantial increases in water use efficiency, primarily driven by photosynthesis enhancement, which may relieve soil moisture limitations to plant productivity. At the ecosystem level, interactions between fire and woody plant demography further promoted woody encroachment. We conclude that substantial future biome changes due to climate and CO2 changes are likely across Africa. Because of the large uncertainties in future projections, adaptation strategies must be highly flexible. Focused research on CO2 effects, and improved model representations of these effects will be necessary to reduce these uncertainties. © 2020 The Authors.

With the growth of human needs and an increase in the number of factors and the degree of negative impact on plants (changing unstable climate, including drought, decreased fertility, increased resistance of plant pathogens and pests to pesticides, cumulative effects of agrochemical load, etc.), there is a need for further development of research in the field of breeding and seed production. The development of these areas through the introduction of competitive domestic technologies based on the latest scientific achievements is the national interest of the state in the field of food security for the long term. Provision of Russian producers with high-quality domestic seeds of high reproduction for a number of crops is insufficient, which creates a threat to the country's food independence. An important factor in providing agricultural producers with domestic seeds is the development of the material and technical base of breeding and seed production, including state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment for seed preparation, since processing and preparation of seeds are today necessary conditions for improving the quality and competitiveness of domestic seed.

The transfer to the atmosphere of heat, due to the inefficiency of conversion of chemical energy into other forms of energy, and CO2 is also causing the increase of atmospheric water vapor, a stronger and more abundant greenhouse gas than CO2: all actors (heat, CO2 and H2Ov) concur to increase the temperature of the planet. Partial substitution of fossil-C can be achieved by using biomass, but that alone cannot produce all the energy and goods necessary for our society. Carbon will still be present in our future, but the solution to our problems is integrating solar chemistry and biotechnologies for using atmospheric CO2. This chapter, after an introduction to Carbon Circular Economy-CCE and CO2 utilization in Chemical Industry, considers the various options available of using solar energy for CO2 conversion into energy vectors that may allow to continue to use the existing infrastructures in transport and every-day life. Two options are considered: (i) solar-based water splitting and use of H2 for chemo-catalytic CO2 conversion using known processes, or (ii) photo-co-processing of water and CO2 to afford energy products and chemicals without H2 generation, a most innovative technology.

In this work, three electrochemical methods including galvanostatic (GS), applying constant voltage (ACV), potentiostatic (PS) were used to investigate the effect of the start-up process on the performance of biocathode. The methanogenic biocathodes for CO2 reduction were evaluated based on the kinetics, performance, morphology, and microbial community. The methane production rate of the ACV biocathode was 145% and 238% higher than that of the GS and PS, respectively. The EIS analysis indicated that the high performance of ACV biocathode was mainly due to its much low charge transfer resistance, which was only 45% of the PS and 71% of the GS. Our study concluded that enough reducing equivalents (e− or H2) are more significant for the enrichment of high-performance methanogenic biofilms than changing the potential-dependent microbial community. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Biocathode; CO2 reduction; EIS; Methane; Microbial electrosynthesis","Air cushion vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Methane; Microorganisms; Biocathodes; Charge transfer resistance; CO2 reduction; ELectrochemical methods; Microbial communities; Microbial electrosynthesis; Potential-dependent; Renewable energy storages; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080042378

In the present work, we put an emphasis on the influence of annealing twins in parent austenite grains (PAGs) and cooling rates on the discontinuity of lath martensite transformation rate in a low carbon reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steel. Lath martensite microstructure is hierarchical and the lath martensite transformation rate peaks are hierarchical during the cooling process. If the cooling rate was not high enough, the lath martensite transformation rate peaks will be divided into two groups by annealing twins in parent austenite. These transformation rate peaks in the first group were mainly caused by lath martensite transformation in the non–twin zones in the PAGs. Then, the second group mainly consisted of a single transformation rate peak, which was primarily caused by the martensite transformation in the twin zones in the PAGs. In the present work, a new “localized stress field” theory is proposed and successfully used for interpreting the classification mechanism of lath martensite transformation rate peaks and the evolution of these peaks with changing cooling rate. © 2020 The Authors","Annealing twin; Austenite reconstruction; Discontinuous martensite transformation; Lath martensite; Localized stress field; Martensite variant","Annealing; Austenite; Cooling; Martensite; Austenite grain; Classification mechanism; Cooling process; Lath martensite; Localized stress; Martensite transformations; Reduced-activation ferritic/martensitic steels; Transformation rates; Low carbon steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094313893

In this way, soundscape tools have been used in Granada as a complementary method for environmental noise characterisation where traditional noise control techniques are difficult to be carried out or give limited results. After 2016 strategic noise map and in the preparation of the new noise action plan, the city came across a great acoustic challenge in a new area located outskirts characterised by growing urbanisation, still under development, the greatest legal protection because of sensitive teaching and hospital buildings and the greatest noise exposure from nearby ring-way supporting heavy traffic flow. As quiet urban areas are not characterised by the absence of noise but for the presence of the right noise, this research intended to provide the local administration with results and proposals to transform this conflict area in a pleasant or quiet urban place.

This study aimed to explore the effects of high temperature on sugar beet (Beta vu-lgaris L.) performance at seedling stage (6–8 leaf stage) in two climatic areas of Iran, Karaj and Moghan, with different relative humidity (RH). Eight sugar beet genotypes, S1-92521, SB26, SHR.02.P4, O.T 607, S1‑92685, S1-92615, SB33-H-1 and 31714, were sown in both sites at two dates, April and July as control and high temperature stress treatments, respectively. Maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry in dark (Fv/Fm) decreased by high temperature in both sites, with genotypes S1-92521 and O.T 607 showing the highest value in stress treatment in Karaj. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), not affected by high temperature in any sites, was, in general, significantly higher in control treatment than in high temperature in the Moghan, which was attributed to high RH not the high temperature. This decreased net-photosynthetic rate (An), significantly, with genotype SB26 having the highest value in Moghan. Under control, S1-92521 showed the highest NPQ. Genotype SHR.02.P4 had the highest biomass in Karaj and under stress treatment in Moghan. Sugar beet genotypes produced higher biomass in Karaj compared with the Moghan. Finally, it was concluded that the adverse effect on sugar beet in Karaj was due to the high temperature, while in the Moghan, it was because of high RH. The genotypes S1-92521, SHR.02.P4 and SB26 were tolerant to high temperature of which the two latter had better performance under high RH condition. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Beta vulgaris; high temperature; maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry in dark; non-photochemical quenching; relative humidity; sowing date",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101430657

Ideally, the photocatalyst involved in the process of solar-to-hydrogen (STH) production should remain unaffected by the undesirable catalytic processes and charge separation and transportation taking place at its surface. In the quest of lowering down the cost of producing H2, the challenge of developing a cheaper photocatalyst material which can efficiently split water into hydrogen has become more prominent. Although, the metal-free semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN or g-C3N4), owing to its 2D architecture and apposite band-energy gap and relatively lower production cost has shown immense potential in H2 production via water splitting, yet the concerns for its low specific surface area (SSA) and rich defect density have limited its photocatalytic performance and water-splitting efficiency. This mini review features the recent research accomplishments made in the design strategies of g-CN nanostructures based on its pore texture/surface area tailoring, dimensionality tuning, band-gap modulation, defect control, metal-doping and semiconductor heterojunction formation and the corresponding application in H2 generation. The reviewing of important state-of-the-art developments and prospect of high surface area g-C3N4 can provide new avenues in designing the g-CN with high SSA for utilization in H2 evolution, fuel cell, solar cell, supercapacitor and lithium battery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Heterojunction; Hydrogen evolution; Solar energy; Water splitting","Carbon footprint; Energy gap; Fuel cells; Global warming; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Heterojunctions; Lithium batteries; Semiconductor doping; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Textures; Bandgap modulation; Charge separations; Photocatalyst materials; Photocatalytic performance; Semiconductor heterojunctions; Solar-to-hydrogen; Specific surface area (SSA); State-of-the art reviews; Hydrogen production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089432475

Such reactions may depend on explicit interactions with ions and solvent molecules that are nontrivial to characterize. Rigorously modeling explicit solvent effects with molecular dynamics usually brings steep computational costs while the performance of continuum solvent models such as polarizable continuum model (PCM), charge-asymmetric nonlocally determined local-electric (CANDLE), conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), and effective screening medium method with the reference interaction site model (ESM-RISM) are less well understood for reaction mechanisms. Here, we revisit a fundamental aqueous hydride transfer reaction - carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) - as a test case to evaluate how different solvent models perform in aqueous phase charge migrations that would be relevant to renewable energy catalysis mechanisms. For this system, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations almost exactly reproduced energy profiles from QM simulations, and the Na+ counterion in the QM/MM simulations plays an insignificant role over ensemble averaged trajectories that describe the reaction pathway. However, solvent models used on static calculations gave much more variability in data depending on whether the system was modeled using explicit solvent shells and/or the counterion. We pinpoint this variability due to unphysical descriptions of charge-separated states in the gas phase (i.e., self-interaction errors), and we show that using more accurate hybrid functionals and/or explicit solvent shells lessens these errors. This work closes with recommended procedures for treating solvation in future computational efforts in studying renewable energy catalysis mechanisms. ©",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Continuum mechanics; Ions; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; Sodium Borohydride; Solvation; Solvents; Uncertainty analysis; Aqueous phase reactions; Computational quantum chemistry; Conductor-like screening model for real solvents; Hydride-transfer reaction; Molecular dynamics simulations; Polarizable continuum model; Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics; Reference interaction site models; Computational chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100027732

In this study, we analysed 29 case studies across the Mediterranean region which describe potential success stories for the implementation of good nexus practices. We developed an analytical framework for investigating the impacts on 15 SDG targets and we also explicitly quantified the magnitude of interconnection of nexus pillars with SDGs. Our findings showed that renewable energies have a predominant role on sustainability. Moreover, to achieve the highest positive impacts on economy, environment and society, it is necessary to ensure that both people and ecosystems benefit from a minimum amount of goods/qualities as expected by specific targets like SDG 6.1–4 (clean water and sanitation) and 15.1–3 (life on land), as well as 7.2–3 (affordable and clean energy) that are strongly linked with 13.1 (climate action). We showed also that the strongest interconections between SDG and WEFE are present for the categories of renewable energy system (RED and REW). However, the analysis showed that there is a tendency to focus on a specific sector (e.g. agriculture) and that the good nexus practices implementation is not enough to understand the achievement and progress towards the SDGs. For that reason, we recommended that a more holistic nexus approach including end of supply chain options should be systematically integrated into the project design or evaluation. © 2020","analytical framework; Case studies; Mediterranean region; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystems (WEFE) nexus","Agricultural robots; Ecosystems; Renewable energy resources; Supply chains; Case-studies; Clean waters; Complex relationships; Mediterranean areas; Mediterranean region; Project designs; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Sustainable development; water; alternative energy; analytical framework; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Article; climate; controlled study; desalination; economic aspect; environmental impact; irrigation (agriculture); life; renewable energy; resource allocation; resource management; resource use efficiency; sanitation; sustainable development; sustainable development goal; waste water management; waste water recycling; water energy food ecosystems nexus; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092228143

Multiple policies have been declared and implemented by the city authority in the recent past with the hope of improving the air quality of the cities and to attain the national ambient air quality standard. This study assesses that these present policies can help to reduce air pollution in these cities as much as 20% in the optimistic assessment, which may not be sufficient to attain the clean-air goal soon. During April and May 2020, the nationwide lockdown to control the pandemic of COVID-19 has unintentionally resulted in improved air quality due to force reduction at pollution emission sources. Significant pollution emitting sectors in NCR-Delhi are still not covered in current policy measures adequately. The substantial contribution of secondary aerosol formation from its precursor gases is still not addressed in any city-specific policies. The present study attempts to assess these gaps in current air pollution control policies. A way forward is indicated to empower these two polluted metro cities to attain clean air after lifting of the lockdown for the safety of the city inhabitants. © The Author(s).","Air pollution control policy; COVID-19; Emission inventory; Kolkata; Lockdown; NCR-Delhi; PM2.5","Air quality; Quality control; Clean air; Force reductions; National ambient air quality standards; National capital regions; Policy measures; Pollution emissions; Secondary aerosols; Air pollution control; aerosol formation; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; environmental impact assessment; local government; pollution control; Delhi; India; Kolkata; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100414805

While the spatial variability of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and nitrous oxide (N2O) on the plot scale can hardly be explained, there is first evidence that methane (CH4) consumption covaries with CO2 fluxes in upland forest soils. Yet, if this spatial correlation is persistent over time is unclear. We studied the spatial variability in soil respiration (CO2 fluxes) and soil CH4 consumption in a homogenous, planted forest on an 800 m2 plot. The study was repeated after two weeks at sampling points next to those of the first study. Both studies showed that CH4 consumption was higher at locations with higher soil respiration, and that the correlation between CH4 consumption and soil respiration was persistent between the studies. This result agrees with the interpretation of the rhizosphere as most important source of soil CO2 and potentially preferred habitat for methanotrophic bacteria. The correlation found in the first study allowed predicting CH4 consumption rates of the second study based on the observed CO2 fluxes at the new measurement locations with a standardized root-mean-square error (SRMSE) of 26%. Since soil respiration measurements are much easier to conduct, they would be a good means to complement the more laborious and cost-intensive measurements of CH4 consumption in order to get a more comprehensive estimate of the representative CH4 consumption of a site. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Mean square error; Nitrogen oxides; Consumption rates; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas fluxes; Measurement locations; Methanotrophic bacteria; Root mean square errors; Spatial correlations; Spatial variability; Soils; carbon dioxide; methane; methanotrophy; microbial activity; nitrous oxide; rhizosphere; soil emission; soil respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090581928

The best and most timely responses against climate change are suitable adaptation measures. Accurately perceiving the risks associated with climate change is an essential factor for planning and then implementing adaptations. Using farm household-level data of 400 rainfed farmers collected through a well-designed and field-tested questionnaire, this study examines the association between various adaptation stages (climate risk perceptions, adaptation planning, and implementation of adaptation) and their determinants using a multivariate probit (MVP) model. The findings indicate that farmers’ perceptions of climatic changes are in line with historical climatic data. Climate risk management (CRM) trainings and digital agriculture extension and communication (DAEC) services (indicators of formal institutional arrangements) show a highly significant impact on all adaptation stages. Input market distance, farmer cooperative meetings (an indicator of informal institutional arrangement), off-farm income, education, and number of male family members are among the other key determinants. A highly significant association between various adaptation stages indicates that accurate climate risk perceptions lead to planning and implementation of adaptations. When risk perceptions are underestimated or lacking, then adaptations do not occur. The results further indicate that the timely availability of reliable information on advanced agricultural inputs, weather parameters, crop farming advisory services, and market information could help rainfed farmers devise sound adaptations to minimize risks associated with climate change. The study recommends the provision of CRM trainings and DAEC services to provide a better understanding and promote sound adaptation planning through the adaptive capacity enhancement of rainfed farming communities for sustainable production and livelihood security. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation planning; Climate risk management trainings; Digital advisory services; Pakistan; Rainfed; Risk perceptions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101348037

Qualitative, primary data were collected from a random sample of 189 small farmers, supplemented with 28 key informants, from across Guyana's five main rice-producing regions. The most prevalent perception related to precipitation among farmers is an increase in rainfall year-round (56%), while for informants, it is an increase in rainfall intensity (81%). When considering the atmospheric conditions of temperature and humidity, farmers (88%) and informants (96%) overwhelmingly perceive warmer conditions. Considering weather and climate volatility, farmers (72%) and informants (82%) most prevalently perceive an increase in excess rainfall/flooding, but secondly, farmers (58%) and informants (71%) communicated a perceived increase in drought. Secondary quantitative hydroclimate data support the perception of a wetter climate, and to some degree, increased hydroclimatic volatility. Precipitation is critical to rice cultivation, and the data sets, combined, signal a wetter Guyanese climate, which has major economic implications for small farmers, the broader rice industry, and the economy of Guyana. However, granularity in farmers’ perceptions suggests a need for more detailed hydroclimate monitoring across Guyana. Thus, strengthening the Guyanese Hydrometeorological Service to support improved spatial and temporal monitoring and collection of primary weather data would be a wise investment in short- and long-term climate mitigation efforts. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture; Guyana; Hydroclimate; Key Informants; Perceptions; Rice; Small Farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109660245

Millions of people die each year because of reasons directly or indirectly related to air pollution. Effective strategies to counter the harmful effects of air pollution are an imperative need of the times. The responses to the air pollution problems are usually knee-jerk reactions, which don’t help in the long run. For developing an effective counter-strategy for combating air pollution, it is necessary to focus the efforts on the pollutants that are most responsible for the air pollution. This paper focuses on identifying the pollutant that plays the most important role in defining the Air Quality Index of a region and also attempts to establish the trend patterns followed by the identified pollutant. This will help the decision makers to devise counter-strategies well in advance for countering the harmful effects of the main pollutant thereby helping to reduce air pollution. © 2021 IEEE","Air Quality; Air Quality Index; Feature Importance; Random Forest","Cloud computing; Data Science; Decision making; Air quality data; Air quality indices; Decision makers; Harmful effects; Pollution problems; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103858287

Per agreement with the evidence evaluation recommendations of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, only systematic reviews could result in a new or revised treatment recommendation. Systematic reviews performed for this 2020 CoSTR for pediatric life support included the topics of sequencing of airway-breaths-compressions versus compressions-airway-breaths in the delivery of pediatric basic life support, the initial timing and dose intervals for epinephrine administration during resuscitation, and the targets for oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in pediatric patients after return of spontaneous circulation. The most controversial topics included the initial timing and dose intervals of epinephrine administration (new treatment recommendations were made) and the administration of fluid for infants and children with septic shock (this latter topic was evaluated by evidence update).

The book draws out policies and practices with both national and local examples, which will demonstrate various complementary approaches that are empowering states and people as they seek to pursue the carbon neutral goal. The author delineates a climate crisis economics approach that is fit for purpose and which can help achieve necessary climate change goals in the decades ahead. Ensuring economic and ecological sustainability is neither easy nor cost-free; there is no single solution to the climate crisis. All aspects of our economies, policies, business, and personal practices must come into alignment in order to succeed. Frustratingly, we know what is needed and we have many of the technologies and systems to make the leap to a carbon neutral economy, yet we still fail to act with alacrity. Leaders, communities, and businesses must shift their narratives in how they talk about and think about the climate crisis. In doing so, in making the narrative leap to a new understanding about what is possible and necessary, we can stop endangering our common future and single, fragile, global habitat, and instead set the stage for Green Globalisation 2.0 and a new, sustainable industrial revolution. Climate Crisis Economics will appeal to academics, students, investors, and professionals from varying disciplines including politics, international political economy, and international economics.

This climate–conflict scholarship, however, has involved divergent findings, sometimes strident disagreement, and resulting limits to the usability of the scholarship for policymakers and practitioners. This viewpoint essay draws from recent expert assessments of climate–conflict linkages to position the research field among climate change research and assessment more broadly. We explore potential insights from the climate realm. As is often the case for climate change research, science–society dynamics are inherent in scholarship on climate and conflict. They contribute to contestation about the state of knowledge, the best ways to characterize it, and its implications for societal choices and investments. Our critique is grounded in the literature evaluating policy-relevant climate change assessment across diverse disciplines, from sea-level-rise adaptation science to energy-system modeling. Through comparisons with such fields, this perspective article considers several implications for climate–conflict knowledge production. We examine, in particular, the necessity of integrating diverse lines of evidence to understand the risks of responding to societally relevant uncertainties and priorities, and of encouraging interactions among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The experiences of other climate change disciplines can provide inspiration for potential directions for climate, conflict, and security scholarship. They include risk framings in integrating underlying evidence, through to options for supporting the interactions among researchers and societies. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate change; conflict; science-policy interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097596355

Within widespread recognition of the need to link sustainable livelihoods approaches with climate change adaptation, there is growing awareness of the importance of people-centered approaches which keep the diverse experience, capabilities, and knowledges of the most vulnerable at the heart of sustainable livelihoods thinking. In response, this paper explores the conditions for changes in modes of livelihoods in a case study area where top-down strategies for sustainable livelihoods are met with residents’ diverse experiences of vulnerability, and where climate and environmental changes shape residents’ relations with the landscape. The research is undertaken via interviews with residents, farmers/fishers, and local government officials. Our study finds that whilst government-led initiatives for sustainable livelihoods are welcomed in the locality, inflexible policies can make it challenging for the most vulnerable people to access support. Moreover, residents see the capacity to live with and respond to extreme weather events as a critical component of maintaining a sustainable livelihood. Our findings reinforce international literature, showing that ‘the poor’ are not a homogenous category, and illustrate the importance of attention to the smallest levels of government who are tasked with putting sustainable livelihoods initiatives into practice in relation to people’s daily lives. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; Coastal communities; Quang Nam Province; Sustainable livelihoods; Vietnam",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092566035

The MTLBO still has two phases: Teaching phase and Learning phase. In teaching phase, all students are divided into two groups based on the mean marks of the class, the two groups present different solution updating strategies, separately. In learning phase, all students are divided into two groups again, where the first group includes the top half of the students and the second group contains the remaining students. The two groups also have different solution updating strategies. Performance of the proposed MTLBO algorithm is evaluated by 14 unconstrained numerical functions. Compared with TLBO and other several state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, the results indicate that the MTLBO shows better solution quality and faster convergence speed. In addition, the tuned extreme learning machine by MTLBO is applied to establish the NOx emission model. Based on the established model, the MTLBO is used to optimize the operation conditions of a 330 MW circulation fluidized bed boiler for reducing the NOx emissions concentration.

It is critical to determine the real culprit causing such a large increase in surface O3. In this study, 7-year surface observations and satellite retrieval data are analyzed to determine the long-term change in surface O3 as well as driving factors. Results indicate that anthropogenic emission control strategies and changes in aerosol concentrations as well as aerosol optical properties such as single-scattering albedo (SSA) are the most important factors driving such a large increase in surface O3. Numerical simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Master Mechanism (MM) model suggest that reduction of O3 precursor emissions and aerosol radiative effect accounted for 45 % and 23 % of the total change in surface O3 in summertime during 2013-2019, respectively. Planetary boundary layer (PBL) height with an increase of 0.21 km and surface air temperature with an increase of 2.1 ◦C contributed 18 % and 12 % to the total change in surface O3, respectively. The combined effect of these factors was responsible for the rest of the change. Decrease in SSA or strengthened absorption property of aerosols may offset the impact of aerosol optical depth (AOD) reduction on surface O3 substantially. While the MM model enables quantification of an individual factor's percentage contributions, it requires further refinement with aerosol chemistry included in the future investigation. The study indicates an important role of aerosol radiative effect in development of more effective emission control strategies on reduction of ambient levels of O3 as well as alleviation of national air quality standard exceedance events. © Author(s) 2021.

During the erythrocytic phase of the parasite life cycle, Plasmodium falciparum invades red blood cells, where it catabolizes hemoglobin and sequesters the released toxic heme as innocuous hemozoin crystals. Artemisinin (ART)-class drugs are activated in vivo by newly released heme, which creates a carboncentered radical that markedly reduces parasite density. Radical damage to parasite lipids and proteins is perceived to be ARTs' dominant mechanism of action. By contrast, quinoline-class antimalarials inhibit the formation of hemozoin and in this way suppress heme detoxification. Here, we combine malaria parasite assays and scanning probe microscopy of growing β-hematin crystals to elucidate an unexpected mechanism employed by two widely administered antimalarials, ART, and artesunate to subdue the erythrocytic phase of the parasite life cycle. We demonstrate that heme-drug adducts, produced after the radical activation of ARTs and largely believed to be benign bystanders, potently kills P. falciparum at low exogenous concentrations. We show that these adducts inhibit β-hematin crystallization and heme detoxification, a pathway which complements the deleterious effect of radicals generated via parent drug activation. Our findings reveal an irreversible mechanism of heme-ART adduct inhibition of heme crystallization, unique among antimalarials and common crystal growth inhibitors, that opens new avenues for evaluating drug dosing regimens and understanding growing resistance of P. falciparum to ART. © 2021 The Authors.",,"Blood; Chemical activation; Controlled drug delivery; Detoxification; Diseases; Hinges; Scanning probe microscopy; Targeted drug delivery; Carbon-centered radicals; Crystal growth inhibitors; Deleterious effects; Dominant mechanism; Equatorial regions; Malaria parasite; Plasmodium falciparum; Radical damage; Porphyrins; artemisinin; artemisinin derivative; artesunate; chloroquine; hematin; heme; hemozoin; artemisinin; artemisinin derivative; hemin; hemoprotein; antimalarial activity; Article; controlled study; crystallization; detoxification; drug activation; drug mechanism; drug structure; erythrocyte; IC50; in vitro study; nonhuman; parasite survival; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; drug effect; human; malaria; metabolism; pathogenicity; Plasmodium falciparum; Artemisinins; Crystallization; Hemeproteins; Hemin; Humans; Malaria; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Plasmodium falciparum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102943019

Unfortunately, the exploration of electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity over a wide potential window (especially low potential for high current density) still remains a grand challenge. In this study, the fabrication of bismuthene nanosheets using an in-situ electrochemical transformation strategy of monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 flakes is demonstrated. Catalyzing the CO2 electroreduction in 1 m KHCO3 aqueous solution, the bismuthene nanosheets exhibit a dramatically high formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ≈97.4% and a very large current density of −105.4 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Significantly, over a record wide potential window of 750 mV from the initial −0.65 V to the applied minimum −1.4 V, the formate FEs of the bismuthene nanosheets are always higher than 90%, outperforming state-of-the-art electrocatalysts.

The chemistry of the zoned saddle dolomite-ankerite from the Bohai Bay Basin, China, changes in a cyclic way from core to rim, reflecting a dynamic system perturbated several times from thermodynamic steady-state. The distribution of the dolomite-ankerite close to faults suggests that the cyclic evolution may be related to the faulting. Oxygen isotope ratios, relatively high precipitation temperatures (80–160°C), and association with late-stage pyrite cementation, suggest that dolomite-ankerite formation may be connected to thermochemical sulphate reduction within the hydrocarbon reservoir. The chemical zones alternate between low and high Fe-content, and show evidence of corrosion before each growth stage. The complex relation between the silicate, carbonate, and sulphur/sulphide systems can be explained in terms of open-system diagenesis, where fault rupturing triggers an influx of CO2 and thermogenic H2S. Pyrite scavenges both H2S and Fe, until all H2S is exhausted, and the aqueous Fe then builds up again from slow silicate dissolution. The Fe-content of dolomite-ankerite growth after such a perturbation therefore depends on the rate of Fe-supply from the silicate dissolution, and the length of time between the chemical perturbations.

In this study, the meteorological drought stress over the Yellow River basin (YRB) of China for the next forty years (2021–2060) is comprehensively evaluated based on meteorological simulations of eight climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) with three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is used as a metric of drought magnitude at multiple temporal scales, while the multi-threshold run analysis is conducted for the definition of drought events and derivation of drought characteristics (e.g., frequency, duration and severity). The Mann–Kendall test is adopted as a universal tool to analyse the trends in climate variables (precipitation and temperature), multi-temporal SPEI drought indices and drought characteristics (duration and severity). Our preliminary conclusions include that partially increasing precipitation and generally rising temperature are likely to be seen in the YRB from 2021 to 2060. More importantly, a warmer YRB may undergo either a nearly regular atmospheric regime (e.g., comparable to the baseline period of 1961–2000) with RCP2.6 scenario or significantly drying processes with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Meanwhile, the enhanced spatiotemporal variability/heterogeneity of meteorological forcing (e.g., precipitation and temperature) and drought characteristics (e.g., magnitude, frequency, duration and severity) would also increase future uncertainty of meteorological drought stress over the YRB, such as the encounter of drought with long duration and/or high severity and relevant increasing trends. Understanding the spatiotemporal influences of specific climate and emission scenarios on projected drought vulnerability might help improving our knowledge of climate-human interactions and selecting rational development strategy (like the low emission scenario of RCP2.6 or so) for regional adaptation to future climate change. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; CMIP5; drought; Mann–Kendall; SPEI; Yellow River basin","Climate change; Drought; River basin projects; Watersheds; Comprehensive analysis; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Development strategies; Drought characteristics; Future climate scenarios; Meteorological drought; Meteorological simulations; Spatiotemporal variability; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; drought; environmental stress; evapotranspiration; precipitation assessment; river basin; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Yellow River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093506057

The composite films show strong intermolecular force compared to the PI films which leads to excellent tensile strength and thermal conductivity. The composite films can be transformed into carbon films and graphite films by carbonization and graphitization. The GO-COOH can induce the graphitization process and compensate the defects. The thermal conductivity of graphite films prepared by composite films graphitized at the same temperature is higher compared to that of PI films. The addition of GO-COOH has great effects on reducing carbonization and graphitization temperature and improving property of films. The graphite films treated with 2500 °C possess smoother surface and the color of graphite films turn into dark grey. The films can keep the integral state and bend to a certain extent which exhibits that the flexibility of the graphite films is improved.

However, the exploitation of rare earths not only promoted the social and economic development, but also produced negative environmental externalities, so the relevant departments issued policies and regulations to carry out pollution control work. This paper made a macroanalysis of China firstly. And then this paper took Jiangxi province as the main research area, which compared with Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Sichuan and Fujian. This paper used the method of non-radial SBM to measure policy execution efficiency. Based on calculating the social and economic development indicator, economic development and social development indicator, this paper explored the feedback correlation of policy execution efficiency and the development of society and economy by grey relational analysis. The results showed that China reduced its dependence on rare earth resources. However, the efficiency of policy implementation needs to be improved. Effective implementation of rare earth industry policy has a feedback effect on social and economic development. From the perspective of case analysis, the implementation efficiency of vegetation destruction policy in Jiangxi province is higher than that of air pollution policy. The overall policy implementation efficiency of Jiangxi province has a strong feedback effect on the overall level of social and economic development, among which the air pollution and water pollution policy implementation efficiency has a relatively obvious feedback effect on social and economic development. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Air pollution; Climate change; Economics; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Feedback; Pollution control; Rare earths; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Development policies; Economy and society; Grey relational analysis; Policy implementations; Rare earth industry; Rare-earth resources; Social and economic development; Vegetation destruction; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099598678

A growing body of literature indicate that the structure of the microbiota community closely correlates with methane yield during AD. The correlations between methane yield and the relative abundance (RA) of microbial community, however, is mainly qualitative. The goal of this research was to collate the published data to determine the quantitative nature and extent of such correlations. Available literature on AD providing methane yields and microbiota RA, suitable for the random model, were gathered from the web of sciences and other available data bases for the meta-analyses and meta-regressions. In total, 1140-case studies, comprising 846 mesophilic and 246 thermophilic-AD processes, were used in the analysis. Data heterogeneity indicated that the RA of microbiota against methane yield of AD were different at different operating conditions. The main bacteria significantly determining methane yield, during AD processes, were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. A unit increase (%) in the RA of Firmicutes resulted in about 2.9 mL g−1[VS] improvement in CH4 yield in non-stable mesophilic digesters, while the same improved CH4 yield by 4.5 mL g−1[VS] in stable mesophilic digesters. In stable mesophilic AD, a unit increase (%) in the RA of Bacteroidetes significantly improved CH4 yield by 7.0 mL g−1[VS] and by roughly 4.8 mL g−1[VS] in non-stable mesophilic digesters. Significant decline in CH4 yields corresponded to increases in the RA of two bacteria phyla (Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria) commonly related to overloaded digesters. In this regard, a unit increase (%) in Actinobacteria indicated a significant reduction in CH4 yield (18.7 mL g−1[VS]) in non-stable mesophilic digesters, while a unit increase (%) in Proteobacteria indicated around 4.9 mL g−1[VS] decline in CH4 yield in stable mesophilic digesters. The major archaea significantly contributing to CH4 yield were Methanosarcina indicating CH4 yields improvements ranging from 2.0 to 3.0 mL g−1[VS] for each percent increase in the RA of Methanosarcina, in either mesophilic or thermophilic digesters. The RA of other minor microbiota groups did not statistically correlate with CH4 yield. The HRT and OLR tended to positively correlate with the RA of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Methanosarcina. © 2020","Anaerobic digester; Archaea; Bacteria; Mesophilic; Meta-analysis; Thermophilic","Bacteria; Methane; Anaerobic digestion process; Data heterogeneity; Different operating conditions; Growing bodies; Microbial communities; Proteobacteria; Relative abundance; Thermophilic digesters; Anaerobic digestion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089360559

The development of electric vehicles will lead to an increase in electricity demand. Because electricity is mostly generated by thermal power in China, primary energy consumption will also increase. This study sets two scenarios: with the electric vehicle policies scenario (REN) and without the electric vehicle policies scenario (FOS) to compare electric vehicle policy’s impact. We quantified the health benefits of the electric vehicle policies in the BTH region by using an integrated assessment framework. Compared with scenario FOS, the local PM2.5 emission will reduce by 11.38%, 15.12%, 22.27%, and the concentration will reduce by 18.84%, 20.04%, and 19.57% in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei separately by 2030 in REN.

An interesting phenomenon associated with this process is the self-induced explosion of the drop, producing a multitude of smaller secondary droplets, which promotes overall fuel atomization and, consequently, improves the combustion efficiency and reduces emissions of liquid-fueled engines. Here, we study a unique explosive gasification process of a tricomponent droplet consisting of water, ethanol, and oil (""ouzo""), by high-speed monitoring of the entire gasification event taking place in the well-controlled, levitated Leidenfrost state over a superheated plate. It is observed that the preferential evaporation of the most volatile component, ethanol, triggers nucleation of the oil microdroplets/nanodroplets in the remaining drop, which, consequently, becomes an opaque oil-in-water microemulsion. The tiny oil droplets subsequently coalesce into a large one, which, in turn, wraps around the remnant water. Because of the encapsulating oil layer, the droplet can no longer produce enough vapor for its levitation, and, thus, falls and contacts the superheated surface. The direct thermal contact leads to vapor bubble formation inside the drop and consequently drop explosion in the final stage. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

However, since the previous studies have largely neglected the operational process of innovation activities and the existence of spatial effect in carbon emissions, the impact of technology innovation on mitigation needs to be further investigated. Based on the sample of regional-level dataset in China during the period from 1998 to 2015, we first estimate the regional innovation system efficiency (RISE) with employing Data Envelopment Analysis window technique. Moreover, by adopting spatial econometric approaches, we further examine the direct effect and spatial spillover effect of RISE on CO2 intensity in China during the study period. The results show that there exist remarkable spatial spillover effects of CO2 intensity in China. Interestingly, RISE spatial agglomeration has higher spatial spillover effects on CO2 intensities between two remote areas than between neighbors. More importantly, RISE can facilitate CO2 intensity reduction at national level, whereas in across eastern-western and central-western regions, RISE in one region within a particular area can reduce its CO2 intensity while increasing those of other regions in the other area. Finally, some policy suggestions are identified to reduce CO2 intensity in China. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon dioxide intensity; China; Data envelopment analysis; Regional innovation system efficiency; Spatial spillover effect","agglomeration; carbon dioxide; data envelopment analysis; econometrics; energy planning; innovation; operations technology; reduction; spillover effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078273719

In this context, it is important to examine the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and decoupling analysis are commonly used assessment methods for regional sustainable development. Each method has a particular emphasis: the former focuses on long-term trends and the latter on short-term change. Integrating the EKC hypothesis with decoupling analysis is helpful to diagnose the relationship between economic growth and the carbon emissions of the manufacturing industry from the perspective of long-term trends and short-term changes. The results showed that the EKC passed the inflection point for both China’s entire manufacturing industry and manufacture of nonmetallic mineral product subsector (MNM), but not in the other four main subsectors from 1995 to 2017. Strong decoupling, weak decoupling, and expansive coupling were observed between CO2 emissions and the value added in China’s entire manufacturing industry, in which weak decoupling accounted for the largest proportion. The decoupling index showed a downward trend on the whole. The decoupling status of subsectors from 1995 to 2017 was mainly weak decoupling, but different subsectors also showed characteristics of differentiation. At present, integrating EKC with decoupling has only occurred across the entire manufacturing industry and MNM.

However, conventional TiO2 has low energy harvesting efficiency and charge separation ability, though the recently developed black TiO2 formed under high temperature or pressure has achieved elevated performance. The phase-selectively ordered/disordered blue TiO2 (BTO), which has visible-light absorption and efficient exciton disassociation, can be formed under normal pressure and temperature (NPT) conditions. This perspective article first discusses TiO2 materials development milestones and insights of the BTO structure and construction mechanism. Then, current applications of BTO and potential extensions are summarized and suggested, respectively, including hydrogen (H2) production, carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) reduction, pollutant degradation, microbial disinfection, and energy storage. Last, future research prospects are proposed for BTO to advance energy and environmental sustainability by exploiting different strategies and aspects. The unique NPT-synthesized BTO can offer more societally beneficial applications if its potential is fully explored by the research community.

However, traditional decision approaches only rank alternative scenarios but fail to manage them. Implementing effective management for alternative MSWM scenarios can save decision costs and improve efficiency. Thus, this paper aims to construct a novel multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methodology to manage and rank sustainable scenarios. To evaluate sustainable MSWM scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation index system is constructed from five dimensions including economy, environment, society, technology, and energy. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is employed to articulate evaluation information. Given the importance of experts and the incomplete criteria weight information, an inclusion measure-based approach is proposed to obtain expert weights, and the grey relational analysis linear programming model with incomplete criteria weight information is constructed to determine criteria weights. An inclusion measure-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic multigranulation three-way decisions over two universes approach is developed to manage and rank alternative MSWM scenarios. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical case. Triple sensitivity analysis is performed from the perspectives of decision-makers’ risk appetite, expert weight fluctuations, and criteria weight fluctuations. A comparative analysis is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology. This study provides a novel insight to solve MSWM scenario selection and can extensively be applied to handle other MCGDM problems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set; Inclusion measure; Inclusion measure-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic multigranulation three-way decisions; Multi-criteria group decision-making; Sustainable municipal solid waste management","Decision making; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Linear programming; Linguistics; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Waste management; Comparative analysis; Comprehensive evaluation index system; Effective management; Grey relational analysis; Linear programming models; Multi criteria group decision making; Multi-granulations; Novel methodology; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092020532

Use of the composites would help to reduce both operational energy consumption and embodied energy of building insulation materials. In addition, use of the renewable composites could also reduce embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the insulation materials. Local production and use of the composites could stimulate residential building insulation process via additional socio-economic benefits, such as positive impact on local economy, created workplaces and reduced import. The research question of this study is to determine a difference between embodied energy and GHG emissions of the mycelium insulation material and synthetic insulation alternatives. System dynamics model is used as the method for assessment of the dynamics of the total embodied energy and GHG emissions if equal amounts of the insulation materials is produced. Time horizon for the modeling is 2021-2050. Data used in the model were taken from scientific publications and laboratory experiments with growth process and properties of the mycelium composites. The model includes several feedback effects, e.g., effect of research and development on efficiency and productivity of the mycelium production process. The results show that embodied energy of the mycelium insulation material is higher than for the synthetic alternatives but the embodied GHG emissions are considerably lower than for the alternatives. The embodied GHG emissions are even lower if the absorption of CO2 of renewable materials used for the production of the mycelium composites is included. © 2021 Ilze Luksta et al., published by Sciendo.","Bioeconomy; Energy efficiency; Insulation of buildings; Mycelium insulation material; Sustainability; System dynamics modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121911254

This study analyses the technical and economic feasibility for three types of solar photovoltaic (PV) renewable energy (RE) systems; (i) solar stand-alone, a non-grid-connected building rooftop-mounted structure, (ii) solar rooftop, a grid-connected building rooftop-mounted structure, (iii) solar farm, a grid-connected land-mounted structure in three tropical climate regions. Technical scientific and economic tools, including life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) with an integrated framework from a Malaysian case study were applied to similar climatic regions, Thailand, and Indonesia. The short-term, future scaled-up scenario was defined using a proxy technology and estimated data. Environmental locations for this scenario were identified, the environmental impacts were compared, and the techno-economic output were analysed. The scope of this study is cradle-to-grave. Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) was greatly affected due to PV performance degradation rate, especially the critical shading issues for large-scale installations. Despite the land use impact, increased CO2 emissions accumulate over time with regard to energy mix of the country, which requires the need for long-term procurement of both carbon and investment return. With regards to profitably, grid-connected roof-mounted systems achieve the lowest LCOE as compared to other types of installation, ranging from 0.0491 USD/kWh to 0.0605 USD/kWh under a 6% discounted rate. A simple payback (SPB) time between 7–10 years on average depends on annual power generated by the system with estimated energy payback of 0.40–0.55 years for common polycrystalline photovoltaic technology. Thus, maintaining the whole system by ensuring a low degradation rate of 0.2% over a long period of time is essential to generate benefits for both investors and the environment. Emerging technologies are progressing at an exponential rate in order to fill the gap of establishing renewable energy as an attractive business plan. Life cycle assessment is considered an excellent tool to assess the environmental impact of renewable energy. © 2021 by the authors.

However, whether population growth inevitably leads to air pollution is controversial. The expansion of city scale is accompanied by changes in traffic mode and traffic congestion. However, whether such expansion influences traffic and wields a significant impact on air pollution remains unknown. Thus, this research attempts to clarify the influence mechanism of city-scale expansion on air pollution and analyze the expansion of city scale, traffic, and air pollution in the same framework. First, we find that city-scale expansion can directly influence air pollution. The scale effect of energy consumption caused by such expansion significantly aggravates air pollution, whereas the structural and technological effects can effectively improve air quality. Second, green mode of transportation can reduce air pollution, whereas traffic congestion worsens air pollution by increasing the commuting time. Third, we find that the city-scale expansion can both alleviate and worsen air pollution by promoting public transport and exacerbating traffic congestion, respectively. Therefore, the effect of city-scale expansion on air quality by influencing traffic is clearly a “double-edged sword.” © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; City scale; Traffic congestion; Traffic mode","air quality; atmospheric pollution; haze; road traffic; traffic congestion; urban development; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093662608

Thus, owing to features of the built city environment, specific locations where physical activity take place may put individuals at increased risk for harmful inhaled exposures leading to decrements in lung function. Objectives: The objectives were to determine locations throughout an urban landscape where children engage in moderate to vigorous activity (MVA). We hypothesized that outdoor activity would be associated with increased exposure to air pollution and reduced lung function. Methods: Children aged 9–14 years living in New York City (NYC) (n = 151) wore global positioning system devices and wrist accelerometers for two 24-hour periods. Time-stamped global positioning system points and accelerometer data were aggregated and mapped using ArcGIS to determine locations where children engaged in MVA. Location-specific particulate matter,2.5 microns and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was determined based on land use regression models of street-level pollution. Temporal air pollution exposure was determined based on daily concentrations collected at one central site in NYC. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (FEF25–75) were collected following each 24-hour period. Data were analyzed using multivariable linear regression models to examine associations between MVA time and both lung function and air pollution in separate models. Additionally, a multiplicative interaction term (MVA time 3 season) was included to test whether the association between MVA time and lung function outcomes varied by warmer versus colder months. Results: On average, children spent less MVA time outdoors (38.2 6 39.6 min/d) compared with indoors (71.9 6 74.7 min/d, P, 0.01), regardless of season. The majority of outdoor MVA occurred along sidewalks and roadbeds (30.2 6 33.3 min/d, 76.9% of outdoor) where annual average concentrations of NO2 were relatively high. Interquartile range (IQR) increase in outdoor MVA time (44 min) was associated with higher levels of annual average NO2 (P, 0.01) but not particulate matter,2.5 microns. In warmer months, for IQR increase in outdoor MVA time, children had 1.41% lower FEV1/FVC (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 22.46 to 20.36) and 4.40% lower percent predicted FEF25–75 (95% CI, 28.02 to 20.78). These results persisted even after adjustment for location-specific annual average concentrations of NO2. No association was observed between MVA time and lung function in colder months (P . 0.05), and a formal test for interaction (MVA time 3 season) was significant (P value for interaction = 0.01 and 0.03 for FEV1/ FVC and FEF25–75, respectively). Conclusions: Children in NYC spent less time active outdoors compared with indoors. Outdoor activity was greatest near traffic sources and associated with higher annual average concentrations of NO2. In warmer months, outdoor activity was associated with lower lung function, but this association did not appear to be mediated by higher exposure to outdoor pollution during exercise.

We used data from Zhejiang Province, China, and the economic output model of four tea plant cultivars (Jiaming 1, Longjing 43, Baiye 1, and Jiukeng) in spring and the yield output model of one tea plant cultivar (Jiukeng) in summer and autumn, and analyzed the impact of climate change on tea production from 1985 to 2018. The results showed that the effects of high temperature and drought on tea production have increased significantly. Temperature was the main factor effecting the economic output of tea plants in spring. Climate change has resulted in the start date of tea buds and leaves plucking period to have become significantly earlier in spring. The risk of frost damage and economic loss, caused by frost, decreased significantly in the period of spring tea production. Among the five bud and leaf grades, the length of plucking periods for superfine, Grades 1 and 2 decreased significantly. High temperatures and drought were the main factors impacting tea production in summer and autumn, and effected the economic output of spring tea in the following year. The economic losses caused by daytime rainfall decreased significantly in spring tea production.

Recently-deglaciated terrains have been a subject of ecological studies for a long time, as they represent a unique natural model system for examining the effects of global warming associated with glacier retreat on biodiversity and the spatio-temporal dynamic of communities. However, we still have a limited understanding of how physical and biotic factors interactively influence species persistence and community dynamics after glacier retreat and glacier extinction. Using hierarchical joint species distribution models, we integrated data on plant species occurrence at fine spatial scale, spatio-temporal context, environmental conditions, leaf traits, and species-to-species associations in plant communities spanning 0 to c 5,000 years on average after glacier retreat. Our results show that plant diversity initially increases with glacier retreat, but ultimately decreases after glacier extinction. The 22% of plant species non-linearly respond to glacier retreat and will locally disappear with glacier extinction. At the local scale, soil carbon enrichment and reduction of physical (topographic) disturbance positively contribute to distribution patterns in 66% of the species, indicating a strong impact of community-level environmental conditions. Furthermore, positive and negative associations among species play a relevant role (up to 34% of variance) in driving the spatio-temporal dynamic of plant communities. Global warming prompts a shift from facilitation to competition: positive associations prevail among pioneer species, whereas negative associations are relatively more common among late species. This pattern suggests a role of facilitation for enhancing plant diversity in recently ice-free terrains and of competition for decreasing species persistence in late stages. Associated to that, species persisting the most show more “conservative” traits than species of concern. In summary, although plant diversity initially increases with glacier retreat, more than a fifth of plant species are substantially declining and will disappear with glacier extinction. Even for the “winners,” the “victory” is not to be taken for granted due to the negative impact of rising competition. Integrating survey data with hierarchical and network models can help to forecast biodiversity change and anticipate cascading effects of glacier retreat on mountain ecosystems. These effects include the reduction of ecosystem services and benefits to humans, including food production from the pioneer species Artemisia genipi. © Copyright © 2021 Losapio, Cerabolini, Maffioletti, Tampucci, Gobbi and Caccianiga.","biodiversity change; community dynamic; competition; facilitation; glacier forelands; global warming; hierarchical modeling; plant networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100956266

We used Actor-Network Theory to describe the network of actors that underlie these realities. We analyzed key documents and conducted active interviews with actors responsible for the design and implementation of these policies. Results show that the assembled network enacts an accountability reality by means of the Law on Assurance of the Quality of Education, with key devices and s-objects performing the network. However, this enacted reality is at odds with a logic of school improvement that is still defended by the Ministry of Education, an actor that is no longer the main source of translation in the network.

The peculiarities of the development of the gas-phase reaction block as a part of the heterogeneous-homogeneous model of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) are considered and approaches to the selection of kinetic parameters of elementary steps are analyzed. It has been demonstrated that kinetic models developed in accordance with the principle of “independence of kinetic parameters” can exhibit low predictive power due to existing uncertainties in the values of the parameters presented in well-known review papers and databases. In addition, the effects of the accounting of the heterogeneous reaction block and variation of the OCM reaction conditions on the results of the reduction of the detailed kinetic scheme are addressed. It has been shown that the use of reduction procedures to analyze the mechanism of complex processes is limited due to the high degree of conjugation between their individual stages and the strong dependence of kinetic constants on the parameters of state. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","elementary step; kinetic model; kinetic parameters; kinetics; mechanism; modeling; rate constant; reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102121100

Increased environmental variability and uncertainty due to climate change are creating shifts in productivity and distribution of fished species, and subsequent social-ecological impacts that require timely implementation of adaptive management strategies. Yet many proposed “climate-ready” fisheries actions – such as integrating climate factors into stock assessments and increasing flexibility in decision-making – either complicate or add to existing responsibilities of fishery managers and strain existing institutions. In the United States, many fisheries management agencies have explicitly acknowledged certain capacity shortfalls and institutional limitations to addressing current and projected impacts of climate change on marine fisheries. Many resource and capacity gaps across the adaptive fisheries management cycle could be filled through more effective fishery partnerships among management agencies, fishing industries, private sector, and academia. Partnership approaches are key to unlocking capacity for achieving climate-ready fisheries yet expanded implementation may require a shift towards a model that empowers and obligates fishery stakeholders to take on expanded roles with appropriate guidelines and oversight, while establishing increased roles for agencies as facilitators and auditors for certain tasks. Building and institutionalizing more effective fishery partnerships to achieve climate-ready fisheries will require clear guidance and enabling conditions. © 2020 The Authors","Adaptive management; Climate-ready fisheries; Fishery partnerships; Stakeholders","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision making; fishery management; fishery policy; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095999864

On the one hand, sharing bicycles facilitates people's travel and enriches the way of travel. On the other hand, sharing bicycles improves people's awareness and sense of responsibility for energy saving and emission reduction, which in turn reflects the meaning of green travel. In order to support people using shared bicycles for green travel, it is very important to optimize the configuration of bike-sharing system. The increasing amounts of free-floating bicycles give a serious challenge in parking planning. Dispatching random parking bicycles will increase vehicles workload and offset emission reduction effect of the bicycles. At this paper we discuss about the virtual stations in a free-floating bike-sharing system. Virtual stations are the focus of efficient and environmentally friendly dispatching, which enable the bike-sharing company to achieve cleaner production. We introduce the modifiable areal unit problem and propose a new method called the graded cluster system to mine virtual stations on a multiscale geographic view. The new method can generate more virtual stations more evenly. This not only makes it more convenient for people to use shared bicycles for green travel, but also dense virtual stations can make shared bicycles more visible in people's sight, strengthening people's awareness of green travel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Community detection; DBSCAN; Free-floating bike-sharing; K-means; Modifiable areal unit problem; Network formation","Cluster analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Reduction; Sporting goods; Virtual reality; Cleaner production; Cluster systems; Emission reduction; Energy saving and emission reductions; Sharing systems; Virtual stations; Bicycles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094581763

With the advancement in technology and reduction in the cost of batteries, plug-in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly attractive options for improving energy efficiency and reducing air emissions of MHDVs. In this paper, we compared the well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gases (GHGs) and criteria air pollutant emissions of MHD BEVs with their conventional diesel counterparts across weight classes and vocations. We expanded the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model to conduct the WTW analysis of MHDVs. The fuel economy for a wide range of MHDV weight classes and vocations, over various driving cycles, was evaluated using a high-fidelity vehicle dynamic simulation software (Autonomie). The environmental impacts of MHD BEVs are sensitive to the source of electricity used to recharge their batteries. The WTW results show that MHD BEVs significantly improve environmental sustainability of MHDVs by providing deep reductions in WTW GHGs, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide emissions, compared to conventional diesel counterparts. Increasing shares of renewable and natural gas technologies in future national and regional electricity generation are expected to reduce WTW particulate matters and sulfur oxide emissions for further improvement of the environmental performance of MHD BEVs. ©",,"Air pollution; Automotive batteries; Carbon monoxide; Computer software; Diesel engines; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Employment; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Sustainable development; Volatile organic compounds; Wheels; Carbon monoxide emissions; Criteria air pollutants; Electricity generation; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Heavy duty vehicles; Natural Gas Technology; Vehicle dynamic simulation; Battery electric vehicles; carbon monoxide; fuel; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; sulfur oxide; volatile organic compound; gasoline; natural gas; detection method; electric vehicle; equipment; instrumentation; air pollutant; Article; carbon footprint; comparative study; controlled study; diesel engine; economic aspect; electric power plant; electricity; energy recovery; environmental impact; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; greenhouse gas; human; motor vehicle; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; reduction (chemistry); software; urban area; air pollutant; electricity; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; technology; Air Pollutants; Electricity; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Natural Gas; Technology; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099090608

Compared with SBR2, the intermittently aerated SBR1 reached not only a higher total nitrogen removal efficiency (averaged 93.5%) but also a lower N2O-emission factor (0.01–0.53% of influent ammonia), in which short-cut nitrification and denitrification were promoted. Moreover, less accumulation and consumption of polyhydroxyalkanoates, a potential endogenous carbon source promoting N2O emission, were observed in SBR1. Batch experiments revealed that nitrifier denitrification was the major pathway generating N2O while heterotrophic denitrification played as a sink of N2O, and SBR1 embraced a larger N2O-mitigating capability. Finally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction results suggested that the abundant complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) elevated in the intermittently aerated environment played a potential role in avoiding N2O generation during wastewater treatment.

Here we present new evidence of sea surface temperature (SST) estimates and δ18O of seawater (δ18Osw, presumably salinity-driven) from the paired data of Mg/Ca and δ18O measured from planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white) in core BoB-24 collected from the central Bay of Bengal (BoB), tropical Indian Ocean. Eleven accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates on planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquedrina dutertrei from the core provide a reliable age model. Our results indicate a gradual surface warming with several short-lived fluctuations since ~42 kyr ago, and a ~3 °C cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and a ~3 °C warming from the last glacial to the Holocene. Our δ18Osw revealed an increased salinity during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2, which is likely attributable to a weakening of Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) precipitation and associated river discharge in the BoB. Our record also indicates clearly a phase of strengthening ISM during the mid-MIS 3 (37.5–32 ka) as evidenced by low foraminiferal δ18Osw values of ~0.2‰. Lower than present δ18Osw values during the Bølling/Allerød (B/A) event (14.5–12.6 ka) and the early Holocene (10–5 ka) in core BoB-24 indicate lower salinity that in turn suggest enhanced ISM precipitation and increased freshwater output from the Ganges-Meghna-Brahmaputra-Irrawaddy (GMBI) rivers together with peninsular rivers and Irrawaddy-Salween rivers from Myanmar. This study brings data evidence that implies weakened ISM was linked with Northern Hemisphere cooling events, especially during the MIS 2.

The effect of Ca/S molar ratio on the SO2 capture efficiency of clean coke was investigated, and the SO2 retention efficiency was optimized at a Ca/S molar ratio of 1.5. The sulfur retention mechanism of clean coke was attributed to: (1) CaCO3 decomposition to CaO and partial reaction of CaO with H2S to generate CaS during pyrolysis. (2) Transformation of the remaining sulfur in the clean coke to SO2 during combustion, capture by unreacted CaO to form CaSO4, and direct oxidation of CaS to CaSO4.

Notably, the interglacials in this East Asian monsoon region were abnormally warm. The results from the interval of L5-S5 of the studied Xifeng section suggest that the principal factors controlling natural fires in an interglacial period (S5) and a glacial period (L5) were fuel load and fuel moisture level, respectively. The difference between the carbon isotope composition of black carbon and soil organic carbon during S5LL1 (marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 14) was due to the fact that the former records the more positive carbon isotope values of C3 plants caused by drought and low temperatures in the fire season, while the latter records the carbon isotope of plants throughout the year. The optimum temperature and humidity conditions during S5SS1 (MIS 13) were the most conducive to fires during the interglacial period of S5.

However, it is still unclear how much energy is consumed from both fossil fuel and electricity usage for transportation sectors (TCO2 ). We take 10 sampled cities in the YRD as examples and examine their city-level sustainable levels from 1990 to 2018. Then, we observed that SHSN (Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing) are in leading positions, followed by WCN (Wuxi, Changzhou, Ningbo) and NXH (Nantong, Xuzhou, Hefei). We found that the cumulative TCO2 in SHSN from 1990 to 2018 is the highest among groups, which is mainly due to the earlier industrialization in history. In 2018, SHSN had the highest TCO2 (623.9 × 104 t), WCN was 311.9 × 104 t, and NXH was 166.4 × 104 t. TCO2 per capita in SHSN reached its minimal (≈0.12 t) in 2018 among 29 years, while WCN and NXH shared the same levels (≈0.07 t). This could be attributed to the dense population and a series of low carbon policies announced in SHSN and WCN. NXH is still in the stage of high demands on economic-centered development. The primary source for TCO2 in the YRD is fossil fuels. The TCO2 contributed by transportation electricity usage is continually increasing, especially after 2010. This phenomenon represents that electricity can be a significant part of the YRD’s transportation sectors’ energy consumption shortly. A complex estimation model uncovers the complexity between the economy, environment, and carbon emissions in the YRD, which indicated that the decrease of TCO2 in YRD could not be regulated solely by economic or environmental interventions. This study highlighted the urgency for socio-economic adjustments from carbonized to decarbonized structures in the YRD. © 2020 by the authors.

California's predominantly annual rangelands cover ∼12% of the state's land area, and the forage production is highly heterogeneous, making balancing economic (grazing), conservation (habitat) and environmental (erosion/water quality) objectives a big challenge. Herein, we examined how climate and environmental factors regulate annual grassland forage production spatially across the state and among four ecoregions using machine learning models. We estimated annual forage production at 30 m resolution over a 14 year period (2004-2017) using satellite images and data fusion techniques. Our satellite-based estimation agreed well with independent field measurements, with a R2 of 0.83 and RMSE of 682 kg ha-1. Forage production (14 year average) showed large spatial variability (2940 ± 934 kg ha-1 yr-1; CV = 35%) across the study area. The gradient boosted regression tree with 11 feature variables explained 67% of the variability in forage production across the state. Precipitation amount, especially in November (germination) and April (rapid growth), was found as the dominant driver for spatial variation in forage production, especially in drier ecoregions and during drier years. Seasonal distribution of precipitation and minimum air temperature showed a relatively stronger control on forage production in wetter regions and during wet years. Additionally, solar energy became more important in wetter ecoregions. Drought reduced forage production from the long-term mean, i.e. a 33% ± 19% decrease in production (2397 ± 926 kg ha-1yr-1; CV = 38%) resulting from a 29% ± 5% decrease in precipitation. The machine learning based spatial analysis using 'big data' provided insights on impacts of climate and environmental factors on forage production variation at various scales. This study demonstrates a cost-effective approach for rapid mapping and assessment of annual forage production with the potential for near real-time application. © 2021 The Author(s).","Data fusion; Ecosystem productivity; Gradient boosted regression trees; Rangelands; Remote sensing; Spatial variability","Balancing; Cost effectiveness; Data fusion; Machine learning; Solar energy; Topography; Boosted regression trees; Cost-effective approach; Data fusion technique; Ecological services; Environmental factors; Machine learning models; Seasonal distributions; Spatial variability; Climate models; climate change; crop production; forage; grassland soil; spatial variation; topography; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100118352

In this study, the credibility of two long-term atmospheric composition reanalysis datasets—the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA)—are evaluated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products over the SCB during 2003–2018. The time series of the three datasets at seasonal, monthly and annual scales exhibit some interesting similarities and differences, but with all of them demonstrating a prominent slowing down of the severe air pollution status over the SCB since 2012 (−0.25/7yrs for MODIS and CAMSRA and −0.12/7yrs for MERRA-2). CAMSRA shows good consistency with MODIS at all time scales (correlation coefficients varying from 0.89 to 0.97 at four seasons) despite its systematic overestimation (～0.2) throughout the 16-year study period. MERRA-2 has a negative deviation during 2003–2006 and then maintains an increasing positive deviation in the following years (0.05–0.2). This positive bias increases as MODIS AOD declines prominently from 2014. The good temporal consistency of CAMSRA is partly attributable to the bias correction of the assimilated remotely sensed AOD from MODIS and AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer). The differences between the reanalysis and MODIS are obvious during October–December, which may be related to the cloud contamination effects as well as the uncertainties of emissions in each model system. The uniform decreasing trend of the three datasets since 2012 supports the effects of the tough emissions reduction policy, which is also evident in AOD changes of anthropogenic species. It is concluded that atmospheric composition reanalysis data with good spatial and temporal coverage can be considered in future air quality analyses over the SCB. However, the bias and regional dependence should be handled carefully. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth; CAMSRA; Data evaluation; MERRA-2; MODIS; Sichuan basin","Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Emission control; Topography; Advanced-along track scanning radiometers; Aerosol optical depths; Anthropogenic species; Correlation coefficient; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Research and application; Retrospective analysis; Statistical characteristics; Radiometers; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; correction; data set; industrialization; MODIS; optical depth; time series; aerosol optical depth; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; Article; autumn; China; cloud; data analysis; physical parameters; priority journal; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; statistical analysis; statistical bias; summer; time series analysis; uncertainty; winter; China; Sichuan Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092504510

This improved model is beneficial for establishing energy-saving and CO2 emission reduction policies for both Shandong and other regions in China. Because of the lack of data on a county scale, this study applied panel data analysis from 1992 to 2017 by integrating the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and NPP-VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suit) nighttime light data. Results showed that (1) The new method performed better than previous methods on estimating fossil fuel consumption; (2) Fossil fuel consumption has been rapidly growing in all cities and most districts and counties, mainly concentrated in west and east central Shandong; (3) Regions with high fossil fuel consumption shifted from west central Shandong to east central on the city level, and expanded from the east central to the entire central region on the county level; (4) In regions with a lower level of development, fossil fuel consumption tended to grow faster.

To achieve this goal, an agreement between the Parties on reference levels (RLs) is critical. RLs have profound implications for the effectiveness of the program, its cost efficiency, and the distribution of REDD+ financing among countries. In this paper, we introduce a methodological framework for setting RLs for REDD+ applications in tropical forests in Xishuangbanna, China, by coupling the Good Practice Guidance on Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and land use scenario modeling. We used two methods to verify the accuracy for the reliability of land classification. Firstly the accuracy reached 84.43%, 85.35%, and 82.68% in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively, based on high spatial resolution image by building a hybrid matrix. Then especially, the 2010 Globeland30 data was used as the standard to verify the forest land accuracy and the extraction accuracy reached 86.92% and 83.66% for area and location, respectively. Based on the historical land use maps, we identified that rubber plantations are the main contributor to forest loss in the region. Furthermore, in the business-as-usual scenario for the RLs, Xishuangbanna will lose 158,535 ha (158,535 × 104 m2) of forest area in next 20 years, resulting in approximately 0.23 million t (0.23 × 109 kg) CO2e emissions per year. Our framework can potentially increase the effectiveness of the REDD+ program in Xishuangbanna by accounting for a wider range of forest-controlled GHGs. © 2021 by the authors.

Soil moisture is one of the most important indicators of the hydrological state of the land, the variability of which is determined by both the soil structure and the impact of atmospheric processes. Study of the state and spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture is necessary not only for solving local applied problems of agrotechnical character, but also for conducting fundamental research in the field of ecology, hydrology, meteorology, climatology, including the forecasting of global climate change. In order to increase the accuracy of resonance control devices, it is proposed to use multiparameter methods of measurement and linear frequency modulation of the signal that excites the measuring transducer. Analytical studies of the processes associated with the appearance of additional measurement errors arising from the influence of active losses in the controlled soil and the ""drift"" of resonance frequency have been carried out, and ways of reducing these errors have been identified. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Local governments and stakeholders are developing short‐term strategies and long‐term pathways towards deep decarbonization at the local level but are struggling to determine effective actions. In this article, we examine cities pursuing deep decarbonization to provide insights into the strategies and governance structures that eight leading local governments are using to develop and implement deep decarbonization plans. The cases are in Canada (Bridgewater, Guelph, Vancouver and Toronto), the USA (Park City and New York City), Finland (Lahti), and Norway (Oslo) and range from very small (8.4 thousand people) to very large (9.6 million people). For each city, their implementation strategies are detailed under four categories: engagement; green economy; policy tools; and financial tools. Governance mechanisms and modes are explained regarding coordination; oversight and reporting; communication; multi-level integration; cross‐sector collaboration; funding, and mode. While a number of these approaches and tools have been identified in previous research and grey literature, the findings show that leading local government plans continue to develop innovative strategies on their own and also share their successes with other communities through transnational networks. The cases examined in this study are moving beyond the incremental approach to mitigating greenhouse gases and are innovating to find applied methods for achieving transformative change. The findings from this study are useful for practitioners and academics working on climate mitigation, strategy implementation, cross‐sector partnerships, and sustainable cities. © 2020 by the authors.

Conventional routes to produce the Mn units used for steelmaking are energy- and capital-intensive. Therefore, a novel methane-based solid-state reduction process for manganese ore pellets is under investigation. It was found in preliminary tests that the reduction of ore pellets by methane was limited by gas transport to the pellet interior. To enhance the reducibility of Mn ore pellets, this study aimed at improving pellet porosity through adjustment of Mn ore powder particle size and the addition of limestone, which thermally decomposes to CaO and CO2. The change in compressive strength with an increase in pellet porosity was also studied. It was found that the increase in porosity as a result of limestone addition improves the reducibility of pellets and decreases the pellet strength. The effect of particle size on pellet reducibility was, however, more complicated because of the simultaneous change in the total surface area and sintering behavior of the particles. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",,"Calcium oxide; Compressive strength; Lime; Limestone; Manganese steel; Methane; Ore reduction; Particle size; Pelletizing; Porosity; Sintering; Tensile strength; Critical properties; High manganese steel; High-tensile strength; Pellet reducibility; Porosity development; Sintering behaviors; Solid state reduction; Total surface area; Ore pellets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095998228

However, our understanding of how a plant-microbiome system responds to pre-planting soil management remains limited. Here, continuous labeling with 13CO2 gas combined with stable isotope probing (SIP) was applied to explore bacterial utilization of plant-derived carbon (C) in the tomato rhizosphere as affected by biochar amendment or reductive soil disinfestation (RSD). Our results showed that RSD treatment strongly shaped the soil bacterial community composition, while biochar soil amendment had little impact on the community in the rhizosphere of tomato. We observed that the bacterial community in the RSD treatment, which actively utilized plant-derived C, belonged to various phyla (i.e., Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria), while the genus Streptomyces (phylum Actinobacteria) was the main bacterial taxa that actively utilized plant-derived C in the biochar and control treatments. This study provides evidence that biochar application or RSD pre-planting soil management practices induced distinct bacterial utilization of plant-derived C, which may in turn regulate plant productivity in agricultural systems. Key points: • Genus Streptomyces was the main bacterial group utilizing plant-derived carbon in both control and biochar treatments. • Reductive soil disinfestation altered bacterial utilization of plant-derived carbon. • Biochar did not alter the composition of the bacterial communities but had more labeled bacterial taxa utilizing plant-derived carbon. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bacterial communities; Plant-derived C; Soil management; Stable isotope probing","Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Carbon; Fruits; Productivity; Soils; Agricultural system; Bacterial community; Bacterial utilization; Control treatments; Plant productivity; Plant-derived carbon; Soil bacterial community; Stable-isotope probing; Bacteria; biochar; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; charcoal; genomic DNA; phytochemical; stable isotope; unclassified drug; biochar; carbon; charcoal; bacterium; biochar; carbon dioxide; community composition; disinfection; microbial community; rhizosphere; soil management; soil microorganism; stable isotope; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Article; biomass; carbon utilization; controlled study; cyanobacterium; Dechloromonas; disinfection; DNA extraction; greenhouse; illumina sequencing; microbial community; nonhuman; Proteobacteria; rhizosphere; root exudate; soil acidity; soil amendment; soil property; Streptomyces; tomato; Verrucomicrobia; microbiology; soil; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria; Lycopersicon esculentum; Proteobacteria; Streptomyces; Verrucomicrobia; Carbon; Charcoal; Lycopersicon esculentum; Rhizosphere; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098591644

However, an integrated assessment of changes in carbon storage, entailing complex land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamics, remains a challenge. This study assessed the consequences of LULC changes on regional carbon storage in the Loess Plateau from 1995 to 2050 by integrating spatially explicit LULC and carbon models using multi-source data and typical scenarios. A Markov-CA model was used to model past LULC dynamics, which was followed by future projections under different LULC scenarios. Each scenario represented different socio-economic trajectories, including historical trend, ecological priority, and urban priority. The integrated valuation of the ecosystem service and tradeoffs (InVEST) carbon storage model and statistical methods were then used to assess spatiotemporal changes in the regional carbon storage associated with LULC dynamics. The results indicated that the ecological priority scenario could increase carbon storage by 11.36 Pg between 2015 and 2050. This is due to an increase in the carbon storage capacity in grasslands, shrub forest, and evergreen coniferous forest, indicating that ecological restoration could increase carbon sequestration. This mitigates the carbon loss caused by the rapid expansion of built-up land and fluctuations in cropland, which often takes place in the urban priority and historical trend scenarios. In favor of targeting the northwestern and central regions with socioeconomic benefits, grasslands and forests should be further promoted in the Loess Plateau. The findings will help implement long-term carbon sequestration strategies for ecosystem conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","InVEST model; Loess Plateau; LULC dynamic; Markov-CA model; Scenarios; Terrestrial carbon storage","Carbon capture; Conservation; Digital storage; Dynamics; Economics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Sediments; Ecological restoration; Integrated assessment; Land use and land cover; Loess plateau of chinas; Socio-economic benefits; Spatio-temporal changes; Spatiotemporal process; Terrestrial ecosystems; Storage as a service (STaaS); anthropogenic effect; carbon storage; habitat conservation; integrated approach; land cover; land use; spatiotemporal analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091022018

Clarifying such scientific fundamentals and overcoming technological challenges can effectively advance the implementation of pressurised oxy-fuel combustion technology and realise cleaner production. Herein, the transformation mechanisms of sulfur among solid, liquid, and gaseous states during the pressurised oxy-fuel pyrolysis of pulverised coal were experimentally investigated. The analysis of the gaseous products indicated that the concentration of H2S, the most abundant gaseous product, decreased from 840.3 to 32.1 ppm as the operating pressure increased from 0.1 to 3.1 MPa. Similar trends were observed for CH3SH and SO2. Conversely, COS concentration first increased from 61.4 to 143.4 ppm, after which it decreased to 30.4 ppm, a level similar to H2S concentration. The decreasing sulfur concentration in the volatiles is attributable to the oxidation of low-valence sulfur to form high-valence sulfur and the subsequent absorption by alkali metals in the char residue. The sulfur concentration in liquid tar, which was determined by the competitive reactions of the cracking of heavy hydrocarbons and the polymerisation of light volatiles, first decreased from 6.25 to 3.17 mg/L, followed by an increase to 5.03 mg/L as the operating pressure increased. To further investigate the sulfur transformation, the physicochemical, morphological, and structural properties of pyrolysed char were characterised. The crystal phase, microstructure, average particle size, specific surface area, and surface elemental content of the char affected the distribution and conversion of organic and inorganic sulfur in the char residue. The total sulfur content in the char residue typically increased with operating pressure. Moreover, the effect of operating temperature on the sulfur-containing products was investigated. Based on the experimental results, a binary correlation fitting was applied to predict the various trends in different sulfur-containing gaseous products of pressurised oxy-fuel pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Oxy-fuel; Pressurised; Pulverised coal; Pyrolysis; Sulfur","Alkali metals; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Conversion efficiency; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Physicochemical properties; Pollution control; Pyrolysis; Sulfur; Average particle size; Competitive reactions; Operating temperature; Oxy-fuel combustion technology; Sulfur concentrations; Sulfur transformation; Technological challenges; Transformation mechanisms; Pulverized fuel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089889258

However, its catalytic performance is determined collectively by a number of parameters including its composition and structure, electrolyte, and cell configuration. It remains a challenge to disentangle and understand the individual effect of these parameters. In this work, we study the effect of the electrode-electrolyte interface on CO2 reduction in water by coating CuO electrodes with polymers of varying hydrophilicities/phobicities. Hydrophilic polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) exert negligible influence, while hydrophobic polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) and polyethylene significantly enhance the activity, selectivity, and stability of CuO-derived electrodes toward C2H4 production. From ex situ characterizations, electrolysis in deuterated water, and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose that the improved catalytic performance triggered by hydrophobic polymers originates from restricted water diffusion and a higher local pH near the electrode surface. These observations shed light on interfacial manipulation for promoted CO2-to-C2H4 conversion. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","CO2reduction; ethylene production; interfacial hydrophobicity; polymer coating; water diffusion","Aliphatic compounds; Copper; Copper oxides; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Fluorine compounds; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Molecular dynamics; Polyvinyl alcohols; Catalytic performance; Cell configurations; Electrode-electrolyte interfaces; Hydrophilic polymers; Hydrophobic polymers; Molecular dynamics simulations; Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone); Poly(vinylidene fluoride); Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099663704

By partially replacing Cd2+ with Pb2+, the energy band of Cd–P shows a transformation from indirect to direct, supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

We investigated the mixing state of carbonyls, ammonium, amines, and imidazole (as a surrogate of BrC) in cloud residual, interstitial, and cloud-free particles by single-particle mass spectrometry. The results provide the first ambient evidence of the formation of imidazole through reactions between carbonyls and ammonium/amines at the individual particle level. The key evidence for this is that 60% of the imidazole particles are internally mixed with carbonyls and ammonium/amines. The number fraction of imidazole is significantly enhanced in particles with internally mixed carbonyls and ammonium (7.8%)/amines (26.7%), compared with that (1.4%) in all of the cloud-free particles. Furthermore, a higher number fraction of imidazole is observed in all cloud residual and interstitial particles (2.9%) than in the cloud-free particles (1.4%). This is due to the enhancement of amines and/or the synergistic effect of ammonium and amines in the formation of imidazole in cloud residual and interstitial particles. These findings extend the current understanding of the formation and evolution of imidazole-based BrC. ©",,"Amines; Bromine compounds; Mass spectrometry; Nitrogen; Ambient atmosphere; Aqueous reactions; Formation and evolutions; Individual particles; Interstitial particles; Laboratory studies; Single particle mass spectrometry; Synergistic effect; Aromatic compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095884723

Materials-based bio-electrochemical approaches are attractive for supplying biological organisms directly with grid-supplied electrons to convert carbon dioxide to value-added chemicals. Carbon nanotube-modified biocathodes have emerged as promising candidates for microbial electrosynthesis with high yields of carbon product formation, but a fundamental understanding of extracellular charge transfer at this electrode-biofilm interface is still lacking. Here, we utilize solid-state interfaces between semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNT) and a model acetogenic bacterium for mechanistic studies of electro-catalytic CO2 conversion to acetate. Studies of bacteria/s-SWCNT interactions in a transistor-based device suggest direct extracellular electron transfer (EET) at the bio-nano interface. Deuterium isotope labeling experiments confirmed that the availability of electrochemically produced H2 as a redox mediator does not limit the efficiency of EET and CO2 electro-reduction for C. ljungdahlii biofilms, suggesting the primary reducing equivalents are the electrons delivered across the electrode/bacterium interface or involvement of biological redox mediators. Additional isotope labeling studies demonstrate high Faradaic efficiency for CO2 electro-reduction at the SWCNT/bacterium interface. These results provide important information about EET across the bacterium/material interface in a model biocathode.

Contrary to expectations, neither energy generation (e.g., ATP) nor provision of precursor molecules for nucleotides (e.g., uracil) and amino acids (e.g., pyruvate, glutamate) limit host cell and plasmid-encoded functions. Growth inhibition is assumed to occur when hampered anabolic capacities do not match with the ongoing and overwhelming carbon catabolism. Excessive carbon uptake leads to by-product secretion, for example, pyruvate, acetate, glutamate, and energy spillage, for example, accumulation and degradation of adenine nucleotides with concomitant accumulation of extracellular hypoxanthine. The cellular response towards compromised anabolic capacities involves downregulation of cAMP formation, presumably responsible for subsequently better-controlled glucose uptake and resultant accumulation of glucose in the culture medium. Growth inhibition is neglectable under conditions of reduced carbon availability when hampered anabolic capacities also match with catabolic carbon processing. The growth inhibitory effect with accompanying energy spillage, respectively, hypoxanthine secretion and cessation of cAMP formation is not unique to the production of hFGF-2 but observed during the production of other proteins and also during overexpression of genes without transcript translation. © 2020 The Authors.

Herein, cost-effective Bi2O3−x with oxygen vacancies was formed in situ on commercial bismuth powder by calcination at 453.15 K in atmosphere. Interestingly, defects introduced into Bi2O3−x simultaneously induced a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the wavelength range of 600–1400 nm and enhanced the adsorption for CO2 molecules, which enabled efficient photocatalysis of CO2-to-CO (ca. 100 % selectivity) even under low-intensity near-IR light irradiation. Significantly, the apparent quantum yield for CO evolution at 940 nm reached 0.113 %, which is approximately 4 times that found at 450 nm. We also showed that the unique LSPR allows for the realization of a nearly linear dependence of photocatalytic CO production rate on light intensity and operating temperature.

Therefore, the pollutant emissions of products associated are transferred from consuming countries to exporting countries, which significantly changes the spatial distribution of global pollutant emissions. The objective of this research is to analyse the embodied nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in the trading process between China and the European Union (EU) and to further trace the interindustry and intercountry transfer paths. This study constructs a multiregional input–output (MRIO) model based on the latest EORA global supply chain database. The MRIO model quantitatively analyses the total NOx emissions from the production and consumption ends of China and the EU from 1995 to 2014. Important findings are derived from the empirical results as follows. (1) In 2014, China’s production end emissions were 1824.38 kilotons higher than those of the consumption end. By contrast, the situation in the EU was the opposite, i.e., production end emissions were 1711.97 kilotons lower than those of the consumption end. (2) In the trade between China and the EU, the EU is a net importer of embodied NOx, and China is a net exporter of embodied NOx . In 2014, 2.55% of China’s domestic NOx emissions were transferred to the EU in China-EU trade, accounting for 2.75% of China’s domestic consumption demand. (3) In 2014, Electricity, Gas and Water (397.75 kilotons), Transport (343.55 kilotons), Petroleum, Chemical and non-metallic Products (95.9 kilotons), Metal Products (49.88 kilotons), Textiles and Apparel (26.19 kilotons), are among the industries with the most embodied NOx emissions from China’s net exports during its two-way trade with the EU. (4) In the bilateral trade between the EU and China, many countries are in the state of embodied NOx net import. The top three net importers in 2014 were Germany (169.24 kilotons), Britain (128.11 kilotons), France (103.21 kilotons). © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, the static box method is used to analyze the change of CH4 emission rate in the sealed area of the landfill, the influence of different factors on the change of emission rate is investigated, and the orthogonal test design is carried out. The results show that stable CH4 emissions from landfills are not total and continuous emissions, but local intermittent emissions. The emission rate of landfill methane in 24 h is mainly affected by overburden temperature. The degree of influence of each factor on the CH4 emission is overburden temperature> atmospheric pressure > the moisture content of the overburden > time. © by PSP","CH4 emission; Climate change; Landfill; Static box method","atmospheric pressure; climate change; diurnal variation; domestic waste; landfill; methane; moisture content; overburden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101386569

Building heating and cooling is one primary source of energy consumption and anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. First, this review presents previous studies that estimate the specific amount of climate change impact on building heating and cooling energy consumption, using the statistical method, physical model method, comprehensive assessment model method, and the combination method of statistical and physical model methods. Then, because the heating and cooling degree days indices can simply and reliably indicate the effects of climate on building heating and cooling energy consumption, previous studies were reviewed from the aspects of heating and cooling degree days indices, regional spatial-temporal variations in degree days and related indices, influencing factors of the spatial distributions of degree days, and the impacts of urbanization on degree days. Finally, sev-eral potential key issues or research directions were presented according to the research gaps or fields that need to be studied further in the future, such as developing methods to simply and accurately estimate the specified amounts of climate change impact on building cooling and heating energy consumption; using more effective methods to analyze the daytime, nighttime, and all-day spatial-temporal changes in different seasons in the past and future under various environment contexts by considering not only the air temperature but also the relative humidity, solar radiation, population, etc., and further exploring the corresponding more kinds of driving forces, including the various remotely sensed indices, albedo, nighttime light intensity, etc.; estimating the daytime, nighttime, and all-day impacts of urbanization on heating degree days (HDDs), cooling degree days (CDDs), and their sum (HDDs + CDDs) for vast cities in different environmental contexts at the station site, city, regional and global scales; producing and sharing of the related datasets; and analyzing the subsequent effects induced by climate change on the energy consumption for building heating and cooling, etc. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Comprehensive assessment model method; Degree days method; Energy consumption; Physical model method; Statistical method; Urbanization effects","accuracy assessment; building; climate change; cooling; heating; literature review; urbanization; ventilation; air temperature; albedo; carbon footprint; city; climate change; cooling; energy consumption; heating; human; humidity; light intensity; physical model; review; season; solar radiation; systematic review; urbanization; air conditioning; energy resource; Air Conditioning; Cities; Climate Change; Energy-Generating Resources; Heating",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098698698

Here, we report a 10-year (2010 ~ 2019) cave monitoring of carbon isotopes from the plants, soil, cave water, and speleothems in Jiguan Cave, Central China, located on the Chinese north–south divide in an area that is sensitive to the Asian monsoon. The results show that the cave ventilation and soil air CO2 controlled by the local temperature and humidity conditions are responsible for the seasonal variability in the δ13CDIC values. The variation in the δ13CDIC values and trace element ratios of the cave water are sensitive to the local hydrological conditions. Although there is the lag time from precipitation to cave water in drought year, the δ13CDIC and trace element ratios (Mg/Ca, Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca) of cave water are strongly coupled and reflect the extreme drought due to the influence of prior calcite precipitation (PCP) and water–rock interaction. The 10-year monitoring period covered two complete El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. During the two strong El Niño years (2010 and 2015), the cave drip water δ13CDIC values were negative but the δ18O values were positive. This opposite trend is mainly due to their different controlling mechanisms. The rainfall amount and moisture sources are responsible for the δ13CDIC and δ18O values of the drip water, respectively. Throughout the karst cave system, the carbon isotopes in Jiguan Cave are continuously enriched when migrating from the vegetation to the soil to the cave drip water to the modern speleothems. Comparisons with the stalagmite δ13C records for the nearby Jiguan Cave suggest that stalagmite carbon isotopes may reflect the regional precipitation changes induced by the ENSO on the decadal scale. Overall, we demonstrate that the δ13C is a potentially reliable proxy that records the changes in the regional environment, especially precipitation changes, and is also a sensitive indictor that indirectly reflects ENSO. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon isotopes; El Niño Southern Oscillation; Extreme drought events; Karst hydrology; Modern speleothems","Atmospheric pressure; Calcite; Carbon; Climatology; Drought; Humidity control; Soils; Trace elements; Carbon isotope composition; Controlling mechanism; Hydrological condition; Paleoclimate reconstruction; Precipitation change; Prior calcite precipitations; Regional environments; Seasonal variability; Isotopes; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; cave; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; isotopic composition; karst; paleoclimate; reconstruction; seasonal variation; speleothem; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097584349

However, leading countries have announced long-term plan and targets in developing hydrogen energy. Should the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) follow up such developments? This study asks if hydrogen-based road transport, especially FCEVs in the fleets of passenger cars, buses, and trucks, could be economically justified in the ASEAN member states. If not, what strategies to take for ASEAN member states? The study applies a well-to-wheel model and a total cost of ownership model to compare the energy consumption, carbon emissions, as well as the costs of FCEVs with those of alternative powertrains. This practice shows the scale of the cost gaps. Subsequently, it estimates the implications of predicted future developments of both hydrogen and FCEVs, in terms of costs and carbon emissions reduced. The results indicate the areas in which FCEVs are most likely to become competitive in the near future, and thus could be targeted and prioritised.

However, the related underlying mechanisms are still poorly explored. We conducted an anaerobic incubation study to investigate changes in CO2 emissions from SOC and acetate (13C-labeleld) in response to iron oxide (ferrihydrite and goethite) addition in chloroform-fumigated and unfumigated paddy soils. The iron oxides, as electron acceptors, increased CO2 emissions from SOC with stronger impact under ferrihydrite than goethite addition. However, the acetate addition, as a preferable C source for reducing microbes, decreased SOC mineralisation and caused a negative priming effect. CO2 emission from both acetate and SOC was affected by microbial biomass change. In the acetate-treated soil, goethite in the fumigated soil (i.e. high microbial biomass) increased CO2 emissions from acetate, providing electron acceptors, and decreased CO2 emissions from SOC. Ferrihydrite accepted electrons and adsorbed acetate, resulting in a slight decline in CO2 emission from acetate. However, in the fumigated soil (i.e. low microbial biomass), both iron oxide additions reduced CO2 emissions from acetate and SOC and likely the dominant role of both iron oxides shifted from being electron acceptors to being adsorbents, thus limiting acetate accessibility to microorganisms. The results suggest that microbial biomass is a key driver in shifting the effects of iron oxides on organic C mineralisation in anaerobic paddy soils. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Acetate; Anaerobic mineralisation; Iron oxides; Microbial biomass; Rice paddy soil; Soil organic C","agricultural soil; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; chloroform; electron; iron oxide; microbial activity; mineralization; oxic conditions; soil organic matter; upland region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091351702

The concentrations of O3 and its precursors, as well as H2O2 and meteorological data were obtained from the urban site (Yanchang, YC), suburban (Zhengzhou University, ZZU) and background sites (Ganglishuiku, GLSK). Result showed that the rates of O3 concentration exceeded Chinese National Air Quality Standard Grade II (93.3 ppbv) were 59.0%, 52.5%, and 55.7% at the above three sites with good consistency, respectively, indicating that O3 pollution is a regional problem in Zhengzhou. The daily peak O3 appeared at 15:00–16:00, which was opposite to VOCs, NOx, and CO and consistent with H2O2. The exhaustive statistical analysis of meteorological factors and chemical effects on O3 formation at YC was advanced. The high concentration of precursors, high temperature, low relative humidity, and moderately high wind speed together with the wind direction dominated by south and southeast wind contribute to urban O3 episodes in Zhengzhou. O3 formation analysis showed that reactive alkenes such as isoprene and cis-2-butene contributed most to O3 formation. The VOCs/NOx ratio and smog production model were used to determine O3-VOC-NOx sensitivity. The O3 formation in Zhengzhou during early summer was mainly under VOC-limited and transition regions alternately, which implies that the simultaneous emission reduction of alkenes and NOx is effective in reducing O3 pollution in Zhengzhou. © 2020","H2O2; Meteorological influences; O3-VOC-NOx; Ozone formation potential; Smog production model","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Emission control; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Olefins; Ozone; Wind; Emission reduction; High temperature; Low relative humidities; Meteorological data; Meteorological factors; National Air Quality Standards; Production modeling; Transition regions; Urban growth; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); experimental study; hydrogen peroxide; ozone; suburban area; summer; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; urban site; China; Henan; Zhengzhou; hydrogen peroxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrogen Peroxide; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088639393

In order to improve the reliability of energy planning models, a novel dynamic modeling methodology is proposed and applied to the Swiss energy systems covering power, heat, and mobility. It provides freedom for users to generate tailored pathways according to region-specific inputs and to define model horizons determined by the variable start year, end year, and time slice, taking into account dynamic minus-plus of existing stocks and new installation across 140 energy conversion technologies.

In particular, an increase in flooding and extreme erosion events is foreseeable as a result of an anticipated increase in the frequency and severity of storms. In the absence of timely and strategic intervention, climate change is taking us closer to more uncertain (non-linear, stochastic) and potentially more catastrophic climatic impacts. This paper develops a state-of-the-art modelling framework to assess the economic impact of erosion hazards on critical infrastructure and evaluate their vulnerability and resilience to differing storm regimes. This framework is trialled on a UK town (Cockermouth, NW England) that has experienced significant storm-related erosion and flood damage in recent years, highlighting its ability to determine current and future erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. A hydro-sedimentary model is used to simulate fluvial and hillslope sediment erosion and deposition caused by extreme storms within river catchments (sheet, rill, gully and channel bank and bed erosion). The model is applied for current climate conditions and for two future epochs (2021–2040 & 2061–2080) to assess changing erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. Climate conditions for the two epochs are obtained using the UKCP18 high resolution realisation projections under emission scenario RCP8.5. The economic loss caused by these hazards is projected based on new, non-linear depth-cost curves derived from previous assessments. The results show that: 1) due to a warming climate, total rainfall in the Cockermouth area (and likely across the UK) may be higher for all storm durations and annual exceedance probabilities, until epoch 2061–2080 when the rainfall regime may shift towards shorter duration events with higher rainfall and longer duration events with less rainfall; 2) the total area that undergoes flooding, erosion and sediment deposition, and the magnitude of the hazard, may increase as the climate shifts; 3) the economic damage caused by erosion and deposition is positively related to rainfall total, and the highest costs are likely to be associated with damage caused to bridges (£102-130 million), followed by sediment deposition in the urban fabric (£9-82 million), and erosion damage to agricultural land (£16-26 million), buildings (£0.4-18 million) and roads (£0.4-4 million); and 4) the Estimated Annual Damage costs suggest that investment in bridges (£4-6 million) in the Cockermouth area is required now to ensure their resilience to extreme storm events, and interventions are likely to be needed within the next 20 years to prevent high economic costs associated with significant sediment deposition in the urban fabric (£0.3-4 million) and damage to roads (£0.08-0.1 million) and agricultural land (£0.6-2 million). This new framework can help support operational (immediate) and strategic (medium to long term i.e. 10+ years) erosion control decision making through the provision of an assessment of the scale and consequences of erosion. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change; Decision making; Economic impact; Erosion hazard; River catchment; UKCP18",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101848221

In recent years, with the gradual intensification of seismic network and the continuous improvement of seismic data quality, the understanding of the sedimentary and tectonic evolution characteristics of the Hetao Basin has been deepened. However, the influence of these factors on the law of hydrocarbon accumulation has not been studied in depth. In this paper, based on the latest two-dimensional seismic data and well-drilled analysis in the Linhe Depression, we have systematically conducted research on the characteristics of faults, unconformities, structural evolution and reservoir control in the study area. The results show that there are four different levels of unconformity developed from bottom to top in the Linhe Depression, which are the unconformity at the top of the Precambrian, the unconformity at the top of the Carboniferous Permian, the unconformity at the top of the Lisangou Formation, and the unconformity surface in the top area of the Cretaceous. The faults in this area are very developed, and they are mainly northeast and northeast trends. The types of faults include normal faults, reverse faults, reversal faults and strike-slip faults. The Hetao Basin as a whole has a north-fault-south-super structure. According to the basement ups and downs and regional structural morphology, fault system, local structural development and arrangement direction, a structural pattern of ""two uplifts, two depressions and one slope"" is formed. The analysis of tectonic evolution shows that the Hetao Basin was in an uplifted state in the Paleozoic, and under the action of the north-south compression force, a nearly east-west tectonic belt was formed. In the Mesozoic era, under the control of the Hetao arc structure system, the Hetao graben system experienced four stages of Indosinian uplift, Yanshanian shear compression depression, Himalayan shear extensional fault depression, and gravity subsidence. The Jilantai-Hangjinhouqi area has three major exploration directions: bedrock fractured reservoirs, Paleogene Oligocene clastic reservoirs, and Cretaceous clastic reservoirs. At the same time, the Pre-Cretaceous is also a potential exploration target. © 2021 Parlar Scientific Publications.

Hydrogen is widely considered as an imperative energy carrier to reach carbon neutral targets. However, hydrogen production, either from non-fossil power or fossil fuels with carbon capture, is closely linked with an energy supply system and has great impacts on its structure. Identifying an economically affordable transition pathway is attractive, and energy infrastructure is critical due to massive investment and long life-span. In this paper, a multi-regional, multi-period, and infrastructure-based model is proposed to quantify energy supply system transition costs with different low-carbon targets and hydrogen production alternatives, and China is taken as a case study. Results show that, fulfilling 2-degree and 1.5-degree temperature increase targets would result in 84% and 151% increases in system transition costs, 114% and 246% increases in infrastructure investment, and 211% and 339% increases in stranded investment, compared to fulfilling stated policy targets. Producing hydrogen from coal would be economical when carbon capture and sequestration cost is lower than 437 yuan per tonne, and reduce infrastructure investment and stranded coal investment by 16% and 35% respectively, than producing hydrogen from renewable power. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on ecological footprint methodology, this study comprehensively considered carbon emission and carbon sequestration in order to calculate the carbon footprints from agriculture and animal husbandry, and analyzed spatiotemporal distribution of carbon emission, carbon sequestration, and carbon footprint on the QTP. The results showed that during the period of 1990–2015, the carbon emissions of agriculture and animal husbandry on the QTP increased by 163% and 41%, respectively. Agricultural carbon sequestration showed an increasing trend with a growth rate of 45%, and animal husbandry carbon sequestration showed that it increased by 40% in the period of 1990–2005 and then decreased by 28% in the period of 2005–2015. The carbon footprint of agriculture reduced by 23% from 1990 to 1995, then grew by 112% from 1995 to 2015, and the animal husbandry carbon footprint reduced by 18% from 1990 to 2005 then grew by 71% from 2005 to 2015; both of these phenomena showed the downward trends first before trending upward. The high carbon emission and sequestration regions of agriculture were mainly distributed in the southeastern and northwestern areas of the QTP, and the high carbon footprint regions of agriculture were centered in the southeastern and northeastern areas. The high carbon emission regions of animal husbandry were located in southeastern areas, while the high carbon sequestration regions were in the southeastern, southwestern and middle areas. Additionally, the high carbon footprint regions were in southwestern areas. All measures mentioned showed a significant variation in spatial distribution. The economic and population growth contributed to the increase in carbon footprint despite technological advances.

In this work, the synthesis, crystal structure and luminescence properties has been carried out for Pr3+-activated SrMoO4 phosphors as optical thermometry. The XRD results show that all the phosphors possess the scheelite type tetragonal structure with space group I41/a. The efficient luminescence of Pr3+ can be observed under intra-configurational (4f-4f) and charge transfer band (Mo–O) excitations, respectively. Upon different excitations, the quenching concentration of Pr3+ is diverse due to the multi-phonon relaxation and cross-relaxation processes occurring in different excited states of Pr3+ ions. The fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) techniques based on emissions of 3P0 and 1D2 excited states of Pr3+, and the FIR in the excitations of the charge transfer band (Mo–O) and 4f-4f transitions of Pr3+ were employed for the thermometric characterizations in the 298–498 K range. Both results show remarkable performance in temperature sensing with the maximum relative sensitivity of 0.45%K−1@489 K and 0.98 %K−1@298 K, respectively.

As temperature decreased, the COD mass flow to methane decreased and COD mass flows in the permeate and waste sludge increased. At 24°C, rapid membrane TMP increases were not observed while at 15 and 10°C rapid increases occurred at 11.7 ± 0.46 and 7.6 ± 0.45 days, respectively, indicating a greater fouling propensity of the mixed liquor at lower temperatures. When the temperature was reduced from 15°C to 10°C in a transient test, CH4 production was reduced and VFA concentrations increased. A 2–3 SRT lag in the responses suggested that the delayed response was due to long-term changes in microbial population. The permeate VFA content in a PAC-dosed reactor was lower than that without PAC dosing, and PAC addition increased the time to rapid TMP development to 11.3 ± 0.46 days from 7.4 ± 0.49 days. The primary benefit of PAC addition at low temperatures is enhanced membrane performance. Practitioner points: AnMBRs can produce high-quality effluents at temperatures of 15°C Membrane fouling increases as temperature decreases Bioreactor performance was sustained for 2–3 SRTs after temperature decrease PAC addition reduced the permeate VFA concentrations Membrane fouling at 10°C was reduced through PAC addition. © 2020 Water Environment Federation","anaerobic; membrane fouling; powdered activated carbon; psychrophilic; wastewater","Activated carbon; Bioreactors; Effluents; Mass transfer; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Bioreactor performance; Fouling propensities; Membrane performance; Microbial populations; Municipal wastewaters; Powdered activated carbon; Temperature decrease; Activated carbon treatment; activated carbon; methane; charcoal; activated carbon; bioreactor; chemical oxygen demand; control system; fouling; membrane; methane; sludge; temperature profile; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Article; chemical oxygen demand; cleaning; concentration (parameter); controlled study; low temperature; membrane permeability; municipal wastewater; priority journal; sludge; transition temperature; waste component removal; waste water management; water permeability; anaerobic growth; artificial membrane; bioreactor; powder; sewage; temperature; waste water; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Charcoal; Membranes, Artificial; Powders; Sewage; Temperature; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084158140

However, significant knowledge gap exists in terms of the selection of appropriate boiler tube materials, which has delayed the commercialization of this promising technology. In this study, the corrosion performance of the three candidate alloys (SS347, Alloy 800AT and Alloy 825) was investigated in the hot flue gas mixtures (60% H2O + 33% CO2 + 2–7% O2) at 600 °C and 15 MPa to simulate typical pressurized oxy-fuel natural gas combustion environments. On all the alloys, Cr2O3 was the main surface oxide and several alloying elements (including Si, and/or Al+Ti) accumulated at the interface of oxide layer/substrate. Among the gas species, O2 acted as the dominant oxidizing agent with a critical content of ∼2%, above which nodular oxidation was suppressed and corrosion rates of alloys were greatly reduced. H2O was likely to enhance the growth and evaporation of oxides, while CO2 did not trigger carburization during the testing period. From a corrosion perspective, three alloys exhibit promising potential for boiler tube constructions while Alloy 825 exhibited the best corrosion performance. © 2020","General and localized oxidation; Hot flue gas; Pressurized oxy-fuel combustion","Alloying elements; Boiler corrosion; Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Corrosion rate; Energy conversion; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Natural gasoline plants; Titanium oxides; Boiler tubes; Corrosion performance; Knowledge gaps; Natural gas combustion; Oxidizing agents; Oxy-fuel combustion technology; Oxyfuel combustion; Surface oxide; Chromium alloys; alloy; carbon dioxide; combustion; commercialization; corrosion; greenhouse gas; oxidation; oxygen; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094881856

We conducted five cruises from May to September and studied spatiotemporal variations in the seawater carbonate system in the semi-closed Sanggou Bay, which is famous for its large-scale mariculture. Our results showed that both kelp and bivalve farming induced significant spatiotemporal variations in the carbonate system within the bay. When cultured kelp reached its highest biomass in May, the maximum ΔDIC, ΔpCO2 and ΔpHT between the seawater from the kelp farming area and the non-farming outer bay area was −156 μmol kg−1, −102 μatm and 0.15 pH units, respectively. However, no significant effect of kelp farming on seawater total alkalinity (TA) was observed. Kelp farming also caused the carbonate system variations of seawater from the bivalve farming area. Assuming no kelp was farmed in May, the average pH and pCO2 would reduce by 0.12 pH units and increase by 179 μatm, respectively, in the bivalve farming area. Bivalve farming significantly reduced seawater TA, indicating that fast deposition of calcium carbonate occurred in the bivalve farming area. Although bivalve respiration released CO2 into seawater and elevated seawater pCO2 level and reduced seawater pHT, surprisingly, seawater dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reduced significantly in the bivalve farming area. These results indicated that bivalves fixed a larger amount of inorganic carbon by calcification than that released into seawater by respiration. Overall, large-scale kelp and bivalve farming are important biological drivers of variations in the carbonate system within the semi-enclosed Sanggou Bay. Altered carbonate systems by kelp farming may favour calcification of farmed bivalves and provide an essential refuge for these species during the future ocean acidification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aquaculture; Bivalve; IMTA; Kelp; Ocean acidification; Seawater carbonate system","Alkalinity; Biomineralization; Bone; Calcium carbonate; Carbon; Carbonation; Marine biology; Molluscs; Carbonate system; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dominant species; Fast deposition; Inorganic carbon; Ocean acidifications; Spatio-temporal variation; Total alkalinities; Seawater effects; calcium carbonate; carbon; carbonic acid; inorganic compound; sea water; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; sea water; carbonate system; future prospect; kelp forest; mariculture; ocean acidification; semienclosed sea; shellfish culture; spatiotemporal analysis; acidification; alkalinity; aquaculture; Article; biomass; bivalve; carbon dioxide tension; kelp; mariculture; marine environment; priority journal; sea; spatiotemporal analysis; agriculture; animal; kelp; pH; China; Sanggou Bay; Shandong; algae; Bivalvia; Agriculture; Animals; Bivalvia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonates; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kelp; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090188582

Cities are not only the gathering place for development, but also the key to mitigating carbon emissions. The current urban planning thinking mode has begun to shift to low-carbon ecologicalization. Low-carbon urban planning theory and construction practice have become the focus of attention of the international community in many urban issues. Its core idea is to transform the traditional way of urban development, develop a low-carbon economy and build a low-carbon life through the low-carbon transformation planning layout of urban space and the low-carbon industrial system. As the largest carbon source and the region with the greatest emission reduction potential, cities urgently need to transform their production and lifestyles into renewable energy and circular economy in an all-round way. As a city planning that has a strong guiding and controlling role in urban development, it also plays an important role in the transformation process. Based on the analysis of the low-carbon city planning and construction of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, Xi'an has the following characteristics: As a northwestern industrial base, the main industrial pillar of Xi'an is the secondary industry, and the industry will continue to be occupied in the development of Xi'an. Since Xi'an's main pillar industries are petrochemicals, automobile manufacturing, metallurgy (mainly steel), and electricity, carbon dioxide emissions have seriously exceeded the standard. As a city along the river, Xi'an has abundant water resources and long and cold winters. This paper analyzes the data of Xi'an for ten years, analyzes and predicts the carbon dioxide emissions of Xi'an, and puts forward feasible low-carbon city planning and construction policies and recommendations. We summarize and analyze the existing theories, examples and research status of low-carbon city planning, and extract analysis methods and planning research theories from them. We establish urban low-carbon models and evaluation indicators to analyze and forecast Xi'an's carbon dioxide emissions from the aspects of low-carbon energy and economy, low-carbon space and layout, low-carbon transportation and transportation, low-carbon communities and buildings, low-carbon emissions and treatment, and low-carbon policies and management. © 2021 Parlar Scientific Publications.

In simulations of initially segregated reactive species with an entrainment-emission configuration with an A-B-C second-order chemical scheme, urban surface emission fluxes of the homogeneously emitted tracer A result in a very large segregation between the tracers and hence a very large overestimation of the effective chemical reaction rate in a complete-mixing model. This large effect can be indicated by a large Damköhler number D a of the limiting reactant. With heterogeneous surface emissions of the two reactants, the resultant normalised boundary-layer-averaged effective chemical reaction rate is found to be in a Gaussian function of Da, and it is increasingly overestimated by the imposed rate with an increased horizontal scale of emission heterogeneity. Coarse-grid models with resolutions commensurable to regional models give reduced yet still significant errors for all simulations with homogeneous emissions. Such model improvement is more sensitive to the increased vertical resolution. However, such improvement cannot be seen for simulations with heterogeneous emissions when the horizontal resolution of the model cannot resolve emission heterogeneity. This work highlights particular conditions in which the ability to resolve chemical segregation is especially important when modelling urban environments. © Author(s) 2021.

Environmental management is essentially based on two factors, namely reducing environmental risk and increasing environmental benefit. This article describes the sustainability of ecotourism developments, the development of ecotourism in Genilangit based on participation, the management of ecotourism in Genilangit based on a stimulus of religious ecology, and the strategies of the mountainside community for adapting to climate change. The research uses a qualitative method with a case study, which aims to gain a deep understanding of the attitudes and behaviour of the community with regard to religious ecology in developing ecotourism. The results of the research show that ecotourism in Genilangit is “Green and Fair” in its concern for sustainable development and conservation, in aspects of economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. Ecotourism in Genilangit is community based, and the principle of religious ecology is always implemented as the basis for managing ecotourism which is adaptive to climate change. The success of the Genilangit community in adapting to climate change is due to their social and cultural adaptations which are implemented within a framework of religious ecology. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Moreover, population viability analyses (PVAs) often ignore the effects of large environmental gradients and use temporal resolutions that are too coarse to take into account that different stages of a population's life cycle may be affected differently by climate change. Here, we present the High-resolution Large Environmental Gradient (HiLEG) model and apply it in a PVA with daily resolution based on daily climate projections for Northwest Germany. We used the large marsh grasshopper (LMG) as the target species and investigated (1) the effects of climate change on the viability and spatial distribution of the species, (2) the influence of the timing of grassland mowing on the species and (3) the interaction between the effects of climate change and grassland mowing. The stage- and cohort-based model was run for the spatially differentiated environmental conditions temperature and soil moisture across the whole study region. We implemented three climate change scenarios and analyzed the population dynamics for four consecutive 20-year periods. Climate change alone would lead to an expansion of the regions suitable for the LMG, as warming accelerates development and due to reduced drought stress. However, in combination with land use, the timing of mowing was crucial, as this disturbance causes a high mortality rate in the aboveground life stages. Assuming the same date of mowing throughout the region, the impact on viability varied greatly between regions due to the different climate conditions. The regional negative effects of the mowing date can be divided into five phases: (1) In early spring, the populations were largely unaffected in all the regions; (2) between late spring and early summer, they were severely affected only in warm regions; (3) in summer, all the populations were severely affected so that they could hardly survive; (4) between late summer and early autumn, they were severely affected in cold regions; and (5) in autumn, the populations were equally affected across all regions. The duration and start of each phase differed slightly depending on the climate change scenario and simulation period, but overall, they showed the same pattern. Our model can be used to identify regions of concern and devise management recommendations. The model can be adapted to the life cycle of different target species, climate projections and disturbance regimes. We show with our adaption of the HiLEG model that high-resolution PVAs and applications on large environmental gradients can be reconciled to develop conservation strategies capable of dealing with multiple stressors. © 2020","Climate change; Environmental gradients; High resolution; Land use; Population viability analysis; Stage-based model","Climate models; Land use; Life cycle; Soil moisture; Springs (components); Timing circuits; Wetlands; Climate change scenarios; Climate projection; Conservation strategies; Environmental conditions; Environmental gradient; Multiple stressors; Population viability analysis; Temporal resolution; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; ecological modeling; environmental disturbance; environmental gradient; grasshopper; land use change; life cycle; marsh; population viability analysis; strategic approach; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096637635

Adding MS and PPM reduced NH3 emissions by 25.78–68.37% and N2O emissions by 19.00–42.86%. PPG reduced NH3 emissions by 59.74% but slightly increased N2O emissions by 8.15%. MS was strongly correlated with the amoA-dominated nitrification process. PPG and PPM had strong correlations with nirS- and nirK-dominated, and nosZ-dominated denitrification processes, respectively. PPM promoted nitrification and denitrification processes more than PPG and MS. Different functional bacteria had key roles in nitrification and denitrification during different composting stages. Firmicutes probably contributed to the conversion and release of nitrogen in the thermophilic period, whereas Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and other phyla might have played important roles in the cooling and maturation periods. PPM obtained the greatest reductions in NH3 and N2O release via the regulation of environmental variables, nitrogen functional genes, and the bacterial community. Overall, these results provide insights at a molecular level into the effects of PPG and MS on nitrogen transformation and NH3 and N2O emissions during composting. © 2020","Medical stone; NH3 and N2O emissions; Nitrogen functional gene; Nitrogen transformation; Phosphogypsum","Ammonia; Bacteria; Denitrification; Environmental regulations; Genes; Gypsum; Nitrification; Bacterial community; Denitrification process; Environmental variables; Functional bacteria; Nitrification and denitrification; Nitrification process; Nitrogen transformations; Thermophilic period; Nitrogen; ammonia; calcium sulfate; inorganic compound; medical stone; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; phosphogypsum; unclassified drug; calcium sulfate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; phosphogypsum; phosphorus; ammonia; bacterium; composting; emission; gene; microbial community; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxic conditions; transformation; aerobic composting; amoA gene; Article; Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; composting; concentration (parameter); denitrification; Firmicutes; functional genomics; microbial community; nirK gene; nirS gene; nitrification; nitrogen functional gene; nosZ gene; priority journal; Proteobacteria; bacterial gene; bacterium; denitrification; genetics; nitrification; soil; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Firmicutes; Proteobacteria; Bacteria; Calcium Sulfate; Composting; Denitrification; Genes, Bacterial; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Phosphorus; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090736301

However, the chemical and structural state of Cu catalyst surfaces during the CO2RR remains a matter of debate. Here, we show the structural evolution of the near-surface region of polycrystalline Cu electrodes under in situ conditions through a combination of grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy (GIXAS) and X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). The in situ GIXAS reveals that the surface oxide layer is fully reduced to metallic Cu before the onset potential for CO2RR, and the catalyst maintains the metallic state across the potentials relevant to the CO2RR. We also find a preferential surface reconstruction of the polycrystalline Cu surface toward (100) facets in the presence of CO2. Quantitative analysis of the reconstruction profiles reveals that the degree of reconstruction increases with increasingly negative applied potentials, and it persists when the applied potential returns to more positive values. These findings show that the surface of Cu electrocatalysts is dynamic during the CO2RR, and emphasize the importance of in situ characterization to understand the surface structure and its role in electrocatalysis. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Copper; Copper compounds; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Surface reconstruction; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Applied potentials; Cu-based catalyst; Grazing incidence x-ray absorption spectroscopies; In-situ characterization; Near surface regions; Renewable energies; Structural evolution; Surface oxide layer; Copper metallography; carbon dioxide; copper; Article; catalysis; catalyst; chemical structure; controlled study; grazing incidence X ray absorption spectroscopy; grazing incidence X ray diffraction; oxidation; quantitative analysis; surface property; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100136963

The variance components and contributions of indoor versus outdoor source determinants of personal exposure to air pollution are poorly understood, especially in settings of household solid fuel use. We conducted a panel study with up to 4 days of repeated measures of integrated gravimetric personal exposure to PM2.5 and black carbon in 787 men and women (ages 40–79) living in peri-urban villages in northern (Beijing and Shanxi) and southern (Guangxi) China. We simultaneously measured outdoor PM2.5 and collected questionnaire data on sociodemographic characteristics and indoor pollution sources including tobacco smoking and solid fuel stove use. We obtained over 2000 days of personal exposure monitoring which showed higher exposures in the heating season (geometric mean (GM): 108 versus 65 μg/m3 in the non-heating season for PM2.5) and among northern participants (GM: 90 versus 59 μg/m3 in southern China in the non-heating season for PM2.5). We used mixed-effects models to estimate within- and between-participant variance components and to assess the determinants of exposures. Within-participant variance in exposure dominated the total variability (68–95%). Outdoor PM2.5 was the dominant variable for explaining within-participant variance in exposure to PM2.5 (16%). Household fuel use (PM2.5: 8%; black carbon: 10%) and smoking status (PM2.5: 27%; black carbon: 5%) explained the most between-participant variance. Indoor sources (solid fuel stoves, tobacco smoking) were associated with 13–30% higher exposures to air pollution and each 10 μg/m3 increase in outdoor PM2.5 was associated with 6–8% higher exposure. Our findings indicate that repeated measurements of daily exposure are likely needed to capture longer-term exposures in settings of household solid fuel use, even within a single season, and that reducing air pollution from both outdoor and indoor sources is likely needed to achieve measurable reductions in exposures to air pollution. © 2020","Air pollution; Energy; Household air pollution; Repeated measures","Air pollution; Carbon; Exposure controls; Health risks; Heating; Rural areas; Stoves; Tobacco; Determinants of exposure; Mixed effects models; Personal exposure monitoring; Personal exposures; Repeated measurements; Socio-demographic characteristics; Total variabilities; Variance components; Fuels; black carbon; carbon; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; health risk; household energy; particulate matter; pollution exposure; risk factor; source apportionment; adult; aged; air monitoring; air quality; Article; biomass; Chinese; female; fuel and fuel related phenomena; human; indoor air pollution; male; panel study; particulate matter 2.5; passive smoking; priority journal; solid fuel stove use; air pollutant; air pollution; China; cooking; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; middle aged; particulate matter; Beijing [China]; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Shanxi; Nicotiana tabacum; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Beijing; Carbon; China; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098454329

The 1D cobalt oxide (Co3O4) was in situ hydrothermally grown on the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate, followed by sulfurization to form 1D cobalt sulfide (Co4S3) nanoneedle array. The Co4S3 is characterized by a high electrocatalytic activity for reducing/oxidizing the redox couple in the electrolyte. Additionally, the 1D structural feature of the Co4S3 allows fast electron transport through the oriented diffusion pathway. However, the Co4S3 still has relatively low chemical stability and poor electrical conductivity than conventional Pt catalyst. Herein, we incorporated the mesoporous carbon layer derived from the double comb copolymer, i.e., PVDC-g-POEM, which can act as a mesoporous structural template and sufficient carbon source. This strategy increased the electrocatalytic activity and chemical durability of the heterogeneous catalytic materials. The 1D Co4S3/mesoporous carbon heterogeneous catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide, thereby outperforming the conventional Pt counter electrode. The catalytic properties were demonstrated by electrochemical analysis, i.e., cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results suggest that solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs) fabricated with the 1D Co4S3/mesoporous carbon counter electrode exhibited a higher solar energy conversion efficiency of 6.2% than the corresponding ssDSSC with conventional Pt (5.7%). The pure 1D Co4S3 or mesoporous carbon showed relatively lower performance than conventional Pt. Accordingly, the 1D Co4S3/mesoporous carbon synergetic approach represents a new strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity and chemical stability for highly efficient ssDSSCs. © 2020","Cobalt sulfide; Double comb copolymer; Electrocatalyst; Mesoporous carbon; Transition metal compounds","Carbon; Catalyst activity; Chemical stability; Cobalt compounds; Conversion efficiency; Cyclic voltammetry; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electron transport properties; Mesoporous materials; Nanocomposites; Nanoneedles; Solar energy; Substrates; Sulfur compounds; Tin oxides; Carbon counter electrodes; Catalytic properties; Electrical conductivity; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrochemical analysis; Fast electron transport; Fluorine doped tin oxide; Heterogeneous catalyst; Platinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090217179

In contrast to conventional emissions accounting which captures only territorial or local production activities, the CF includes the emissions imposed by consumption across global supply chains for goods and services. Recent interest has grown in the application of CF assessment for municipalities owing to their large contribution to global carbon emissions and the limited coverage of existing data to monitor their climate pledges. By linking household-level consumer surveys to a global supply chain database, spatially-explicit CF assessment is possible at a district and household scale. To date, such technique has exposed otherwise unforeseen differences in consumer carbon footprints in developed countries. Within this study we calculate and compare the household carbon footprints 623 districts in India, based on micro consumption data from 203,313 households and explain their variation by economic, cultural and demographic factors. We show the eradication of extreme poverty does not contradict with climate change mitigation in India. However, our analysis suggests CF reduction policies within India need to target high-expenditure households which are responsible for nearly seven times the carbon emissions than low-expenditure households (living on $1.9 consumption a day). These vast disparities between the carbon footprint of citizens in India highlights the need to differentiate individual responsibilities for climate change in national and global climate policy. © 2020 The Author(s)","carbon footprint; household consumption; India; MRIO; poverty alleviation","carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; global climate; mitigation; poverty; supply chain management; India; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098070820

Although there is a large volume of evidence related to climate change effects on wildlife, research on climate adaptation strategies is lagging. To assess the current state of knowledge in climate adaptation, we conducted a comprehensive literature review and evaluated 1,346 peer-reviewed publications for management recommendations designed to address the consequences of climate change on wildlife populations. From 509 publications, we identified 2,306 recommendations and employed both qualitative and quantitative methods for data analysis. Although we found an increase in the volume and diversity of recommendations since 2007, a focus on protected areas (26%, 596 of 2,306 recommendations) and the non-reserve matrix (12%, 276 of 2,306 recommendations) remained prominent in the climate adaptation literature. Common concepts include protected areas, invasive species, ecosystem services, adaptive management, stepping stones, assisted migration, and conservation easements. In contrast, only 1% of recommendations focused on reproduction (n = 26), survival (n = 14), disease (n = 26), or human-wildlife conflict (n = 24). Few recommendations reflected the potential for local-scale management interventions.

The cluster of denitrification genes harbored by this strain has been well characterized. It includes nir and nor operons encoding nitrite and nitric oxide reductases, respectively. However, the reductase involved in nitrate reduction has not yet been studied and little information is available on denitrification regulators in A. fabrum C58. In this study, we aimed to (i) characterize the nitrate reductase, (ii) determine its role in A. fabrum C58 fitness and root colonization and (ii) reveal the contribution of small RNA on denitrification regulation. By constructing a mutant strain defective for napA, we demonstrated that the reduction of nitrate to nitrite was catalyzed by the periplasmic nitrate reductase, NapA. We evidenced a positive role of NapA in A. fabrum C58 fitness and suggested that A. fabrum C58 is able to use components exuded by plant roots to respire anaerobically. Here, we showed that NorR small RNA increased the level of norCBQ mRNA and a decrease of NorR is correlated with a decrease in N2O emission. Together, our results underscore the importance of understanding the denitrification pathway at the strain level in order to develop strategies to mitigate N2O production at the microbial community level. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

They consist of one dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic chains undulated by incommensurate structural modulations with unusually large atomic displacive waves, giving a mixed 1D/2D “real” magnetic topology. The magnetic ground state is antiferromagnetic (AFM) with k = [½ 0 0], leading to a nonmodulated collinear spin lattice despite the aperiodic atomic framework, and allows developing spin-induced multiferroicity below TN. Severe arguments against the identified mechanisms for type-II multiferroics, i.e., by inverse Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya, exchange striction and spin-dependent p–d hybridizations, suggest an original scenario in which the atomic waves, the collinear magnetic structure, and magnetic dipole–dipole interactions may interact as crucial ingredients of the spin-induced ferroelectric phase. Here, the specific role of the Co2+ spin–orbit coupling in the magnetoelectric (ME) phase diagram is demonstrated by comparison with the novel Heisenberg BaFeP2O7 isomorph, similarly structurally modulated. This compound shows a noncollinear modulated AFM ordering, while no ME coupling is detected in its case. Accordingly, both BaCoX2O7 and BaFeP2O7 also undergo metamagnetic transitions above 5–6 T promoted by the modulated distribution of spin exchanges, but the spin-flop progressive alignment of the spins in the noncollinear spin structure (Fe2+ case) turns into an abrupt flip-like transition in the uniaxial spin structure (Co2+ case). © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","collinear spins; incommensurate structure; magnetic dipole–dipole; magnetoelectric coupling; multiferroics","Antiferromagnetism; Arsenic compounds; Atoms; Band structure; Barium compounds; Cobalt compounds; Ground state; Iron compounds; Multiferroics; Antiferromagnetic chain; Induced ferroelectric phase; Magnetic ground state; Magnetic topologies; Metamagnetic transitions; Noncollinear spin structures; Progressive alignment; Structural modulations; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106107633

In all models, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) were reduced due to increasing electric vehicles, though reductions varied. At best, CAVs decreased GHGs by 20% compared to no-CAV conditions in 2040. At worst, we model a 6% decrease in GHGs if autonomy provokes increased use of personal vehicles (Motor City scenario), even with 85% electric vehicles. An overall reduction in emissions is seen for other pollutants, with the exception of PM, ranging from emissions reductions of up to 20% (PM exhaust) to an increase in emissions by 30% (PM2.5 brakewear) in 2040.

Protected areas (PAs) are meant to counteract loss and fragmentation of ecosystems and today PAs form the backbone of conservation strategies worldwide. However, anthropogenic climate change can severely reduce the effectiveness of PAs. Conservation professionals are in need of concrete spatial information on climatic changes within PAs in order to put forward practicable strategies to safeguard PA effectiveness in the face of climate change. In this study, we take advantage of openly accessible data on the disappearing climate index (DCI) to examine which PA characteristics are linked to climate change resilience on a global scale. DCI provides a measure of the relative area (percent of total area) within a PA that exhibits certain climatic conditions that will either disappear entirely or move outside the boundaries of the PA by the year 2070. Our results show that topographic diversity is highly correlated with reduced climate change impacts in PAs worldwide. We analyzed three different PA characteristics representing topographic diversity: PA area, maximal elevational difference (MED) and median terrain ruggedness (TR). All three characteristics are highly correlated with a decrease in the disappearing climate index (DCI). These results hold true across localities and even PA management practices. IUCN management category IV (habitat/species management area) and V (protected landscape/seascape) exhibit on average the highest DCI values. As an indicator for PA resilience under climate change, topographic diversity can be assessed easily through publicly available data and remote sensing products. This ease-of-use leaves topographic diversity standing in marked contrast to overall environmental diversity as an actionable conservation metric. Of course, topographic diversity alone is not a sufficient criterion on which to base conservation decisions. However, neither should the potential usefulness of topographic diversity be underestimated. As an actionable and complementary metric in combination with biological information topographic diversity can be an exceptional tool for decision making by PA managers, conservation practitioners and politicians. © 2021 The Authors",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099154586

With this crisis, the question of water resources management has entered the national political agenda, creating an opportunity to better prepare the country to deal with future droughts. In order to improve climate predictions, and thus preparedness in NEB, a circulation pattern (CP) classification algorithm offers various options. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to develop a computer aided CP classification based on the Simulated ANnealing and Diversified RAndomization clustering (SANDRA) algorithm. First, suitable predictor variables and cluster domain setting are evaluated using ERA-Interim reanalyses. It is found that near surface variables such as geopotential at 1,000 hPa (GP1,000) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP) should be combined with horizontal wind speed at the upper 700 hPa level (UWND700). A 11-cluster solution is favoured due to the trade-offs between interpretability of the cluster centroids and the explained variances of the predictors. Second, occurrence and transition probabilities of this 11-cluster solution of GP1,000 and UWND700 are analysed, and typical CPs, which are linked to dry and wet conditions in the region are identified. The suitability of the new classification to be potentially applied for statistical downscaling or CP-conditional bias correction approach is analysed. The CP-conditional cumulative density functions (CDFs) exhibit discriminative power to separate between wet and dry conditions, indicating a good performance of the CP approach. © 2020 The Authors.

The Vision of the new Circular Bio-based Economy, CBE is presented: Unlocking the full potential of all types of sustainably sourced biomass, crop residues, industrial side-streams, and wastes by transforming it into value-added products. The resulting product portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of value-added products, addressing societal and consumer needs. Food and feed, bio-based chemicals, materials, health-promoting products; and bio-based fuels. The pillars of CBE are described, including biotechnology, microbial production, enzyme technology, green chemistry, integrated physical/chemical processing, policies, conducive framework conditions and public private partnerships. Drivers of CBE are analyzed: Biomass supply, biorefineries, value chain clusters, rural development, farmers, foresters and mariners; urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Improved framework conditions can be drivers but also obstacles if not updated to the era of circularity. Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014–2020) are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil. Parallel to this, diversification of industrial segments and types of funding instruments developed, reflecting industrial needs and academic research involvement. Impact assessment is highlighted. A number of specific recommendations are given; e.g., including international win/win CBE-collaborations, as e.g., expanding African EU collaboration into CBE.

In this study, we characterized the barrier and mucociliary functions of differentiated human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs), cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). Due to the presence of mucociliary protection, particle internalization was reduced, with a concomitant decrease in cytotoxicity in differentiated S-ALI cells, as compared to conventional submerged SAEC cultures. After 24-hour exposure to PM2.5 surrogates, 117 up-regulated genes and 156 down-regulated genes were detected in S-ALI cells, through transcriptomic analysis using the Affymetrix Clariom™ S Human Array. Transcription-level changes in &gt;60 signaling pathways, were revealed by functional annotation of the 273 differentially expressed genes, using the PANTHER Gene List Analysis. These pathways are involved in multiple cellular processes, that include inflammation and apoptosis. Exposure to urban PM2.5 led to complex responses in airway epithelia, including a net induction of downstream pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic responses. Collectively, this study highlights the importance of using the more advanced ALI model rather than the undifferentiated submerged model, to avoid over-assessment of inhaled particle toxicity in human. The results of our study also suggest that reduction of ambient PM2.5 concentrations would have a protective effect on respiratory health in humans. © 2020 The Authors","Airborne fine particulate; Functional annotation; Gene microarray; Primary small airway epithelial cells; Urban aerosol","caspase 3; cytokine; transcriptome; aerosol; cell; DNA; gene expression; particulate matter; pollution exposure; toxicity; airway epithelium cell; ambient air; ANGPT1 gene; apoptosis; Article; ASNS gene; atmospheric particulate matter; CDH10 gene; CDH9 gene; cell culture; ciliated epithelium; CLTCL1 gene; controlled study; CTPS2 gene; CX3CR1 gene; CXCL10 gene; CXCR6 gene; cytotoxicity; DNAJC27 gene; down regulation; ecotoxicity; EDNRA gene; gene; gene identification; gene regulatory network; genetic analysis; GNG3 gene; GRB7 gene; GRK5 gene; GUCY1B3 gene; HAO1 gene; human; human cell; ID2 gene; IL13RA2 gene; JAK2 gene; KAT6B gene; lung toxicity; MAP3K14 gene; particulate matter 2.5; particulate matter exposure; PCDHB10 gene; PDK2 gene; PHKA2 gene; PIK3CD gene; PRB1 gene; proapoptotic activity; PSAT1 gene; PTK2 gene; RGS16 gene; RIMS2 gene; RNA analysis; SAG gene; SCG2 gene; SCIN gene; SERPINA1 gene; SERPINA10 gene; SH3GL3 gene; signal transduction; SLC17A6 gene; SPC25 gene; SYK gene; TLE6 gene; TNFRSF10A gene; upregulation; urban area; air pollutant; chemistry; drug effect; epithelium cell; gene expression profiling; genetics; metabolism; particle size; particulate matter; pathology; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Apoptosis; Cells, Cultured; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096823611

About one quarter of that difference is thought to be due to a stronger biological pump during glacial times, driven by increased aeolian dust deposition and hence greater iron availability in ocean surface waters. However, dust supply did not change uniformly or in synchrony over the deglacial transition and what is not known is the relative importance of different oceanic regions and how this may have changed in time. Using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, we quantify the sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 to regional changes in iron supply, and test six different global dust reconstructions in order to explore uncertainty in past dust changes. We confirm the Southern Ocean (&gt;34°S) as the region most sensitive to iron fertilization, with the Atlantic and Pacific sectors accounting for about 41±23% and 16±10%, respectively, of the total CO2 reduction from global iron fertilization. However, the North Pacific contributes 28±3% to the total implying an important role for Northern Hemisphere processes in driving deglacial CO2 rise. In addition, our analysis reveals an unexpected regional-temporal disparity, and while Southern Hemisphere iron fertilization influences atmospheric CO2 relatively constantly throughout the termination the impact of the Northern Hemisphere only occurs during the later stages of the termination. © 2020 The Author(s)","CO2; dust; iron fertilization; paleoclimate; termination","Biology; Carbon dioxide; Dust; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Global warming; Surface waters; CO2 concentration; Earth system model of intermediate complexity; Iron fertilization; Last Glacial Maximum; Last glacial terminations; Northern Hemispheres; Southern Hemisphere; Temporal evolution; Iron; carbon dioxide; dust; global warming; iron; Last Glacial Maximum; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; reconstruction; temporal evolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097219262

While recent attempts to engineer synthetic methylotrophs have proved successful, autonomous methylotrophy, that is, the ability to utilize methane or methanol as sole carbon and energy substrates, has not yet been realized. Here, we address an important limitation of autonomous methylotrophy in E. coli: the inability of the organism to synthesize several amino acids when grown on methanol. We targeted global and local amino acid regulatory networks. Those include removal of amino acid allosteric feedback inhibition (argAH15Y, ilvAL447F, hisGE271K, leuAG462D, proBD107N, thrAS345F, trpES40F), knockouts of transcriptional repressors (ihfA, metJ); and overexpression of amino acid biosynthetic operons (hisGDCBHAFI, leuABCD, thrABC, trpEDCBA) and transcriptional regulators (crp, purR). Compared to the parent methylotrophic E. coli strain that was unable to synthesize these amino acids from methanol carbon, these strategies resulted in improved biosynthesis of limiting proteinogenic amino acids (histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tyrosine) from methanol carbon. In several cases, improved amino acid biosynthesis from methanol carbon led to improvements in methylotrophic growth in methanol minimal medium supplemented with a small amount of yeast extract. This study addresses a key limitation currently preventing autonomous methylotrophy in E. coli and possibly other synthetic methylotrophs and provides insight as to how this limitation can be alleviated via global and local regulatory modifications. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","allosteric feedback inhibition; amino acid biosynthesis; Escherichia coli; methanol; synthetic methylotrophy; transcriptional regulation","Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Carbon; Escherichia coli; Methane; Methanol; Feedback inhibition; Methanol utilization; Over-expression; Proteinogenic amino acids; Regulatory interventions; Regulatory network; Transcriptional regulator; Transcriptional repressors; Amino acids; amino acid derivative; arga protein; bacterial protein; carbon; carbon 13; crp protein; hisg protein; histidine; ihfa protein; ilva protein; isoleucine; leua protein; leucine; lysine; methanol; methionine; metj protein; phenylalanine; prob protein; purr protein; repressor protein; thra protein; threonine; transcription factor; trpe protein; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; yeast extract; allosterism; amino acid metabolism; amino acid synthesis; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; biosynthesis; controlled study; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; gene knockout; gene overexpression; gene repression; metabolic engineering; metabolic regulation; metabolism; methylotrophic bacterium; methylotrophy; negative feedback; nonhuman; operon; strain difference; transcription regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090999497

Better understanding of building stock dynamics and future development is crucial, e.g., for sustainable management of the built environment as various analyses require long-term projections of building stock development. Recognizing the uncertainty in relation to long-term modeling, we propose a transparent calculation-based QuantiSTOCK model for modeling building stock development. Our approach not only provides a tangible tool for understanding development when selected assumptions are valid but also, most importantly, allows for studying the sensitivity of results to alternative developments of the key variables. Therefore, this relatively simple modeling approach provides fruitful grounds for understanding the impact of different key variables, which is needed to facilitate meaningful debate on different housing, land use, and environment-related policies. The QuantiSTOCK model may be extended in numerous ways and lays the groundwork for modeling the future developments of building stocks. The presented model may be used in a wide range of analyses ranging from assessing housing demand at the regional level to providing input for defining sustainable pathways towards climate targets. Due to the availability of high-quality data, the Finnish building stock provided a great test arena for the model development. © 2021 by the authors.

Fermi 5, Firenze, 50125, Italy","Context. The discovery of giant planets orbiting very low mass stars (VLMS) and the recent observed substructu res in disks aroundVLMS is challenging planet formation models. Specifically, radial drift of dust particles is a catastrophic barrier in these disks, which prevents the formation of planetesimals and therefore planets. Aims. We aim to estimate if structures, such as cavities, rings, and gaps, are common in disks around VLMS and to test models of structure formation in these disks.We also aim to compare the radial extent of the gas and dust emission in disks around VLMS, which can give us insight about radial drift. Methods. We studied six disks around VLMS in the Taurus star-forming region using ALMA Band 7 (340 GHz) at a resolution of 0:100. The targets were selected because of their high disk dust content in their stellar mass regime. Results. Our observations resolve the disk dust continuum in all disks. In addition, we detect the 12CO (J = 3) emission line in all targets and 13CO (J = 32) in five of the six sources. The angular resolution allows the detection of dust substructures in three out of the six disks, which we studied by using UV-modeling. Central cavities are observed in the disks around stars MHO6 (M 5.0) and CIDA1 (M 4.5), while we have a tentative detection of a multi-ringed disk around J0433. We estimate that a planet mass of 0:1 MJup or 0:4 MSaturn is required for a single planet to create the first gap in J0433. For the cavities of MHO6 and CIDA1, a Saturn-mass planet (0.3 MJup) is required. The other three disks with no observed structures are the most compact and faintest in our sample, with the radius enclosing 90% of the continuum emission varying between 13 and 21 au. The emission of 12CO and 13CO is more extended than the dust continuum emission in all disks of our sample. When using the 12CO emission to determine the gas disk extension Rgas, the ratio of Rgas=Rdustin our sample varies from 2.3 to 6.0. One of the disks in our sample, CIDA7, has the largest Rgas=Rdustratio observed so far, which is onsistent with models of radial drift being very efficient around VLMS in the absence of substructures. Conclusions. Given our limited angular resolution, substructures were only directly detected in the ost extended disks, which represent 50% of our sample, and there are hints of unresolved structured emission in one of the bright smooth sources. Our observations do not exclude giant planet formation on the substructures observed. A comparison of the size and luminosity of VLMS disks with their counterparts around higher mass stars shows that they follow a similar relation. © The Author(s), 2021.",,"Dust; Giant stars; Orbits; Planets; Angular resolution; Continuum emission; Emission lines; Giant planet formation; Planet formation; Star-forming region; Structure formations; Very-low-mass stars; Compact disks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100451378

The fastest rate of consumption is 4,7% per year since 2002; by the domination of coal-fired power plant in Indonesia in 2005 with 29.4 million tons of coal consumption, it is projected to be an increment in 2020 with 75 million tons of coal consumption. This condition could lead to generated coal dust, potentially impacting the ground concentration of TSP in the ambient air quality. The further impact may lead to environmental &amp; social issues in the community residence of surrounding coal-fired power plants (PLTU). Considering the potential impact of coal dust emission from coal stockpile activities, then the prediction of coal dust dispersion generated from coal handling activities to determine the ground concentration of TSP is necessary to determine appropriate mitigating control to reduce the coal dust emission. Therefore, such a power plant will have mutual benefits with the surrounding area, especially the community. According to the model prediction result using AERMOD, it could be predicted that the emission contribution from the coal stockpiles is reached 100-200 μg/m3 © 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science",,"Air quality; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal handling; Dispersions; Forecasting; Fossil fuel power plants; Sustainable development; Ambient air quality; Coal consumption; Coal-fired power plant; Development plans; Ground concentrations; Potential impacts; Rate of consumption; Total suspended particulates; Coal dust",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100811797

An advantage of decentralized sanitation systems is the separation of the blackwater (BW) stream, contaminated with human pathogens, from the remaining household water. However, the composition and functions of the microbial community in BW are not known. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomics to assess the dynamics of microbial community structure and function throughout a new BW anaerobic digestion system installed at The Netherlands Institute of Ecology. Samples from the influent (BW), primary effluent (anaerobic digested BW), sludge and final effluent of the pilot upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor and microalgae pilot tubular photobioreactor (PBR) were analyzed. Our results showed a decrease in microbial richness and diversity followed by a decrease in functional complexity and co-occurrence along the different modules of the bioreactor. The microbial diversity and function decrease were reflected both changes in substrate composition and wash conditions. Our wastewater treatment system also decreased microbial functions related to pathogenesis. In summary, the new sanitation system studied here fosters microbial groups and functions that allow the system to efficiently and robustly recover carbon and nutrients while reducing pathogenic groups, ultimately generating a final effluent safe for discharge and reuse. © 2020 by the authors.

One key component is the reduction of emissions produced by motorized vehicles. Since the amount of emission directly correlates to the velocity of a vehicle via energy consumption factors, a general speed limit is often proposed. This article presents a methodology to combine openly available topology data of road networks from OpenStreetMap (OSM) with pay-per-use API traffic data from TomTom to evaluate such measures transparently by analyzing historical real-world circumstances. From our exemplary case study of the German motorway network, we derive that most parts of the motorway network on average do not reach their maximum allowed speed throughout the day due to traffic, construction sites and general road utilization by network participants. Nonetheless our findings prove that the introduction of a speed limit of 120 km per hour on the German autobahn would restrict 50.74% of network flow kilometers for a CO2 reduction of 7.43% compared to the unrestricted state. © 2021 by the authors.

This challenge is generally observed in large energy extensive plants or processes involving fossil fuel combustion. Diesel engines are widely used to convert some of the chemical energy, contained by the diesel fuel, to mechanical energy through combustion. This mechanical energy can be converted into electrical energy using an alternator. Researchers claim that using alternate fuels having similar chemical properties or using foreign fuel as a fractional substance with diesel in these engines could result in a significant reduction in emissions or can alter the concentration of different pollutants. In this study, a methodology is suggested to create a feasible design space for operation with capped emission limits and energy consumption. A data-driven machine learning approach is implemented to classify feasible data points from the data set to create design space.

Its central thesis is that actually existing community, contrary to how the bulk of CRE literature commonly understands it, is a combination of bonds of solidarity and emergent purposes.

Data from insulation markets, economic parameters, fuel prices, and heating degree days (HDDs) were introduced into the model as input variables. To complete the most thorough analysis, three learning algorithms, Levenberg Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) were employed. Five statistical indexes were utilized to evaluate models' performances: determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), standard error of prediction (SEP), RMSE observations' standard deviation ratio (RSR), and average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE). Moreover, visualization techniques were used to assess the similarity between the OIT, ATS, and RCO2 values calculated and predicted. The results obtained clearly show that the LM model outperformed the BR and SCG models in all estimations. Thereafter, the developed ANNs model was validated for different cities.

While considerable research on vulnerability to climate change exists, research about Indian smallholder farming systems as a whole, encompassing farming strategies and development pathways in this context, is limited. Hence, the current study examines the vulnerability of three smallholder farming systems, namely, (i) crop without livestock (CWL), (ii) crop with small ruminants (CSR), and (iii) crop with dairy (CD), in the context of climate change in Telangana, India. A mixed methods approach was used to conduct the research with a sample size of ten households per farming system. We found that households of different farming systems faced differential vulnerability due to variation in perceptions of climate change exposures, access to livelihood capitals, and the farming strategies they chose. The CWL households were highly vulnerable to increased maximum temperature and erratic rainfall, while households that farmed both crop and livestock were more vulnerable to overall reduction in precipitation. Decision-making related to farming strategies was a complex process involving several factors, of which the availability of livelihood capitals, provided by government programs, was the foremost. Due to this, households of the different farming systems pursued divergent farming strategies, leading to varying types of adaptation and climate change resilience. Among the three farming systems, the households in the CWL system had the least access to all livelihood capitals and showed the highest vulnerability as their farm strategies only helped to cope with immediate needs. The households in the CD system had access to all critical livelihood capitals, which facilitated opting for sustainable farming strategies. However, as these households were highly dependent on scarce ground water resources for production, their strategies helped only short-term adaption. The households in the CSR system, despite having access to limited capitals, adopted long-term adaptation strategies which is attributed to them being a pastoral ethnic group. Lastly, despite the existence of an integrated climate change policy, state-level development programs continue to focus more on agricultural intensification than on climate change adaptation. This stimulates farming strategies that are lucrative in the short term but endanger farming system resilience to climate change in the long term. We therefore recommend policy makers to give high priority to climate smart development in state development programs, and science-based evaluations of these programs to enable proper climate change adaptation in dryland regions that is inclusive of perspectives of different populations. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation pathways; Differential vulnerability; Farming strategies of smallholders; Mixed methods research; Semi-arid regions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099689495

However, CH4 in serpentinized waters is thought to be primarily abiogenic, raising key questions about the relative importance of methanogens and methanotrophs in the production and consumption of CH4 in these systems. Herein, we apply molecular approaches to examine the functional capability and activity of microbial CH4 cycling in serpentinization-impacted subsurface waters intersecting multiple rock and water types within the Samail Ophiolite of Oman. Abundant 16S rRNA genes and transcripts affiliated with the methanogenic genus Methanobacterium were recovered from the most alkaline (pH, &gt;10), H2- and CH4-rich subsurface waters. Additionally, 16S rRNA genes and transcripts associated with the aerobic methanotrophic genus Methylococcus were detected in wells that spanned varied fluid geochemistry. Metagenomic sequencing yielded genes encoding homologs of proteins involved in the hydrogenotrophic pathway of microbial CH4 production and in microbial CH4 oxidation. Transcripts of several key genes encoding methanogenesis/methanotrophy enzymes were identified, predominantly in communities from the most hyperalkaline waters. These results indicate active methanogenic and methanotrophic populations in waters with hyperalkaline pH in the Samail Ophiolite, thereby supporting a role for biological CH4 cycling in aquifers that undergo low-temperature serpentinization. IMPORTANCE Serpentinization of ultramafic rock can generate conditions favorable for microbial methane (CH4) cycling, including the abiotic production of hydrogen (H2) and possibly CH4. Systems of low-temperature serpentinization are geobiological targets due to their potential to harbor microbial life and ubiquity throughout Earth's history. Biomass in fracture waters collected from the Samail Ophiolite of Oman, a system undergoing modern serpentinization, yielded DNA and RNA signatures indicative of active microbial methanogenesis and methanotrophy. Intriguingly, transcripts for proteins involved in methanogenesis were most abundant in the most highly reacted waters that have hyperalkaline pH and elevated concentrations of H2 and CH4. These findings suggest active biological methane cycling in serpentinite-hosted aquifers, even under extreme conditions of high pH and carbon limitation. These observations underscore the potential for microbial activity to influence the isotopic composition of CH4 in these systems, which is information that could help in identifying biosignatures of microbial activity on other planets. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

Two correction techniques are considered: the selection of an effective value of the input heliogeophysical index and linear-correlation correction of ionospheric models with respect to the critical frequency of the F2 layer of the ionosphere. Domains in which model correction by one point is effective are found. They determine the current coverage of the European Russia by the Russian ionospheric observation network. The regions in which the correction of median models is noticeable in comparison with the median models without correction are shown to be 7° in latitude and 15° in longitude at the midlatitudes. It is ascertained that it is mainly impossible to determine the ionospheric parameters at northern points and points in the region of the main ionospheric trough via correction based on data from midlatitude ionospheric observation sites. In these cases, the climate models without correction are more effective. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102042809

Our investigation uses the state-of-The-Art regional climate model WRF to produce the six-member, multi-physics ensembles. Results show that our model setup simulates a realistic cyclone track and the transition from an initial disturbance to a tropical-like cyclone with a deep warm core. However, the simulated transition occurs earlier than for the observed medicane. The response of the medicane to future climate change is investigated with a pseudo global warming (PGW) approach. This is the first application of the PGW framework to medicanes. The PGW approach adds a climate change delta (defined as difference between future and present climate) to WRF s boundary conditions which is obtained for all prognostic variables using the mean change in an ensemble of CMIP5 simulations. A PGW simulation where the climate change delta is added to all prognostic variables (PGWALL) shows that most of the medicane characteristics moderately intensify, e.g. surface wind speed, uptake of water vapour, and precipitation. However, the minimum sea level pressure (SLP) is almost identical to that under present climate conditions. Two additional PGW simulations were undertaken; One simulation adds the projected change in sea surface and skin temperature only (PGWSST) while the second simulation adds the PGW changes to only atmospheric variables (PGWATMS); i.e. we use present-day sea surface temperatures. These simulations show opposing responses of the medicane. In PGWSST, the medicane is more intense than PGWALL as indicated by lower SLP values, the stronger surface wind, and the more intense evaporation and precipitation. In contrast, the medicane in PGWATMS still transitions into a tropical-like cyclone with a deep warm core, but the PGWATMS medicane weakens considerably (SLP, surface wind, and rainfall decrease). This difference can be explained by an increase in water vapour driven by the warmer ocean surface (favourable for cumulus convection). The warmer and drier atmosphere in PGWATMS tends to inhibit condensation (unfavourable for cumulus convection). The warmer ocean and warmer atmosphere have counteracting effects which leads to only a modest enhancement of the medicane by global warming. The novel approach in this study provides new insights into the different roles of warming of the ocean and atmosphere in medicane development. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

One of the challenges in aprotic CO2 reduction are the limited achievable current densities under standard conditions, despite the increased CO2 solubility compared to aqueous applications. The application of aprotic solvents can reduce CO2 rather selectively to oxalate, and faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of up to 80% were achieved in this study with a Pb catalyst in acetonitrile, the FE being mainly dictated by the local CO2 concentration at the electrode. This process was integrated into a flow cell employing a two-layered carbon-free lead (Pb) gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and a sacrificial zinc (Zn) anode. With the application of this GDE the applicable current densities could be improved up to a current density of j = 80 mA cm-2 at a FE(oxalate) = 53%, which is within the range of the highest j reported in the literature. In addition, we provide an explanation for the deactivation mechanism of metal catalysts observed in the aprotic CO2 reduction literature. The deactivation is not related to a mass transport limitation but to cathodic corrosion observed at highly negative potential when employing quaternary ammonium supporting electrolyte cations, promoting catalyst leaching. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst deactivation; Corrosion; Current density; Diffusion in gases; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Lead; Organic solvents; Reduction; Aqueous applications; Deactivation mechanism; Faradaic efficiencies; Gas diffusion electrodes; Mass transport limitation; Quaternary ammonium; Standard conditions; Supporting electrolyte; Oxalic acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109439926

However, we know quite little about whether such action can also generate benefits for firms induced by political action, such as benefits associated with public procurement, (softer) regulatory enforcement and corporate tax breaks. We argue that citizens are more likely to support such rewards for firms that have a stronger record of environmental business conduct, express stronger commitment to future environmental action and submit such action to independent audits. The empirical analysis focuses on vehicle emissions reduction by car producers and plastic waste reduction by retailers. Choice experiments with 6726 respondents from Germany and the United States support these arguments. Our findings are surprisingly consistent across two different sociocultural and political contexts (Germany, USA), two different environmental policy domains (vehicle emissions, plastic waste) and three forms of political rewards. Whereas studies focusing on narrowly defined economic benefits (competitiveness) of environmental business conduct have become somewhat more sceptical about the magnitude and scope of such benefits, our results provide more room for optimism by pointing to other types of benefits of corporate environmental action. © 2020 The Author(s)","Choice experiment; Corporate social responsibility; Environment; Public opinion; Regulation","Emission control; Environmental protection; Solid wastes; Taxation; Choice experiments; Competitive advantage; Empirical analysis; Environmental action; Environmental business; Environmental policy; Political actions; Public procurement; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090922265

It is widely accepted that the changes in temperature, rainfall patterns, sea water level and concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will have the most devastating impacts on agricultural production. This paper examines the past and future crop production and food security in Kenya under variable climate. From the review, it is evident that the country is already experiencing episodes of climate change, manifested by seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature of varying severity and duration despite overreliance on rain-fed agriculture. The findings also reveal that climate change would continue to negatively affect crop production and food security to the already vulnerable communities in the arid and semi-arid areas. Future projections also indicate that climate variability will likely alter cropping patterns and yields in several regions. As the country is faced with a high population growth rate and rapid urbanization, crop production and food security systems need to become more adaptive as uncertainties of projected climate variability and change unfold. This study is important in providing decision makers and interested stakeholders with a detailed assessment of climate impacts and adaptation strategies geared towards improved crop production and food security. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate variability; Crop production; Food security; Rain-fed; Yields","adaptive management; agroindustry; arid environment; climate change; climate effect; crop production; cropping practice; food security; growth rate; rainfall; seasonal variation; strategic approach; Kenya",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078605219

Results show that economic growth and fossil fuel consumption are positively related to CO2 emissions, while renewable energy consumption bears a negative relationship with it. Furthermore, fossil fuel consumption has a positive impact on the mortality rate and economic growth a negative one. The negative effect of renewable energy consumption on the mortality rate is only observable on the right tail of its distribution. The modelisation reveals two ways in which the consumption of renewable energy can reduce the outdoor air pollution death rates: (i) directly, by increasing renewable energies, and (i) indirectly because the increase in the consumption of renewable energies implies a decrease in the consumption of energy from fossil fuels. The phenomenon of increasing urbanisation is a point where the action of public policymakers is decisive for the reduction of outdoor air pollution death rates. Here, the question is not to reduce the level of urbanisation but to act on the “quality” of urbanisation, to make cities healthier.

In present-day climate realizations, which are forced by observed sea surface temperature (SST), the AGCM shows high performance in simulating mean and extreme precipitations, such as the annual maximum 1-day precipitation total (Rx1d), with some dependency on the choice of convection schemes. In a warmer climate, mean precipitation is projected to increase in most land monsoon regions especially in East Asia. Extreme precipitation is projected to increase with higher rates than mean precipitation except some regions around the western tropical Pacific. Uncertainty in tropical land precipitation changes originates mainly from differences in convection schemes, contrasting with the tropical oceanic precipitation uncertainty, which is mainly influenced by differences in future SST warming patterns. A significant decrease of tropical cyclone frequency in future climate over the western tropical Pacific results in little changes in Rx1d there, but their interannual variability will increase. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

These systems are suggested to utilize organometallic intermediates during catalysis, though characterization of these species has remained challenging. We have established a mutant of nickel-substituted azurin as a scaffold upon which to develop protein-based models of enzymatic intermediates, including the organometallic states of ACS. In this work, we report the comprehensive investigation of the S = 1/2 Ni-CO and Ni-CH3 states using pulsed EPR spectroscopy and computational techniques. While the Ni-CO state shows conventional metal-ligand interactions and a classical ligand field, the Ni-CH3 hyperfine interactions between the methyl protons and the nickel indicate a closer distance than would be expected for an anionic methyl ligand. Structural analysis instead suggests a near-planar methyl ligand that can be best described as cationic. Consistent with this conclusion, the frontier molecular orbitals of the Ni-CH3 species indicate a ligand-centered LUMO, with a d9 population on the metal center, rather than the d7 population expected for a typical metal-alkyl species generated by oxidative addition. Collectively, these data support the presence of an inverted ligand field configuration for the Ni-CH3 Az species, in which the lowest unoccupied orbital is centered on the ligands rather than the more electropositive metal.

Aquatic habitats with little dissolved oxygen are called dead zones because nothing can live there except some microbes. The number and size of dead zones are increasing worldwide. The book shows that oxygen loss causes fish kills, devastates bottom-dwelling biota, reduces biological diversity, and rearranges aquatic food webs. In the 19th century in rich countries and in poor regions today, dead zones are accompanied by waterborne diseases that kill thousands of people. The open oceans are losing oxygen because of climate change, whereas dead zones in coastal waters and seas are caused by excessive nutrients, which promote excessive growth of algae and eventually oxygen depletion. Work by Gene Turner and Nancy Rabalais demonstrated that nutrients in the Gulf of Mexico come from fertilizers used in the US Midwest, home to the most productive cropland in the world. Agriculture is also the biggest source of nutrients fuelling dead zones in the Baltic Sea and other coastal waters. Today, fertilizers contaminate drinking water and kick-start harmful algal blooms in local lakes and reservoirs. Nutrient pollution in some regions has declined because of buffer zones, cover crops, and precision agriculture, but more needs to be done. The book concludes by arguing that each of us can do our part by changing our diet; eating less, especially eating less red meat, would improve our health and the health of the environment. A better diet could reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emitted by agriculture and shrink dead zones worldwide. © Oxford University Press 2021.

Integrated modelling of disease impacts on farm-scale emissions is important in identifying effective health strategies to reduce emissions. However, it requires that modellers understand the pathways linking animal health to emissions and how these might be incorporated into models. A key barrier to meeting this need has been the lack of a framework to facilitate effective exchange of knowledge and data between animal health experts and emissions modellers. Here, these two communities engaged in workshops, online exchanges and a survey to i) identify a comprehensive list of disease-related model parameters and ii) test its application to evaluating models. Fifty-six parameters were identified and proved effective in assessing the potential of farm-scale models to characterise livestock disease impacts on GHG emissions. Easy wins for the emissions models surveyed include characterising disease impacts related to feeding. © 2020 The Authors","Agricultural modelling; Climate change; Dairy production; Greenhouse gas emissions; Livestock health","agricultural land; animal; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; livestock; Animals; Farms; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Livestock",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100650261

In 2011, heavy rain of 110.5 mm/hr caused great damage to the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Most of the causes of flooding in modern cities include a sharp increase in non-permeable pavement and a lack of water circulation facilities. It is predicted that heavy rainfalls will occur in the future, causing large amounts of local damage. In this study, possible future flood damages were analyzed using climate change scenarios based on the Korean Peninsula. ArcGIS was adopted to perform analyses, and Huff curves were employed for precipitation analysis. Water tanks, permeable pavement, and ecological waterways were installed as mitigation technologies. These three technologies can contribute to flooding mitigation by increasing the rainwater storage capacity. This study suggests that all floods can be reduced by RCP 8.5 by 2050 and 2060. Although there will be run-off after 2050, it is believed that technology will significantly reduce the volume and possibility of floods. It is recommended that a one-year analysis should be conducted in consideration of the maintenance aspects that will arise in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

This study therefore systematically investigated for the first time a pretreatment process to prevent the accumulation of organic and inorganic matter as well as scaling in the CDI process. During various pretreatments, activated filter media and granule activated carbon were considered promising for drinking water treatment. The higher the turbidity and organic matter concentration in the CDI feed solution was, the greater the reduction of salt removal efficiency, production rate, and energy consumption became. Divalent ions, such as Ca2+, had no noticeable effect on CDI treatment performance because of the neutralization effect of the dispersant, whereas iron had a noticeable effect on CDI electrode fouling.

However, few studies have assessed the impact of upwind PM2.5 precursor controls on changes in downwind PM2.5 concentrations. In this study, we analyzed the overall impact of PM2.5 precursor emission controls in upwind areas on PM2.5 in downwind areas with two types of impacts: “direct impact” and “cross impact.” The former refers to PM2.5 changes in downwind areas due to the transported PM2.5 itself, whereas the latter represents PM2.5 changes due to reactions between the transported gaseous precursors and intermediates (i.e., HNO3) originating from upwind areas and locally emitted precursors (i.e. NH3) in the downwind areas. As a case study, we performed air quality modeling for Northeast Asia for January 15–17, 2016 by setting China and South Korea as the upwind and downwind areas, respectively. To account for potential spatiotemporal variations in NH3 emissions in downwind areas, we considered two NH3 conditions. When NOx emissions in China were reduced by 35%, in downwind areas the PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 2.2 μg/m3 under NH3-rich conditions, while PM2.5 concentrations increased by 2.3 μg/m3 under NH3-poor conditions. The direct impact increased by 4.0 μg/m3 in both cases due to upwind NOx disbenefit effects. However, the cross impacts led to a PM2.5 decrease of 6.2 μg/m3 under NH3-rich conditions versus a PM2.5 increase of 1.7 μg/m3 under NH3-poor conditions. We noted that PM2.5 concentrations in the downwind areas may not improve unless a cross impact outweighs a direct impact. This may be one of the reasons why South Korea PM2.5 concentrations have not declined despite efforts by China to reduce their PM2.5 precursor emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Downwind; Emissions control; Long-range transport; Particulate matter; Upwind","Air quality; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction intermediates; Air quality modeling; Emissions reduction; Gaseous precursors; Long range transport; Northeast Asia; PM2.5 concentration; Rich conditions; Spatio-temporal variation; Ammonia; ammonia; nitrate; sulfur dioxide; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; long range transport; particulate matter; air pollution control; air quality; Article; case study; chemical reaction; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; downwind; environmental impact; gas; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; pollution transport; simulation; South Korea; spatiotemporal analysis; upwind; wind; air pollutant; air pollution; Asia; China; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; South Korea; China; Northeast Asia; South Korea; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Republic of Korea; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093703561

Here we present a comparative cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of one and two-step electrochemical conversion of CO2to eight major value-added products; wherein we consider CO2capture, conversion and product separation in our process model. We measure the carbon intensity (i.e., global warming impact) of one and two-step electrochemical routes with its counterparts - thermochemical CO2utilization and fossil-fuel based incumbent synthesis routes for those eight products. Here we show that due to inevitable carbonate formation or CO2crossover in one-step CO2electrolysis using neutral pH membrane electrode assembly, the two-step electrosynthesis pathways (i.e., CO2to CO in solid oxide electrolysis cell followed by CO electroreduction in alkaline flow cell) would be distinctively compelling through the lens of climate benefits. This analysis further reveals that the carbon intensity of electrosynthesis products is due to significant energy requirement for conversion (77-83% of total energy consumption for gas products) and product separation (30-85% of total energy consumption for liquid products) phases. Global warming impact of electrochemical route is highly sensitive to the electricity emission intensity and is compelling over incumbent routes only when coupled with low emission intensity (&lt;0.25 kg CO2e per kWh). As the technology advances, we identify near-term compelling products that would provide climate benefits over incumbent routes, including syngas, ethylene and n-propanol. We further identify technological goals required for electrochemical route to be competitive, notably achieving liquid product concentration &gt;20 wt%. It is our hope that this analysis will guide the CO2electrosynthesis community to target achieving these technological goals, such that when coupled with low-carbon electricity, electrochemical route would bring climate benefits in near future. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Alkalinity; Carbon; Electrolytic reduction; Energy utilization; Ethylene; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Regenerative fuel cells; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Comparative life cycle assessment; Electrochemical conversion; Electrochemical routes; Global warming impact; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon electricities; Membrane electrode assemblies; Total energy consumption; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100430908

The adequate provision of climate information is critical for adaptation planning in climate-sensitive sectors.

The aim of this research was to assess the use of and need for climate information by water managers in China, with a focus on long-term climate information in the Yellow and Yangtze River basins. Data was collected from regional water managers, and climate information providers using a workshop (n = 15), and semi-structured interviews (n = 27). It was found that water manages in China required climate data with different timescales and variables. The findings show that water managers receive historical, weather and seasonal forecasts data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) mainly because there is a close dialogue between data providers and users in terms of historical, weather, and seasonal climate data that does not exist with regard to climate change projections. The use of external sources of climate change projections by users in China allows critical evaluation of climate services provided by the CMA; from that, an understanding of the limitations of current services such as limited variables and timescales was established. © 2020","China; Climate change projections; Climate information; Decision-making; User needs; Water resources","Decision making; Information use; Managers; Weather forecasting; Climate change projections; Climate information; Climate variability and change; Critical evaluation; Seasonal climate data; Semi structured interviews; Specific information; Yangtze River basin; Climate change; rain; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; decision making; water management; Article; Chinese; climate change; decision making; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; flooding; forecasting; human; humidity; manager; priority journal; river basin; seasonal variation; sediment; temperature sensitivity; water management; China; Yangtze Basin; Yellow River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089949847

Despite the large part it plays in the economy, it faces significant challenges caused by climate change, such as rising temperatures, floods, droughts, and yield losses. In Pakistan, rice, which is the second most essential food crop and livelihood source for the millions of farm households, is facing significant yield reduction due to climate change. It is pertinent to consider the vulnerabilities of farm households and related factors to create a climatic-resilient farming system. The current study is aimed at mapping the vulnerability of rice-growing communities of Punjab province while considering climatic challenges beyond temperatures and rainfall changes. The Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) was calculated for four rice-growing districts of Punjab province using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s three-indicator approach (sensitivity, exposition, and adaptive capacity). According to the results, farmers in the study area are highly vulnerable to climate change (CCVI 0.81). Specifically, the indices of vulnerability components showed that farmers have a high level of exposure (EVI 0.72) and susceptibility (SVI 0.59) to the climatic uncertainties with the least adaptive capacity (AVI 0.50). Further, the vulnerability analysis across different rice-growing regions showed that farmers, particularly in the low-yield region, are more vulnerable (EVI 0.73, SVI 0.61, AVI 0.49, CCVI 0.85) than the farmers in the high-yield region (EVI 0.71, SVI 0.58, AVI 0.51, CCVI 0.78). These findings imply that regional priority must be given despite the difference in farm performance to reduce production losses. Besides, climate-smart adaptation initiatives should be facilitated at the farm and regional levels through the implementation of appropriate policies and investment plans. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive capacity; Agriculture; Climate change; Exposure; Pakistan; Punjab; Rice growers; Susceptibility","climate change; crop yield; developing world; drought; farming system; flood; high temperature; livelihood; rural population; urban population; vulnerability; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Indicator indicator; agricultural worker; agriculture; climate change; human; Oryza; Pakistan; Agriculture; Climate Change; Farmers; Humans; Oryza; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091098434

These revisions have previously been shown to increase the production and recycling of HOx radicals at lower NOx levels characteristic of the remote troposphere. The main aim of this study is to assess the resultant broader changes to atmospheric composition due to the recent revisions to isoprene oxidation chemistry. The impact of the increased isoprene-related HOx recycling is found to be significant on the reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) lifetime, e.g. a decrease in isoprene's tropospheric burden by ~17%. The analysis of lifetime reduction of the potent greenhouse gas, methane, associated with the increased HOx recycling, suggests its significant lifetime reduction by ~5% in terms of the current literature. The revisions to the isoprene chemistry also reduce the amount of ozone (by up to 10%), but provide a significant increase in NO3 (by up to 30%) over equatorial forested regions, which can alter the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere. The calculated mixing ratios of formic acid are decreased which in turn leads to an increase in the inferred concentrations of Criegee intermediates due to reduced loss through reaction with formic acid (up to 80%) over the dominant isoprene emitting regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric lifetime; Equatorial region; HOx recycling; Isoprene chemistry; Oxidation cycle","Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric movements; Formic acid; Greenhouse gases; Isoprene; Oxidation; Reaction intermediates; Recycling; Troposphere; Volatile organic compounds; Chemistry and transport models; Criegee intermediates; Lifetime reduction; Mixing ratios; Oxidation chemistry; Oxidizing capacity; Reduced loss; Atmospheric chemistry; formic acid; hydroxide; isoprene; methane; nitrate; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; chemical composition; formic acid; greenhouse gas; isoprene; methane; oxidation; ozone; recycling; reduction; volatile organic compound; Article; atmosphere; forest; oxidation; priority journal; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090586092

The system utilizes waste heat from three different sources, PV/T (photovoltaic thermal) with flat plate collector, milk pasteurization process, and condenser exchange heat. Real weather data is employed to determine the hourly performance of the system in three European cities, Valencia (Spain), Berlin (Germany), and Stockholm (Sweden) representing warm, middle and cold climates, respectively. Moreover, R450A and R513A alternative refrigerants are compared to the greenhouse gas R134a. The results show that the proposed system improves cooling COP by 7% using R450A in comparison with a conventional R134a vapor compression system. Furthermore, the utilization of waste heat recovery enhances the system COP from 3.7 to 4 in the absence of solar intensity. On the other hand, the results of the heating mode show that the system with PV/T and using R450A has a COP increase over the adopted solar time, ranging from 2 to 5% in Valencia; 2 to 2.5% in Berlin, and1 to 1.5% in Stockholm. However, R513A shows a COP reduction of about 5% in comparison to R134a. Regarding the heating mode with waste heat utilization from milk pasteurization, the system based on R450A results in the highest system COP, increasing COP up to 75% compared to the R134a baseline scenario. Overall, the proposed R450A systems show the highest equivalent carbon dioxide emission reduction and, therefore, it is recommended from an environmental point of view. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants; PV/T; Solar ejector; Vapor compression; Waste heat recovery","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Dairies; Ejectors (pumps); Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Heating; Pasteurization; Refrigerants; Waste heat; Alternative refrigerant; Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmentally-friendly refrigerants; Photovoltaic thermals; Simultaneous cooling; Solar assisted heat pump; Theoretical performance; Vapor-compression systems; Waste heat utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097383301

A proper and fair accounting method should motivate both the producers toward cleaner production methods and the consumers toward reducing the embodied emissions of their consumption. This research work proposes a new approach to map the production chain of carbon emissions in which every subsystem is responsible for the level and efficiency of its production activities and embodied emissions for providing its economic activities or final demands. The exergy cost formation concept is used to track the emissions in the production chain. The results of this accounting present the total carbon loads on economic outputs either consumed locally or exported abroad (CExA). The CExA results are then compared to the results of conventional production-based (PBA) and consumption-based (CBA) carbon inventories. Here we show that, in addition to the levels of production and consumption, the economic structures of the countries and the efficiency of the production activities are important factors differentiating the roles of the countries in the global emissions. Our results show that the share of the imported emissions to the total CExA varies between 14% for developing countries to 34% for the developed countries. Moreover, although the ratio of CBA to PBA for the countries is highly dependent on their economic states (0.87 for developing countries and 1.21 for developed countries), the ratio of CExA to PBA does not follow a unique trend among developing or developed countries. The results demonstrate that, according to the proposed sharing approach, the import-oriented developed countries, which have benefited the most from the carbon leakage effect, are mostly penalized for the embodied emissions associated with the imports to their economy, and vice versa. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon accounting; Carbon emission added; Climate change; Exergoenvironmental analysis; Exergy cost; Shared responsibility","Climate change; Developing countries; Economics; Efficiency; Exergy; Pollution control; Carbon inventories; Cleaner production; Climate change mitigation; Developed countries; Economic activities; Embodied emissions; Production activity; Production and consumption; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091905834

Pollution episodes, such as wildfires, can lead to substantial increases in PM2.5 levels. However, sparse regulatory measurements provide an incomplete understanding of pollution gradients. Here, we demonstrate an infrastructure that integrates community-based measurements from a network of low-cost PM2.5 sensors with rigorous calibration and a Gaussian process model to understand neighborhood-scale PM2.5 concentrations during three pollution episodes (July 4, 2018, fireworks; July 5 and 6, 2018, wildfire; Jan 3-7, 2019, persistent cold air pool, PCAP). The firework/wildfire events included 118 sensors in 84 locations, while the PCAP event included 218 sensors in 138 locations. The model results accurately predict reference measurements during the fireworks (n: 16, hourly root-mean-square error, RMSE, 12.3-21.5 μg/m3, n(normalized)RMSE: 14.9-24%), the wildfire (n: 46, RMSE: 2.6-4.0 μg/m3 nRMSE: 13.1-22.9%), and the PCAP (n: 96, RMSE: 4.9-5.7 μg/m3 nRMSE: 20.2-21.3%). They also revealed dramatic geospatial differences in PM2.5 concentrations that are not apparent when only considering government measurements or viewing the US Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow visualizations. Complementing the PM2.5 estimates and visualizations are highly resolved uncertainty maps. Together, these results illustrate the potential for low-cost sensor networks that combined with a data-fusion algorithm and appropriate calibration and training can dynamically and with improved accuracy estimate PM2.5 concentrations during pollution episodes. These highly resolved uncertainty estimates can provide a much-needed strategy to communicate uncertainty to end users. ©",,"Calibration; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Environmental Protection Agency; Explosives; Fires; Mean square error; Pollution; Sensor data fusion; Sensor networks; Visualization; Adverse health effects; Air pollution episodes; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Gaussian process models; Reference measurements; Regulatory measurement; Root mean square errors; US Environmental Protection Agency; Uncertainty analysis; air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental gradient; health and safety; particulate matter; pollution exposure; sensor; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; algorithm; Article; clinical article; cold air; community; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cost; environmental protection; government; human; particulate matter 2.5; pollution monitoring; process model; seasonal variation; time series analysis; Utah; wildfire; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; wildfire; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098955520

In order to achieve these targets, China's CO2 emissions need to be cut deeply by 2050. The present paper presents studies from the integrated policy assessment model for China (IPAC) team about the impact on China's economic development of deep cuts in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in order to realize the Paris climate change targets. With the requirement of deep cuts in GHG emissions in China, China's economic development will also be impacted in moving toward a low-carbon or zero-carbon emission-based economy by 2050. This means the Chinese economy needs a strong transition over the next three decades, a relatively short time. All sectors in the economy need to seek ways to reduce GHG emissions, and this could change activities, industry processes and technologies in order to make the deep cuts in GHG emissions happen. This is the meaning of the economic transition toward to a low-carbon economy. The findings of the present paper include: a significant transition in the energy supply sector; a high rate of electrification in all end-use sectors; and a technology transition in the transport sector. Transitions will also occur in the traditional industrial sectors, including steel making, cement manufacture, and the chemical sector. The availability of low-cost renewable energy could change the allocation of industries, which could potentially have a strong impact on regional economic development. Deep cuts in CO2 emissions in China need not be a burden for economic development, as the IPAC results show there will be a more than 1.5% increase of gross domestic product by 2050 in the deep cut scenario compared with the baseline scenario. © 2021 Japan Center for Economic Research","China; CO2 emission reduction; economy transition; energy transition; Paris Agreement; Q43; Q48; Q54; Q58; scenario",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099282057

Since knocking combustion is highly stochastic, a cyclic analysis of in-cylinder pressure is necessary. In this study we propose an approach for efficient and robust detection and identification of knocking combustion in three different internal combustion engines. The proposed methodology includes a signal processing technique, called continuous wavelet transformation (CWT), which provides a simultaneous analysis of the in-cylinder pressure traces in the time and frequency domains with coefficients. These coefficients serve as input for a convolutional neural network (CNN) which extracts distinctive features and performs an image recognition task in order to distinguish between non-knock and knock. The results revealed the following: (i) The CWT delivered a stable and effective feature space with the coefficients that represents the unique time-frequency pattern of each individual in-cylinder pressure cycle; (ii) the proposed approach was superior to the state-of-the-art threshold value exceeded (TVE) method with a maximum amplitude pressure oscillation (MAPO) criterion improving the overall accuracy by 6.15 percentage points (up to 92.62%); and (iii) The CWT + CNN method does not require calibrating threshold values for different engines or operating conditions as long as enough and diverse data is used to train the neural network. © 2021 by the authors.

Four isolated strains showed high efficiency for the degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and the reduction of COD of the oily sludge, at 96.6% and 92.6%, respectively. The mixed strains together with bran prepared in form of SCBA exhibited improved performance compared to individual strains, all of which had an optimal temperature of around 35 °C. The use of SCBA provided advantages over commonly used liquid media for storage and transportation. The two-step process, consisting of firstly biosurfactant-assisted oil recovery and secondly biodegradation of the remaining TPH with SCBA, demonstrated the capability for treating oily sludge with high TPH content (> 10 wt%) and short process period (60 days). The large-scale (5 tons oily sludge) field test, achieving a TPH removal efficiency of 93.8% and COD reduction of 91.5%, respectively, confirmed the feasibility and superiority of the technology for industrial applications. © 2020 The Authors","Bioremediation; Oily sludge; Solid complex bacterial agent; Two-step combined treatment","aromatic hydrocarbon; arsenic; asphalten; benzo[a]pyrene; biosurfactant; cadmium; chemical compound; chromium; copper; cyclophthalide; hydrocarbon; lead; mercury; nitrogen; petroleum derivative; phosphate; unclassified drug; zinc; hydrocarbon; petroleum; bioremediation; chemical oxygen demand; oil pollution; petroleum hydrocarbon; pollutant removal; sludge; waste treatment; Article; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; biodegradation; bioremediation; Chelatococcus daeguensis; chemical oxygen demand; community structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation; high throughput sequencing; leaching; Luteimonas huabeiensis; microbial activity; nonhuman; oily sludge; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; sludge; temperature; water content; bioremediation; chemistry; culture medium; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; oil spill; prevention and control; sewage; Bacteria (microorganisms); Biodegradation, Environmental; Culture Media; Hydrocarbons; Microbiota; Petroleum; Petroleum Pollution; Sewage; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096661562

Lefka Ori massif, a global biodiversity hotspot on the island of Crete is part of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) monitoring network. The paper examines species and vegetation changes with respect to climate and altitude over a seven-year period (2001–2008) at a range of spatial scales (10 m Summit Area Section-SAS, 5 m SAS, 1 m2 ) using the GLORIA protocol in a re-survey of four mountain summits (1664 m–2339 m). The absolute species loss between 2001–2008 was 4, among which were 2 endemics. At the scale of individual summits, the highest changes were recorded at the lower summits with absolute species loss 4 in both cases. Paired t-tests for the total species richness at 1 m2 between 2001–2008, showed no significant differences. No significant differences were found at the individual summit level neither at the 5 m SAS or the 10 m SAS. Time series analysis reveals that soil mean annual temperature is increasing at all summits. Linear regressions with the climatic variables show a positive effect on species richness at the 5 m and 10 m SAS as well as species changes at the 5 m SAS. In particular, June mean temperature has the highest predictive power for species changes at the 5 m SAS. Recorded changes in species richness point more towards fluctuations within a plant community’s normal range, although there seem to be more significant diversity changes in higher summits related to aspects. Our work provides additional evidence to assess the effects of climate change on plant diversity in Mediterranean mountains and particularly those of islands which remain understudied. © 2021 by the authors.

Studies of the local heat transfer coefficients were carried out using a 3D-CRFD-mathematical model developed and verified on the basis of the experimental results, first used to study a hydrogen engine of this type. It has been established that the operation of a hydrogen engine on combustible mixtures of stoichiometric (or close to it) composition is impractical, since it leads not only to abnormal combustion processes and increased emission of nitrogen oxides, but also to an increase in local heat loads on parts, in particular on the piston, the local temperatures of which may exceed acceptable values. It is shown that the use of lean mixtures can prevent undesirable phenomena, in particular, reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides, reduce heat loads, and improve the heat-stressed state of the piston, providing acceptable conditions for the operation of the hydrogen engine. © 2021, Allerton Press, Inc.","combustion chamber; hydrogen engine; lean hydrogen–air mixture; local heat exchange; mathematical modeling; nitrogen oxides","Combustion chambers; Heat transfer; Hydrogen; Hydrogen engines; Hydrogen fuels; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Pistons; Thermal load; Abnormal combustion; Combustible mixture; Local heat transfer; Local heat transfer coefficient; Local temperature; Mixture formation; Stressed state; Working process; Engine pistons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102373545

However, these biological processes are associated with the potential production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that need to be measured. In this study, we quantified nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from the soil under a transition period from dry to wet conditions in subtropical Australia. The GHG fluxes were measured on the bed of slow (wet basin) and fast (dry basin) draining basins and their embankment area. In addition, the influence of Carex appressa plant on emissions was investigated. Finally, the denitrification potential of the basin soil and their C and N accumulation (over an 18-month interval) were measured. The dry and the embankment soils were both slight sinks of CH4 (−16 and − 2 μg CH4 − C m−2 h−1) while being a high source of CO2 (&gt; 520 × 103 μg CO2 − C m−2 h−1). In comparison, the wet basin was a source of CO2 and CH4 with a mean value of 123× 103 μg CO2 − C m−2 h−1 and 2405 μg CH4 − C m−2 h−1, respectively. The dry and wet basins were a slight source of N2O emissions and were positively driven by precipitation. The presence of C. appressa plant increased CH4 consumption and N2O generation. The results suggest that adopting a slow-draining design for bioretention systems, such as lowering the hydraulic conductivity and/or provision of a saturation zone higher in the soil profile, can reduce CO2 and N2O fluxes from the soils and potentially improve water quality performance of these basins. However, an increase in CH4 fluxes should be the expected by-product. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biofiltration basin; Denitrification potential; Global warming potential; Green infrastructure; Stormwater control measure; Water sensitive urban design systems","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Embankments; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Water quality; Anaerobic conditions; Biological process; Bioretention basins; Denitrification potential; Microbial activities; Potential production; Transition period; Water quality performance; Greenhouse gases; anoxic conditions; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; denitrification; greenhouse gas; microbial activity; nitrous oxide; soil profile; stormwater; Australia; Carex appressa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097873799

An estimated six million people in over 150 countries took to the streets over a period of a week to demand action on climate change (Taylor, Watts & Bartlett, 2019).

The present study simultaneously quantified the carbon footprint (CF) and water footprint (WF) of rice and wheat production in the five agro-climatic zones of Punjab, India using farm survey data. Further, the variability in CF among the five agro-climatic zones and farm sizes was analysed. The carbon footprint per unit area of rice and wheat was found to be 8.80 ± 5.71 and 4.18 ± 1.13 t CO2eq/ha respectively. The CF per tonne of rice and wheat was 1.20 ± 0.70 and 0.83 ± 0.23 t CO2eq/t respectively. Large farms had 39% lower CF per tonne of rice compared to small farms. Residue burning, direct methane emissions and fertilizer use were the most important factors that contributed to the CF of rice and wheat production in Punjab. Nitrogen fertilizer use was identified as the major hotspot for mitigation. The average WF of rice and wheat was found to be 1097 and 871 m3/t respectively. A disparity between CROPWAT estimates of blue WF and actual blue water use was established indicating the need for actual blue WF accounting, particularly for flood irrigated crop production. Additionally, policy measures based on ground situation are discussed and the major role of local government policies in mitigating carbon and water footprint is highlighted. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crop residue management; Farm survey; Irrigated agriculture; Life cycle GHG emissions; Nitrogen fertilizer; Policy issues","agrometeorology; carbon footprint; crop production; fertilizer application; food production; local government; rice; spatiotemporal analysis; water footprint; wheat; India; Punjab [India]; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092395967

Herein, the effect of defects, controlled by ozone dosage, on the field cycling behavior of the atomic layer deposited Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) films is investigated. A nearly wake-up free device is achieved after reduction of carbon contamination and oxygen defects by increasing the ozone dosage. The sample which is grown at 30 s ozone pulse duration shows about 97% of the woken-up Pr at the pristine state whereas that grown below 5 s ozone pulse time shows a pinched hysteresis loop, that underwent a large wake-up effect. This behavior is attributed to the increase in oxygen vacancy and carbon concentration in the films deposited at insufficient O3 dosage, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) scan shows that the increase in ozone pulse time yields the reduction of tetragonal phase; therefore, the dielectric constant reduces. The I–V measurements reveal the increase in current density as the ozone dosage decreases, which might be due to the generation of oxygen vacancies in the deposited film. Finally, the dynamics of wake-up effect is investigated, and it appears to be explained well by the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogoroff model, which is based on structural phase transformation. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbon contents; defect engineering; ferroelectrics; HfO2; Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogoroff model; leakage currents; wake-up effects; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies","Atomic layer deposition; Carbon; Carbon films; Defects; Ferroelectric films; Ferroelectric thin films; Hafnium oxides; Ozone; Ozone layer; Thin films; Wakes; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zirconium compounds; Atomic layer deposited; Carbon concentrations; Carbon contamination; Defect engineering; Deposited films; Pulse durations; Structural phase transformations; Tetragonal phase; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091530173

The model predicts that both the concentration of CO2 and the buffer electrolyte gradually diminish along the channels for a parallel flow of gas and electrolyte as a result of electrochemical conversion and nonelectrochemical consumption. At high single-pass conversions, significant concentration gradients exist along the flow channels leading to large local variations in the current density (>150 mA/cm2), which becomes prominent when compared to ohmic losses. In addition, concentration overpotentials change dramatically with CO2 flow rate, which results in significant differences in outlet concentrations at high conversions. The outlet concentration of CO attains a maximum of 80% along with 5% CO2 and 15% H2, although the maximum single-pass conversion is limited to below 60% due to homogeneous consumption by the electrolyte. Fundamental and practical implications of our findings on electrochemical CO2 reduction are discussed with a focus on the trade-off between high current density operation and high single-pass conversion efficiency. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Concentration overpotential; Electrochemical CO2reduction; Local pH; Modeling study; Single pass conversion","Carbon dioxide; Current density; Diffusion in gases; Economic and social effects; Electrodes; Parallel flow; Reduction; Buffer electrolytes; Channel gradients; Concentration gradients; Electrochemical conversion; Gas diffusion electrodes; High current densities; Outlet concentration; Transport modeling; Electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099955907

However, the total carbon footprint of the associated supply chain still needs to be carefully investigated. In this study we propose a stochastic biobjective optimization model to analyze the economic and environmental impacts of biopower supply chains. We use a life cycle assessment approach to derive the emission factors used in the environmental objective function. We use chance constraints to capture the uncertain nature of energy content of biomass feedstocks. We propose a cutting plane algorithm which uses the sample average approximation method to model the chance constraints and finds high confidence feasible solutions. In order to find Pareto optimal solutions we propose a heuristic approach which integrates the ϵ-constraint method with the cutting plane algorithm. We show that the developed approach provides a set of local Pareto optimal solutions with high confidence and reasonable computational time.

This face-to-face interaction has been understood as critically important for developing partnerships and building trust. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant uncertainty worldwide, including international travel restrictions of indeterminate permanence. Following the 2020 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine meeting, the Global Emergency Medicine Academy (GEMA) sought to enhance collective understanding of best practices in GEM training with a focus on multidirectional education and remote collaboration in the setting of COVID-19. GEMA members led an initiative to outline thematic areas deemed most pertinent to the continued implementation of impactful GEM programming within the physical and technologic confines of a pandemic. Eighteen GEM practitioners were divided into four workgroups to focus on the following themes: advances in technology, valuation, climate impacts, skill translation, research/scholastic projects, and future challenges. Several opportunities were identified: broadened availability of technology such as video conferencing, Internet, and smartphones; online learning; reduced costs of cloud storage and printing; reduced carbon footprint; and strengthened local leadership. Skills and knowledge bases of GEM practitioners, including practicing in resource-poor settings and allocation of scarce resources, are translatable domestically. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a paradigm shift in the practice of GEM, identifying a previously underrecognized potential to both strengthen partnerships and increase accessibility. This time of change has provided an opportunity to enhance multidirectional education and remote collaboration to improve global health equity. © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096794761

The challenges for each pathway to produce “drop-in” fuels are covered. Currently “drop-in” fuel production cost is approximately 2 times (~5–6$/gallon) higher than fossil fuels (3$/gallon), especially with the use of 2nd generation feedstocks. The primary sources of cost with “drop-in” fuel production are feedstock cost (40–60% of the total production cost), syngas cleaning and conditioning to meet Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requirement (12–15% of the total production cost) and bio oil upgrading (14–18% of the total production cost) in the case of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The most influential factors on the life cycle analysis (LCA) were biomass cultivation, harvesting, biomass pre-treatment, and transportation. Therefore, robust processes that can use local waste biomass are far more environmental and economically viable, especially as biofuel from second generation have a greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (50–100%) than first generation biofuels (50–90%) when land use changes are omitted in the LCA. The sustainability of biofuels is pre-dominantly dependant on the sustainability of the initial biomass, with 2nd generation feedstocks being more sustainable than 1st generation. Gasification-FTS is considered as the most promising technique for “drop-in” fuel production over pyrolysis and HTL due to its flexibility towards feedstock acceptance and the ability to produced high yields of liquid fuel together with other economically viable biofuels such as electricity and heat. Biochemical routes (i.e.fermentation) to “drop-in” fuels are still in their early development stages, and therefore require more studies and pilot-scale experiments in order to discover an economic and sustainable means of using these methods. © 2020","Biomass; Conversion technologies; Life cycle assessment; Techno-economic analysis; “Drop-in” fuels","Biomass; Costs; Drops; Economics; Feedstocks; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrothermal synthesis; Land use; Life cycle; Lignocellulosic biomass; Pyrolysis; Sustainable development; Synthesis gas manufacture; Biomass pre treatments; Economical feasibility; Economically viable; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Pilot-scale experiments; Sustainable assessment; Techno-economic feasibility; Total production cost; Biofuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088998377

Of particular interest are those systems that contain exoplanets at a variety of star-planet separations, allowing direct comparison of exoplanet evolution (comparative planetology). The Kepler-1649 system contains two terrestrial planets similar both in size and insolation flux to Venus and Earth, although their eccentricities remain largely unconstrained. Here we present results of dynamical studies of the system and the potential effects on climate. The eccentricities of the Kepler-1649 system are poorly constrained, and we show that there are dynamically viable regions for further terrestrial planets in between the two known planets for a limited range of eccentricities. We investigate the effect of eccentricity of the outer planet on the dynamics of both planets and show that this results in high-frequency (1000-3000 years) eccentricity oscillations in long-term stable configurations. We calculate the resulting effect of these eccentricity variations on insolation flux and present the results of 3D climate simulations for the habitable zone planet. Our simulations demonstrate that, despite large eccentricity variations, the planet can maintain stable climates with relatively small temperature variations on the substellar hemisphere for a variety of initial climate configurations. Such systems thus provide key opportunities to explore alternative Venus/Earth climate evolution scenarios. © 2020. The American Astronomical Society.

This study evaluates quadrennial, and seasonal surface ozone variations, ozone trends along with its significance through seasonal and deseasonal datasets, and ozone-NO2 correlation to codify a precedent for pollution control policies. China is divided into eight regions namely: Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), North (N), East (E), Central (C), South (S), Southwest (SW), and Tibet (T), to exploit four-years data via (a) ozone 8-hr moving averages (O3-8hr), (b) hourly ozone monthly mean (O3-MM), (c) hourly ozone daily maximum MM (O3-DM-MM), (d) mean of the daily maximum 8-hr average ozone (MDA8-O3), (e) hourly ozone averages (O3-1hr), and (f) hourly NO2 averages (NO2-1hr), respectively. Quadrennial variations show distinct regions (i) Northeast with daily upraised value of 164.59 μg/m3, (ii) North possessing increased monthly variation of 125 μg/m3, and (iii) Tibet containing maximum yearly value of 79.81 μg/m3, respectively. Seasonal variations outpace North and South regions. The highest and lowest values of seasonal variations in North region are 135.61 μg/m3, and 23.96 μg/m3 during summer and winter, while maximum values of South region are 87.98 μg/m3 in autumn. In trend analysis, the seasonal dataset highlights higher ozone values during autumn, i.e. 74.12 μg/m3 and 141.96 μg/m3 for South and Central regions, respectively. In the meantime, the deseasonal dataset reveals the presence of increasing ozone trends in all studied regions. In assessing statistical significance by Mann-Kendall test, seasonal dataset rolls out statistically insignificant trends with an exception of South region. Meanwhile, deseasonal dataset projects statistically significant trends in all the eight regions. Lastly, two continual regions North and South are selected to determine ozone-NO2 relationship. The multiple analytical approaches unveil that O3 has increased by 20.86%, 14.05% and 12.64% in North, Central and South regions. The dissimilar climate, land cover modifications, precursors transportation and vehicular emissions might be some of the rationales to give rise to regional ozone variations. Therefore, we suggest revamping of emissions control policies and their precise implementation to abate ozone pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deseasonal dataset; NO2; Quadrennial; Seasonal variations; Surface ozone; Trend significance","Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Pollution control; Statistical tests; Analytical approach; Emissions control; Mann-Kendall test; Moving averages; Ozone pollution; Seasonal variation; Statistical significance; Vehicular emission; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; detection method; economic development; land cover; ozone; pollution control; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; air monitoring; air pollutant; air quality; Article; autumn; China; climate; land use; pollution control; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; statistical significance; summer; Tibet; time series analysis; trend study; winter; China; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096368039

This has resulted in lockdown under different phases in many nations, including India, around the globe. In the present study, we report the impact of aerosols on surface ozone in the context of pre-lockdown (01st - 24th March 2020 (PLD)), lockdown phase1 (25th March to 14th April 2020 (LDP1)), and lockdown phase 2 (15th April to 03rd May 2020 (LDP2)) on clear days at a semi-arid site, Anantapur in southern India using both in situ observations and model simulations. Collocated measurements of surface ozone (O3), aerosol optical depth (AOD), black carbon mass concentration (BC), total columnar ozone (TCO), solar radiation (SR), and ultraviolet radiation (UV-A) data were collected using an Ozone analyzer, MICROTOPS sunphotometer, Ozonometer, Aethalometer, and net radiometer during the study period. The diurnal variations of O3 and BC exhibited an opposite trend during three phases. The concentrations of ozone were ~10.7% higher during LDP1 (44.8 ± 5.2 ppbv) than the PLD (40.5 ± 6.0 ppbv), which mainly due to an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. The prominent increase in the surface zone during LDP1 is reasonably consistent with the observed photolysis frequencies (j (O1D)) through Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) model. The results show that a pronounced spectral and temporal variability in the AOD during three lockdown phases is mainly due to distinct aerosol sources. The increase in AOD during LDP2 due to long-range transport can bring large amounts of mineral dust and smoke aerosols from the west Asian region and central India, and which is reasonably consistent with the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) air mass back trajectories and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire counts analysis over the measurement location. Overall, a drastic reduction in BC concentration (~8.4%) and AOD (10.8%) were observed in the semi-arid area during LDP1 with correspondence to PLD. The columnar aerosol size distributions retrieved from the spectral AODs followed power-law plus unimodal during three phases. The absorption angstrom exponent (AAE) analysis reveals a predominant contribution to the BC from biomass burning activities during the lockdown period over the measurement location. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth; HYSPLIT; Semi-arid; Surface ozone","Aerosols; Particle size analysis; Photolysis; Radiometers; Smoke; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol size distributions; Air mass back trajectories; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Photolysis frequencies; Satellite observations; Total columnar ozones; World Health Organization; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097738832

This work examines to what extent the currently carbon-intensive hydrogen production in Europe could be replaced by water electrolysis using electricity from renewable energy resources (RES) such as solar photovoltaic, onshore/offshore wind and hydropower (green hydrogen). The study assesses the technical potential of RES at regional and national levels considering environmental constraints, land use limitations and various techno-economic parameters. It estimates localised clean hydrogen production and examines the capacity to replace carbon-intensive hydrogen hubs with ones that use RES-based water electrolysis. Findings reveal that -at national level- the available RES electricity potential exceeds the total electricity demand and the part for hydrogen production from electrolysis in all analysed countries. At regional level, from the 109 regions associated with hydrogen production (EU27 and UK), 88 regions (81%) show an excess of potential RES generation after covering the annual electricity demand across all sectors and hydrogen production. Notably, 84 regions have over 50% excess RES electricity potential after covering the total electricity demand and that for water electrolysis. The study provides evidence on the option to decarbonize hydrogen production at regional level.

This has rendered these countries more vulnerable to climate change–induced variability. In spite of the uncertainties about anticipated magnitude of climate change on regional scale, an assessment of the possible changes in key climatic elements to identify most vulnerable locations becomes important for formulating adaptation strategies. This study compiles the existing knowledge about observed climate and projections of future change in Telangana state of India. The agriculture in this semiarid state has to adapt to changes in mean climate variables to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged dry spells. Based on climatic vulnerability assessment, we found that the number of vulnerable mandals (currently 28%) will be increased to 45% during early century and to 59% by mid-century. As per the climate exposure index scores, Jogulamba-Gadwal district was found to be most sensitive. Overall, vulnerability index scores indicated that Adilabad, Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda, Peddapalli, Suryapet, Wanaparthy, and Yadadri are extremely vulnerable districts in the state. The ranking of vulnerable mandals in each district envisages the need for a holistic approach for each mandal or a group of mandals to reduce their sensitivity though implementation of site-specific adaptation strategies to minimize climate-related shocks not only in agriculture but also in other sectors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture and adaptation; Climate change; Vulnerability","adaptation; agricultural development; agricultural production; climate change; extreme event; risk assessment; vulnerability; India; Telangana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092725155

In all European Union (EU) countries, including Latvia, it is possible to use renewable energy resources cost-effectively. The world is now at the beginning of the global energy transformation. Cost-effective renewable energy technologies provided an opportunity for sufficient development to reach ambitious climate targets of the EU Directive 2009/28/EC. Some systems are not only dependent on the interaction of many elements and dynamics over time, but they are also variable in space. In this context, energy production from local and renewable resources is one of the most relevant examples. It is characterized by many spatially variable elements, such as biomass availability, wind speed, solar radiation, location of power plants, transmission network infrastructure, energy demand, etc. It is crucial to explore the spatial distribution of resources to plan territorially-unified development of renewable energy and, consequently, promote efficient use of resources. This paper describes the data acquisition process of the spatial distribution of renewable energy sources.

Therefore, studying the trans-critical injection characteristics of diesel is of great significance for further understanding of diesel supercritical combustion. In this work, a diesel trans-critical injection experiment is first carried out to test the liquid and vapor jet structure. Then the six-component surrogate of diesel is used to represent the thermo-physical properties of diesel in the range from subcritical state to supercritical state. Based on these thermo-physical properties, the dense fluid approximation method based on Large Eddy Simulation is applied to simulate the trans-critical injection processes of diesel. The results show that there is only a short continuous cold liquid core near the nozzle exit in the diesel trans-critical injection. The dense fluid approximation method based on diesel six-component surrogate and Large Eddy Simulation can accurately predict the diesel trans-critical injection properties. In order to accurately simulate the diesel trans-critical injection, it is necessary to develop a reliable diesel surrogate that can accurately emulate diesel various properties. Generally, this work is helpful to understand the characteristics of diesel trans-critical injections, and the numerical model is valuable for the optimal design of diesel engines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel; Large Eddy simulation; Supercritical; Surrogate; Trans-critical","Approximation theory; Combustion; Large eddy simulation; Physical properties; Diesel surrogates; Engine efficiency; Harmful emissions; Injection process; Subcritical state; Supercritical combustion; Supercritical state; Thermo-physical property; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092941976

Identifying and quantifying its emission sources are critical for effective policymaking and achieving the desired reduction in air pollution. In this study, we present the first direct measurements of urban BC fluxes using eddy covariance. The measurements were made over Beijing within the UK-China Air Pollution and Human Health (APHH) winter 2016 and summer 2017 campaigns. In both seasons, the mean measured BC mass (winter: 5.49 ng m-2 s-1, summer: 6.10 ng m-2 s-1) and number fluxes (winter: 261.25 particles cm-2 s-1, summer: 334.37 particles cm-2 s-1) were similar. Traffic was determined to be the dominant source of the BC fluxes measured during both seasons. The total BC emissions within the 2013 Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) are on average too high compared to measured fluxes by a factor of 58.8 (winter) and 47.2 (summer). Only a comparison with the MEIC transport sector shows that emissions are also larger (factor of 37.5 in winter and 37.7 in summer) than the measured flux. Emission ratios of BC / NOx and BC / CO are comparable to vehicular emission control standards implemented in January 2017 for gasoline (China 5) and diesel (China V) engines, indicating a reduction of BC emissions within central Beijing, and extending this to a larger area would further reduce total BC concentrations. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

We assess the effectiveness of ambient PM2.5 regulations in Chile by estimating meteorologically adjusted trends in ambient PM2.5. This analysis includes 9 geographical regions, 33 monitoring sites in 23 cities, comprising 61% of Chile's urban population. We find a significant downward trend in ambient PM2.5 in most cities that have an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP, PDA in Spanish); these include the case of Santiago and southern cities at which ambient PM2.5 is dominated by residential wood burning (RWB). However, in cities without AQMP our results are mixed: in some cities there is no significant trend at all and in others there is a downward, significant trend, ascribed to nationwide regulations upon mobile sources. Overall, we estimate a significant downward trend in ambient PM2.5 for 56% of Chile's urban population. Hence, ongoing regulations have been efficient in reducing ambient PM2.5. The significant downward trends are higher in magnitude (up to 4.4 μg/m3 per year) for smaller, more polluted cities than for cleaner or larger urban zones (down to 0.3 μg/m3 per year). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality regulations; Motor vehicle emissions; Residential wood burning; Sustainable urban development; Urban air quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098191574

To understand the effects of agricultural production on forest carbon, we quantify the aboveground carbon (AGC) of a degraded forest in northeast Gabon (the Olam Rubber Gabon concession) designated for development to a rubber plantation. Combining field measurements from 19 1-ha tree plots and aerial LiDAR, we estimate forest AGC stocks and emissions under four development scenarios: no development, 30-year rubber rotation, extended rubber rotation (replanting of plantation in stages at 30 and 40 years), and 30-year oil palm rotation. On average, the degraded forest in the study area stored 123.8 Mg C ha−1, a mean AGC lower than the Gabon average (141.6 Mg C ha−1) but substantially higher than the 75 Mg C ha−1 threshold recommended by the High Carbon Stock protocol. Converting secondary forest to plantation might incur high environmental opportunity costs from lost carbon sequestration through forest succession and growth. In this study, we estimate that a rubber plantation can sequester similar amounts of AGC as secondary forest by the end of a 30-year rotation; however, the time-averaged AGC of regenerating secondary forests under no development would be 184% higher than a mature rubber plantation with a 30-year rotation, 169% higher than an extended rubber rotation, and 512% higher than a 30-year oil palm rotation. When degraded forest is developed for agriculture, measures should be taken to avoid emissions and prolong carbon retention. We specifically estimate carbon retention from extended harvest rotations and conserving high carbon value areas as set-asides and highlight recommendations from the literature such as minimizing soil disturbance and creating rubber timber products (e.g. furniture). To minimize carbon emissions from agriculture, crop plantation area should be minimized at national and regional scales in highly forested countries, and new plantations should be coupled explicitly with effective forest restoration actions, through suitable regulation and planning, to mitigate or compensate for their climate and biodiversity impacts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Central Africa; Gabon; Land use; Rubber plantation; Secondary forest; Tropical agriculture","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Biodiversity; Carbon; Oil field development; Palm oil; Reforestation; Rotation; Rubber plantations; Rubber products; Soil conservation; Above-ground carbons; Agricultural productions; Carbon sequestration; Development scenarios; Economic productivity; Forest restoration; Forest succession; Opportunity costs; Rubber industry; agricultural production; biodiversity; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; environmental degradation; environmental disturbance; environmental economics; food availability; rubber; secondary forest; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Carbon; Development; Gabon; Reforestation; Rotation; Rubber; Gabon; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094327191

Current adoption levels remain low because of issues such as long payback periods, limited consumer awareness, capital constraints, and resource intermittency challenges. In this study, we assess the ability of two system design concepts to improve the economics of distributed water and energy technologies, and ultimately encourage their broader adoption: (1) co-optimizing water and energy technology investments and operations, and (2) investing in community-scale rather than home-scale systems. We explore the benefits of these approaches by formulating a mixed-integer linear program for optimal system design and dispatch. Our case study applies this model to a neighborhood in Austin, Texas. Results show that distributed electricity and water production increase, and total cost decreases, when resources and demands are pooled at larger community scales. These community-scale systems make a wider range of technologies economically viable and enable greater asset utilization due to systems integration.

The MOCAGE model, the chemistry transport model developed by Météo-France, forecasts hourly surface PM10 concentrations at a resolution of 0.1° throughout France (7.6 km). To obtain more efficient forecasts, a downscaling method is applied using topographic data (250-m resolution) and inventory data (2.2 km). All these disparate inputs are spatially standardized in a geographical information system to construct continuous daily fields at 250-m resolution. This method is suitable for large territories with widely varying environments (mountains, lowlands, coastlinessnap, urban areas, etc.) and areas with a low density of monitoring stations. The parameters used to improve MOCAGE forecasts are derived from “global” and “local” regressions describing the links between the daily PM10 concentration averages collected at 325 monitoring stations and seven explanatory variables (three topographic and four emission-inventory variables). One of the main results shows that the topographic and emission variables, respectively, explain 6% and 13% of PM10 variance in France. Analysis by local regression accounts for 74% of the spatial variation of PM10 concentration, while the global regression accounts for 49%. The results show above all that if the authorities responsible for human health protection had used the downscaling method instead of MOCAGE raw forecasts in 2016, they would have informed or alerted ten times as many people about the information and recommendation threshold (50 μg m−3) and alert threshold (80 μg m−3) being exceeded. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Land use regression methods; Particulate matter; Public health; Spatialization","air quality; concentration (composition); downscaling; forecasting method; particulate matter; public health; regression analysis; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092717463

The strain is unique relative to other Cohnella species due to its slow growth and reduced number of sole carbon sources. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA indicated that strain CBP-2801T is a Cohnella bacterium and showed the highest similarity to Cohnella xylanilytica (96.8%). Genome-based phylogeny and genomic comparisons based on average nucleotide identity confirmed the strain to be a novel species of Cohnella. Growth occurs at 15–45 °C (optimum 40 °C), pH 5–7 (optimum pH 6) and with 0–1% NaCl. The predominant fatty acids are anteiso-15:0 and 18:1 ω6c.

The original idea was to examine how the damaging roots of nationalism have been corroding political systems around the world, and creating dangerous obstacles for necessary international cooperation. Since I (Bruce E. Johansen) has written profusely about climate change (global warming, a.k.a. infrared forcing), I suggested a concerted effort in that direction. This is a worldwide existential threat that affects every living thing on Earth. It often compounds upon itself, so delays in reducing emissions of fossil fuels are shortening the amount of time remaining to eliminate the use of fossil fuels to preserve a livable planet. Nationalism often impedes solutions to this problem (among many others), as nations place their singular needs above the common good. Our initial proposal got around, and abstracts on many subjects arrived. Within a few weeks, we had enough good material for a 100, 000-word book. The book then fattened to two moderate volumes and then to four two very hefty tomes. We tried several different titles as good submissions swelled. We also discovered that our best contributors were experts in their fields, which ranged the world. We settled on three stand-alone books:"" 1/ nationalism and racial justice. Our first volume grew as the growth of Black Lives Matter following the brutal killing of George Floyd ignited protests over police brutality and other issues during 2020, following the police assassination of Floyd in Minneapolis. It is estimated that more people took part in protests of police brutality during the summer of 2020 than any other series of marches in United States history. This includes upheavals during the 1960s over racial issues and against the war in Southeast Asia (notably Vietnam). We choose a volume on racism because it is one of nationalism’s main motive forces. This volume provides a worldwide array of work on nationalism’s growth in various countries, usually by authors residing in them, or in the United States with ethnic ties to the nation being examined, often recent immigrants to the United States from them. Our roster of contributors comprises a small United Nations of insightful, well-written research and commentary from Indonesia, New Zealand, Australia, China, India, South Africa, France, Portugal, Estonia, Hungary, Russia, Poland, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and the United States. Volume 2 (this one) describes and analyzes nationalism, by country, around the world, except for the United States; and 3/material directly related to President Donald Trump, and the United States. The first volume is under consideration at the Texas A & M University Press. The other two are under contract to Nova Science Publishers (which includes social sciences). These three volumes may be used individually or as a set.

The effects of calcium superphosphate (CaSSP) on N2 O production during composting are reported to be controversial, and the intrinsic microbial mechanism remains unclear. Here, a pig manure windrow composting experiment lasting for ~60 days was performed to evaluate the effects of CaSSP amendment (5%, w/w) on N2 O fluxes in situ, and to determine the denitrifiers’ response, and their driving factors. Results indicated that CaSSP amendment significantly reduced N2 O emissions as compared to the control pile (maximum N2 O emission rate reduced by 64.5% and total emission decreased by 49.8%). CaSSP amendment reduced the abundance of nirK gene encoding for nitrite reductase, while the abundance of nosZ gene (N2 O reductase) was enriched. Finally, we built a schematic model and indicated that the abundance of nirK gene was likely to play a key role in mediating N2 O production, which were correlated with NH4+-N and NO3−-N changing responsive to CaSSP. Our finding implicates that CaSSP application could be a potential strategy for N2 O mitigation in manure windrow composting, and the revealed microbial mechanism is helpful for deepening the understanding of the interaction among N-cycle functional genes, physicochemical factors, and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

Experiments were carried out under different liquid flow-rates (5.0–28.0 L h−1), N2 flow-rates (0.5–1.5 L h−1) and vacuum pressures (0–480 mbar). The maximum removal efficiency of methane was &gt;90% at moderate values of gas-to-liquid ratios (G/L) and vacuum of 0.2 and ≤ 200 mbar, respectively. Removal efficiencies obtained in combination mode were usually higher than when using vacuum or sweep gas, separately. To achieve a methane content &gt;35% in the recovered gas, G/L values lower than 0.03 are necessary, with removal efficiency up to 55%. Even at these soft conditions, gas phase mass transfer resistance was demonstrated as being negligible, so the limiting resistance was in the liquid phase. G/L ratios increased until values of 0.3, with a vacuum of 200 mbar, maximised the energy output (&gt;250 kJ m−3 of treated water), in the case of recovered methane mixed with biogas produced in an anaerobic reactor.

The study included 12 crossbred F1 dual-purpose cows over 60 days of lactation. The cows grazed on 28% tropical native grassland and 72% Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon neumfluensis, supplemented with 0, 150, 300, and 450g of concentrate per kg daily milk production, during three experimental periods of 15 days each in a crossover design. Pasture and concentrate samples were collected and were analyzed for dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber. Milk production (kg d-1) was recorded daily, nitrous oxide (N2O), and emissions from excreta and daily CH4 production were calculated. Results were analyzed with the SAS MIXED procedure. Concentrate supplementation in tropical crossbred dairy cows did not improve milk yield but increased CH4 and N2O production (P &lt; 0.0001) per cow as the concentrate increased in the diet; the Ym factor from the tropical region yielded less CH4 than the IPCC Ym model (P &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, the calculation of CH4 using specific emission factors for the tropical climate region is better than the IPCC default emission factors in order not to overestimate the CH4 emissions. © 2021 Malque Publishing.

In this paper, by extracting the key components that lead to the success of pollution reduction policies between Hong Kong (HK) and Guangdong, we aim to construct a general framework for cooperative environmental management. The incentive for and the dynamic trajectory, core measures, and outcomes of cooperative pollution abatement policies to address transboundary air pollution were studied using incrementalism analysis. The context that drives the abnormal increment of cooperative policies between HK and Guangdong was analyzed to determine the factors that affect the full cooperation process. The political union between HK and China is the main driving force for fostering cooperative policies in these two regions that have highly asymmetric economic development levels and pollution emission intensities. The factors for successfully designing cooperative pollution reduction policies are revealed from trust building, political support, efficient governance, precise policies, a rational cost-sharing mechanism, and detailed management and implementation plans. Innovative multi-level and cross-department governance, and an unequal but rational cost-sharing scheme sustain long-term cooperation. A general framework is derived from these empirical key components and constructed as a systematic approach to provide a guide for designing cooperation in transboundary pollution reduction for the sustainable management of cross-border natural resources in different regions with conflicts of interest. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asymmetric regions; Cooperative policy; Cost-sharing mechanism; Incrementalism analysis; Institutional arrangement; Transboundary pollution abatement","Air pollution; Environmental management; Sustainable development; Conflicts of interest; Cost sharing mechanism; Cost-sharing schemes; Dynamic trajectories; Pollution emissions; Sustainable management; Trans-boundary air pollutions; Trans-boundary pollution; Cost effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090401061

The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0%. It contributes to a 44.3%–55.4% reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6% by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air-emission reduction; Car mobility behaviour; COVID-19; Flexible lockdown strategy; Risk mitigation; Spatial-temporal analysis","Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Curve fitting; Data Analytics; Decision making; Electric circuit breakers; Flexible electronics; Garages (parking); Regression analysis; Flexible circuit; Human behaviours; Near real-time datum; Potential exposure; Regression model; Space-time interactions; Spatial temporals; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090183740

While wind power has fluctuating and intermittent characteristics, this paper develops a short-term combined operation strategy of wind and water using the flexible regulation characteristics of cascade hydropower stations. To ensure full access to wind power, reduce the impact of wind power fluctuations as little as possible. A multi-objective short-term optimal scheduling model with the minimum variation of combined wind and water output and the largest total power generation is established considering the constraints of storage capacity, discharge flow, reservoir water level, output of each power station, and power transmission section. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm, such as slow convergence rate and fall into optimal local solution easily in the late search, dynamic inertia weight and learning factors are introduced and applied to model solving. The simulation results show that the cascade hydropower station can effectively stabilize the wind power fluctuation, improve the wind power consumption level, increase the power generation of the system, and ensure the safe and stable operation of the power system. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.","Cascade hydropower station; Dynamic inertia weight; Particle swarm optimiza-tion; Wind power uncertainty","Emission control; Environmental technology; Geology; Hydroelectric power; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reservoirs (water); Water levels; Wind power; Cascade hydropower stations; Combined operations; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Optimal scheduling; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power fluctuations; Reservoir water level; Wind power integrations; Hydroelectric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100853057

To unravel the pollutant evolution mechanism during the heavy pollution episodes (HPEs), this study combined observational data analysis and three-dimensional WRF-Chem simulations. From December 2, 2016 to January 15, 2017, YH region experienced 4 HPEs under the control by synoptic system, normally associated with a transport stage (TS) and a cumulative stage (CS). During the TS, pollutants are transported to the north of YH region through the near-surface, and then transported to the “mountain corridor” through the residual layer (RL) under the influence of prevailing wind. For the RL transport mechanism, the change of pollutant concentration cannot only consider the net flux in the horizontal direction, but also the role of the vertical movement is extremely important and cannot be ignored. By analyzing the mass conservation equation of pollutant, the results show that the advection transport and turbulent diffusion have a synergistic effect on the change of pollutant in the CS of three HPEs. The change of turbulence characteristics also affected by topography. For the “mountain corridors”, which is accompanied by variable wind direction and turbulence diffusion is easily affected by wind shear. In addition, the turbulence characteristics are different during the TS and CS, especially the strong stable conditions in the CS at nighttime. The turbulence is intermittent, and the model has insufficient performance for turbulence, which will lead to differences for the simulation of pollutant concentration. In short, as the PM2.5 concentration linearly increases, the friction velocity (turbulent diffusion coefficient) decreases 63% (80%), 61% (78%) and 45% (68%), respectively. Therefore, the change of pollutants is less sensitive to the change of turbulence during the HPEs. The contribution of regional transport (local emissions) reaches 43% (47%), thus we need pay attention to the contribution of each part during the HPEs, which will help us to build a certain foundation for the emission reduction work in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Contribution of emissions; Residual layer; Transport and cumulative stages; Turbulent characteristics; Yangtze-Huaihe region","Atmospheric turbulence; Diffusion; Emission control; Landforms; Topography; Advection transports; Mass conservation equations; Pollutant concentration; Transport mechanism; Turbulence characteristics; Turbulence diffusion; Turbulent diffusion; Turbulent diffusion coefficients; Air pollution; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; pollutant transport; pollution incidence; seasonality; turbulence; advection; article; attention; case report; clinical article; data analysis; eddy diffusivity; friction; net flux; particulate matter 2.5; simulation; synergistic effect; topography; China; Huai Basin; Yangtze Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092252956

The regional characteristics of uneven distribution of energy and water resources exacerbates regional energy-related water shortage. This paper focus on quantitative analysis of energy development impacts on water resources that considers regional characteristics. A supply-demand-integrated method is proposed to assess water stress of energy industry for multiple regions and multiple energy types under different energy development scenarios. China has a typical mismatch characteristic of energy and water resources. Case studies of China are conducted at both regional and energy-base scales. Results show that the water stress of energy industry in northwest regions (40%) is higher than that of the national average value (24%) in 2015. The carbon emission reduction measures can save the energy industrial water withdrawal by about 16%–33% in 2030, compared with the Business as Usual Scenario. Interregional power transmission would result in an over 100% value of the water stress in energy output areas. The coal chemical industry is high-water-consuming and accounts for a large proportion of the water demand in energy bases. The technological progress and capacity reduction of high-water-consuming technologies can reduce the water stress. Both water demand side and water supply side measures are suggested to reach the coordinated development of energy industry with water resources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy base; Energy transformation; Energy water nexus; Industrial water withdrawal; Multi-regional analysis; Water stress","Chemical industry; Coal industry; Emission control; Sustainable development; Water supply; Capacity reduction; Carbon emission reductions; Development of energy industries; Energy development; Integrated method; Northwest regions; Regional characteristics; Technological progress; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089684724

However, increasing ammonia uniformity in a short time period while injecting a urea solution is not a trivial task. Therefore, in this study, the uniformity of various urea injector designs is compared and an optimal design for the urea injector angle and direction is selected. The uniformity index (UI) was calculated using numerical analysis and compared with experimental result to achieve high reliability. The boundary condition of the analysis is extracted from the dominant operating region of the non-road transient cycle (NRTC) to guarantee a realistic analysis result. The design candidates were generated from the combination of three urea injection angles and eight urea injection directions and thoroughly compared to provide an insightful analysis. The conclusion is that injecting urea in the opposite direction to the main stream of exhaust gas increases the kinetic energy and thus the uniformity is highly increased. For example, urea injection in the opposite direction and angle to the mainstream flow could increase the UI to 0.966, which is a 16.7% improvement compared to the same direction and angle injection. © 2020 by the authors.

ODP Site 1063 on the Bermuda Rise, at the interface of NADW and Southern Ocean-sourced water, appears an ideal location to study the relationships between ocean circulation and climate. This study reports Nd isotope ratios at Site 1063 that extend to ~1 Ma. The data show Nd isotope values during portions of interglacials that are much lower than modern NADW. However, interglacial Nd isotope values at Site 607, located within the core of NADW, off the abyssal seafloor in the North Atlantic, are consistently similar to modern NADW. In contrast to glacial values, we infer that interglacial Nd isotopes at Site 1063 are not representative of NADW and do not solely record water mass mixing. We conclude that the low Ndisotope ratios reflect regional particle-seawater exchange as a consequence of input of freshly ground bedrock from the Canadian shield, which is eroded into the North Atlantic during major ice sheet retreats. The result is a deep, thin, and regionally constrained layer of seawater tagged with this anomalous low Nd isotope signature that is unrepresentative of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We suggest that a benthic nepheloid layer, whose development is linked to the behavior of a deep-recirculating gyre system, regulated by the interaction between the Gulf Stream and the deep western boundary current, facilitates the periodic masking of the Nd isotope signature of the North Atlantic AMOC end-member in this region at these depths. ©2020.

Four common stable states differ in dominant groups of primary producers: submerged, floating, or emergent macrophytes or phytoplankton. Shifts in primary producer dominance affect key supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services supplied by lakes. However, links between states and services are often neglected or unknown in lake management, resulting in conflicts and additional costs. Here, we identify major shallow lake ecosystem services and their links to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), compare service provisioning among the four ecosystem states and discuss potential trade-offs. We identified 39 ecosystem services potentially provided by shallow lakes. Submerged macrophytes facilitate most of the supporting (86%) and cultural (63%) services, emergent macrophytes facilitate most regulating services (60%), and both emergent and floating macrophytes facilitate most provisioning services (63%). Phytoplankton dominance supports fewer ecosystem services, and contributes most to provisioning services (42%). The shallow lake ecosystem services we identified could be linked to 10 different SDGs, notably zero hunger (SDG 2), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG13). We highlighted several trade-offs (1) among ecosystem services, (2) within ecosystem services, and (3) between ecosystem services across ecosystems. These trade-offs can have significant ecological and economic consequences that may be prevented by early identification in water quality management. In conclusion, common stable states in shallow lakes provide a different and diverse set of ecosystem services with numerous links to the majority of SDGs. Conserving and restoring ecosystem states should account for potential trade-offs between ecosystem services and preserving the natural value of shallow lakes. © 2020 The Authors.

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has some significant disadvantages, such as training slowly, easiness to fall into local optimal point, and sensitivity of the initial weights and bias. To overcome the shortcomings, an improved ANN structure, that is optimized by the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA), is proposed in this paper (COANN). The performance of the COANN is evaluated with Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Correlation Coefficient (CC) between the output of the model and the actual dataset. Finally, CO2 emission in the world by 2050 is forecasted using COANN. The findings showed that COANN is a helpful and reliable tool for monitoring global warming. This proposed method will assist experts, policy planners and researchers who study greenhouse gases. • The method can be used as a potential tool for policymakers and governments to make policy on global warming monitoring and control. • The proposed method can play a key role in the global climate changes policies and can have a significant impact on the efficiency or inefficiency of government's intervention policies. © 2021","COANN- a hybrid Cuckoo optimization algorithm with Artificial neural network; Global climate changes; Metaheuristic method; Optimization algorithm","air monitoring; Article; artificial neural network; carbon footprint; cuckoo search algorithm; forecasting; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103369439

Traditional ‘Production-Based Accounting’ (PBA), which assigns responisibility to the region where emissions are released, has frequently been challenged by ‘Consumption-Based Accounting’ (CBA) schemes that suggest that greenhouse gas emissions generated to produce traded goods and services should be attributed to their final consumers. PBA and CBA both lack a sound foundation in economic theory as they do not consider the economic benefits accruing to producers or consumers if carbon emissions do not carry a price that reflects their social costs. We build on well-established economic theory to derive how to share responsibility for trade-related emissions between producers and consumers and apply this novel approach for the most prominent bilateral trade relationships using multi-regional input–output data. We propose an ‘Economic Benefit Shared Responsibility’ (EBSR) scheme, in which China is attributed significantly higher responsibility for emissions than in CBA, while lower emissions and responsibility are attributed to both the US and the EU. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate Change Mitigation; Economic benefit analysis; Economic counterfactual analysis; Emission Accounting; Global climate policy; Input-Output Analysis; Responsibility; Trade-related Emissions","carbon emission; climate change; economic theory; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; policy making; trade-environment relations; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098192616

As these buildings accommodate the sick and vulnerable, occupant wellbeing and good indoor environmental quality (IEQ) that deals with indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal comfort, lighting and acoustics are important objectives. As the specialist nature of hospital function demands highly controlled indoor environments, this makes them energy intensive buildings due to the complex and varying specifications for their functions and operations. This paper reports on a holistic building performance evaluation covering aspects of indoor air quality, thermal comfort, lighting, acoustics, and energy use. It assesses the performance issues and inter-relationships between IEQ and energy in a new building on a hospital campus in the city of Bristol, United Kingdom. The empirical evidence collated from this case study and the feedback received from the hospital staff help identify the endemic issues and constraints related to hospital buildings, such as the need for robust ventilation strategies in hospitals in urban areas that mitigate the effect of indoor and outdoor air pollution and ensuring the use of planned new low-carbon technologies. Whilst the existing guidelines for building design provide useful instructions for the protection of hospital buildings against ingress of particulate matter from outdoors, more advanced filtration strategies may be required to enact chemical reactions required to control the concentration levels of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and benzene. Further lessons for improved performance in operation and maintenance of hospitals are highlighted. These include ensuring that the increasingly available metering and monitoring data in new buildings, through building management systems, is used for efficient and optimal building operations for better IEQ and energy management. Overall, the study highlights the need for an integrated and holistic approach to building performance to ensure that healthy environments are provided while energy efficiency targets are met. © 2021 by the authors.

We have chosen to focus on the 4.2 ka BP event due to the widespread belief in recent Chinese archaeological publications that it brought about the collapse of Neolithic cultures in multiple regions of China. Following a literature review concerning the many issues surrounding the reconstruction of the 4.2 ka BP event in East Asia, we present three short case studies from the Lower Yangzi, the Shaanxi loess plateau, and the Central Plains detailing a number of problems with Chinese archaeological attempts at using climate change as a causal mechanism for sociopolitical change. We then focus on a common but highly problematic methodology-The growing use of archaeological data compiled in the Atlas of Chinese Cultural Relics to correlate with climate proxies in order to generate linear, causal models explaining sociopolitical collapse. We follow with an example from Northeast China, where work from the past three decades has provided ample data with which to begin answering these questions in a more productive manner, and end with a set of suggestions for archaeologists and climate scientists going forward.

The database of the UK air monitoring networks from 2009 to 2017 was analyzed to examine the trends in black carbon (BC), brown carbon (BrC), elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) at 11 sites with different classifications over the UK. The concentrations increased from rural to urban background to kerbside sites. BC showed the strongest variation, with maxima at kerbside (&gt;9.0 μg m−3) and minima at rural sites (below 1.0 μg m−3). On the other hand, BrC showed no clear variation according to site classification. BrC increased as domestic emissions of wood smoke increased at weekends. Total OC and secondary OC showed a winter maximum at urban and kerbside sites, while BC increased during the winter at urban sites and in autumn at kerbside sites. Secondary Organic Carbon is dominated by regional transport processes. All pollutants revealed a decreasing long-term trend in the UK, the most significant reduction was observed in BC levels, particularly at the kerbside site (−0.87 μg m−3 yr−1), with lesser rates of decline (−0.08 to −0.13 μg m−3 yr−1) at urban background sites. The general behaviour of BrC was consistent with a major contribution from regional transport. As expected, EC shows similar behaviour to BC, and OC/EC ratios have increased with time as diesel particle filters have reduced EC emissions more than OC, and other sources of primary OC have not changed markedly.

Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) has been shown a promising technique to synthesize organic products particularly acetate using microorganisms and electrons. However, the efficiency of the system is low. In this study, we demonstrated the simple yet efficient strategy in enhancing the efficiency of MES by applying continuous feeding regime. Compared to the fed-batch system, continuous operational mode provided better control of pH and constant medium refreshment, resulting in higher acetate production rate and more diverse bio-products, when the cathodic potential of -1.0 V Ag/AgCl and dissolved CO2 were provided. It was observed that hydraulic retention time (HRT) had a direct effect on the pattern of production, acetate production rate and coulombic efficiency. At HRT of 3 days, pH was around 5.2 and acetate was the dominant product with the highest production rate of 651.8 ± 214.2 ppm per day and a significant coulombic efficiency of 90%. However at the HRT of 7 days, pH was lower at around 4.5, and lower but stable acetate production rate of 280 ppm per day and a maximum coulombic efficiency of 80% was obtained.

They provide important services, like water supply, recreation opportunities, flood and climate regulation. Still, they are also considered as disruptive areas, a source of mosquitoes and diseases, which is why they are frequently destroyed by changes in land use. Their degradation is likely to advance from this time forth due to climate change processes. It is, therefore, important to examine how the local population understands the importance of wetlands in coping with different coastal risks in West Sardinia. Our study is focused on West Sardinia (municipalities Cabras, Oristano and Arborea), counting for remarkable biodiversity of wetlands. This area is characterized by high environmental and agricultural pressures which intensify the vulnerability of the coastal areas. To test for local population's preparedness to change, data collection was performed through field methods and questionnaires. The study was undertaken by asking key questions on the role of wetlands and willingness to pay to protect from future events (contingent valuation exercise). The results indicate that the locals do not seem to be aware of the regulating services provided by wetlands, but are willing to invest in order to mitigate climate change-related hazards. The obtained results could serve in future governance frameworks for the mitigation of natural hazards in the Mediterranean region and wider. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coastal hazards; Contingent valuation; Sardinia; Wetlands; Willingness to pay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097471331

Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the question of payment for air emissions. Today, the economic instruments to reduce the negative environmental impact and to ensure compliance with the environmental regulations are only partially applied. All mentioned above underline the need for consideration of the given problem, which can be solved by the additinal method.

For instance, New York State has already committed a transition to 100% clean energy by 2040. This paper identifies the relationships among driving factors and the changes in emissions levels between 1990 and 2050 using the logarithmic mean divisia index analysis. The analysis relies on historical data and outputs from techno-economic-energy system modeling to elude future power sector pathways. Three scenarios, including a business-as-usual scenario and two policy scenarios, explore the changes in utility structure, efficiency, fuel type, generation, and emission factors, considering the non-fossil-based technology options and air regulations. We present retrospective and prospective analysis of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide emissions for the New York State’s power sector. Based on our findings, although the intensity varies by period and emission type, in aggregate, fossil fuel mix change can be defined as the main contributor to reduce emissions. Electricity generation level variations and technical efficiency have relatively smaller impacts. We also observe that increased emissions due to nuclear phase-out will be avoided by the onshore and offshore wind with a lower fraction met by solar until 2050. © 2020 by the authors.

Understanding the impact of varying degrees of electric vehicle adoption and CO2 intensities on emissions reduction in the city is critical. Here, using a technology-rich, bottom-up, energy system optimization model, we analyse the cost and air emissions impacts of New York City’s proposed CO2 reduction policies for the transportation sector through a scenario framework. Our analysis reveals that the electrification of light-duty vehicles at earlier periods is essential for deeper reductions in air emissions. When further combined with energy efficiency improvements, these actions contribute to CO2 reductions under the scenarios of more CO2-intense electricity. Substantial reliance on fossil fuels and a need for structural change pose challenges to cost-effective CO2 reductions in the transportation sector.

Yet, the biotic and abiotic determinants of microbialite formation remain poorly constrained. Here, we analysed the structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities associated with microbialites occurring in several crater lakes of the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt along an alkalinity gradient. Microbialite size and community structure correlated with lake physicochemical parameters, notably alkalinity. Although microbial community composition varied across lake microbialites, major taxa-associated functions appeared quite stable with both, oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis and, to less extent, sulphate reduction, as major putative carbonatogenic processes. Despite interlake microbialite community differences, we identified a microbial core of 247 operational taxonomic units conserved across lake microbialites, suggesting a prominent ecological role in microbialite formation. This core mostly encompassed Cyanobacteria and their typical associated taxa (Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes) and diverse anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, notably Chloroflexi, Alphaproteobacteria (Rhodobacteriales, Rhodospirilalles), Gammaproteobacteria (Chromatiaceae) and minor proportions of Chlorobi. The conserved core represented up to 40% (relative abundance) of the total community in lakes Alchichica and Atexcac, displaying the highest alkalinities and the most conspicuous microbialites.

Circular economy strategies such as longer life, more intense use, repair, product upgrades, modularity, remanufacturing, component reuse, and open/closed-loop recycling are strategies to put in place urgently to reduce the environmental impact of raw material production. Although recycling of metals is the most used strategy and is being improved in terms of efficiency, it is mandatory moving towards more virtuous circular economy strategies, such as product/component reuse. In this paper a novel reuse strategy for sheet metal based End-of-life components is proposed; to be more specific the suitability of Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) to reshape End-of-life aluminum components is presented. An experimental approach is used to change the shape of a square box, previously obtained by deep-drawing processes, by means of single point incremental forming processes. The paper aims at outlining the environmental impact of the proposed reshaping approach presenting a Cumulative Energy Demand and CO2-eq. emissions comparative analysis. Three different routes are analyzed and compared to one another: SPIF based reshaping, conventional recycling and Solid State Recycling (SSR) routes. The SPIF based approach proved to be the most environmentally friendly strategy, the energy and emissions saving are ascribable to the fewer process steps and the less material involved with respect to the analyzed recycling strategies. © 2020 CIRP","Circular economy; Component reuse; Energy and resource efficiency; Reshaping","Aluminum sheet; Drawing (forming); Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Metals; Recycling; Cumulative energy demands; Energy and emissions; Energy-efficiency strategies; Experimental approaches; Manufacturing process; Raw material production; Single point incremental forming; Solid state recycling; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098142105

Substantial increase in the cost of energy supply, determination to decrease CO2 emissions and to reduce the consumption of natural materials on the other hand, are the major challenges in construction practice. The paper is investigating the consequences of dewatering by means of recycling copper mine tailings in mortars both for the sustainable development of construction materials and for the socio-economic recovery of Lefke-Xeros area of Cyprus.

Physical measurements provided an insight into the actual effect of dewatering on the resistance of freezing and thawing action of mortars containing copper tailings. The use of copper tailings and therefore the degree of dewatering have shown to play a substantial role in the decrease in thermal conductivity and increase in cost efficiency of these mortars in construction practice.

We generated Ecological Niche Models (ENM) for 796 woody plant species from which we estimated the spatio-temporal changes of beta diversity components, the community-weighted means (CWM) of selected traits and functional diversity indices. The pessimistic scenario indicated an overall threefold increase in woody plant species loss compared to the optimistic scenario, whereas at regional scales, species loss may reach percentages as high as 19%. Conversely, beta diversity may increase in the future, in which the turnover component had a greater contribution than nestedness. The CWM projection emphasized contrasts among traits and ecoregions, with an increase in most analysed traits (stem wood density, seed length and fruit length) and a decrease in one of them (maximum plant height). Functional divergence and richness may decrease in future, while functional evenness may increase.

Optimal management strategies are required to alleviate such issues and to maintain the continuous supply of power. Due to integration of EVs various issues related to grid system are reviewed briefly in this paper. This paper reviews different management strategies to minimize the impacts of integration of EVs into grid system. Decentralized coordination helps to reduce load variability and stability issue of grid due to EVs but it needs accurate forecast of EVs travelling pattern. Central coordination reduces load variance, voltage variations, power losses, computational complexity and helps in determining the EVs charging location but it has less customer stratification. Integration of renewables reduces the burden on local grid, optimizes the production cost and enhances the charging capacity but it has intermittent power supply. EVs charging functioning reduce the power losses and waiting time but require huge investments. Public policies maximize the overall profit but it requires proper load managements. Among these methods it is found that centralized coordination can be more effective in solving EVs integration issues. The optimal power, energy capacity and location of EVs in centralized coordination can accurately found by optimizing the objective functions. Centralized coordination becomes more effective to resolve the EVs issues when addition of smooth power from renewables is included in the system. © 2020","centralized coordination; electric vehicle (EVs); frequency variations; interaction of renewables; Overloading; power losses; voltage variations","Electric vehicles; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Investments; Nuclear fuels; Vehicle-to-grid; Decentralized coordination; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Integration issues; Integration of renewables; Management strategies; Objective functions; Optimal management strategy; Travelling pattern; Electric power transmission networks",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096863924

In addition, the set of indicators was developed based on the Adaptation Monitoring and Assessment Tool (AMAT), which were divided into three sets of indicators: reducing vulnerability to negative impacts of climate change, increasing likelihood responding to the impacts of climate change and promoting the transfer and application of adaptive technologies. In this study, Can Tho City, Viet Nam was chosen as the pilot city to apply the indicator to assess the effectiveness of adaptation measures.

However, the nature of the decoupling relationship between them is still unclear. This study adopts the Tapio decoupling model to explore the decoupling relationship among residential building carbon emissions (TC), per capita carbon emissions (PC), residential carbon intensity (FC) and per capita income (PCI) across 30 Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2015. Then, the Logarithmic Mean Divisa Index (LMDI) model is used to decompose the decoupling of residential building carbon intensity and PCI at the provincial level to determine the main factors determining this relationship. Results show that the main decoupling trend between FC and PCI in 30 provinces transformed from weak decoupling state to strong decoupling state during the whole period, while there is still extensive room for TC and PC to decouple with PCI. PCI has the major inhibiting effect on the decoupling between FC and PCI, while residential energy intensity (EI) has the primarily promoting effect on the decoupling. These findings provide valuable references for international policymakers in formulating precisely targeted energy-saving and carbon-reducing policies to coordinate the relationship between income and carbon emissions, and the results also can be applied to other economies and, to a greater extent, other pollutants. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emissions; Driving factors; LMDI model; Residential building sector; Sustainable development; Tapio decoupling","Carbon; Climate change; Energy conservation; Carbon mitigation; Decomposition analysis; Decoupling models; Global climate changes; Inhibiting effect; Per capita income; Residential building; Residential energy; Housing; building; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; energy conservation; energy intensity; environmental impact assessment; global climate; pollution incidence; residential energy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091983423

However, an advanced synthesis that characterizes the existing studies is lacking. In this review, we used citation network analysis and a text mining approach to identify research trends and extract common research topics and the emerging domains in urban climatology. Based on the clustered networks, we found that aerosols and ozone, and urban heat island are the most popular topics. Together with other clusters, four emerging topical fields were identified: secondary organic aerosols, urban precipitation, flood risk and adaptation, and greenhouse gas emissions. The city case studies' geographical information was analyzed to explore the spatial–temporal patterns, especially in the emerging topical fields. Interdisciplinary research grew in recent years as the field of urban climatology expanded to interact with urban hydrology, health, energy issues, and social sciences. A few knowledge gaps were proposed: the lack of long-term high-temporal-resolution observational data of organic aerosols for model validation and improvements, the need for predictions of urban effects on precipitation and extreme flooding events under climate change, and the lack of a framework for cooperation between physical sciences and social sciences under urban settings. To fill these gaps, we call for more observational data with high spatial and temporal resolution, using high-resolution models that adequately represent urban processes to conduct scenario analyses for urban planning, and the development of intellectual frameworks for better integration of urban climatology and social-economical systems in cities.

Currently, we have not achieved a general consensus on the role of supraglacial processes in regulating climate–glacier sensitivity in High Mountain Asia, which is mainly due to a lack of an integrated understanding of glacier surface dynamics as a function of debris properties, mass movement, and ponding. Therefore, further investigations on supraglacial processes is needed in order to provide more accurate assessments of the hydrological cycle, water resources, and natural hazards in the region. Given the scarcity of long-term in situ data and the difficulty of conducting fieldwork on these glaciers, many numerical models have been developed by recent studies. This review summarizes our current knowledge of surface processes on debris-covered glaciers with an emphasis on the related modeling efforts. We present an integrated view on how numerical modeling provide insights into glacier surface ablation, supraglacial debris transport, morphological variation, pond dynamics, and ice-cliff evolution. We also highlight the remote sensing approaches that facilitate modeling, and discuss the limitations of existing models regarding their capabilities to address coupled processes on debris-covered glaciers and suggest research directions. © 2021 by the authors.

These lakes are hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions, but with substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity across the Arctic. We measured dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations in thermokarst lakes of Central Yakutia and their seasonal patterns over a yearly cycle. Lakes formed over the Holocene (alas lakes) are compared to lakes that developed over the last decades. The results show striking differences in dissolved greenhouse gases (up to two orders of magnitude) between lake types and seasons. Shallow lakes located in hydrologically closed alas depressions acted as CO2 sinks and strong sources of diffusive CH4 during some seasons (ebullition was not assessed). Recent thermokarst lakes were moderate to extremely high sources of diffusive CO2 and CH4, with considerable accumulation of greenhouse gas under the ice cover (winter) or in the deepest water layers (summer), highlighting the need to include spring and autumn as critical periods for integrated assessments. The water column was stratified in winter (all lake types) and especially in summer (recent thermokarst lakes), generating anoxia in bottom waters and favoring CH4 production and storage, particularly in the most organic-rich lakes. The diffusive fluxes measured from thermokarst lakes of this typical taiga alas landscape of Central Yakutia are among the highest presented across Arctic and subarctic regions. © 2020 The Authors.

In this study, the effect of bromine and iodine chemistry on tropospheric O3 within the annual cycle in Asia-Pacific is investigated using the CMAQ model with the newly embedded bromine and iodine chemistry and a blended and customized emission inventory considering marine halogen emission. Results indicate that the vertical profiles of bromine and iodine species show distinct features over land/ocean and daytime/nighttime, related to natural and anthropogenic emission distributions and photochemical reactions. The halogen-mediated O3 loss has a strong seasonal cycle, and reaches a maximum of −15.9 ppbv (−44.3%) over the ocean and −13.4 ppbv (−38.9%) over continental Asia among the four seasons. Changes in solar radiation, dominant wind direction, and nearshore chlorophyll-a accumulation all contribute to these seasonal differences. Based on the distances to the nearest coastline, the onshore and offshore features of tropospheric O3 loss caused by bromine and iodine chemistry are studied. Across a coastline-centric 400-km-wide belt from onshore to offshore, averaged maximum gradient of O3 loss reaches 1.1 ppbv/100 km at surface level, while planetary boundary layer (PBL) column mean of O3 loss is more moderate, being approximately 0.7 ppbv/100 km. Relative high halogen can be found over Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the largest O3 loss (approximately 4–5 ppbv) in the PBL can be found between the western boundary of the domain and the TP. Halogens originating from marine sources can potentially affect O3 concentration transported from the stratosphere over the TP region. As part of efforts to improve our understanding of the effect of bromine and iodine chemistry on tropospheric O3, we call for more models and monitoring studies on halogen chemistry and be considered further in air pollution prevention and control policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bromine and iodine chemistry; CMAQ; Onshore/offshore features; Tropospheric O3; Vertical structure","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Iodine; Offshore oil well production; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Troposphere; Air pollution prevention; Anthropogenic emissions; Emission inventories; Planetary boundary layers; Seasonal differences; Tropospheric ozone; Vertical profile; Western boundary; Bromine; bromine; chlorophyll a; halogen; hydrobromic acid; iodine; ozone; bromine; iodide; iodine; ozone; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; bromine; emission inventory; iodine; ozone; troposphere; vertical profile; air pollution; air quality; anthropology; Article; Asia; boundary layer; circannual rhythm; concentration (parameter); embedding; exhaust gas; meteorology; ozone layer; Pacific Ocean; photochemistry; photolysis; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; solar radiation; stratosphere; surface property; troposphere; air pollutant; air pollution; Asia; chemistry; season; Asia; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Bromine; Halogens; Iodides; Iodine; Ozone; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089192283

Drawing on the ideas of coupling and synergistic development, this study views sustainable development as the result of the interactions between the economy and the environment and constructs an index system to measure economic development and environmental quality. The system coupling model is used to reflect the synergistic interactions between the economy and the environment systems. The coordination degree model is then used to assess the economic–environmental coupling coordination degree in order to measure sustainable development. The empirical results show that the ETS can help in achieving economic–environmental sustainable development in the pilot cities. Moreover, the better the socioeconomic development of a city, the better effects of the ETS on sustainable development. However, it is more difficult to achieve economic–environmental coordinated development in industrially developed areas (e.g., Guangdong).

This study assesses the impacts of using such PACs equipped with high-efficiency particulate air filters on residential PM2.5 levels in six households recruited in Seattle, Washington, for a randomized crossover study, in which participants used a PAC in their homes under three intervention scenarios: (1) sham-mode filtration in which all filters in the PAC were removed, (2) auto-mode filtration in which the PAC was set to auto mode, and (3) adjustable-mode filtration in which the participants were allowed to manually adjusted the PACs. Each filtration session was one-week long. PM2.5 levels were measured at 1-min intervals in the kitchen and living room of each household. Also, an hourly time-activity log was collected from each participant. The empirical concentrations and I/O ratios of PM2.5 were compared among the three filtration modes. Additionally, linear mixed-effects regression models (LMER) were developed to reveal the impacts of different filtration modes on indoor PM2.5, while controlling for outdoor PM2.5, indoor cooking events, and indoor relative humidity, and temperature. Based on the LMER models, when indoor cooking events were present and absent, auto-mode filtration significantly reduced the indoor PM2.5 levels by 31% [95% CI: 19%, 42%] and 28% [95% CI: 22%, 34%], respectively, compared with sham-mode filtration, and reduced the indoor PM2.5 levels by 19% [95% CI: 6%, 31%] and 4% [95% CI: 4%, 11%], respectively, compared with adjustable-mode filtration. These findings suggest that using such PACs running in auto mode is a practical and effective way to reduce indoor PM2.5 levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Auto mode; Cooking; Indoor air quality (IAQ); Linear mixed-effects regression (LMER); PM2.5; Portable air cleaner (PAC)","Humidity control; Regression analysis; Activity logs; Filtration modes; High-efficiency particulate air filters; Intervention studies; Mixed effects; PM2.5 concentration; Regression model; Seattle , Washington; Air filters; air conditioning; air quality; combustion; concentration (composition); indoor air; particulate matter; regression analysis; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096181081

In theory, industrial agglomeration is conducive to reducing pollution emissions. However, this needs to be tested in reality. The purpose of this paper is to test the impacts of manufacturing industry agglomeration on the quality of water ecological environment in 17 prefecture-level cities downstream of the Three Gorges Dam. Therefore, a theoretical model was established to test the direct and indirect effects. Empirically, results show that the direct effect of manufacturing agglomeration on the quality of water ecological environment is −0.426, which provides statistical evidence for the important role of manufacturing agglomeration in improving the quality of water ecological environment. The indirect effect of manufacturing agglomeration on ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) is 0.118% through technological innovation, the indirect effect on NH3-N is 0.114% through economic growth, and the indirect effect on NH3-N is 0.254% through industrial structure. Due to the low overall level of the manufacturing industry and its reliance on dirty technologies, the indirect effects of industrial agglomeration are not conducive to improving the quality of the water ecological environment. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a long-term mechanism to promote the evolution of the regional economy along a path that is conducive to the improvement of the water ecological environment. © Copyright © 2021 Huang, Li and You.","economic growth; industrial structure; manufacturing agglomeration; technological innovation; Three Gorges Dam; water ecological environment quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099741404

In this study, we assessed the variations in concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the holidays in the heating season from 2014 to 2018 based on daily surface air quality monitoring measurements in Beijing. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is used to analyze pollutant concentrations for 34 sites by comprehensively accounting for annual, monthly, and weekly cycles as well as the nonlinear impacts of meteorological factors. A Saturday effect was found in the downtown area, with about 4% decrease in PM2.5 and 3% decrease in NO2 relative to weekdays. On Sundays, the PM2.5 concentrations increased by about 5% whereas there were no clear changes for NO2. In contrast to the small effect of the weekend, there was a strong holiday effect throughout the region with average increases of about 22% in PM2.5 and average reductions of about 11% in NO2 concentrations. There was a clear geographical pattern in the strength of the holiday effect. In rural areas the increase in PM2.5 is related to the proportion of coal and biomass consumption for household heating. In the suburban areas between the Fifth Ring Road and Sixth Ring Road there were larger reductions in NO2 than downtown which might be due to decreased traffic as many people return to their hometown for the holidays. This study provides insights into the pattern of changes in air pollution due to human activities. By quantifying the changes, it also provides insights for improvements in air quality due to control policies implemented in Beijing during the heating season. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GAM analysis; Holiday effects; Residential coal burning; Spatial variations; Traffic emissions","Air quality; Heating; Roads and streets; Silicon compounds; Air quality monitoring; Biomass consumption; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Generalized additive model; Geographical patterns; Meteorological factors; PM2.5 concentration; Pollutant concentration; Nitrogen oxides; coal; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; concentration (composition); nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; regression analysis; spatial variation; traffic emission; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environment; heating; human activities; leisure; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); residential coal burning; rural area; suburban area; surface property; traffic; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089908910

We have recently developed a solid-state chemical route for synthesizing this family of alloy materials, which is carried out under seemingly impossible conditions. Here, we report an in-depth understanding of the synthesis mechanism, obtained through systematic investigations of the chemical processes involved at different stages of the synthesis process and the structural evolution of the intermediate products. The formation of Pt-RE nanoalloys is made possible by a series of consecutive chemical and physical processes, including the polymerization processes of the nitrogen-rich precursor, the formation of a porous RE carbodiimide phase, the mobility of the formed metal phases on the carbon support, the reduction of the RE metals driven by the alloying reaction, and so forth. This thorough understanding of the mechanism of the synthesis process lays the foundation for optimizing the synthesis procedures and maneuvering this method to synthesize Pt-RE alloy materials with the desired structures and properties. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Oxygen reduction reaction; Platinum alloys; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Rare earth elements; Rare earths; In-depth understanding; Intermediate product; Long term stability; Polymerization process; Structural evolution; Structures and properties; Synthesis mechanism; Synthesis procedure; Platinum metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100134923

The separation of CH4 from nitrogen (N2) is crucial for the capture of CH4 from low concentration sources, such as coal seam gas, to reduce GHG emissions. Pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) provides a flexible and scalable method for CH4/N2 separation. In this work, a novel adsorbent (ILZ) was used in a 112 kg scale PVSA pilot facility to test the feasibility of separating CH4 from low concentration sources (4.7–44.5%). A product purity of 44.5% CH4 and a methane recovery of 81% were achieved from a feed gas containing just 4.7% CH4 via a 3-stage PVSA process. Such a product gas can then be transported using pipelines and used for either power generation or 4T town gases in China. The total energy consumption was 133 kJ per mol CH4 captured, which is 85% lower than its heating value (~880 kJ/mol). This study demonstrates that the capture of CH4 from large but low concentration sources incentivises GHG emissions reduction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse Gas; ILZ; Methane; Pressure Swing Adsorption; Separation; TMAY","Adsorption; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Separation; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; CH$-4$; Greenhouses gas; ILZ; Low concentrations; Pilot scale; Pressure swing adsorption; Pressure vacuum swing adsorptions; TMAY; Town gas; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108631782

People tend to create their own stories of climate change providing an opportunity to capture personal experiences and frame solutions accordingly through narratives. Engagement with the issue can be further enhanced when using topics that resonate with individuals, especially through place attachments and local interests. Positioning climate change around communities, cities, homes and the countryside, for example, resonates with certain audiences as action at these scales provides useful narratives through which to engage audiences and increase positive associations with resilient and low-carbon futures. Nevertheless, we show how engagement with these narratives is complex and may overlap or contest in some cases. We present findings from thirty semi-structured interviews conducted with academic, policy and practitioner communities in the United Kingdom (UK) which explored what sub-themes could be utilised to engage audiences on climate change through narratives focused around cities, the countryside, communities and the home. We identify 10 sub-themes ranging from technological change (homes), connecting people (communities), alternative infrastructures (countryside) and positive visions of identity (cities). In search of a coherent coalition of diverse interests in shaping climate change action, we discuss two cross-cutting themes on technology and social norms which emerge strongly across each of the sub-themes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cities; Climate action; Community; Countryside; Home; Narratives","Risk perception; Cross-cutting; Low-carbon futures; Personal experience; Semi structured interviews; Social norm; Technological change; United kingdom; Climate change; climate change; environmental policy; local participation; perception; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; sense of place; technological change; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099879063

Although metal-ion hybrid capacitors (MIHCs) integrating a battery-type anode and a capacitor-type cathode are wished to realize this target, state-of-the-art MIHCs just showed the compromise performance between high-power supercapacitors (SCs) and high-energy metal-ion batteries. Herein, we propose a new concept of “device-level integration” to realize the integration of SC, MIHC and dual-ion battery (DIB) in one device. By coupling a mixed and pre-potassiated activated carbon (AC)/graphite anode and another mixed AC/graphite cathode in a K+-based organic electrolyte, as-built device can exhibit three distinctly different energy storage behaviors including SC, MIHC and DIB by simply tuning the applied voltage window. Consequently, this device is able to achieve the maximum power density at 0–2.8 V and the maximum energy density at 0–5.0 V, and exhibits a good combination of high power density and high energy density at 0–4.0 V.

The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are the three most important economic circles in China. One purpose of energy transition in those Three Urban Agglomerations is to enable the energy system to have a higher share of clean energy. This paper introduces the current situation in terms of energy endowment, production and consumption in the three urban agglomerations, discusses the policy environment from the aspects of development planning, supporting mechanism and policy tools. We further analyse the barriers of the energy transition in the three urban agglomerations by using Institution-Economy-Technology-Behaviour (IETB) conceptual model. Through this research, we know that reducing the carbon emissions is a priority in energy transition and increasing the utilization of renewable energy has become the consensus in the three urban agglomerations.

This paper employs input–output analysis (IOA) and the hypothetical extraction method (HEM) to establish an embodied carbon analysis framework to resolve the above externalities. As a typical downstream consumption industry, the service sector has had very little work examining its embodied carbon transfer structure and related climate policies. In this paper, carbon flows of China's service sector between 1997 and 2015 are mapped and a scenario analysis is conducted that accounts for the service sector development plan and carbon emissions reduction targets. The results demonstrate that 13–19% of carbon flows in the Chinese economy are caused by the service sector's demand of other sectors. Controlling the industry scale and carbon intensity of its upstream industries effectively mitigates the dramatic growth of embodied carbon emissions in the service sector. The embodied carbon emissions accounting framework might provide new insights for the definition of emissions reduction responsibility on both a regional and sectoral scale. The further exploration of the service industry from this novel perspective will be helpful in realizing China's overall carbon emissions reduction goals. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon Emissions; Embodied Carbon; Hypothesis Extraction Method (HEM); Input–Output Analysis (IOA); Scenario Analysis; Service Sector","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon intensity; Development plans; Emissions reduction; Extraction method; Industrial production; Scenario analysis; Upstream industry; Service industry; accountability; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; environmental policy; estimation method; extraction method; industrial production; mitigation; service sector; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096203695

The work presented in this paper investigates how Community Design and Decision Making (CDDM) processes can be enhanced using smart decision making techniques involving Building Performance Simulation (BPS). This work presents action research based on findings from a real-world case study project involving the design of a mixed-use zero carbon community centre, planned for the Findhorn Eco-Community, in Scotland, UK. Throughout the conceptual and early design stages the community played a crucial part in the decision-making process. BPS results coupled with the use of sensitivity analysis (SA) techniques incorporating resilience as a performance criterion contributed to establishing a multi-criteria evidence base from which to inform the CDDM process. Although not yet fully implemented in commercial simulation tools, the approaches used (e.g. uncertainty analysis, using resilience as a performance objective) proved to be invaluable in informing and facilitating the CDDM process. Overall an integrated two-way communication process (using BPS and uncertainty analysis for decision support) enabled the community to play an informed role in the design decision-making process. © 2020 The Authors","Community design and decision making (CDDM); Mixed-use zero carbon community centre; Passivhaus; Resilience; Smart decision-making; Uncertainty analysis","Decision support systems; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Building performance simulations; Community decision making; Decision making process; Design decision-making; Extreme weather events; Performance criterion; Performance objective; Two way communications; Decision making; architectural design; computer simulation; decision making; decision support system; local participation; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; participatory approach; performance assessment; uncertainty analysis; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096088976

Appropriately planned transfer stations (TSs) can increase system performance and reduce costs. Therefore, this study aims to develop a spatial modelling approach for investigating the optimum siting and economic impacts of MSW TSs. A geographic information system-based land suitability analysis was conducted to identify potential TS sites followed by a scenario analysis to determine optimum TS sites and waste collection routes for various collection vehicle capacities through vehicle routing problem modelling. The approach was implemented in the southeastern region of İzmir where a new landfill is to be built to serve three district municipalities. The addition of a TS in the study area reduced the collection time and number of shifts by 9%. Similarly, collection with large vehicles decreased the collection time and number of shifts by 25% and 17%, respectively. However, the unit cost of the system increased from 17.52 to 18.60 US$ metric tonnes−1 waste with the TS addition because of the additional costs of the TS. The results indicated that TS addition is not economically feasible in the study area because of the small collection vehicle fleet (eight collection vehicles), proximity of landfill to areas with high waste density and district level collection. On the other hand, TS addition resulted in lower fuel consumption which may help reduce fuel-induced air pollution. © The Author(s) 2020.","decision support; facility siting; geographic information system; Municipal solid waste; solid waste collection; vehicle routing problem; waste transfer station","Economic analysis; Fleet operations; Land fill; Refuse collection; Transfer stations; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Additional costs; Collection vehicles; Economic impacts; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Scenario analysis; Spatial modelling; Vehicle Routing Problems; Waste transfer stations; Municipal solid waste; decision support system; GIS; landfill; municipal solid waste; satellite data; waste disposal; waste management; air pollution; article; decision support system; geographic information system; landfill; municipal solid waste; siting; city; geographic information system; solid waste; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; waste management; Izmir [Turkey]; Turkey; Cities; Geographic Information Systems; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093923017

It reached a category 5 severity and made landfall or otherwise directly impacted several islands in Vanuatu, causing widespread damage and loss of life. It then moved along a southerly track between Fiji and New Caledonia, generating wind-waves of up to approximately 15 m, before exiting the region around March 15th. The resulting swell propagated throughout the central Pacific, causing flooding and damage to communities in Tuvalu, Kiribati and Wallis and Futuna, all over 1,000 km from TC Pam’s track. The severity of these remote impacts was not anticipated and poorly forecasted. In this study, we use a total water level (TWL) approach to estimate the climatological conditions and factors contributing to recorded impacts at islands in Tuvalu and Kiribati. At many of the islands, the estimated TWL associated with Pam was the largest within the ∼40-year period of available data, although not necessarily the largest in terms of estimated wave setup and runup; elevated regional sea-level also contributed to the TWL. The westerly wave direction likely contributed to the severity, as did the locally exceptional storm-swell event’s long duration; the overall timing and duration of the event was modulated by astronomical tides. The findings of this study give impetus to the development, implementation and/or improvement of early warning systems capable of predicting such reef-island flooding. They also have direct implications for more accurate regional flood hazard analyses in the context of a changing climate, which is crucial for informing adaptation policies for the atolls of the central Pacific. © Copyright © 2021 Hoeke, Damlamian, Aucan and Wandres.","atolls; coastal hazards; flooding; sea level; tropical cyclones; wave climate analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100551949

This study examined the association between urban adolescents’ use of SBHCs and their receipt of mental health supports. Methods: Data were analyzed from 3,909 high school students attending 10 urban schools with SBHCs in one California county using the 2016–2017 California Healthy Kids Survey. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression were used to measure associations. Effect modification by student gender and race/ethnicity was examined. Results: Female SBHC users were significantly more likely to report receiving mental health counseling when needed (Adjusted Odds Ratio/AOR 1.86; 95% Confidence Interval/CI: 1.55, 2.23) and to report having a caring relationship with an adult at school (AOR 1.66; 95% CI: 1.47, 1.89) compared to female non-users. Differences were not found between male users and non-users. SBHC users were more likely than non-users to report having talked to a doctor or nurse about their moods and feelings (AOR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.27) and about how school is going (AOR 1.76; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.38).

The mechanism of carbon distribution in this mycoheterotrophy is unknown. We detected high sucrose concentrations in all stages of Gastrodia tubers, suggesting sucrose may be the major sugar transported between fungus and orchid. Thick symplasm-isolated wall interfaces in colonized and adjacent large cells implied involvement of sucrose importers. Two sucrose transporter (SUT)-like genes, GeSUT4 and GeSUT3, were identified that were highly expressed in young Armillaria-colonized tubers. Yeast complementation and isotope tracer experiments confirmed that GeSUT4 functioned as a high-affinity sucrose-specific proton-dependent importer. Plasma-membrane/tonoplast localization of GeSUT4-GFP fusions and high RNA expression of GeSUT4 in symbiotic and large cells indicated that GeSUT4 likely functions in active sucrose transport for intercellular allocation and intracellular homeostasis. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing GeSUT4 had larger leaves but were sensitive to excess sucrose and roots were colonized with fewer mutualistic Bacillus, supporting the role of GeSUT4 in regulating sugar allocation. This is not only the first documented carbon import system in a mycoheterotrophic interaction but also highlights the evolutionary importance of sucrose transporters for regulation of carbon flow in all types of plant-microbe interactions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bacillus subtilis; mycoheterotrophy; SUT; symbiosis; transporter","biomass allocation; concentration (composition); fungus; gene expression; homeostasis; sucrose; Arabidopsis; Armillaria; Bacillus subtilis; Gastrodia; Gastrodia elata; Orchidaceae; carrier protein; plant protein; sucrose; sucrose transport protein, plant; Arabidopsis; Armillaria; Gastrodia; in situ hybridization; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; plant tuber; symbiosis; transgenic plant; transmission electron microscopy; ultrastructure; Arabidopsis; Armillaria; Gastrodia; In Situ Hybridization; Membrane Transport Proteins; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Mycorrhizae; Plant Proteins; Plant Tubers; Plants, Genetically Modified; Sucrose; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089186875

While conceiving molecules with improved properties is fundamental for the evolution of materials science, keeping control over the 3D arrangement of molecules represents an ever-expanding challenge. Herein, a synthetic protocol to replace carbon atoms of π-systems by dissymmetric phosphorus atoms is reported; in particular, it allowed for conceiving new fused phosphapyrene derivatives with improved properties. The presence of dissymmetric phosphorus atoms precluded the formation of excimers. X-ray diffraction revealed that, meanwhile, strong intermolecular interactions are taking place in the solid state. The phosphapyrenes photoluminesce in the visible region with high quantum yields; importantly, they are CD-active. In addition, the unique non-planar features of phosphorus atoms allowed for the control of the 3D arrangement of molecules, rendering lemniscate-like structures. Based on our discoveries, we envisage the possibility to construct higher-order, chiral 3D architectures from larger phosphorus-containing π-systems. © 2020 The Authors.

Observational data was retrieved from the Kelowna weather station located in the centre of the valley. Indicators and thresholds associated with climate risks and climatic suitability were identified from among previous impact assessments on grape and wine within cool climate viticultural areas. Climate change projections from Global Climate Models were retrieved from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5, including both medium (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) Representative Concentration Pathways. Two different statistical downscaling techniques were employed, evaluated, and selected, based on their ability to reproduce historical climate conditions. Scenarios from the Statistical Down-Scaling Model were used for temperature projections while scenarios from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium were used for precipitation projections. All the temperature variables considered demonstrated statistically significant warming trends during the historical period with continued warming projected over the course of the 21st century. Precipitation trends were less conclusive, with a wetter climate projected despite some evidence of historical drying. The results of this study demonstrate that the Okanagan Valley has already transitioned from cool to intermediate climate viticulture and may shift further into warm climate viticultural classifications. This means greater climate risks associated with heat stress but less risk due to freeze damage and frost potential. Effective climate change adaptation is of critical importance to the grape and wine industry in this region. Such planning and management strategies can ensure climate risks are minimised while capitalising on new opportunities associated with improved climatic suitability for growing more Europeans grape varieties, capable of producing higher quality wines, which often sell for greater market prices. © 2021 The Authors","Canadian geography; Climate change impacts and adaptation; Climate risk; Climatic suitability; Kelowna (British Columbia); Oenology; Viticulture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111119958

The grow-out phase typically takes place in coastal waters. There are ambitions for continued strong growth. Five years ago, a survey revealed that the fish farmers saw the lack of available sea area as the industry's greatest challenge for continued growth. This paper examines the current and future situation for area use, needs and availability, for salmon farming in Norway. The paper considers several possible changes that can influence this, including the coastal zone planning system, new technologies for offshore, land-based and closed salmon farming, and new tax-schemes that affect the distribution of burdens and benefits from salmon farming. The main finding is that central government has several options available, if it would like to prioritise aquaculture in terms of access to coastal waters. However, this would imply a full-scale overhaul of the present allocation system, as well as a dramatic change of the current planning system, which in turn means challenging local democracy – not a very likely development under the current political circumstances. This leaves the industry with two options; to reduce salmon lice, emissions and escapes and to increase legitimacy on all levels, and by granting the local municipalities a larger share of the enormous value creation seen in the salmon sector. While the ambitious plans of doubling production by 2030 and increase it five times by 2050 certainly will require more and better coastal aquaculture localities, the actual extent of area shortage will to a large degree depend on the development of new production models; land-based, offshore, contained net pens and the production of large smolt. Success in these endeavours, could also have an impact on global production of salmon, by opening the market for new actors, thus reducing the Norwegian share and the profitability of the industry. © 2020 The Authors","Area planning; Governance; Incentives; Salmon aquaculture; Technology","Aquaculture; Offshore oil well production; Allocation systems; Central government; Coastal aquaculture; Global production; Local democracy; New production; Planning systems; Value creation; Offshore technology; aquaculture production; coastal zone; coastal zone management; democracy; environmental planning; fishery production; government; profitability; resource allocation; resource development; salmonid fishery; seafood; Norway; Lepeophtheirus salmonis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092763439

Here, we assessed the relative importance of canopy position—top, mid, and bottom at a height between 31 and 20 m—and tree species identity for shaping the phyllosphere microbiome in a floodplain hardwood forest. Leaf material was sampled from three tree species—maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), oak (Quercus robur L.), and linden (Tilia cordata MILL.)—at the Leipzig canopy crane facility (Germany). Estimated bacterial species richness (Chao1) and bacterial abundances approximated by quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA genes exhibited clear vertical trends with a strong increase from the top to the mid and bottom position of the canopy. Thirty operational taxonomic units (OTUs) formed the core microbiome, which accounted for 77% of all sequence reads. These core OTUs showed contrasting trends in their vertical distribution within the canopy, pointing to different ecological preferences and tolerance to presumably more extreme conditions at the top position of the canopy. Co-occurrence analysis revealed distinct tree species-specific OTU networks, and 55–57% of the OTUs were unique to each tree species. Overall, the phyllosphere microbiome harbored surprisingly high fractions of Actinobacteria of up to 66%. Our results clearly demonstrate strong effects of the position in the canopy on phyllosphere bacterial communities in a floodplain hardwood forest and—in contrast to other temperate or tropical forests—a strong predominance of Actinobacteria. © 2020, The Author(s).","Acer pseudoplatanus; Canopy crane; Phyllosphere; Quercus robur; Tilia cordata","RNA 16S; Acer; Actinobacteria; biodiversity; classification; forest; genetics; Germany; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; oak; physiology; plant leaf; Tilia; tree; Acer; Actinobacteria; Biodiversity; Forests; Germany; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Microbiota; Plant Leaves; Quercus; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Tilia; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089108307

Nevertheless, the hydroclimate changes projected by the state-of-the-art earth system models across the island remain unknown. Here, we assess 21st-century changes in hydroclimate over Hispaniola Island using precipitation, temperature, and surface soil moisture data from the 6th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The resulting analysis indicates, as with the previous 5th Phase of CMIP (CMIP5) models, that Hispaniola Island might see a significant drying through the 21st century. The aridity appears to be robust in most of the island following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 5–8.6, which assumes the “worst case” greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. We find a significant reduction in both annual mean precipitation and surface soil moisture (soil’s upper 10 cm), although it appears to be more pronounced for precipitation (up to 26% and 11% for precipitation and surface soil moisture, respectively). Even though we provide insights into future hydroclimate changes on Hispaniola Island, CMIP6’s intrinsic uncertainties and native horizontal resolution precludes us to better assess these changes at local scales. As such, we consider future dynamical downscaling efforts that might help us to better inform policy-makers and stakeholders in terms of drought risk. © 2020 by the authors.

In the context of rapidly urbanizing catchments, NBS can take part of the development of sustainable cities, either by conserving peri-urban ecosystems from urban sprawl or by developing green infrastructure in the cities. Both can provide a wide range of co-benefits (e.g., climate regulation, air quality regulation), but also generate some negative effects (e.g., mobility issues, unsafety, allergens). We develop and imple-ment a Discrete Choice Experiment survey to analyse people’s perception of co-benefits and negative effects, and associated preferences for the two types of NBS at a catchment scale. The results obtained from 400 households living in a French Mediterranean catchment highlight that people associate numerous co-benefits to NBS, but also negative effects. Our estimations reveal that resident households are ready to contribute large amounts through a tax increase for the development of NBS (from 140 to 180 EUR/year, on average). There is however a strong heterogeneity of preferences at the catchment scale influenced by income, location of the respondent along an urban–rural gradient, and perception of the importance of ecosystem services. These differences may reflect urban environmental inequalities at the catchment scale, which are important to take into account in order to avoid distributive inequalities. © 2021 by the authors.

The local pH is evaluated by using the ratio of the SERS signals for HCO3- and CO32-. We find that the local pH is both substantially lower than expected from the bulk electrolyte pH and exhibits dependence on applied potential. Analysis of SERS data reveals that the decrease in pH is associated with the formation of malachite [Cu2(OH)2CO3, malachite] due to the presence of soluble Cu(II) species from the initially oxidized electrode surface. After this initial layer of malachite is depleted, the local pH maintains a value >11 even at currents exceeding -20 mA/cm2. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","CO2reduction; flow electrolyzer; gas diffusion electrode; local pH; surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy","Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Copper compounds; Copper metallography; Diffusion in gases; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Raman spectroscopy; Reduction; Applied potentials; Bulk electrolytes; Competing process; Electrochemical data; Electrode surfaces; Gas diffusion electrodes; Potential dependence; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Alkalinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098963408

Ammonia (NH4+) adsorption property capacitates zeolite as an FA mitigator. The microplastics and reused zeolite were processed into reused-zeolite/microplastic composite particle (RZ), whose merit of FA mitigation was fully developed via an optimally thermal modification to process modified-zeolite/microplastic particle (MZ). The 171-day biological nutrient removal (BNR) performance in a single integrated fluidized bed bioreactor (SIFBBR) shows that the bioreactor with MZ particle (SIFBBR-MZ) achieved nitrogen removal efficiency 10.0% higher than the bioreactor with RZ particle (SIFBBR-RZ) over the enhanced short-cut nitrification and denitrification. Analysis of microbial community structure unveils that the long-term lower FA inhibition favored more significant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) enrichment and acclimated specific MZ biofilm predominant by nitrite (NO2−) denitrifier, contributing to the outperformance in nitrogen removal. Apart from fluidization energy conservation, the techno-economic analysis confirms that using MZ as an FA-mitigating carrier could be of great benefit for FBBR system: realizing waste utilization, reducing carbon addition and alleviating sludge treatment. © 2020","FA mitigation; Low C/N wastewater; Techno-economic superiority; Waste reuse","Ammonia; Bacteria; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Economic analysis; Fluidization; Microplastic; Nitrogen removal; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Zeolites; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Biological nutrient removal; Fluidized bed bioreactors; Low carbon to nitrogens; Microbial community structures; Nitrogen removal efficiency; Short-cut nitrification and denitrifications; Techno-Economic analysis; Fluidized beds; ammonia; microplastic; zeolite; carbon; nitrogen; plastic; ammonia; bioreactor; carbon; nitrogen; plastic waste; wastewater treatment; zeolite; adsorption; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; biofilm; biomass production; carbon nitrogen ratio; chemical oxygen demand; denitrification; denitrifyer; energy conservation; fluidization; microbial community; nitrification; priority journal; recycling; sludge treatment; waste water management; bioreactor; sewage; waste water; Nitrosomonadales; Ammonia; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Plastics; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089997633

However, it is not clear how plant nitrogen and carbon content, including bulk δ13C and δ15N and n-alkane δ13C values, vary across species and within species when plants are exposed to the interaction between nutrient (nitrogen-N, phosphorus-P) availability and stressors (i.e., salinity). Here we present significant differences in green leaves wax n-alkane δ13C (δ13Cn-alkane) values and brown-senescent leaves C:N atomic ratios and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of three mangrove species (Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, and Avicennia germinans) that reflect ecophysiological adaptations to nutrient availability and salinity along the Shark River estuary (SRE), South Florida, USA. Linear models between leaf wax δ13Cn-alkane values and species location along TP fertility and salinity gradients showed distinct differences, particularly between the species A. germinans and R. mangle. Our analyses showed that leaf wax δ13Cn-alkane properly represented major differences in ecophysiological responses by each mangrove species. We also found that both R. mangle and L. racemosa showed different isotopic footprints among the SRE upper, middle and lower estuarine salinity regions. Further, the green leaves bulk δ13C values in R. mangle (−32.3‰ to −27.6‰) were positively correlated with distance from the mouth of the estuary. In contrast, L. racemosa showed a negative relationship with distance and a narrower bulk δ13C range (−29.8‰ to −28.1‰) in comparison to the other two species. A. germinans, a species found only in the brackish (salinity: 18.8 ± 1.2) and saline (30.3 ± 0.53) estuarine regions, also showed a positive bulk δ13C relationship with distance. Because of the well-defined species-specific leaf wax n-alkane δ13C values along both water column/soil pore water salinity and TP gradients, we propose these values as a potential salinity proxy for paleoclimate reconstruction. © 2020","Carbon isotopes; Compound-specific carbon isotopes; Florida; Mangroves; n-alkanes; Nitrogen isotopes","adaptation; assembly rule; biogeochemical cycle; ecophysiology; ecotype; environmental gradient; estuary; isotopic composition; mangrove; nutrient availability; paleoclimate; phosphorus; porewater; salinity; soil fertility; subtropical region; Florida [United States]; Shark Estuary; United States; Avicennia germinans; Florida; Laguncularia racemosa; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085306879

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the Climate Friendly Parks tool, a carbon emissions list with a clear border and relatively complete content was established to characterize the negative impact of tourism activities on the environment. Forest resource inventory data and the CO2Fix method could be used to accurately calculate the carbon sinks of forest tourism scenic spots. In 2019, the total CO2 emissions in Shenyang National Forest Park were 1841.445 t. The amount of CO2 sequestered by the forest was 1336.787 t, accounting for 72.59% of the total CO2 emissions. Thus, tourism had a net CO2 deficit of 504.658 t. Electricity consumption, garbage disposal, raw coal consumption, infrastructure construction, and land-use changes of forestland were the top five sources of CO2 emissions. The augmentation of the carbon pool could be improved by 65.358% of the total budget through forest management. The reduction aims of 133.41%-150.32% could be easily reached through emissions-cutting measures. Based on these results, we suggest several measures for low-carbon sustainable tourism. © 2021 by the authors.

The community’s adaptation is more important than before. Community-based adaptation (CBA) is now gaining worldwide attention. Taiwan has promoted disaster prevention communities (DPC) for many years. Although the communities’ promotion can increase their capacity to promote efficiency, the top-down job designation may not adequately meet the community’s needs. This research aims to establish a community adaptation model and focus on building community adaptation capabilities from the bottom-up due to climate change. We design a community adaptation model that integrated climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). A disaster reduction and climate adaptation (DRCA) risk template was illustrated and adopted in the study. The 2D flooding model using future rainfall simulates the flooding depth for the hazard for it. This information is offered for discussing possible countermeasures with residents during the participatory risk analysis process. An urban laboratory concept is also adopted in this study. The Zutian community, Tucheng District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, a flood-prone community, served as a case study area to illustrate those concepts and tools.

Quantifying the changes in NOx emissions resulting from COVID-19 and associated governmental control measures is crucial to understanding its impacts on the environment. Here, we divided the research timeframe into three periods: the normal operation period (P1), the Spring Festival period (P2), and the epidemic period following the Spring Festival (P3). We then calculated the NOx operating vent numbers and emission concentrations of key polluting enterprises in 29 provinces and 20 industrial sectors and compared the data for the same periods in 2020 and 2019 to obtain the impacts of COVID-19 on industrial NOx emissions. We found that spatially, from P1 to P2 in 2020, the operating NOx vent numbers in North China changed the most, with a relative change rate of –33.84%. Comparing the operating vent numbers in P1 and P3, East China experienced the largest decrease, approximately –32.72%. Among all industrial sectors, the mining industry, manufacturing industry, power, heat, gas, and water production and supply industry, and the wholesale and retail industry, were the most heavily influenced. In general, the operating vent numbers of key polluting enterprises in China decreased by 24.68%, and the standardized NOx (w)5-day decreased by an average of −9.54 ± −6.00 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Traditional stochastic or deterministic modelling techniques do not sufficiently capture carbonate reservoir heterogeneities in sectors with restricted datasets. The methodology applied uses a process-based approach that aims to define carbonate architectural and textural/facies heterogeneity and provides a framework to develop a more consistent conceptual geological model for exploration and field development. Through this communication we test the sensitivity of Lower Jurassic reference case model of complex carbonate systems (Al Wazzan et al., 2020) to various framework and sedimentological/ecological parameters as subsidence, eustacy, carbonate production rates, wave energies and evaporation versus precipitation rates. Results of this work help achieve a more refined and data calibrated model that tackles mainly the 3rd and 4th order sequence stratigraphic evolution of the Marrat Formation. Simulation results point to the main impact of differential subsidence and eustatic sea level changes on the architectural and textural variability along Kuwait with dominantly (1) transgressive onlapping packages of intercalated mudstone/wackestone and anhydritic textures in the Lower Marrat, (2) prograding to aggrading packages in the Middle Marrat localized around the southern, northern, northwestern and westernmost part of onshore Kuwait, and (3) an onlapping transgressive system composed of wackestone and lime mudstone with very restricted shoal patches. This work also highlights (1) the good fit with overall tendencies of the recently published Haq (2018) Jurassic global relative sea level curves, (2) the need to reduce the latter amplitudes of high frequency relative sea level drops to fit the G&G dataset, (3) the good anhydritic prediction using evaporation and precipitation predictions of the General Circulation Models (GCMs) (Sellwood and Valdes, 2006) and finally (4) the need for about 20–30% of additional differential subsidence in zones of thinner continental crust.

Under the conditions of an open economy, multi-channel international technology spillover has become an important way to improve a country's technological innovation capabilities. Based on the establishment of China's intellectual property protection (IPP) system, this paper integrates trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) into a unified international technology spillover framework and analyzes how international technology spillovers affect China's carbon emissions at different IPP levels. The results demonstrate that Trade, FDI, and OFDI increase regional carbon emissions and that trade has the greatest effect on carbon emissions’ growth. The regression results of the dynamic threshold demonstrate that as the regional IPP level exceeds the threshold, trade technology spillovers can reduce carbon emission, and that FDI and OFDI further increase carbon emissions. The impact of IPP and international technology spillovers on carbon emissions has regional heterogeneity in China. For the eastern and central regions, the interaction of international technology spillovers and IPP increases carbon emissions, while it has a significant inhibitory effect on carbon emissions in the western region. Therefore, to fully realize the role of international technology spillovers and IPP in reducing carbon emissions, China should implement differentiated IPP and international technology spillover policies. © 2020","Carbon emission; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Intellectual property protection; International technology spillover; Outward foreign direct Investment (OFDI); trade","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Compensation (personnel); Economic and social effects; Intellectual property; Investments; Environmental pollutions; Environmental problems; Foreign direct investments; Intellectual property protection; International technology; Technological advancement; Technological innovation capability; Technology spillovers; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098460289

The outcomes of theoretical and empirical findings indicate that both linear and non-linear term for green growth reduces CO2 emissions. Also, environmental tax, human capital and renewable energy use are found to decrease CO2 emissions. The impact of GDP growth both in short-run and long-run is environment depletion.

Herein, we report a concept of atom-polymer hybridization to synthesize AuNi homogeneous solid-solution alloy nanoparticles (NPs) with positively charged Ni center supported on electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The nanofibers host can strong restrict the separated growth of Au and Ni nanoclusters during the directly graphitization process, leading to the formation of homogeneous AuNi alloy. In-situ characterizations reveal the formation process and phase evolution of the AuNi alloy during the carbonization. The positively charged Ni when alloying with Au lead to the enhanced local electronic structure on AuNi homogeneous solid-solution alloy due to the electron-withdrawal effect of nearby Au atoms. The AuNi homogeneous solid-solution alloy exhibits a high CO selectivity with an optimal CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 92% at −0.98 V (vs. RHE). Theoretical calculations indicate that the incorporation of Ni into Au can make the d-band center more positive and reduce the free energy barrier for the CO2 activation into *COOH and *CO desorption. Operando Raman spectroscopy provides the evidences that AuNi homogeneous solid-solution alloy can facilitate the activation of CO2 into *COOH and enhance the interaction between *COOH and AuNi (1 1 1) due to the change of electronic structure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide reduction; Electronic structure; Electrospinning; Homogeneous solid-solution alloy; Materials chemistry","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon nanofibers; Carbonization; Chemical activation; Electrocatalysts; Electronic structure; Free energy; Gold; Indium alloys; Indium metallography; Nickel alloys; Pollution control; Reduction; Solid solutions; Synthesis (chemical); Attractive strategies; Bimetallic electrocatalysts; Carbon dioxide reduction; Electrospun carbon nanofibers; Graphitization process; In-situ characterization; Local electronic structures; Theoretical calculations; Gold alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089142452

Retreats may be initiated over different times and scales using various instruments by actors, from the state to the private sector and civil society. However, in the absence of a coherent strategic vision, guiding frameworks, and capacity to manage retreats, at-risk communities, their elected representatives, policy makers, and planners are compelled to embark on retreat governance experiments. Consequently, retreat is perceived as a ‘high regrets’ policy imperative with potentially adverse impacts for community wellbeing, as well as political and professional risks. To help translate managed retreat rhetoric into reality, this paper presents a governance framework that acknowledges the multiplicity of ‘managed retreats.’ Using examples from Aotearoa-New Zealand, we identify and delineate retreat modalities and clarify terminology, converging our framework with the international mobility literature to harness the valuable lessons from decades of human mobility practice. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Climate change; Governance; Managed retreat; Relocation; Resilience; Risk reduction; Strategic planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100086669

However, there is little evidence that the climate envelope of a plant species directly relates to the drought and thermal tolerance of that species, at least not at the resolution required to identify or rank species vulnerability. Here, we attempted to predict drought and thermal tolerance of commonly used urban tree species using climate variables derived exclusively from open-source global occurrence data. We quantified three drought and thermal tolerance traits for 43 urban tree species in a common garden experiment: stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential at the turgor loss point, and leaf thermal tolerance. We then attempted to predict each tolerance trait from variables derived from the climate envelope of each species, using occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We found no strong relationships between drought and thermal tolerance traits and climatic variables. Across wide environmental gradients, plant tolerance and climate are inherently linked. But our results suggest that climate envelopes determined from species occurrence data alone may not predict drought or thermal tolerance at the resolution required to select tree species for future urban forests. We should focus on identifying the most relevant strategies and traits required to describe tolerance which in combination with climate envelope analysis should ultimately predict growth and mortality of trees in urban landscapes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate envelope; Species selection; Stomatal sensitivity; Thermal tolerance; Turgor loss point; Urban trees","Biodiversity; Drought; Forecasting; Forestry; Plants (botany); Climate variables; Climatic variables; Envelope analysis; Environmental gradient; Information facilities; Leaf water potential; Thermal tolerance; Vapour pressure deficits; Urban growth; climate variation; drought; environmental gradient; quantitative analysis; stomata; temperature tolerance; tree; urban climate; vapor pressure; article; biodiversity; cell turgor; climate; drought; forest; heat tolerance; leaf water potential; mortality; vapor pressure; climate change; plant leaf; tree; water; Climate Change; Droughts; Forests; Plant Leaves; Trees; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090407065

Some PM2.5 is natural, but anthropogenic PM2.5 is comparatively avoidable. We determined the impact of long-term exposures to the anthropogenic PM component on mortality in Australia. PM2.5-attributable deaths were calculated for all Australian Statistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 2310) regions. All-cause death rates from Australian mortality and population databases were combined with annual anthropogenic PM2.5 exposures for the years 2006–2016. Relative risk estimates were derived from the literature. Population-weighted average PM2.5 concentrations were estimated in each SA2 using a satellite and land use regression model for Australia. PM2.5-attributable mortality was calculated using a health-impact assessment methodology with life tables and all-cause death rates. The changes in life expectancy (LE) from birth, years of life lost (YLL), and economic cost of lost life years were calculated using the 2019 value of a statistical life. Nationally, long-term populationweighted average total and anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations were 6.5 _g/m3 (min 1.2–max 14.2) and 3.2 _g/m3 (min 0–max 9.5), respectively. Annually, anthropogenic PM2.5-pollution is associated with 2616 (95% confidence intervals 1712, 3455) deaths, corresponding to a 0.2-year (95% CI 0.14, 0.28) reduction in LE for children aged 0–4 years, 38,962 (95%CI 25,391, 51,669) YLL and an average annual economic burden of $6.2 billion (95%CI $4.0 billion, $8.1 billion). We conclude that the anthropogenic PM2.5-related costs of mortality in Australia are higher than community standards should allow, and reductions in emissions are recommended to achieve avoidable mortality. © 2020 by the authors.

Since it is closely related with high carbon emissions, international travel makes a substantial contribution to the global carbon emissions. To comprehensively explore the influence of international travel on carbon emissions and develop a sustainable development plan, this paper studies the temporal and spatial distribution and evolution of the carbon footprint of inbound tourism in China’s 30 provinces between 2007 and 2017. In this study, comprehensive calculations and spatial models are adopted to reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics. The results show that the carbon footprint of inbound tourism in China has been increasing continuously from 2007 to 2017. While the carbon footprint increased by 1.94-fold, from 5.623 million tons to 10.8809 million tons, it presented obvious fluctuations by initially increasing rapidly and then dropping slightly. From the perspective of the contributions of various tourism components on the carbon footprint, transportation and post and telecommunications account for the largest proportions. In the past ten years, the variations in the carbon footprint of inbound tourism in most provinces and cities in China were not very extreme, but maintained a relatively stable state. In the spatial dimension, the carbon footprint of China’s inbound tourism tends to decrease from the southeast to the northwest. The highest coefficient of variation is in Ningxia and the lowest is in Liaoning. Based on these results, recommendations are put forward for sustainable development plans in some major cities and provinces for the future. © 2021, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

This study attempts to examine the effectiveness of air pollution control regulations implemented in Beijing during 2008–2019 through a data-driven regulatory intervention analysis. Our proposed Bayesian deep learning model utilizes proxy data including Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and meteorology as well as socio-economic data, while accounting for confounding effects via propensity score estimation. Our results show that air pollution control regulatory measures implemented in China and Beijing during 2008–2019 reduced PM2.5 pollution in Beijing by 11 % on average. After the introduction of Action Plan for Clean Air in China and Beijing in late 2013, as compared to the hypothetical PM2.5 concentration (without any regulatory interventions), the estimated PM2.5 reduction increased dramatically from 15 % in 2015 to 44 % in 2018. Our results suggest that Beijing's air quality has improved gradually over the past decade, though the annual PM2.5 pollution still exceeds the WHO threshold. In this regard, the air pollution control regulations introduced in Beijing and China tend to become more effective after 2015, suggesting a 2-year time lag before the stringent air pollution control regulations starting from 2013 takes any strong positive effects. Moreover, as compared to the air pollution control regulations introduced before 2013, newly introduced policy-making governance, which couples the policy-makings of the local jurisdictions with that of the central government, and the new policy measures that tackle the vested interests of the local stakeholders in Beijing and its nearby cities, alongside with the stringent local and national air pollution control regulations and plans, should help reduce air pollution and promote healthy living in Beijing over the longer term. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control regulations; Bayesian LSTM; Causal inference; Counterfactual analysis; Effects of regulatory interventions; Propensity score","aerosol; air pollution control; air quality; article; China; city; controlled study; deep learning; government; long short term memory network; management; meteorology; optical depth; particulate matter 2.5; propensity score",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093931605

It has significantly reduced gross domestic product (GDP), power generation, industrial activity and transport volume; thus, it has reduced fossil-related and cement-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China. Due to time delays in obtaining activity data, traditional emissions inventories generally involve a 2–3-year lag. However, a timely assessment of COVID-19's impact on provincial CO2 emission reductions is crucial for accurately understanding the reduction and its implications for mitigation measures; furthermore, this information can provide constraints for modeling studies. Here, we used national and provincial GDP data and the China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs) inventory to estimate the emission reductions in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020. We find a reduction of 257.7 Mt. CO2 (11.0%) over Q1 2019. The secondary industry contributed 186.8 Mt. CO2 (72.5%) to the total reduction, largely due to lower coal consumption and cement production. At the provincial level, Hubei contributed the most to the reductions (40.6 Mt) due to a notable decrease of 48.2% in the secondary industry. Moreover, transportation significantly contributed (65.1 Mt), with a change of −22.3% in freight transport and −59.1% in passenger transport compared with Q1 2019. We used a point, line and area sources (PLAS) method to test the GDP method, producing a close estimate (reduction of 10.6%). One policy implication is a change in people's working style and communication methods, realized by working from home and holding teleconferences, to reduce traffic emissions. Moreover, GDP is found to have potential merit in estimating emission changes when detailed energy activity data are unavailable.

Here we investigated the rates of anammox and denitrification, and the distribution patterns of anammox bacteria and nosZ clade I and II denitrifiers across coastal tidal flat to inland paddy soils. Results showed that denitrification dominated the N2 production over anammox in all samples, accounting for 87.1%–100% of total N2 production. Coincident with the rate, the abundance of nosZ clade I and II genes were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those of hzsB gene. The community of anammox bacteria was mainly driven by salinity while nosZ clade I and II denitrifiers communities were mainly determined by both salinity and pH. Alphaproteobacteria dominated in the nosZ clade I community in all samples while Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were mainly present in low salinity wetland and paddy soils. The nosZ clade II community was composed of more phyla, in which Bacteoidetes and Chloroflexi were ubiquitous while Gemmatimonadetes was present only in low salinity wetland and paddy soils.

These complexities cause difficulties in summer monsoon prediction, presenting a challenge in monsoon regions. In this chapter, we review dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of distinguished intraseasonal modes in the EA-WNPSM, their irregularities in occurrences and patterns conducive to climate extremes, and asymmetric responses to El Niño- Southern Oscillation (ENSO). First, we briefly review the identification of the irregular four major intraseasonal modes. The four major modes are classified as the pre-Meiyu-Baiu, Changma-Meiyu, WNPSM, and monsoon gyre modes. The WNPSM and monsoon gyre modes occur preferentially in late summer and have the potential to trigger more frequent extreme rainfall in accordance with typhoon-related precipitation over the western North Pacific and the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, the asymmetric responses to ENSO provide sources of predictability that mainly originate from an interactive coupling over the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. Major predictors in terms of the modes have been obtained from persistent signals and trends of the ocean and land surface anomalous conditions reflected on a physical basis. Ultimately, these studies provide primary sources for prediction in the context of the intraseasonal variability of the EA-WNPSM, and the results have important implications for reducing extreme climate disasters in the EA-WNPSM region. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Preliminary analyses showed that a basic humidified ammonia-hydrogen Brayton cycle can produce total plant efficiencies of ~34%. However, further improvements are required to make these units competitive to current fossil-based plants whose efficiencies are above 80%. Thus, this work seeks to numerically and analytically demonstrate the implementation of a complex cycle that will increase final efficiencies whilst using the full potential of ammonia as a cooling fluid, power fuel and heating gas (i.e. trigeneration cycle) with heat district distribution. Therefore, a basic gas turbine cycle was inserted into a two-shaft, reverse Brayton gas turbine plant facility. In order to improve combustion and reduce emissions, a Rich-Quench-Lean system was integrated into the analysis by resolving the combustion performance via CHEMKIN-PRO. Detailed sensitivity analyses were also conducted throughout the burner to identify the key reactions responsible for both flame stability and NO formation/reburn pathways, which are vital for future safe and efficient operation of these types of cycles. The study shows that the total efficiency has significantly increased when compared to the basic turbine facility, with a value ~59%. Moreover, low emissions were accomplished below current European NOx thresholds. The obtained values show a significant potential for the utilisation of ammoni-based blends with steam injection in gas turbine facilities through employment of novel cycles that consider lower dilution in the combustion sector in combination with novel ammonia combustion systems and trigeneration concepts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia/hydrogen; Combined heat power and cooling; Humified gas turbines; Novel cycles; RQL; Trigeneration","Ammonia; Brayton cycle; Efficiency; Emission control; Gas turbines; Gases; Sensitivity analysis; Ammonia combustion; Combustion performance; Gas turbine cycles; Gas Turbine Technologies; Plant efficiency; Preliminary analysis; Total efficiency; Trigeneration cycle; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096171082

This is even more crucial aspect for glass buildings, which have been criticised as major factors in climate change around the world. Recent debates on glass facades, which culminated in plans for a “glass building ban” in New York City highlighted the importance of innovation in glass construction. The current solutions for mitigating energy consumption for glass facades are improving insulation (U-value) and solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with advanced glazing or using shading devices. A fourth approach is the recent technology of water-filled glass (WFG), which utilizes water layer to improve thermal comfort and energy performance of the façade. This paper introduces Smart Water-filled Glass (SWFG) control method, which enables the change of the opacity of the façade element by colouring the fluid over a year regarding seasonal changes. The impact of changing transparency of water layer on cooling and heating energy demand is evaluated by simulating and analysing the energy performance of a reference office room with large glazing facade in different climates. The significance of this energy evaluation is that a water-filled glass with switchable transparency is simulated and assessed here for the first time. The paper analyses the performance in seven cities from all relevant major climatic regions using LBNL WINDOW and TRNSYS (v.18) As a novel approach, the simulation study makes it possible to evaluate the overall performance of two proposed operational methods (insolation-based & storage-based) for adjusting water layer settings depending on climate conditions and reusability of the captured heat in water layer. Moreover, seven different base cases are presented in this study to compare the performance of proposed system, including conventional solutions (e.g. double or triple glazing with/without shading) and a state-of-the-art switchable technology (e.g. electrochromic glazing or EC). The results verify the hypothesis that the impact of SWFG compared to WFG varies depending on the climate with 0%-5.28% for hot climates and 0.25–3.39% for climates with heating demand. The discussion includes comparison with standard glass facades, where SWFG shows 47.41%-78.01% energy savings depending on climate. The climate-based approach of SWFG and WFG offers a significant shift in façade design that sees glass buildings as an opportunity for sustainability rather than liability for climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Building sustainability; Energy-efficiency; Glass buildings; Glazing systems; Solar control; Water-filled glass","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Facades; Glass; Glazes; Life cycle; Reusability; Transparency; Building envelopes; Ecological footprint; Electrochromic glazings; Energy performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Operational methods; Simulation studies; Solar heat gain coefficient; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092715707

While there is an abundant normative literature proposing potential effective ways to adapt, there is a lack of empirical literature on current risk and adaptation policy and its potential effectiveness. Studying existing policies can help to reveal existing constraints, draw inferences about performance and design future policies. However, there is no established method for assessing risk management and adaptation policies. Addressing these gaps, we developed an analytical framework, combining and extending existing approaches, to assess the potential policy effectiveness in dealing with climate risks. The framework merges aspects of climate integration, policy coherence and compliance. Applying this framework to coastal risk management and coastal adaptation policies in the Maldives, we conducted a desk review of policy documents and semi-structured interviews with coastal policy experts and stakeholders. We find five policies addressing coastal risks and adaptation. One of these integrates sea-level rise considerations but is not legally binding. A key constraint on policy coherence are static approaches that ignore the variance in hydrodynamic hazard across the archipelago. Moreover, compliance is constrained by low capacities to monitor actual land use, political influence on the allocation of coastal protections and insufficient coastal protection budgets. Based on these findings, we expect that coastal policies are ill-prepared for dealing with sea-level rise and that scaling-up sea-level rise integration into policy is a critical first step towards improving this. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy integration; Flood risk; Mainstreaming; Policy effectiveness; Small island state","article; budget; climate; comparative effectiveness; human; hydrodynamics; land use; Maldives; risk assessment; risk management; scale up; sea level rise; semi structured interview",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093927743

This study which aims to develop a novel modeling framework, does not only determine the changes in hydropower generation and sustainability, but also provide robust operating rules for handling uncertainty attributed to both climate and land use changes, using Xinanjiang Reservoir in Eastern China as a case study. Specifically, projections of five bias-corrected and downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) and three modeled land uses representing a range of tradeoffs between ecological protection and urban development are employed to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and to predict streamflow under 15 scenarios. We then develop a set of robust rule curves to consider the potential uncertainty in reservoir inflow and to increase hydropower generation, and a baseline rule is presented for comparison. Results show that both robust and baseline rules increase hydropower generation with increasing reservoir inflows in future, but the robust rule yields better hydropower generation, sustainability and efficiency. The streamflow under the rapid urbanization scenarios differs from that under other scenarios, but there are no significant differences in hydropower among scenarios corresponding to the non-linear relationship between streamflow and hydropower change. Our findings highlight the potential to improve water resource utilization in the future, especially based on the robust operating rule considering optimization and uncertainty, and can provide references for future hydropower planning to the other existing plants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate and land use change; Hydropower generation; Reservoir policy; Robust optimization; Sustainability","Climate change; Hydroelectric power; Land use; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Urban growth; Water resources; Ecological protection; General circulation model; Hydro-power generation; Hydrological regime; Non-linear relationships; Rapid urbanizations; Soil and water assessment tool; Water resource utilization; Hydroelectric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092773101

Zone type-1 is the largest emissions of heavy metals, including mining-developed provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi.

The calculated reaction diagrams show that the hydrogen atoms can easily migrate from the Pt cluster to the carbon bridge with a low barrier of 0.22-0.86 eV, and KMC simulations indicate that the migration reactions can take place at intermediate temperatures (91.9-329.5 K). Our research clarified the role of the carbon bridge: (1) the close combination of Pt clusters and carbon bridges reduces H2adsorption enthalpy, which facilitates the spillover of H atoms from the Pt cluster to the carbon bridges and (2) the unsaturated carbon atoms on the carbon bridges have radical character and tend to bind radical H atoms. The subsequent study shows that the F atoms decorated on graphene can greatly reduce the migration barrier of H atoms from the carbon bridge to graphene. With F atoms decorated, the carbon atoms are in an electron-deficient state, which have a strong ability to bind the hydrogen atoms, and it promotes the migration of H atoms to the graphene surface. The migration barrier and reaction temperature are reduced to 0.72 eV and 279 K, respectively. © the Owner Societies 2021.",,"Atoms; Calculations; Fluorine; Hydrogen; Monte Carlo methods; Reaction intermediates; Surface reactions; First-principles calculation; Intermediate temperatures; Kinetic Monte Carlo; Kinetic monte carlo simulation; Migration barriers; Migration reaction; Reaction temperature; Spillover mechanisms; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100231098

Based on the statistical data of the planting industry in three provinces in Northeast China from 1999 to 2018, the study calculated the carbon emissions, carbon absorptions and net carbon sinks of the planting industry by using crop parameter estimation and carbon emissions inventory estimation methods. In addition, the multiple linear regression model and panel data model were used to analyze and test the carbon emissions and net carbon sinks of the planting industry. The results show that: (1). The increase of the planting area of rice, corn, and peanuts in the three northeastern provinces of China will promote carbon emissions, while the increase of the planting area of wheat, sorghum, soybeans, and vegetables will reduce carbon emissions; (2). Fertilizer application, technological progress, and planting structure factors have a significant positive effect on net carbon sinks, among which the changes in the planting industry structure have the greatest impact on net carbon sinks. Based on the comprehensive analysis, it is suggested that, under the guidance of the government, resource endowment and location advantages should be given full play to, and the internal planting structure of crops should be reasonably adjusted so as to promote the development of low-carbon agriculture and accelerate the development process of agricultural modernization. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to a pre-existing stimulus-response association, the willingness of residents can be intuitively reflected by their approach–avoidance responses. This study theoretically analyzed the mechanisms for influencing residents’ approach–avoidance responses towards the personal carbon trading scheme based on open-ended interviews, and empirically examined the mechanisms by developing rating scales and conducting questionnaire surveys on urban residents in eastern China. Findings showed that residents’ approach–avoidance responses could be negatively affected by their preference for comfort, whereas they were positively impacted by their ecological values, sense of social responsibility, cognition of the behaviors for carbon emission reduction, and cognition of personal carbon trading. In terms of subjective norms, the culture of environmentalism had a positive effect on residents’ responses to PCT scheme, while the culture of consumerism caused a negative impact on their responses. Furthermore, the perceived behavioral controls of residents partially mediated the relationships between their psychological characteristics and approach–avoidance responses. Finally, primary and pivotal suggestions were proposed for nudging Chinese urban residents towards approaching the personal carbon trading scheme, which provide theoretical support and practical guidance for its implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

This study developed an alternative approach to predicting water quality quantiles at individual locations. We focused on river water quality data that were collected over 25 years, at 102 catchments across the State of Victoria, Australia. We analysed and modelled spatial patterns of the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles of the concentrations of sediments, nutrients and salt, with six common constituents: total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate-nitrite (NOx), and electrical conductivity (EC). To predict the spatial variation of each quantile for each constituent, we developed statistical regression models and exhaustively searched through 50 catchment characteristics to identify the best set of predictors for that quantile. The models predict the spatial variation in individual quantiles of TSS, TKN and EC well (66%–96% spatial variation explained), while those for TP, FRP and NOx have lower performance (37%–73% spatial variation explained). The most common factors that influence the spatial variations of the different constituents and quantiles are: annual temperature, percentage of cropping land area in catchment and channel slope. The statistical models developed can be used to predict how low- and high-concentration quantiles change with landscape characteristics, and thus provide a useful tool for catchment managers to inform planning and policy making with changing climate and land use conditions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","extreme; nutrients; quantile; salt; sediments; spatial variation; statistical model; stream water quality","Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Forecasting; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Phosphorus; Regression analysis; Suspended sediments; Water quality; Catchment characteristics; Electrical conductivity; Filterable reactive phosphorus; Landscape characteristic; Statistical regression model; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens; Total suspended solids; Victoria , Australia; Runoff; catchment; concentration (composition); numerical model; nutrient; river water; salt; sediment; spatial variation; streamwater; water quality; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097417084

Carbon storage by urban trees is one of these services. Suitable methods for assessing carbon storage by urban trees are being explored. The latest technologies in remote sensing and data analyses can reduce data collection costs while improving accuracy. This paper introduces an assessment approach that combines ground measurements with unmanned aerial vehicle-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate carbon storage by urban trees. Methods underpinning the approach were tested for the case of the Vancouver campus of the University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada. The study objectives were (1) to test five automated individual tree detection (AITD) algorithms and select one on the basis of the highest segmentation accuracy, (2) to develop a model to estimate the diameter at breast height (DBH), and (3) to estimate and map carbon storage over the UBC campus using LiDAR heights, estimated DBHs, and an existing tree-level above-ground carbon estimation model. Of the segmentation algorithms tested, the Dalponte AITD had the highest F score of 0.83. Of the five CW thresholds (th) tested in the DBH estimation model, we chose one resulting in the lowest Akaike’s information criterion, the highest log-likelihood, and the lowest root-mean-squared error (19.55 cm). Above-ground carbon was estimated for each tree in the study area and subsequently summarized, resulting in an estimated 5.27 kg C·m−2 over the main campus of UBC, Vancouver. The approach could be used in other urban jurisdictions to obtain essential information on urban carbon storage in support of urban landscape governance, planning, and management. © 2021 by the authors.","Carbon assessment; Climate-change mitigation; Ecosystem services; Point-cloud data; Remote sensing; Urban vegetation","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Decision making; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Information management; Light weight vehicles; Lithium compounds; Mean square error; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Storage as a service (STaaS); Trees (mathematics); Assessment approaches; Diameter-at-breast heights; Individual tree detections; Light detection and ranging; Root mean squared errors; Segmentation accuracy; Segmentation algorithms; University of British Columbia; Forestry; aboveground biomass; assessment method; carbon storage; climate change; ecosystem service; lidar; remote sensing; tree; urban area; vegetation; Carbon; Decision Making; Ecosystems; Forestry; Lithium Compounds; Remote Sensing; Storage; Trees; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]; Columbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099763114

Our estimates are provided in the form of a dataset of reduction factors varying per country and day that will allow the modelling and identification of the associated impacts upon air quality. The country- and daily-resolved reduction factors are provided for each of the following source categories: energy industry (power plants), manufacturing industry, road traffic and aviation (landing and take-off cycle). We computed the reduction factors based on open-access and near-realtime measured activity data from a wide range of information sources. We also trained a machine learning model with meteorological data to derive weather-normalized electricity consumption reductions. The time period covered is from 21 February, when the first European localized lockdown was implemented in the region of Lombardy (Italy), until 26 April 2020. This period includes 5 weeks (23 March until 26 April) with the most severe and relatively unchanged restrictions upon mobility and socio-economic activities across Europe. The computed reduction factors were combined with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service's European emission inventory using adjusted temporal emission profiles in order to derive time-resolved emission reductions per country and pollutant sector. During the most severe lockdown period, we estimate the average emission reductions to be -33 % for NOx, -8 % for non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), -7 % for SOx and -7 % for PM2.5 at the EU-30 level (EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland). For all pollutants more than 85 % of the total reduction is attributable to road transport, except SOx. The reductions reached -50 % (NOx), -14 % (NMVOCs), -12 % (SOx) and -15 % (PM2.5) in countries where the lockdown restrictions were more severe such as Italy, France or Spain. To show the potential for air quality modelling, we simulated and evaluated NO2 concentration decreases in rural and urban background regions across Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, United-Kingdom and Sweden). We found the lockdown measures to be responsible for NO2 reductions of up to -58 % at urban background locations (Madrid, Spain) and -44 % at rural background areas (France), with an average contribution of the traffic sector to total reductions of 86 % and 93 %, respectively. A clear improvement of the modelled results was found when considering the emission reduction factors, especially in Madrid, Paris and London where the bias is reduced by more than 90 %. Future updates will include the extension of the COVID-19 lockdown period covered, the addition of other pollutant sectors potentially affected by the restrictions (commercial and residential combustion and shipping) and the evaluation of other air quality pollutants such as O3 and PM2.5.

In order to enrich this research field, we collected PM2.5 monitoring data from 367 cities across China in 2016 and combined inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. As a result, we could dynamically describe the spatial distribution pattern of urban PM2.5 at monthly, seasonal, and annual scales and investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the influential factors on urban PM2.5. Furthermore, in order to make the result more scientific and reasonable, the paper used selection.gwr function and bw.gwr function, respectively, to optimize model, thereby avoiding local collinearity caused by independent variables. The main results are as follows: (1) PM2.5 in Chinese cities is characterized as time-space non-equilibrium pattern. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River corner region, the Pearl River Delta region, and the northeast region have formed a pollution-concentrating core area with Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as the axis, which brings greater difficulties and challenges to PM2.5 governance. (2) The effects of various factors of socio-economic activities on the concentration of PM2.5 have significant spatial heterogeneity among Chinese cities. (3) There is an inverted “U” curve between economic growth and PM2.5.

ADH protein engineering efforts have generally focused on reshaping the substrate-binding pocket. However, distant sites outside the pocket may also affect its activity, although the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The current study aimed to apply evolutionary coupling-inspired engineering to the ADH CpRCR and to identify potential mutation sites. Through conservative analysis, phylogenic analysis and residues distribution analysis, the co-evolution hotspots Leu34 and Leu137 were confirmed to be highly evolved under the pressure of natural selection and to be possibly related to the catalytic function of the protein. Hence, Leu34 and Leu137, far away from the active center, were selected for mutation. The generated CpRCR-L34A and CpRCR-L137V variants showed high stereoselectivity and 1.24–7.81 fold increase in kcat/Km value compared with that of the wild type, when reacted with 8 aromatic ketones or β-ketoesters. Corresponding computational study implied that L34 and L137 may extend allosteric fluctuation in the protein structure from the distal mutational site to the active site. Moreover, the L34 and L137 mutations modified the pre-reaction state in multiple ways, in terms of position of the hydride with respect to the target carbonyl. These findings provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and facilitate its regulation from the perspective of the site interaction network. © 2021 The Author(s)","Alcohol dehydrogenases; Catalytic efficiency; Chiral alcohols; Distant sites; Evolutionary coupling; Saturation mutation","Biochemical engineering; Efficiency; Ketones; Proteins; Stereoselectivity; Alcohol dehydrogenase; Catalyse; Catalytic efficiencies; Chiral alcohols; Distant site; Evolutionary coupling; High stereoselectivities; Pharmaceutical intermediates; Saturation mutation; Stereospecific synthesis; Catalysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118358390

Furthermore, this paper considers European projects ongoing from 2016, involving participants from the Baltic Sea Region, concerning various aspects of DH systems. The review presents the energy sources with particular attention to renewable energy sources (RES), district heating generations, and the exploitation problems of DH systems. The essential point is a comparison of traditional maintenance systems versus SAM solutions for optimal design, operating conditions, and controlling of the DH networks. The main conclusions regarding DH systems in Baltic Sea countries are commitment towards a transition to 4th generation DH, raising the quality and efficiency of heat supply systems, and simultaneously minimizing the costs. The overall trends show that applied technologies aim to increase the share of renewable energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, examples presented in this review underline the importance of the implementation of a smart asset management concept to modern DH systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Energy demand and ‘greenhouse gas’ (GHG) emissions associated with the United Kingdom (UK) Iron & Steel sector principally result from the large consumption of coal/coke used in conjunction with the blast furnace. Like other sectors of industry, efforts are being made to ensure that processing becomes ever more environmentally benign, or ‘green’. Thus, the notion of ‘green steel’ has entered into the industrial vocabulary over the last decade or so. It is a steel-making process designed principally to lower GHG emissions, as well as potentially cutting costs and improving the quality of steel, in comparison to conventional methods. The aim of this study was therefore to (i) elicit the various ways in which the term ‘green steel’ has recently been used in the literature; and (ii) compare and contrast different options for making UK steel production more environmentally benign, particularly in regard to its decarbonisation. Some key ‘deep decarbonisation’, or ‘disruptive’, options for producing green steel in the UK are evaluated drawing on the experience from other nation-states and regions. These include the prospects for carbon capture and storage (CCS), the use of bioenergy resources, hydrogen-based production, electrification, and the least desirable option of deindustrialisation (i.e., reducing or out-sourcing of UK steel production ‘offshore’). ‘Circular economy’ interventions or resource efficiency improvements (‘reduce, reuse, recycle’) are also discussed. The potential reductions in GHG emissions from the UK Iron & Steel sector overall out to 2050 are then illustrated by comparison with previous technology roadmaps or transition pathways. The lessons learned are applicable across much of the industrialised world. © 2021 The Authors","Circular thinking; Decarbonisation options; Green steel; Technology roadmaps or transition pathways; United Kingdom; ‘Greenhouse gas’ emissions",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109944723

Based on two independent datasets, we document that firm value varies positively in the level of emissions. This result suggests that the Canadian setting differs from those studied previously, notably because of low climate litigation risk and national and subnational expenditure policies to offset climate impacts on the economy. While national and subnational expenditures to mitigate emissions affect firms' on-balance-sheet costs and profits, investors price the future payoffs to these expenditures into firm value. Supporting this view, we find that the positive relation between emissions and firm value in Canada is amplified for high GHG-intensity firms (mainly energy firms in Alberta), whose future payoffs to environmental policies and spending exceed those of low GHG-intensity firms. Our results are consistent with investors’ recognition of the benefits to firm value of national and subnational policies to decarbonize the Canadian economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Canadian greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon disclosure project; Decarbonization; Emissions intensity; Emissions valuation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084812327

One opportunity for a cost-efficient nitrate elimination are denitrification beds in which a microbial community thrives under anoxic conditions with polymeric plant material as a carbon and an electron source. Incoming nitrate is used as electron acceptor and reduced to molecular nitrogen. Projects realizing denitrification beds in field scale are sparse and robust data on their efficiency throughout the year mostly not available. This study analyzed the nitrate elimination efficiency and microbiology of a 216 m3 denitrification bed over the time course of more than three years. Phylogenetic as well as transcriptomic analysis revealed that the reactor contained a biofilm community growing on the surface of the wood chips and a planktonic community. Both differed in composition but their variance was affected only to a minor extend by seasonal temperature changes. Cellulose degradation was mainly conducted by the biofilm population while denitrification was mostly conducted by the planktonic community. Methanogens were detectable only to a very minor extend. Using online data from the nitrate concentration of in- and outflowing water as well as a hydrological model to predict the water inflow, it was possible to establish a process model that sufficiently describes the denitrification process. This model clearly indicates that the denitrification efficiency is mostly impacted by temperature and hydraulic retention time. It also suggests that the simple design of the denitrification bed most likely leads to different flow paths through the reactor depending on the volumetric flow rate. This study allows for the first time a robust estimation of the necessary reactor size for nitrate removal in a moderate continental climate setting. It also suggests how future denitrification beds could be improved for better performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification bed; hydraulic model; microbial diversity; system limitations","Biodiversity; Biofilms; Efficiency; Eutrophication; Nitrates; Water pollution; Wood products; Denitrification efficiencies; Denitrification process; Environmental contamination; Hydraulic retention time; Key influencing factors; Microbial communities; Nitrate concentration; Seasonal temperature changes; Denitrification; cellulose; nitrate; RNA 16S; water; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; anoxic conditions; biodiversity; biofilm; denitrification; estimation method; microbial community; microbiology; nitrate; performance assessment; pollutant removal; amplicon; Article; biocatalysis; carbon source; catchment area; controlled study; denitrification; DNA extraction; DNA isolation; flow measurement; hydraulic retention time; hydrological model; metagenomics; methanogen; priority journal; RNA extraction; temperature sensitivity; transcriptomics; wood chip; bed; biocatalysis; bioreactor; phylogeny; Biodiversity; Efficiency; Eutrophication; Nitrates; Water Pollution; Wood Products; Beds; Biocatalysis; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Phylogeny",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092477207

Incomplete denitrification produces nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. In salt marshes, denitrification, N2O production, and N2O yield (the fraction of denitrification that produces N2O) have implications for N load reduction and greenhouse gas emissions. We collected soil cores from three salt marsh zones (low marsh, high marsh, and invasive Phragmites australis) on five sampling dates that spanned the growing season (May through October) to quantify seasonal patterns of potential denitrification, N2O production, and N2O yield. Potential denitrification peaked at the beginning and end of the growing season, with rates several times higher in May and October than in June, but we found no significant differences among salt marsh zones. In contrast, seasonal patterns of potential N2O production depended on marsh zone; N2O production was aseasonal in high marsh and P. australis zones, but in the low marsh, N2O production was lower in July compared to all other months sampled. In this salt marsh, seasonal variation of potential denitrification and N2O production was greater than spatial variation over the marsh zones, highlighting the importance of understanding temporal patterns of salt marsh N cycling. © 2021, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Denitrification; Nitrous oxide; Phragmites australis; Salt marsh; Seasonality; Spartina","denitrification; emission control; grass; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; saltmarsh; New England; United States; Phragmites australis; Spartina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100456160

This threatens to aggravate water scarcity problems that periodically arise in this region, because both effects will deteriorate the performance of reservoirs, decreasing their reliable yield. Reservoir storage is the key infrastructure to overcome variability and to enhance water availability in semiarid climates. This paper presents an analysis of the role of reservoir storage in preserving water availability under climate change scenarios. The study is focused on 16 major Southern European basins. Potential water availability was calculated in these basins under current condition and for 35 different climatic projections for the period 2070–2100. The results show that the expected reduction of water availability is comparable to the decrease of the mean annual flow in basins with large storage capacity. For basins with small storage, the expected reduction of water availability is larger than the reduction of mean annual flow. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out by replicating the analysis assuming variable reservoir volumes from 25% to 175% of current storage. The results show that increasing storage capacity attenuates the reduction of water availability and reduces its uncertainty under climate change projections. This feature would allow water managers to develop suitable policies to mitigate the impacts of climate change, thus enhancing the resilience of the system. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, two long-term tillage regimes (conventional tillage [CT] and no tillage [NT], conducted for 36 years) were compared in continuous sorghum production in a sub-tropical environment in southeast Texas. The positive effects of long-term NT practice were more conspicuous at the soil surface compared with the deeper soil profiles. The SOC was greater (1.5 t C ha−1 greater) in the NT system compared with the CT system. Results from an incubation study indicate that the rate of C-min at 0–5 cm soil depth was significantly greater (164 μg of CO2–C g−1 of soil greater) in NT than that of CT, but this trend was reversed at 10–20 cm depth wherein the C-min rates were 106 μg of CO2–C g−1 of soil greater in CT compared with NT, which is likely because of soil disturbance during the study. Soil cumulative CO2-C emissions were greater in the CT system (7.28 g m−2) than in the NT system (5.19 g m−2), which is primarily attributed to high soil temperature conditions in the CT system.

More than 5 million people die every year prematurely from illnesses attributable to poor indoor air quality, which also causes multi-millionaire losses due to reduced employee's productivity, material damages and increased health system expenses. Indoor air pollutants include particulate matter, biological pollutants and over 400 different chemical organic and inorganic compounds, whose concentrations are governed by several outdoor and indoor factors. Prevention of pollutant is not always technically feasible, so the implementation of cost-effective active abatement units is required. Up to date no single physical-chemical technology is capable of coping with all indoor air pollutants in a cost-effective manner. This problem requires the use of sequential technology configurations at the expenses of superior capital and operating costs. In addition, the performance of conventional physical-chemical technologies is still limited by the low concentrations, the diversity and the variability of pollutants in indoor environments. In this context, biotechnologies have emerged as a cost-effective and sustainable platform capable of coping with these limitations based on the biocatalytic action of plants, bacteria, fungi and microalgae. Indeed, biological-based purification systems can improve the energy efficiency of buildings, while providing additional aesthetic and psychological benefits.

Under simulated NG exhaust conditions, NO conversion was intimately correlated to CH4 conversion at slightly fuel-rich operating conditions. CH4 conversion significantly varied with lambda (or O2 concentration) and depended on the direction of the lambda change. The dynamic CH4 conversion is likely related to the change of catalyst oxidation state and structures of Pd active sites. The CH4-NO cross-over point was found at a rich-biased lambda rather than stoichiometry. Compared to static operation, catalyst performance was much higher under a realistic dithering condition. The impacts of dithering parameters including amplitude and frequency on CH4 and NO conversions were explored. O2 dosage is proposed as an effective descriptor of the TWC dithering performance. In the O2-dosage space, the performance of distinct dithering parameters collapse, helping to elucidate the fundamental influence of dithering parameters on TWC performance. With the help of O2 dosage, an optimal operating window leading to high CH4 and NO conversions was identified. A higher dithering amplitude is required to keep the catalyst in a reduced state for higher CH4 and NO conversions, while an appropriate O2 dosage that does not exceed the breakthrough OSC is necessary to avoid excess O2 that results in NO slip. The dithering amplitude and O2-dosage-metric maps provide a new method for studying dynamic TWC performance and identifying optimum operation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CH4-NO cross-over point; Lean/rich dithering; Methane oxidation; Natural gas; Oxygen dosage; Three-way catalyst (TWC)","Catalyst activity; Gas engines; Natural gas; Catalyst oxidation state; Catalyst performance; Cross over; Exhaust conditions; Lean/rich dithering; Methane oxidation; Operating condition; Three way catalysts; Natural gasoline plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079873338

One of the measures to move toward urban sustainability and to reduce the effects of climate change is the development of urban green infrastructures. Urban green infrastructures (UGIs) are being increasingly recognized as key providers of ecosystem services in cities, but there is still a lack of support from urban planners. We highlight the potential of urban green infrastructures for sustainable urban planning based on its capacity to mitigate climate change This paper studies the CO2 mitigation potential through a multi-intervention (agricultural and forestry) local case in the peri-urban surroundings of a big European city such as Madrid. We consider two inseparable aspects: the amount of atmospheric CO2-eq reduced through direct carbon uptake of the UGI and also the emission of greenhouse gases due to its implementation and maintenance. The analysis carried out has shown the benefits of urban green infrastructures and their contribution to the mitigation of climate change. The results demonstrate that the absorption capacity of the new urban green infrastructure is much greater than its ecological footprint. Therefore, it contributes to the mitigation of emissions from other urban activities, thus improving urban sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

Highly efficient combustion engines can benefit from technologies such as cooled external exhaust gas recalculation and water injection. Among these technologies water injection can be used as a promising method to mitigate knock and significantly reduce the CO2 emissions. This is particularly important in highly downsized boosted engines which run under much higher intake pressures and are more prone to knocking combustion. In addition to anti-knock behaviour, water injection is also an effective method for reducing NOx emissions and exhaust gas temperature at high loads, which can protect the turbine in turbocharged engines. This study shows the influence of intake port injection of water on efficiency and emissions of a boosted downsized single-cylinder gasoline direct-injection engine in detail. Six different steady-state speed and load combinations were selected to represent the conditions that knocking combustion start to occur. Water ratio sweep tests were performed to find out the optimum water/fuel ratio at each test point and the impact on the combustion and emissions. In addition to gaseous emissions, impact of water injection on particle emissions was also investigated in this study. The results show the net indicated efficiency improved significantly (by a maximum of around 5% at medium load and around 15% at high load) up to a maximum level by increasing the injected water mass. Improvement in efficiency was mainly due to the increased heat capacity of charge and cooling effect of the injected water evaporation which reduced the in-cylinder temperature and pressure. Thus, knock sensitivity was reduced and more advanced spark timings could be used, which shifted the combustion phasing closer to the optimum point. However, increasing the water/fuel ratio further (more than 1 at medium load and more than 1.5 at high load) deteriorated the combustion efficiency, prolonged the flame development angle and combustion duration, and caused a reduction in the net integrated area of the P-V diagram. Efficiency improvements were lower at higher engine speed (3000 r/min) as the knock sensitivity was already reduced intrinsically. In terms of other, harmful, non-CO2 emissions, water injection was effective in reducing the NOx emissions significantly (by a maximum of around 60%) but increased the HC emissions as the water/fuel ratio increased. The results also show a significant reduction in particle emissions by adding water to the mixture and advancing the spark timing at medium and high loads. In addition, water injection also reduced the exhaust gas temperature by around 80°C and 180°C at medium and high loads, respectively. © IMechE 2019.","boosted downsized gasoline direct-injection engine; knock mitigation; NOx emissions; particulate emissions; port injection of water; Water injection","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Cost effectiveness; Direct injection; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Specific heat; Water injection; Combustion efficiencies; Cost-effective solutions; Exhaust gas temperatures; Gasoline direct injection engines; knock mitigation; NOx emissions; Original equipment manufacturers; Port injection; Combustion knock",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064149325

This review considers the principal mechanisms of the influence of climate changes on the structure and functioning of ecosystems of water bodies and shows the need to take these mechanisms into account when developing strategies for conserving the biological resources of aquatic ecosystems. Climatic fluctuations affect aquatic ecosystems through changes in temperature, surface runoff of nutrients and other substances and their ratios, the intensity of water mixing during the circulation period, and other mechanisms. Additional nutrients received in rainy periods from the catchment area and directly with precipitation stimulate the growth of primary producers and cause the risk of the further eutrophication of water bodies. An increase in temperature promotes the growth of potentially toxic phytoplankton species and exacerbates the problem of green tides, the massive development of multicellular algae in the coastal zone. Organic substances coming from the catchment area during wet periods stimulate a microbial loop in aquatic ecosystems. In shallow lakes, climate fluctuations can cause changes in food webs and the ecological regime. Climate-induced changes in the composition of producer communities often weaken pelagic–benthic relationships in aquatic ecosystems. In some cases, climate changes have contributed to the invasions of alien species. The natural dynamics of ecosystems affected by climate fluctuations deserves close attention and requires the development of special adaptive management of aquatic biological resources. In some cases, it is necessary to take more severe measures for the protection and restoration of water bodies, which would take into account adverse changes in natural factors. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","climate; ecological regime; ecosystem management; food webs; nutrient load; productivity","adaptive management; alga; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; community composition; developing world; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101326989

In contrast to previous work, the consequences of a transformation to fully decarbonized transport system scenarios are quantified across all traffic segments, considering procurement, operation, and disposal. The methodology can be applied to arbitrary regions and transport systems. Here, the metropolitan region of Berlin is chosen as a demonstration case. The first results are shown for a complete conversion of all traffic segments from conventional propulsion technology to battery electric vehicles. The transition of private individual traffic is analyzed regarding technical feasibility, energy demand and environmental impact. Commercial goods, municipal traffic and public transport are analyzed with respect to system cost and environmental impacts.

Additionally, climate-related variations in wave energy should be investigated in order to ensure the stability of its long-term availability. Here, we investigate the potential for wave energy in the Persian Gulf along the southern coasts of Iran. To do so, we have applied the Mike SW numerical model and ECMWF wind field data for a 30-year study, from 1988 to 2017. For this purpose, wave energy was evaluated at six points in the western, northern, southern, and eastern parts of the Persian Gulf. To assess the impacts of climate change, we also consider the wave regime from 2070 to 2099 (for 30 years) following IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios. Our findings suggest that in the present climate, seasonal variations in the mean wave parameters (i.e. wave energy, wave period, and significant wave height) correspond to the lowest wave energy in the summers, and highest in the winters. In the future climate change scenarios, energy level variations generally have similar patterns, with slight modulations in some local areas. © 2020 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Mike SW; Persian gulf; RCP4.5; RCP8.5; Wave energy potential","assessment method; climate change; climate variation; seasonal variation; wave energy; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Iran; Persian Gulf",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097464581

The results classify current renewable energy usage for electricity, heat and fuel production, existing renewable energy potentials, sound legal frameworks to support renewable energy, ongoing research and development activities and expertise in renewable energy conversion and storage as strengths. That fossil fuels still hold a significant share in gross inland energy consumption, energy-intensive industrial structures continue to be supported by fossil fuels and grid access is limited for renewables are identified as weaknesses. The main opportunities are green economies, climate change mitigation and technological innovations. Associated threats are demographic develop-ments, lack of social acceptance and renewable energy resource volatility. We conclude that these regions’ energy systems could potentially enable the realization of a strong integration of renewa-bles and cover partially distributed, decentralized energy systems with embedded energy storage, and the application of smart technologies. Furthermore, we discover that the role of governments in guiding and managing regional energy transitions is highly important. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the first signs of yield deceleration and stagnation have already been reported for some globally important crops. Therefore, the study of the drivers of yield growth and its variation is essential for directing research and policies aiming at ensuring food security in the forthcoming years. We used data on mean and variability in annual yield growth for 107 globally important crops to assess the role of environmental (i.e., climatic region) and plant intrinsic traits (i.e., type of harvested organ, pollinator dependence, and life form) as drivers of change in yield growth and its stability. We applied a comparative approach to control for biases associated with phylogenetic non-independence among crops, an approach rarely used in agronomic studies. Average yield growth and its variation were not phylogenetically structured. Yield growth decreased with increasing pollinator dependence in tree crops but not in herbaceous and shrubby crops. Interannual yield variation tended to increase with increasing pollinator dependence, and it was higher in crops from temperate regions, in those cultivated for their reproductive organs, and in tree and shrubby crops as compared with herbaceous ones. Information on ecological correlates of crop yield growth and interannual yield variation can be used in the design of more sustainable and diversified agriculture schemes. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

The study was based on PAS 2050-1 (BSI) and comprised 99% primary data derived from historical farm records. System boundaries ranged from planting of the grapevines to eventual disposal of a typical 0.75 L glass bottle, which served as the functional unit (FU). iv) Results: The product carbon footprint (PCF) was 1.91 ± 0.3 kg CO2eq/bottle (A) or 1.69 ± 0.3 (B) kg CO2eq/bottle of white wine and 1.86 ± 0.3 kg CO2eq/bottle of red wine for both wineries. These results were attributed to the consumer behaviour (22–30%), followed by the use and production of glass bottles (20–27%). Grapevine cultivation amounted to 0.3–0.4 kg CO2eq/bottle; grape processing caused ca. 0.05–0.06 kg CO2eq/bottle, packaging 0.5–0.6 kg CO2eq/bottle, distribution 0.2–0.4 kg CO2eq/bottle, while use and disposal of the glass bottles emitted 0.5–0.6 kg CO2eq/bottle. The plant protection chemicals caused only ca. 1.4% and organic fertilizer ca. 2.8% of the product carbon footprint (PCF). Red and white wine appeared commensurate in their PCF within 3–8% in both vineyards. The water footprint was ca. 5.7 ± 0.6 (A) and 2.1 ± 0.4 (B) L blue water/bottle for both red and white wine. v) Discussion: The results are discussed with higher carbon footprint values for wine from overseas. We have identified the following reduction potentials such as the following management strategies: vi) Recommendations: a) reduction of fossil fuels for gas heating of the premises and for farm vehicles, b) the use of lightweight glass bottles and c) alternative means of transport for the consumer purchase at the winery when using a private vehicle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Attributional LCA; Carbon dioxide (CO2); Consumer behaviour; Greenhouse gases; Pinot noir; Product carbon footprint (PCF); Regional produce; Riesling; Water footprint","carbon; organic fertilizer; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; cultivation; heating; rootstock; vine; vineyard; water footprint; wine; Article; carbon footprint; consumer attitude; grape; nonhuman; red wine; reduction (chemistry); rhizome; vineyard; white wine; wine; agricultural land; Germany; Germany; Vitaceae; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; Farms; Germany; Wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096195073

As a chemical admixture, NaCl is expected to enhance the strength properties of the clay soil stabilized by CKD. To verify this issue, the geotechnical characteristics of CKD-treated soils with different contents of NaCl (2.5, 5, and 10%) were examined. To this end, the Atterberg limits, standard Proctor, unconfined compressive strength and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were conducted. Besides, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to observe the microstructural changes resulting from using additives. It was found that the addition of NaCl to the CKD-stabilized clay caused the maximum dry density to increase and the optimum moisture content to decrease. 10% NaCl enhanced the unconfined compressive strength of the CKD-treated soil to 18.7% and 8% higher than that of the NaCl-free specimen during 7 and 28 days of curing, respectively.

Herein, we investigated the effect of the support (unmodified and modified titania, commercial alumina, and untreated and treated Sibunit carbon) of mono-and bimetallic catalysts based on noble metals (Ag, Au, Pd) on selective HMF oxidation with molecular oxygen to FDCA under mild and basic reaction conditions. The higher selectivity to FDCA was obtained when metals were supported on Sibunit carbon (Cp). The order of noble metal in terms of catalyst selectivity was: Ag &lt; Au &lt; Pd &lt; PdAu. Finally, FDCA production on the most efficient PdAu NPs catalysts supported on Sibunit depended on the treatment applied to this carbon support in the order: PdAu/Cp &lt; PdAu/Cp-HNO3 &lt; PdAu/Cp-NH4OH. These bimetallic catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Hammet indicator method and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The functionalization of Sibunit surface by HNO3 and NH4OH led to a change in the contribution of the active states of Pd and Au due to promotion effect of N-doping and, as a consequence, to higher FDCA production.

The proposed approach uses a combination of value chain analysis and energy sector analysis that enables a comprehensive assessment considering local specificities. Its application to a case study of the Slovakian region Upper Nitra demonstrates practical examples of opportunities and challenges. The value chain analysis evaluates the coal mining industry, from coal extraction to electricity generation, in terms of jobs and business that are at risk by the closure of the coal mines. The complementary energy system analysis focuses on diversification of the energy mix, environmental impacts, and feasibility assessment of alternative energy technologies to the coal combusting sources. The results show a net positive cost benefit for all developed scenarios of replacing the local existing coal power plant. Although the installation of a new geothermal plant is estimated to be the most expensive option from our portfolio of scenarios, it presents the highest CO2 reduction in the electricity generation in Slovakia—34% less compare to the system employing the existing power plant. In addition, the development of a new industrial polo around deep geothermal technology can boost the economic activity in the region by attracting investments in companies providing geological exploration services, transferring the local knowledge from the coal mining industry into an emerging sector. © 2020 by the authors.

On the other hand, the EU is the world's largest importer of energy and making it highly energy dependent which is reduced the competitiveness of Member States' economies. Reducing the energy resources used leads to political, economic, social and environmental benefits. All this explains the EU's motivation to make energy efficiency a key goal in development policy for the Union. At the level of the European Union a number of normative documents have been adopted, related to increasing the energy efficiency of the two largest areas of energy consumption - buildings and manufacturing systems. In the share of energy consumption in the EU, manufacturing production has a significant share, which represents the potential for increasing energy efficiency.

Previous studies have mainly focused on situational factors and youth characteristics to predict its use. Objectives: This study sought to evaluate the role other potential predictors could play in the decision to use R&S, namely characteristics of residential workers and their perceived team climate. Methods: For two months, a total of 132 residential workers from different RTC in the greater Montreal area completed weekly diaries of standardized questionnaires. Using an explanatory sequential design (i.e., mixed methods), this study aimed at exploring the role of residential workers’ characteristics (e.g., exposure to client aggression, stress and fatigue) and aspects of their perceived team climate (e.g., order and organization, communication and openness) as predictors of R&S use. Survey results were later also presented to four focus groups for discussion. Results: Results indicated that exposure to verbal violence from youths was associated with the increased use of R&S. Meanwhile, perceived communication and openness were associated with lower rates of R&S use. Participants shared that repeated exposure to verbal violence diminished their level of tolerance while teamwork provided them with the emotional space needed to focus on the needs of youths and find alternatives to R&S. Conclusion: This study sheds light on the complex role of human emotions in the decision to use of R&S. Specifically, intense momentary emotions during crisis interventions had a greater influence on the use R&S than chronic states, such as fatigue. © 2020","Mixed-method; Residential treatment centers; Restraint and seclusion; Worker and perceived team climate factors","aggression; Article; burnout; child behavior; controlled study; emotion; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; longitudinal study; medical decision making; medical practice; perception; physical aggression; physical restraint; posttraumatic stress disorder; questionnaire; scoring system; verbal hostility; violence; work environment; aggression; behavior control; epidemiology; exercise; female; information processing; job stress; male; medical record; organization and management; patient isolation; procedures; psychology; Quebec; residential care; workplace; Aggression; Behavior Control; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Medical Records; Occupational Stress; Patient Isolation; Quebec; Residential Treatment; Restraint, Physical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097145051

Once dissolved in ocean waters, this CH4 can be oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2). While it has been hypothesized that the CO2 produced from aerobic CH4 oxidation could enhance ocean acidification, a previous study conducted in Hudson Canyon shows that CH4 oxidation has a small short-term influence on ocean pH and dissolved inorganic radiocarbon. Here we expand upon that investigation to assess the impact of widespread CH4 seepage on CO2 chemistry and possible accumulation of this carbon injection along 234 km of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Bight. Consistent with the estimates from Hudson Canyon, we demonstrate that a small fraction of ancient CH4-derived carbon is being assimilated into the dissolved inorganic radiocarbon (mean fraction of 0.5 ± 0.4%). The areas with the highest fractions of ancient carbon coincide with elevated CH4 concentration and active gas seepage. This suggests that aerobic CH4 oxidation has a greater influence on the dissolved inorganic pool in areas where CH4 concentrations are locally elevated, instead of displaying a cumulative effect downcurrent from widespread groupings of CH4 seeps. A first-order approximation of the input rate of ancient-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into the waters overlying the northern U.S. Mid-Atlantic Bight further suggests that oxidation of ancient CH4-derived carbon is not negligible on the global scale and could contribute to deepwater acidification over longer time scales. ©2020.

This paper has selected Chengdu‐Chongqing region of China as the research object, which suffers from severe air pollution and has been actively involved in air pollution control in recent years to achieve sustainable devel-opment. Based on the historical data of 16 cities in this region from January 2015 to November 2019 on six major air pollutants, this paper has first conducted evaluation on the monthly air quality of these cities within the research period by using Principal Component Analysis and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. Based on that, this paper has adopted the Long Short‐Term Memory neural network model in deep learning to forecast the monthly air quality of various cities from December 2019 to November 2020. The aims of this paper are to enrich existing literature on air pollution control, and provide a novel scientific tool for design and formu-lation of air pollution control policies by innovatively integrating commonly used evaluation models and deep learning forecast methods. According to the research results, in terms of historical evaluation, the air quality of cities in the Chengdu‐Chongqing region was generally moving in the same trend in the research period, with distinct characteristics of cyclicity and convergence. Year-on‐year speaking, the effectiveness of air pollution control in various cities has shown a visible improvement trend. For example, Ya’an’s lowest air quality evaluation score has improved from 0.3494 in 2015 to 0.4504 in 2019; Zigong’s lowest air quality score has also risen from 0.4160 in 2015 to 0.6429 in 2019. Based on the above historical evaluation and deep learning forecast results, this paper has proposed relevant policy recommendations for air pollution control in the Chengdu‐ Chongqing region. © 2020 by the author.

The agricultural sector is responsible for 28.5 % (2018) of total non-European Union Emissions Trading System (non - EU ETS) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Latvia. The largest part of emissions is related to agricultural soils (59.3 %) and enteric fermentation 32.6 % (mainly dairy and beef cattle). The GHG emissions trend of recent years shows a gradual and steady increase in GHG emissions for example between 2005 and 2018 +12.5 % and during the period 2013-2018 emissions increased by 2.12 %. According to Latvia's National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 (NECP), total GHG emissions in the agricultural sector are expected to increase in the period from 2020 to 2030, mainly in the enteric fermentation and agricultural soil categories. To achieve determined targets for Latvia's non-EU ETS sector in 2030 and be on track to reach climate neutrality in 2050, the agricultural sector has to contribute to GHG emission mitigation. For the agricultural sector, improved food security and climate smart activities will be necessary to achieve GHG emission reduction. Existing policies and measures (WEM) as well as those which are included in the NECP as additional measures (WAM) were used to assess more suitable measures to move on climate smart agriculture (CSA), that could help to decrease GHG emissions at the farm and state level as well as is expected to contribute towards achieving the commitments in the plan. To achieve the aim of the study, a combination of the Delphi method together with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is utilized to find a set of top GHG mitigation measures in the future.

First, the health impacts of air quality are estimated by using the concentrations estimated by multiscale air quality modeling and the recommended concentration–response functions (CRF), specifically as a result of exposure to particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), and ozone (O3 ). Second, the associated external costs are calculated by monetization techniques. Two scenarios are analyzed: a package including existing measures (WM2030) and a package with additional measures (WAM2030). Compared with the baseline scenario, an improvement was found in the health effects of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5, while for O3 there was a slight worsening, mainly due to the increase in the O3 metric used (SOMO35), which increases over some urban areas. Despite this, the monetary valuation of the total effects on health as a whole shows external benefits due to the adoption of measures (WM2030), compared with the reference scenario (no measures) of more than € 17.5 billion and, when considering the additional measures (WAM2030), benefits of about € 58.1 billion. © 2020 by the authors.

Festinger's theory of Cognitive Dissonance helps understand the constraints to the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies. For this purpose, a survey was applied to explore the relationship between the perception, attitude, and behavior of beekeepers in the face of climate change in Mexican territory. It was noted that: 1) Beekeepers identified climate change as the main problem for beekeeping; 2) They exhibit dissonance between their attitude and their behavior regarding adaptation strategies, and 3) Cognitive dissonance is reduced through justifications for their behavior. Thus, the present state of dissonance is a limitation for adopting climate change adaptation actions, evidencing the need to modify the behavior of beekeepers, through training to inform and explain the nature of climate change and its impacts; to place the beekeepers within this context, where they can contribute technical elements that may allow them to reorient their work, promoting an objective and constructive perception, which will generate a positive attitude in the face of the challenges that climate change represents, so that they may modify their behavior as much as necessary in order to keep the activity profitable in Mexico. © 2021 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

Among MPAs, a large percentage has been created with the implicit goal of protecting shark populations, including 17 shark sanctuaries which fully protect sharks throughout their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas represents a long-term MPA for sharks, following the banning of commercial longlining in 1993 and subsequent designation as a shark sanctuary in 2011. Little is known, however, about the long-term behavior and space use of sharks within this protected area, particularly among reef-associated sharks for which the sanctuary presumably offers the most benefit. We used acoustic telemetry to advance our understanding of the ecology of such sharks, namely Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), over two discrete islands (New Providence and Great Exuma) varying in human activity level, over 2 years. We evaluated which factors influenced the likelihood of detection of individuals, analyzed patterns of movement and occurrence, and identified variability in habitat selection among species and regions, using a dataset of 23 Caribbean reef sharks and 15 tiger sharks which were passively monitored in two arrays with a combined total of 13 acoustic receivers. Caribbean reef sharks had lower detection probabilities than tiger sharks, and exhibited relatively low habitat connectivity and high residency, while tiger sharks demonstrated wider roaming behavior across much greater space. Tiger sharks were associated with shallow seagrass habitats where available, but frequently transited between and connected different habitat types. Our data support the notion that large MPAs afford greater degrees of protection for highly resident species such as Caribbean reef sharks, yet still may provide substantial benefits for more migratory species such as tiger sharks. We discuss these findings within the context of species-habitat linkages, ecosystem services, and the establishment of future MPAs. © Copyright © 2021 Gallagher, Shipley, van Zinnicq Bergmann, Brownscombe, Dahlgren, Frisk, Griffin, Hammerschlag, Kattan, Papastamatiou, Shea, Kessel and Duarte.","acoustic telemetry; Bahamas; coral reef; marine protected area; MPA; seagrass; shark",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101180441

Optimal selection and operation of heat pumps can significantly improve system performance. To support this analysis, we model the quantitative relationships between heat pump configurations and source flow, supply and distribution temperatures, facility heating design options, output heat generation, and carbon abatement outcomes. A systems approach is used for analysis, troubleshooting, and improvement of the model. The result of this effort is a dynamic tool that appropriately responds to hourly thermal demand and communicates energy response for techno-economic analysis. Simulations indicate that a single well-pair in the local Basement Contact Zone reservoir can satisfy almost 68% of annual thermal demand at nearly 20 MWth average capacity while remaining financially competitive compared to conventional heating with levelized cost of heating (LCOH) as low as $4.55/MMBTU ($15.53/MWhth). A direct-use scheme with heat pump augmentation provided more carbon abatement and 50 to 150% more annual heat supply than one without augmentation. Exploration of three and four well-pair scenarios prove the capability to achieve 50 MWth baseload heating capacity with competitive LCOH and significant carbon reductions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Centralized heat pumps; Coefficient of performance; Deep direct-use; Energy systems; Geothermal district heating","Carbon footprint; District heating; Economic analysis; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Systems engineering; Temperature; Average capacities; Conventional heating; Distribution temperature; District energy systems; Engineering evaluations; Geothermal district heating; Low temperature geothermal energies; Techno-Economic analysis; Geothermal energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092686893

Previous evidence suggests that invasive plants tend to display traits related to a more acquisitive resource-use strategy than natives. However, the contribution of intraspecific trait variation to functional diversity has received little attention in community ecology, and might provide interesting information about community processes. In this study, we used eight plant traits related to carbon and nutrient acquisition of coexisting dominant native and invasive plants in eight communities across the Mediterranean-climate biome to determine sources of functional segregation between native and invasive species. We found three major axes of functional variation, related to leaf economics, resource-use efficiency, and plant height. Invasive species across communities had leaf traits related to an acquisitive resource-use strategy in contrast to native species, whereas differences in the second and third axes were community dependent. Invasive species were more functionally diverse than native species across the dataset and in four out of the eight communities. Intraspecific variance accounted for 11%–27% of total trait variation and was on average greater in invasive species, and especially important in the axis related to resource use efficiency. These results, although dependent on the trait and community considered, offer interesting insights to the sources of functional trait diversity of native and invasive species within communities, indicating that intraspecific variation might not be equally distributed between native and invasive species. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Functional diversity; Functional strategies; Intraspecific variance; Invasive plants; Leaf economics spectrum; Plant life form","community composition; intraspecific variation; invasive species; native species; plant community; resource use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091762977

There are many interventions, including climate‐smart practices, to cope with this situation and possibly enhance crop and soil productivity. Field experiments were set up in a randomized complete block design with six treatments (TRT) with four replications in three locations (LOC) during wheat‐growing seasons in Nepal from 2014 to 2016. Treatments included (i) Controlled Practice (CP), (ii) Improved Low (IL), (iii) Improved High (IH), (iv) Climate Smart Agriculture Low (CSAL), (v) Climate Smart Agriculture Medium (CSAM), and (vi) Climate Smart Agriculture High (CSAH), whereas those LOC were Banke, Rupandehi and Morang districts. There was a significant main effect of TRT and LOC on grain yield and a significant interactionn effect of TRT × LOC on biomass yield in 2014– 2015. About 55.5% additional grain yield was produced from CSAM treatment compared to CP in 2014–2015. Among locations, grain yield was the highest in Banke (3772.35 kg ha−1) followed by Rupandehi (2504.47 kg ha−1) and Morang districts (2504.47 kg ha−1). In 2015–2016, there was a significant interaction effect of TRT × LOC on grain and biomass yields. The highest grain yield was produced from CSAH treatment in Banke district in 2015–2016. Overall, grain yield and other parameters showed a better response with either of the climate‐smart interventions (mostly CSAH or CSAM) despite variability in geography, climate, and other environmental factors indicating the potential of climate‐smart practices to improve wheat production in southern plains of Nepal. © 2021 by the authors.

The distance of IVC 86-36 is constrained to be less than ∼3 kpc from absorption of a background star as determined from optical spectroscopy. There is a bridge feature in velocity between the IVC and the local interstellar medium with velocity separation of ∼50 km s-1, which may indicate dynamical interaction of the IVC with the disk. If the interaction is correct, the distance estimate d of the IVC ranges from 200 pc to 3 kpc, and the mass of the IVC head is estimated to be 7 × 103(d/1 kpc)2 M☉. The IVC shares similar properties to the Smith Cloud located at 12 kpc, including the head–tail distribution, streamers, and bridge feature, while the mass of the IVC is less than ∼0.1 of the Smith Cloud. A comparison between the H I and the Planck/IRAS dust emission indicates that the dust emission of IVC 86-36 is not detectable in spite of its H I column density of 2 × 1020 cm-2, indicating a low metallicity for IVC 86-36, reduced by a factor of ≲0.2 as compared with the solar neighbor. We conclude that IVC 86-38 is an infalling cloud which likely originated in the low-metallicity environment of the Galactic halo or the Magellanic system. © The Author(s) 2018.

Current DAC technologies consider only sorbent-based systems. Recently, there have been reports that show ultrahigh CO2 permeances in gas separation membranes and thus membrane separation could be a potential new technology for DAC in addition to sorbent-based CO2 capture. The simulation of chemical processes has been well established and is commonly used for the development and performance assessment of industrial chemical processes. These simulations offer a credible assessment of the feasibility of membrane-based DAC (m-DAC). In this paper, we discuss the potential of m-DAC considering the state-of-the-art performance of organic polymer membranes. The multistage membrane separation process was employed in process simulation to estimate the energy requirements for m-DAC.

In this study, a novel framework integrating the mass balance model with model-independent parameter estimation, geostatistics, and bagging algorithms were integrated to simulate the long-term changes in the Cd content of farmland soil in Zhejiang Province, China. The predicted Cd content in farmland soil in 2013 was compared to observed data (R value = 0.568 and root-mean-square error = 0.177 mg kg−1), demonstrating the feasibility of our model. The prediction results for 2050 indicated that the average concentration of Cd in farmland soil from Zhejiang Province will increase to 0.30 mg kg−1 if the current trend continues, and that 37.4% of the farmland soil in the province will be classified as a “security utilisation region”, indicating great risk of soil Cd contamination in these areas. Reducing industrial emissions and soil acidification to reduce the Cd pollution risk should receive great attention. This study provides a new perspective for forecasting the temporal trends of Cd accumulation in farmland soil and facilitates improved management and risk prevention of Cd pollution in agricultural soils and products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cadmium; Farmland soil; Mass balance model; Model-independent parameter estimation; Parameter optimisation","Agricultural robots; Cadmium; Farms; Forecasting; Industrial emissions; Mean square error; Pollution control; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Agricultural soils; Average concentration; Mass balance model; Mitigation strategy; Parameter optimisation; Root mean square errors; Soil acidifications; Temporal variation; Soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089956796

In this paper, we utilized socioeconomic data to construct a multiregional input-output (MRIO) table for 27 industries in 30 provinces of China. Multiregional input-output analysis and carbon emission intensity analysis were applied to analyze the effects of poverty alleviation investment on carbon emissions. We found that an investment in poverty alleviation has produced an increase in China's economic aggregate growth from 2010 to 2017. During this time period, the fastest economic growth occurred in 2012 and the regions with the greatest economic drivers were Yunnan and Guizhou. Regarding the industry sector, the construction industry and non-metal products industries had the highest contribution to economy. The economic contribution of the agricultural and food processing industries was insufficient. Poverty alleviation in 26 provinces effectively reduced carbon emission intensity, and the effects were continuously optimized from 2010 to 2017. However, this effect in Inner Mongolia and other 3 provinces was weak. In addition, the effect of carbon emission reduction in the energy production and mining industries was not ideal. This study focuses on the effect of poverty alleviation investment on carbon emissions, which can provide policy guidance for poverty alleviation and green economic growth in China. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emissions; Emission reduction effect; MRIO; Poverty alleviation investment","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Construction industry; Economic analysis; Emission control; Food processing; Investments; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emission reductions; Economic contribution; Food processing industry; Input output analysis; Poverty alleviation; Socio-economic data; Sustainable economic development; Industrial economics; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; green economy; input-output analysis; policy approach; poverty alleviation; socioeconomic survey; sustainable development; China; Guizhou; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092092863

During the Carboniferous–Permian period, convergence between the North China block and the paleo-Yangtze plate to the south resulted in a general marine regression characterized by a series of second-order transgression/regression cycles diachronous along the eastern margin of the Ordos. However, the detailed mechanisms that induced these cycles, as well as the associated paleoecological changes, remain unknown. In this study, we integrate multiple indices, including δ18O and δ13C, rare earth element (REE), paleontological assemblages, and clay content (w (chlorite + kaolinite)/w((Illite) ratio) planar distribution, to restore the paleo-water depth distribution. These parameters are then used to reconstruct the paleo-sea level from the Pennsylvanian to the middle Permian. We conclude that the direction of second-order transgression/regression was mainly toward the east during the Pennsylvanian–early Permian and switched clockwise toward the north during the middle Permian. We suggest that the second-order cycles, diachronous in space and time, are mainly linked to local variations in sediment supply and regional uplift. Using detrital zircon U–Pb data and the REE and trace element content and heavy mineral assemblages (HMA), we estimate the sediment provenance area. The sediment volumes deposited in the basin through time are obtained using 2D seismic data. During the Carboniferous, the coarse-grained sediments deposited in the eastern Ordos were derived from the uplifting Helan Mountain (Qiandam–Qilian orogenic belt). By the middle Permian, the detrital material became multi-sourced, thus issuing the Yinshan range to the north and the Qinling range to the south. We then integrate the description of numerous core samples with electric log and 2D seismic data to reconstruct the sediment facies associations across the first-order regression from the Carboniferous tidal flat depositional system to the middle Permian prograding fluvial delta system. According to the transfer of the glacial epoch, the sedimentation rate, and the transgression/regression rate above, we classify the evolution process into three patterns: low-transgression rate and less-sediment supply pattern (the late Carboniferous), high regression rate and mass sediment supply pattern (the north block during the early Permian), and low regression rate and mass sediment supply pattern (the south block during the Sakmarian stage). Lastly, with the quantitative calculation of the source-to-sink (S2S) parameters, including the S2S system volume and the elevated height of regional uplift with the 2D seismic data, we propose the mechanism of transgression/regression in the Ordos Basin, responding to the above three pattern s. The first pattern was controlled by regional uplift, whereas the second pattern was controlled by sediment supply. As to the third one, uplift and sediment supply could affect the transgression/regression process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Detrital geochronology data; Paleontology data; Pennsylvanian–permian transition; Provenance identification; Transgression mechanism","Climate change; Deposition; Geophysical prospecting; Kaolinite; Metamorphic rocks; Rare earths; Sea level; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Trace elements; Zircon; Coarse-grained sediments; Depositional system; Qilian orogenic belt; Quantitative calculation; Sediment provenance; Sedimentation rates; Spatiotemporal variability; Trace element content; Sediments; Carboniferous; detrital deposit; geochronology; paleontology; provenance; sea level change; sediment transport; spatiotemporal analysis; transgression; China; Ordos Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092464206

The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil OC stocks from Chinese VCHs have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global OC sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil OC stocks, burial rates and losses of VCHs in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low OC stocks, storing 6.3 ± 0.6, 7.5 ± 0.6, and 1.6 ± 0.6 Tg C (±95% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 ± 17, 159 ± 57, and 6 ± 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil OC stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2–395.4 Tg CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","blue carbon; carbon burial; carbon loss; carbon stock; climate change; sequestration potential; soil organic carbon","climate change; mangrove; organic carbon; saltmarsh; seagrass; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil profile; topsoil; China; Matthiola; carbon; carbon sequestration; China; ecosystem; soil; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Ecosystem; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091504025

Many of the 20 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) member nations have been global leaders in the protection and management of wild fisheries, but to date, most of these nations have not developed robust aquaculture industries. Using existing data and documentation of aquaculture targets from government and industry, we compiled and analysed past trends in farmed and wild seafood production and consumption in ICES nations, as well as the potential and need to increase aquaculture production by 2050. We found that the majority of ICES nations lacks long-term strategies for aquaculture growth, with an increasing gap between future domestic production and consumption - resulting in a potential 7 million tonne domestic seafood deficit by 2050, which would be supplemented by imports from other countries (e.g. China). We also found recognition of climate change as a concern for aquaculture growth, but little on what that means for meeting production goals. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize aquaculture policy to set more ambitious domestic production goals and/or improve sustainable sourcing of seafood from other parts of the world, with explicit recognition and strategic planning for climate change affecting such decisions. In short, there is a need for greater concerted effort by ICES member nations to address aquaculture's long-term future prospects. © 2020 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2020.

Tree-reduction treatments are widely implemented in expanding woodlands to reduce fuel loads, increase ecological resilience, and improve habitat, but few studies have measured treatment outcomes over long timescales or large geographic areas. The Sagebrush Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP) evaluated the ecological effects of prescribed fire and cut-and-leave treatments in sagebrush communities experiencing tree expansion in North American cold desert shrublands. We used 10 yr of data from the SageSTEP network to test how treatments interacted with pre-treatment tree dominance, soil climate, and time since treatment to affect plant functional groups and dominant species. Non-sprouting shrub (Artemisia spp.), sprouting shrub, perennial graminoid, and annual grass responses depended on tree dominance and soil climate, and responses were related to the dominant species' life-history traits. Sites with warm and dry soils showed increased perennial graminoid but reduced Artemisia shrub cover across the tree dominance gradient after prescribed burning, while sites with cool and moist soils showed favorable post-burn responses for both functional types, particularly at low to moderate tree dominance. Cut-and-leave treatments sustained or increased native perennial plant functional groups and experienced smaller increases in exotic annual plants in both soil climates across the tree dominance gradient. Both treatments reduced biocrust cover. Selecting appropriate tree-reduction treatments to achieve desired long-term outcomes requires consideration of dominant species, site environmental conditions, and the degree of woodland expansion. Careful selection of management treatments will reduce the likelihood of undesirable consequences to the ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.","ecological resilience; fuel treatments; pinyon-juniper woodlands; prescribed fire; resistance to invasion; restoration; sagebrush steppe; Special Feature: Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project; woodland expansion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099800592

To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a location-based, techno-economic and cradle-to-grave environmental assessment for solar methanol (MeOH) and ammonia (NH3) based on an optimisation model. Methanol and ammonia were considered for this study due to their relative ease of manufacture and lower production costs than complex fuels, e.g., FT-fuels, and the growing interest in using them as transportation fuels. From this analysis, we concluded that ammonia could have similar production costs, ca., 300 USD/GJ, but better environmental performance than methanol regarding global warming potential (GWP) and the three endpoint impact categories of the ReciPe 2016 LCA damage model, i.e., human health, ecosystems and resources. These results are highly dependent on the hydrogen storage options available; their costs and carbon footprints. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","carbon and nitrogen-based fuels; e-fuels; life-cycle assessment; optimisation; techno-economic assessment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110548902

Phasing out solid fuels is expected to contribute to the low-carbon energy transition while delivering health and environmental co-benefits. Poland, a coal-based country where nearly half of the population relies on solid fuels for domestic heating, has introduced fuel switching schemes for assisting households transition towards cleaner energy carriers. In this paper, we investigate the experiences and motivations of beneficiary households in a solid fuel stove replacement programmes operating in Northern Poland between 2015 and 2017 through the lens of co-benefits. Collected data include a 140-household survey and 15 interviews with programme intermediaries at the municipal level. The results identify significant increases in thermal comfort, free time and cleanliness along with improved indoor air quality as key well-being effects of heating systems upgrade. These reported impacts contrast with the institutional clean air rationales underpinning the interventions. Our findings challenge the idea of a neat one-way transition, as participant households stated their reluctance to fully abandon solid fuel-based heating because of perceived uncertainties around future energy prices and supply. The findings warn too about the potentially regressive distributional effects when subsidy allocation mechanisms overlook the income and needs of beneficiaries. To conclude, we put forward the notion of household-level ‘everyday life’ co-benefits as a lever for improved citizen engagement and for advancing energy transitions in the residential sector. © 2020","Air quality; Co-benefits; Energy transition; Households; Poland; Socio-technical transitions; Solid fuels",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092901749

Methodology: In the first phase, two examples of excellent cable car systems and intermodality in the alpine area (Innsbruck and Alpe di Siusi) were examined in order to identify good practices as applicable to the evaluation of the (T-MB) project. Seven key dimensions were identified to evaluate the origins and implementation of the two completed cableway projects. In the second phase, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the project. Findings: From a managerial point of view, the T-MB project was initiated by public actors and adopts the instruments of participatory strategic planning widely used by the municipality of Trento over the last twenty years. The evaluation of environmental sustainability highlights the cable car as a valuable alternative transport mode because it reduces CO2 emissions and pollution and it can be constructed with minimal impact on the territory. Research limits: The T-MB project is still in the evaluation phase. It was not possible to access all the data necessary for either a detailed evaluation of the managerial implications or for the LCA analysis. Practical implications: Identification of key dimensions and best practices for the implementation of sustainable cable car mobility projects. Originality of the paper: The use of LCA analysis for the calculation of the environmental impact of cable care structures is innovative and it is one of the first studies in the field. © 2021 Fondazione Cueim.

However, CO2 foams are thermodynamically unstable, so they must be stabilized. Surfactants are often used to generate and stabilize foams in porous media and can be soluble in the aqueous phase, or in the CO2 phase. Aqueous- and CO2-soluble surfactants must be characterized for their ability to reduce CO2 mobility and stabilize foam at reservoir conditions. In addition, numerical models are necessary to predict and evaluate the effect of foam for field-scale applications and require empirical data obtained from core-scale flooding experiments. This study presents a series of steady-state foam co-injections with dense phase CO2 and either aqueous- or CO2-soluble surfactant solutions at varying CO2 flow velocities and CO2 fractions. One anionic water-soluble surfactant, which is considered a benchmark foam stabilizer, and five partially CO2-soluble non-ionic surfactants were investigated. Gamma ray attenuation was used to accurately monitor in-situ saturations during steady-state co-injections. The primary objective was to determine the steady-state foam characteristics of the different surfactants by evaluating the mobility reduction factor (MRF) and the limiting water saturation where foam abruptly collapses (Sw∗). All of the tested surfactants generated foam and reduced CO2 mobility by more than three orders of magnitude. The anionic surfactant increased foam stability at lower water saturations, compared to the non-ionic surfactants, which resulted in lower residual water saturations and increased pore volume available for CO2 storage. Core flooding results provided input into a local-equilibrium foam model. The fitted foam model reproduced the experimental results for the anionic surfactant and for three of the five non-ionic surfactants. The two latter non-ionic surfactants violated model assumptions because non-monotonic water saturation changes were observed, an effect not accurately captured by local-equilibrium foam models. However, the modelling work elucidated subtle experimental trends and demonstrated the applicability of the dataset as input into implicit-texture local-equilibrium foam models. © 2020 The Authors","CCUS; CO2 EOR; CO2 foam; CO2 storage; Mobility control; Surfactants","Anionic surfactants; Biophysics; Digital storage; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Enhanced recovery; Floods; Gamma rays; Magnetorheological fluids; Oil well flooding; Porous materials; Textures; Enhanced oil recovery; Gamma-ray attenuation; Geological formation; Reservoir conditions; Residual water saturation; Soluble surfactants; Three orders of magnitude; Water-soluble surfactants; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; enhanced oil recovery; numerical model; porous medium; reservoir characterization; surfactant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089354612

Algorithms for planning routes for EVs should take into account their relatively short driving range and the effects of traffic congestion on the battery consumption. This paper proposes new methodology and illustrates how it can be applied to solve an electric vehicle routing problem with stochastic and time-dependent travel times where battery recharging along routes is not allowed. First, a new method for generating network-consistent (correlated in time and space) and time-dependent speed scenarios is introduced. Second, a new technique for applying branch and price on instances defined on real street networks is developed. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for finding optimal or near-optimal solutions in instances with up to 133 customers and almost 1,500 road links. With a high probability, the routes in the obtained solutions can be performed by EVs without requiring intermediate recharging stops. An execution time control policy to further reduce the chances of stranded EVs is also presented. In addition, we measure the cost of independence, which is the impact on solution feasibility when travel times are assumed statistically independent. Last, we give directions on how to extend the proposed framework to handle recourse actions.

It builds on the case of Lima residents’ responses to the extreme events brought by the 2017 El Niño Costero, used here as a temporal analogue. Our novel, process-oriented approach to framing adaptive capacity integrates elements from both environmental behavior and new institutionalism literatures. Based on interviews with Lima residents, policymakers, and stakeholders as well as on a qualitative document analysis of national and city policies we identify and characterize the socio-psychological processes that are critical to understanding why individuals adopt (or not) different adaptive strategies. We show how governance and social institutions (from municipal regulations to gender roles) influenced residents’ perceived vulnerability and how this, in turn, structured their coping actions during the El Niño Costero episode. We further demonstrate that ways in which individuals deploy coping mechanisms structure their future adapting paths through practices that privilege the status quo while deferring risks in time and space. In this context, the interrelation of residents’ cognitive processes with evolving social norms lead to five strategies for dealing with climate change. The discussion reflects on the need to address institutionalized social inequalities that permeate Lima's daily urban life in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable, and on the relationship between residents and authorities on the pathway to urban resilience. © 2021","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Cognitive processes; Lima; Social norms; Urban",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113381197

They include believing pollution causes climate change, believing ozone depletion causes climate change, the combination of these two “green beliefs,” referred to as environmental problems, and believing natural climate variation significantly contributes to current climate trends. Each of these causal beliefs has the potential to weaken or divert support away from effective climate change risk mitigation policies. To assess this potential, we explore the nature and prevalence of these beliefs in the United States with a national sample of interviews (N = 77) and two national surveys (N = 1,013, N = 1,820), and apply regression and mediation analyses to explore whether they explain any of the variation in individuals’ concern or support for policy to mitigate climate change. Adherence to these beliefs—which reflect a variety of misconceptions illustrated in the interviews—differs by political ideology but is common, with over a third of interviewees mentioning one or more. Controlling for general knowledge, political ideology, and other factors, misconceptions about environmental problems are still associated directly with support for climate change policies. On average adherence to the belief that environmental problems cause climate change is associated with a 25% higher probability of policy support. In contrast, believing natural climate variability is a major recent cause of climate change is associated with a 7% lower probability of supporting climate policy, even after controlling for political ideology and other knowledge about climate change. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis","Climate change; mental models; risk perceptions","Environmental protection; Ozone layer; Climate change policies; Climate change risks; Environmental problems; General knowledge; Lower probabilities; Mediation analysis; Natural climate variabilities; Political ideologies; Climate change; climate change; environmental issue; environmental policy; mitigation; ozone depletion; perception; political ideology; questionnaire survey; regression analysis; research work; United States; adult; article; climate change; cognitive model; female; human; ideology; interview; major clinical study; male; perception; prevalence; probability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090924377

To tackle this issue, individuals and corporations first need to assess their carbon footprint, which then represents the groundwork for the future implementation of significant changes required to reduce that footprint. We present the carbon emissions attributed to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) for the year 2019. We partnered with CarbonBuddy and followed their method to break down the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of various activities at CFHT for the entire year of 2019: air travel in and out of state, ground vehicle usage, electricity consumption, and other fossil fuel utilization. The total GHG emissions of CFHT for the year 2019 amount to about 749 tons of CO2 equivalent, which corresponds to more than 16 tons per employee. About 63% of the emissions are related to electricity usage at the summit facility, about 25% to out-of-state travel, about 6% to the use of our fleet of vehicles, and about 5% to electricity usage at headquarters. We show that significant improvements have occurred in the recent past at CFHT, with the installation of solar panels and a remarkable reduction in electricity consumption at headquarters. We list suggestions to further decrease the GHG emissions in the short to long term: offset current emissions by support local projects, invest in more efficient equipment, and establish environmentally friendly habits. The fundamental work presented will facilitate the official planning at CFHT for a drastic reduction in GHG emissions with the goal to meet the objectives laid out in the 2015 Paris Accord. It will also support the design of the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), the future transformation of CFHT, and allow the project to seize this opportunity and incorporate the fight against climate change as one of its core missions. By choosing to implement those changes, CFHT and MSE can become part of the solution to climate change and lead the way, locally and in the world of astronomy. © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","climate change; greenhouse gas emission","Carbon footprint; Electric power utilization; Environmental impact; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear fuels; Carbon emissions; Electricity usage; Electricity-consumption; Fleet of vehicles; Fossil fuel utilization; GHG emission; Offset currents; Severe weather; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103686786

They are in our phones, clothes, bottles, and cars. Yet having improved our lives considerably, they now threaten our environment and our health. The associated carbon emissions and persistency of plastics challenge the fragile balance of many ecosystems. One solution is using biodegradable plastics. Ideally, such plastics are easily assimilated by microorganisms and disappear from our environment. This can help reduce the problems of climate change, microplastics, and littering. However, biodegradable plastics are still only a tiny portion of the global plastics market and require further efforts in research and commercialization. Here, a critical overview of the state of the art of biodegradable plastics is given. Using a material flow analysis, the challenges of the plastic market are highlighted, and with it the large market potential of biodegradable plastics.

This phenomenon exposes people and goods to the threat, being necessary to carry out a well-founded management of these areas. Coastal erosion risk assessment methodologies are an important tool for coastal management. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate and discuss coastal management strategies based on the application of a methodology of coastal erosion risk classification, allowing easy comparison of scenarios. The study was developed for the Portuguese coastal stretch Barra-Vagueira. CERA methodology and its plugin for QGIS software were applied in order to assess the erosion risk of Barra-Vagueira stretch for different coastal erosion mitigation scenarios. First, an analysis of the coastal erosion risk was carried out based on bibliographic elements and present situation characterization. Subsequently, the erosion risk was assessed considering defence, relocation and nourishment strategies scenarios and climate change scenarios. The study based on bibliographic elements shows that the coastal region between Barra and Vagueira has a high risk of coastal erosion. Generally, the different scenarios tested represent variations on coastal erosion risk classification, allowing a simple first approach to evaluate coastal erosion mitigation scenarios, helping planning and decision-makers. Performing measures that allow to constrain the shoreline retreat, as artificial nourishments, leads to greater benefits in reducing the area of the territory classified with higher risk. New coastal defence structures allow to mainly decrease the stretch's susceptibility to coastal erosion. The relocation of population leads to a decrease in the area of the territory classified as very high-risk. Climate change increases the erosion risk. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","CERA; Climate changes; Coastal interventions; Coastal zones management; Hazard","climate change; coastal erosion; coastal zone; coastal zone management; hazard assessment; risk assessment; strategic approach; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092501796

Human impact and the ongoing climate change are however reducing the ability of wetlands to provide such important services. Through field surveys, GIS analyses and climate projections, we assessed the status of, and threats to, 38 largest wetlands belonging to the Mediterranean bird flyways in Sardinia and Sicily (Italy). We then combined ten decision criteria about avifaunal diversity and human/climate threats in order to prioritize the studied wetlands from most to least worthy of urgent interventions. Results showed that the main wetlands of these two regions have distinct demands with regard to the kind of actions required, going from the mitigation of tourism pressure to the prevention of climate-induced water shortage in summer. Furthermore, clear priorities for interventions emerged in both regions. Our study has direct implications for managers and researchers attempting to assess wetland conditions and set conservation priorities, thus offering a tool for deciding urgent interventions on the main stopover sites along the Mediterranean bird flyways. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Avifauna; Climate change; Human impact; Sea level rise; Stopover sites; Water shortage","Birds; Climate change; Ecosystems; Climate projection; Conservation priorities; Decision criterions; Ecosystem services; Prioritization; Stopover sites; Water shortages; Wetland condition; Wetlands; anthropogenic effect; avifauna; conservation management; field survey; GIS; Mediterranean environment; species diversity; wetland; Article; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental decision making; environmental exploitation; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental protection; human activities; human impact (environment); Italy; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; species richness; summer; wetland; animal; bird; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; Sicily; Italy; Sardinia; Sicily; Aves; Animals; Birds; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Sicily; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089946912

Observations show that ozone (O3) concentrations have increased by 62.40% (27.84%) and SO2 concentrations have decreased by 56.42% (35.07%) during particulate pollution episodes in Beijing (BTH) in the autumn from 2013 to 2015. The measured nitrate concentration in Beijing has increased markedly, which to a large degree offsets the sulfate decrease caused by SO2 emission mitigation. Using the WRF-Chem model, we demonstrate that the enhanced nitrate formation is primarily attributed to increasing atmospheric oxidizing capacity (AOC) and decreasing sulfate competition for base ions. A 9.41–46.24% (7.58–40.97%) decrease in OH radical (O3) concentrations in October 2015 reduces nitrate and fine particulate matters (PM2.5) concentrations by 2.51–18.18% and 3.15–18.90% in Beijing, respectively. Based on the scenario in October 2015, if the SO2 emission increases by 20.00–100.00%, the PM2.5 concentration increases by 3.02–11.21%, but the nitrate level decreases by 2.48–21.87% simultaneously. Our results suggest that the nitrate aerosol has become a dominant contributor to particulate pollution in Beijing and that decreasing AOC is critical to mitigate nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric oxidizing capacity; Nitrate; Ozone; Sulfate; WRF-Chem","Air pollution; Free radicals; Nitrates; Sulfur dioxide; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Emission mitigation; Fine particulate matter; Nitrate concentration; Oxidizing capacity; Particulate pollution; PM2.5 concentration; Sulfur dioxide emissions; Particles (particulate matter); ammonia; hydroxyl radical; nitrate; organic carbon; ozone; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; sulfuric acid; concentration (composition); emission; nitrate; oxidation; particulate matter; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric oxidizing capacity; autumn; China; concentration process; controlled study; environmental impact; exhaust gas; haze; humidity; oxidation kinetics; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; phase transition; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092674929

Understanding the contribution of these factors can inform climate responsibilities and potential demand-side climate mitigation strategies. By linking US consumer expenditure survey data with a nested national within a global multi-regional input-output model, this study estimates consumption-based GHG emissions for 9 income groups and assesses the carbon inequality in the US for 2015. Our results show that the per capita carbon footprint (CF) of the highest income group (>200 thousand USD per year) with 32.3 tons is about 2.6 times the per capita CF of the lowest income group (<15 thousand USD) with 12.3 tons. This is due to large gap in consumption volume and associated carbon emissions along the entire global production chain. Consumption pattern tends to narrow the gap in household per capita CF between income groups due to the lower carbon intensity per dollar spent by higher income groups. Another important factor influencing carbon footprints is household size and thus sharing of household equipment and other consumption items. The US average per capita CF is 18.1 tons compared to the global average of approximately 5 tons. The high carbon footprint across income groups in the US is largely due to the large contribution of emissions from heating and cooling and private transport, which reflects the settlement structure and lifestyles in the US, relying heavily on cars and living in larger houses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption; Consumption-based emissions; Household; Inequality; Input-output analysis","Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Climate mitigations; Consumer expenditure; Consumption patterns; Demographic factors; Global production; Heating and cooling; Input output model; Private transport; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090361134

It is essential to understand landscape-scale vegetation responses on these unit time scales as they may describe sensitivity of landscape water, carbon, and energy cycles to shifts in rainfall intensity and frequency, even if the average seasonal precipitation remains unchanged. Because pulse investigations are primarily carried out in drylands, little is known about the characteristics and extent of ecosystem plant pulse responses across the broader range of climates and biomes. Using satellite-based plant water content (from vegetation optical depth) and plant carbon uptake observations from eddy covariance towers across the continental United States climate gradient (dry to humid), we characterize large-scale plant carbon and water uptake responses to rain pulses during spring and summer months. We find that while all ecosystems in the study region show discernable plant water content and carbon flux responses to rain pulses, drier ecosystems exhibit more frequent and longer duration responses. Unlike mesic environments, drylands show significantly different responses under varying antecedent soil moisture and pulse magnitude conditions; the largest water and carbon uptakes follow large pulses on initially wet soils. We detect soil moisture thresholds primarily in drylands, which can partly explain dryland vegetation's different responses under dry and wet conditions. We conclude that vegetation responds to individual pulses of water availability across all climates and therefore a range of ecosystems are sensitive to rainfall distributions beyond simple seasonal precipitation totals. © 2020.

By integrating the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios with climate models, a vegetation model, socio-economic scenarios, and a forest economic model, the study explores long run adjustments of both ecosystems and markets to climate change that have not been studied before. The ecological model suggests that global forest productivity increases under RCP 8.5. The overall supply of timber expands faster than demand through the 23rd century lowering timber prices and creating net benefits in the timber sector. Consumers benefit the most from the lower prices but these same low prices tend to damage forest owners, especially in the tropics. Even without a formal sequestration policy, average global forest carbon is projected to increase by 6%-8% by 2100. Under the RCP 2.6, forest carbon remains stable through 2200 but under RCP 8.5 it is simulated to increase by another 8% with a very heterogeneous distribution across world regions. Under both RCPs, global forest area is projected to increase relative to a no-climate change case until 2150, but possibly decline thereafter. © 2021 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate impacts; Forests; RCPs; SSPs","Climate models; Commerce; Costs; Ecology; Economic analysis; Forestry; Timber; Comprehensive assessment; Ecological modeling; Emission scenario; Environmental and economic impacts; Forest productivity; Heterogeneous distributions; Long-term interaction; Vegetation model; Climate change; carbon storage; climate change; emission inventory; forest management; long-term change; timber market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099946766

However, the degree to which these outcomes may be mitigated by reducing air pollutant emissions is not well understood. Objective: To model the associations between future changes in climate, air quality, and human health for 2 climate models and under 2 air pollutant emission scenarios. Design, Setting, and Participants: This modeling study simulated meteorological conditions over the coterminous continental US during a 1995 to 2005 baseline and over the 21st century (2025-2100) by dynamically downscaling representations of a high warming scenario from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Coupled Model version 3 (CM3) global climate models. Using a chemical transport model, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations were simulated under a 2011 air pollutant emission data set and a 2040 projection. The changes in PM2.5 and O3-attributable deaths associated with climate change among the US census-projected population were estimated for 2030, 2050, 2075, and 2095 for each of 2 emission inventories and climate models. Data were analyzed from June 2018 to June 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were simulated change in summer season means of the maximum daily 8-hour mean O3, annual mean PM2.5, population-weighted exposure, and the number of avoided or incurred deaths associated with these pollutants. Results are reported for 2030, 2050, 2075, and 2095, compared with 2000, for 2 climate models and 2 air pollutant emissions data sets. Results: The projected increased maximum daily temperatures through 2095 were up to 7.6 °C for the CESM model and 11.8 °C for the CM3 model. Under each climate model scenario by 2095, compared with 2000, an estimated additional 21 000 (95% CI, 14 000-28 000) PM2.5-attributable deaths and 4100 (95% CI, 2200-6000) O3-attributable deaths were projected to occur. These projections decreased to an estimated 15 000 (95% CI, 10 000-20 000) PM2.5-attributable deaths and 640 (95% CI, 340-940) O3-attributable deaths when simulated using a future emission inventory that accounted for reduced anthropogenic emissions. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that reducing future air pollutant emissions could also reduce the climate-driven increase in deaths associated with air pollution by hundreds to thousands.",,"ozone; air pollutant; air pollution; climate change; forecasting; human; mortality; particulate matter; season; theoretical model; toxicity; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Climate Change; Forecasting; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Seasons; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099427732

In this work, we report a new hybrid electrocatalyst: iron-cobalt decorated nitrogen doped carbon/reduced graphene oxide-700 °C (Fe-Co-CN/rGO-700). The catalyst shows an excellent electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER in alkaline solution, which has lower overpotentials of 0.215 V and 0.308 V at the current density 10 mA cm−2, respectively, and this catalyst has an outstanding durability (after 45 h). The excellent activity mainly benefit from the highly dispersed iron/cobalt species, sheet structure with high porosity, the improvement of electronic structures with nitrogen-doped carbon and high conductivity of rGO. Combined with the density function theory (DFT) calculations, the improvement of the HER and OER performance were also attributed to the balance of adsorption/desorption of the hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates, and the increased electronic states density near the Fermi level. The proposed work provides a novel and simple strategy to synthesize a porous carbon electrocatalyst material using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursor with high activity and strong stability for HER and OER. © 2020","Hydrogen evolution reaction; Metal–organic frameworks; Oxygen evolution reaction; Water electrolysis","Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Electronic structure; Graphene; Hydrogen; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Oxygen; Oxygen evolution reaction; Porous materials; Probability density function; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Adsorption/desorption; Alkaline solutions; Density function theory calculations; Electrocatalytic performance; Electronic states density; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Nitrogen-doped carbons; Oxygen evolution reaction (oer); Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095412646

In this paper, structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and structural path decomposition (SPD) are jointly used to identify the socioeconomic factors and critical supply chain paths driving consumption-based BC changes in Sichuan Province, which has become a main BC emission source since the implementation of “Western Development Strategy”. The SDA results show that economic growth contributes 75.02 kt emission increase. Emission intensity plays a critical role in emission reduction, which offsets the emission increase by 56.00 kt. The results of SPD identify that the major paths influencing BC emission changes are “Petroleum Processing→(Construction/Metal Smelting and Production/Machinery and Equipment)→Final Demand,” “Agriculture→(Food Production/Agriculture)→Final Demand,” and “Transportation→(Commercial and Institution)→Final Demand.” Socioeconomic drivers might pose a bidirectional impact on BC emission on different supply paths. The results reveal that BC reduction should emphasize reducing the emission intensity of the upstream sector, improving the production efficiency of the intermediate sector, and using cleaner alternatives in the downstream sectors on critical paths. The case of Sichuan may provide insights into the BC mitigation practices of other regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; Critical supply chain paths; Driving factors; Structural decomposition analysis; Structural path decomposition","black carbon; petroleum; carbon; black carbon; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic growth; environmental economics; pollutant source; smog; supply chain management; agriculture; Article; clinical pathway; controlled study; decomposition; economic development; food industry; reduction (chemistry); socioeconomics; China; city; soot; traffic and transport; China; Sichuan; Carbon; China; Cities; Critical Pathways; Soot; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094606989

The AHYR is a province-wide practice and policy change initiative in Alberta, Canada, that aims to prevent intimate partner violence by promoting service provider and systems capacity to support healthy relationships in adolescence and beyond. Developed in 2012 within a broader initiative called Shift: The Project to End Domestic Violence, the design of the AHYR began with work with provincial policy-makers, in order to create a policy climate that championed primary prevention practice. This policy climate subsequently supported the province-wide implementation of three evidence-based/evidence-informed programs that focus on building the skills and capacities required for healthy youth relationships. Through these programs, the AHYR has reached over 62,000 youth in grades 7–9, 900 teachers, 850 parents, and 1300 adults that work with youth across the province. In addition to these three programs, the AHYR also works with larger systems (e.g., policymakers, local funders, post-secondary institutions) to advance primary prevention practice. In this paper, we describe how the AHYR contributed to a culture of intimate partner violence prevention practice in the province by improving the readiness of funders and system leaders, community organizations, and practitioners to support healthy relationships best practices. We also describe how we used process evaluation to explore the potential for practice change and to inform the design of the next iteration of the AHYR. The article concludes with implications for other researchers and practitioners aiming to build a culture of intimate partner violence prevention practice within their province or state. © 2019, Society for Prevention Research.","Adolescent; Healthy relationships; Implementation; Intimate partner violence; Primary prevention","adult; Alberta; article; climate; community; female; human; human experiment; juvenile; leadership; major clinical study; male; partner violence; physician; primary prevention; scientist; skill; teacher; adolescent; Alberta; child parent relation; domestic violence; prevention and control; primary prevention; program evaluation; Adolescent; Adult; Alberta; Domestic Violence; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Parents; Primary Prevention; Program Evaluation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065171088

We used contemporary data (1990-2017) from a standardized annual bottom trawl survey with historical logbook information (1948-1977) from a research vessel. We standardized data to account for spatial and temporal effects on catch rate by first fitting a Bayesian model to the contemporary data, and then using the posterior distributions of the covariates as prior distributions when fitting models to the historical data. We found that most of the 15 species chosen for analysis had highly variable population dynamics within both time periods, and that patterns of variability were similar in the contemporary and historical time period. Surprisingly, there was little evidence of community-wide recovery following regulations that first limited and then banned commercial bottom trawling in the late 1980s to mid-1990s. Spotted ratfish and English sole dominated catches in both time periods, and species that were common in the historical time period were also common in the contemporary time period. The absence of coherent community changes in response to fisheries regulations and other major social and ecological changes may signal the complex dynamics of an urban estuary that is subject to multiple external drivers, and speaks to the need to consider long-term dynamic behavior of populations and communities when establishing ecological indicators. © 2021 Inter-Research.

This is important, as settlement ensures species occur in optimal environments and, for commercially important species such as abalone, reduced settlement could decrease future population success. We investigated how OA could affect settlement success in the New Zealand abalone Haliotis iris by examining: (1) direct effects of seawater at ambient (pHT 8.05) and reduced pHT (7.65) at the time of settlement, (2) indirect effects of settlement substrates (crustose coralline algae, CCA) preconditioned at ambient and reduced pHT for 171 days, and (3) carry-over effects, by examining settlement in larvae reared to competency at ambient and reduced pHT (7.80). We found no effects of seawater pH or CCA incubation on larval settlement success. OA-induced carry-over effects were evident, with lower settlement in larvae reared at reduced pH. Understanding the mechanisms behind these responses is key to fully comprehend the extent to which OA will affect marine organisms and the industries that rely on them. © 2020 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2020.

For species at risk, vulnerability can be reduced by ensuring that their habitat is extensive, connected and provides opportunities for dispersal and/or gene flow, facilitating a biological response through migration or adaptation. For woodland epiphytes, vulnerability might also be reduced by ensuring sufficient habitat heterogeneity, so that microhabitats provide suitable local microclimates, even as the larger scale climate continues to change (i.e. microrefugia). This study used fuzzy set ordination to compare bryophyte and lichen epiphyte community composition to a large-scale gradient from an oceanic to a relatively more continental macroclimate. The residuals from this relationship identified microhabitats in which species composition reflected a climate that was more oceanic or more continental than would be expected given the prevailing macroclimate. Comparing these residuals to features that operate at different scales to create the microclimate (landscape, stand and tree-scale), it was possible to identify how one might engineer microrefugia into existing or new woodland, in order to reduce epiphyte vulnerability to climate change. Multimodel inference was used to identify the most important features for consideration, which included local effects such as height on the bole, angle of bole lean and bark water holding capacity, as well as tree species and tree age, and within the landscape, topographic wetness and physical exposure.

While distillate residues from biomass pyrolysis oils can convert into calcined coke with promising elemental and physical properties, no studies have produced calcined biocoke continuously from rotary kilns. Using a solids feeder and rotary tube furnace, blends of green petroleum coke and biocoke underwent continuous calcination. The biocoke from pyrolysis bio-oil distillation residues contained ∼13 wt % oxygen. In control experiments, the furnace converted green petroleum coke into calcined petroleum coke within industry specifications. Properties measured include % anisotropy (indicated by polarized light microscopy), porosity, crystallite thickness (Lc), and trace element concentrations. With biocoke blends (10 and 27 wt %), the effects on properties increased with respect to the blend concentration. Microscopy and X-ray diffraction indicated the blends to be mostly anisotropic with some amorphous domains remaining in the blended product. Steady-state sulfur concentrations decreased from 3.2 to 2.7 wt %. Nickel and vanadium successfully decreased to desirable limits, especially when 27 wt % biocoke was used. Adding biocoke increased phosphorous and titanium concentrations by 5-7 and 10 ppm, respectively. Blending 27 wt % biocoke with green petroleum coke to produce calcined coke for aluminum smelting anodes can reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions and the acidification potential by 54 and 27%, respectively, avoiding the emission of ∼800 kg CO2e and 0.7 kg SO2e for each metric ton of primary aluminum produced. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","biomass; life cycle assessment; petroleum coke; pyrolysis; renewable resource","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Anisotropy; Anodes; Blending; Brickmaking; Calcination; Distillation; Furnaces; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Green manufacturing; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum industry; Pyrolysis; Trace elements; Aluminum industry; Biomass pyrolysis oil; Calcined petroleum cokes; Distillation residues; Nickel and vanadiums; Pyrolysis bio-oil; Sulfur concentrations; Trace element concentrations; Petroleum coke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099656656

Such impacts are likely to be higher in developing countries.This paper analyses the state of research on the nexus between climate change and food security in Burkina Faso. In particular, it sheds light on whether and how the scholarly literature addresses the impacts of climate change on the four dimensions of food security (i.e. food availability, food access, food utilisation and stability). It also explores the synergies and trade-offs between climate change mitigation/adaptation and food security. A search performed in April 2020 on the Web of Science yielded 243 records and 62 of them, which resulted eligible, were included in the systematic review.The literature shows that climate change will affect all the four dimensions of food security. However, most of the analysed literature addresses its effects on food availability. Indeed, it focuses on impacts on crop yields and climate suitability for crops (e.g. maize, millet, sorghum). Moreover, most of the impacts on the remaining food security dimensions stem from the negative effects on food production and supply (cf. food availability).The review also shows that, on the one hand, climate change mitigation can undermine food security and, on the other hand, agriculture intensification and some adaptation strategies, which aim to enhance food security, might increase emissions from agriculture. The dual climate change—food security relationship calls for integrated policies that address trade-offs and optimise co-benefits between ‘climate action’ and ‘zero hunger’ in Burkina Faso. © CAB International 2021","Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Climate-smart agriculture; Food access; Food availability; Food system; Sahel; West Africa",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101310450

These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Tehran is one of the cities facing air pollution problem. Urban managers concern about choosing different management methods to control air pollution. In this study, a combination of fuzzy systems and neural networks has been used to select the most suitable scenario for controlling SO2 pollution. According to the method presented in this paper, 8 input data categories such as wind speed, precipitation, temperature, pressure, humidity, gas oil consumption, gasoline consumption and urban green space levels have been used as independent parameters and SO2 pollutant concentration has been considered as the dependent parameter. The contribution of each meteorological station to the meteorological data was determined by Thiessen Polygon Method. Then, using adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems, modeling was done in Sugeno Method and the least root mean square error (3.19) was determined for the model. Then, by changing each of the independent parameters, the effect of each of these independent parameters on SO2 pollutant was measured. The results showed that the parameters of pressure, urban green space, gasoline consumption, gas oil consumption, temperature, wind speed and humidity, respectively, had the greatest effect on reducing the SO2 concentration.

Therefore, it is crucial to continuously monitor the quality of the diesel exhaust fluid to secure the ideal selective catalytic reduction. This article presents a platinum thin-film sensor using the 3<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>ω</i></span> method which is able to characterize the diesel exhaust fluid. By means of the 3<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>ω</i></span> method, information about the concentration of urea in water can be extracted. In this investigation, a digital lock-in amplification technique is used to execute the measurements. The results show that this sensor can determine the urea content within 1 % by weight. Moreover, besides the analysis of the 3<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>ω</i></span> signal, the 1<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>ω</i></span> signal is analyzed in depth to receive additional information about the temperature.

One of the main causes of poor air quality is low emission, which arises at a short distance from the ground (up to 40 m). The real reduction of low emission requires a series of measures. The most important of them, include replacement of non-ecological boilers heating single-family buildings, improvement of thermal insulation of outer building walls, development of public transport, limiting the movement of old, non-ecological cars, conducting extensive educational activities, economic support for the poorest families in pro-ecological activities, and development of district heating in urban areas. The issue of thermal modernization is also important from the point of view of ensuring an appropriate level of energy security in the social dimension. The article presents a scenario analysis of activities aimed at reducing low emission through economic support for thermal modernization of single-family houses in the Lubuskie Voivodeship in Poland. The results of the conducted research prove that it is possible to carry out thermal modernization of over 12% of all single-family buildings in the Lubuskie voivodeship, assuming that the co-financing would amount to 60% of the costs of such an investment. The analyses carried out in the article are closely related to low carbon development, and a significant part of emission of harmful substances into the air comes from heating single-family buildings in urban and rural areas. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to save energy, in which electricity is the energy source with high demand and daily increasing. Residential electricity accounts for a large proportion of the total amount of electricity produced, thus if each individual can use electricity at home more effectively, it also means that we are slowing down the process of climate change. The feedback on the energy consumption of household appliances gives users a clearer view of daily electricity consumption, and this will help them to have more efficient ways to consume electricity. In this paper, the authors have built a system to monitor the on/off status and energy consumption of each electrical appliances in the house.

Our interest in free water surface evaporation is due to the needs of ongoing hydric recultivation of the former Ležáky-Most quarry, i.e., Lake Most, and also other planned hydric recultivations in the region. One of the key components of hydric reclamation planning is the securitization of long-term sustainability, which is based on the capability to keep the final water level at a stable level. In our work, we are interested in the evaporation estimation in the area of Lake Most (Czech Republic, Europe). This lake has been artificially created only a few years ago, and nowadays we are looking for a simple evaporation model, based on which we will be able to decide which measurement devices have to be installed at the location to provide more localized data to the model. In this paper, we calibrate state-of-the-art simplified evaporation models against the Penman-Monteith equation based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency maximization.

The real estate developers and consumers are essential participants in the development of LCBs. This paper explores whether the government’s implementation of the carbon tax will change their choices of LCBs. Evolutionary game models between developers and consumers are established under static and dynamic carbon taxes. Their evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) are deduced in different situations. According to the real scenarios in China, numerical simulations are further conducted to show that carbon tax influences the low-carbon behaviors of stakeholders in the construction industry. Under a static carbon tax, the two players cannot reach an equilibrium state, while the game system is stable under a dynamic tax. The probability of the developers constructing LCBs is positively related to the carbon tax, while its degree is gradually weakened as the tax rate increases. Therefore, an appropriate tax should be set to promote the development of LCBs effectively. Finally, policy implications are put forwarded to guide the participants’ low-carbon behaviors and reduce the carbon emissions in the Chinese construction industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Taking environmental and technical heterogeneities into account, this paper employed a meta-frontier method to measure the carbon emission efficiency, carbon mitigation potential, and costs of the construction sector in different regions of China from 2005 to 2016. The empirical results show that substantial disparities in carbon emission efficiency exist in the construction industry. The total carbon mitigation potential of this sector was 206.76 million tons, with the Lower Yellow river area accounting for the largest proportion at 27%. Meanwhile, the carbon mitigation costs of this sector increased from 584.94 to 1273.30 yuan/ton during 2005–2016. The highest mitigation costs occur in the Lower Yangtze River area and the South Coastal area, indicating it was more costly in these areas to conduct additional carbon emissions mitigation. The results could facilitate the policy formulation on regional-oriented carbon emissions mitigation of the construction industry in China. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission efficiency; Carbon mitigation costs; Construction industry; Directional output distance function; Meta-frontier analysis","carbon emission; construction industry; cost analysis; efficiency measurement; industrial emission; mitigation; pollution policy; China; Yangtze River; carbon; carbon dioxide; building industry; China; cost; river; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Construction Industry; Costs and Cost Analysis; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089604577

China is an improbable leader, but less improbable than the other three. No US president can close down the fossil fuel industry in time. The US state, worried about the slippage of its technological superiority, is turning to regulatory mechanisms like intellectual property to slow China’s technological development. China will have to manage the risk of a United States bent on military primacy. China is urbanizing innovation on a historically unprecedented scale. Lying at the heart of the bio-digital energy paradigm is a global city-based network of innovation. China, more than the other three states, is scaling technology innovation through the building of experimental cities such as eco-cities, hydrogen cities, forest cities, and sponge cities. The Belt and Road Initiative will take this innovation well outside of China’s borders. China could help to place cities into a new relationship with their surrounding ecosystems.

In the dysprosium-containing molybdates, the Dy3+ luminescence intensity is low as a result of concentration quenching. The molybdate containing the Eu + Dy pair of rare-earth elements shows predominant high-intensity luminescence in the red spectral region. In addition to usual infrared emission due to ytterbium, the Eu + Yb compound demonstrates emission in the ultraviolet spectral region. We have measured luminescence decay kinetic characteristics at the peak emission wavelengths. In the case of the molybdate containing the Eu + Yb pair of rare-earth elements, energy transfer from europium ions to ytterbium has been observed.

In this study, the performance of the farmland fertility algorithm (FFA) and that of the Harris hawks optimisation (HHO) algorithm were evaluated and compared with each other to solve the two-objective problem of optimal operation of the Golestan dam reservoir under baseline (April 2006 to October 2018) and climate change conditions (April 2021 to October 2033) in Golestan Province, Iran. The operation rules were extracted by minimising vulnerability and maximising reliability indices under both conditions. The results showed that when considering a constant value of the reliability index (i.e. 80%), the rate of vulnerability changes in the multi-objective FFA (Moffa) is lower than that of the multi-objective HHO (Mohho) algorithm. Therefore, Moffa has performed better than the Mohho algorithm in the optimal operation of the Golestan dam reservoir under both baseline and climate change conditions. On the other hand, the comparison of the optimum rules obtained under the baseline and climate change conditions showed that supplying the water demands would be more concordant with the optimum rules under climate change conditions in both optimisation algorithms.

The majority of these transformations are driven by the generation and subsequent reaction of radicals, owing to the intrinsic property of common photocatalysts to transfer single electrons from their excited state. While this is a powerful and elegant method to develop novel transformations, several research groups recently sought to further extend the toolbox of photocatalysis into the realm of polar ionic reactivity by the formation of cationic as well as anionic key reaction intermediates to furnish a desired product.Our group became especially interested in the photocatalytic formation of anionic carbon nucleophiles, as the overall transformation resembles classical organometallic reactions like Grignard, Barbier, and Reformatsky reactions, which are ubiquitous in organic synthesis with broad applications especially in the formation of valuable C-C bonds. Although these classical reactions are frequently applied, their use still bears certain disadvantages; one is the necessity of an (over)stoichiometric amount of a reducing metal. The reducing, low-valent, metal is solely applied to activate the starting material to form the organometallic carbanion synthon, while the final reaction product does generally not contain a metal species. Hence, a stoichiometric amount of metal salt is bound to be generated at the end of each reaction, diminishing the atom economy. The use of visible light as mild and traceless activation agent to drive chemical reactions can be a means to arrive at a more atom economic transformation, as a reducing metal source is avoided. Beyond this, the vast pool of photocatalytic activation methods offers the potential to employ easily available starting materials, as simple as unfunctionalized alkanes, to open novel and more facile retrosynthetic pathways. However, as mentioned above, photocatalysis is dominated by open-shell radical reactivity. With neutral radicals showing an intrinsically different reactivity than ionic species, novel strategies to form intermediates expressing a polar behavior need to be developed in order to achieve this goal.In the last couple of years, several methods toward this aim have been reported by our group and others. This Account aims to give an overview of the different existing strategies to photocatalytically form carbon centered anions or equivalents of those in order to form C-C bonds. As the main concept is to omit a stoichiometric reductant source (like a low-valent metal in classical organometallic reactions), only redox-neutral and reductant-free transformations were taken into closer consideration. We present selected examples of important strategies and try to illustrate the intentions and concepts behind the methods developed by our group and others. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099108472

In this study, changes in soil organic (SOC), inorganic (SIC), and total (TC) carbon; pH; total nitrogen (TN); and net ecosystem production (NEP) were measured in a conventional corn-soybean rotation in central Iowa.

Eddy-flux stations set up in the fields continuously monitored NEP from 2005–2016, and net biome production (NBP) was calculated using yield records. The DayCENT model was used to simulate the effects of conventional management practices on soil carbon and calibrated with field-measured NEP and SOC.

The benefits of trees in urban areas include the following: an increase in ecosystem health, an increase in human health, the mitigation of the effects of heat and drought at microclimate level, the storage and sequestration of carbon, and a reduction in air pollution and noise. These ecosystem services can be provided only by trees that are in good health. The main cause of salt stress in urban environments is the use of deicing salts on the streets in winter. Salt stress is a complex process that includes changes in plants on the physiological, histological, cellular and molecular levels, leading to limitations in nutrient uptake, disrupting the ionic balance of trees and resulting in the death of roadside trees. In response to salinity, trees have developed a variety of defence mechanisms that allow them to minimize the effects of stress and maintain homeostasis. Methodology. The reactions of two species Acer species: A. platanoides and A. campestre, which have different sensitivities to the unfavourable conditions of the urban environments (mainly salt stress), were investigated. The research included two experiments: a field experiment with city trees and a controlled pot experiment with young trees treated with increasing doses of salt. In both experiments, the following were performed: an assessment of the health condition of the trees and the content of macroelements as well as the Cl and Na in leaves and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of polyprenols. Results. A. campestre had a more specific strategy than A. platanoides for dealing with Na and Cl, which resulted in undamaged leaves. Under the same conditions, A. platanoides leaves contained more Cl and Na and were severely damaged. The disruption of the ion balance due to salt stress was lower in A. campestre than in A. platanoides. Compared with A. platanoides, A. campestre synthesized more polyprenols in the field experiment. This ability was acquired during the process of acclimation, because it occurred only in the mature trees in the field experiment and not in the young trees in the pot experiment. Conclusions. The use of two experimental methods (i.e., the field and pot experiments) allowed for a more complete assessment of tree strategies to mitigate salt stress. A. campestre displayed a more specific strategy than A. platanoides. This strategy was based on several elements. A. campestre limited Cl and Na transport to the leaves, which resulted in a lack of damage to those organs. Under the same conditions, A. platanoides individuals contained more Cl and Na in their leaves and were seriously damaged. A. campestre synthesized larger amounts of polyprenols, which probably have the ability to mitigate salt stress. This ability was acquired during the process of acclimation, because it occurred only in the mature trees in the field experiment and was not observed in the young trees in the pot experiment.

The objective is to unveil a governance framing that unmasks how cities shape their climate leadership discourse according to their governance aspirations and capacity. By looking at the adaptations across cities' discourses, this research acknowledges the need to confront the limitations and challenges that cities encounter to effectively contribute to global climate governance. It suggests that a governance framing exposes these challenges by showing the different realities of cities when they highlight particular governance modes in their discourse. The methodology combines critical discourse analysis and corpus techniques to analyse a total of 18 campaigns in different temporal, geographical and political contexts. EMW's discourse issued at European level is used as the reference corpus to examine how cities reframe their discourse by weakening or strengthening two governance modes characterised as an action-taking approach that focuses on the steering role of government, and a decision-making approach that highlights the city's interdependencies in a societal context. Learning more about discourse as a vindicator of governance modes in urban climate governance can contribute to a better understanding of how climate transitions are actually put into practise. The research suggests that climate leadership attributed to cities is in fact a complex and dynamic reality that has to be cautiously examined in order to understand the challenges of climate transitions. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","city; climate change; discourse; framing; governance","climate change; decision making; global climate; governance approach; state role; urban climate; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088826844

Respiratory settings were adjusted to induce respiratory acidosis with the adjunct of an external source of pure CO2 (target pre membrane lung venous PCO2 (PpreCO2): 80–120 mmHg). The amount of CO2 removed (VCO2, mL/min) by the membrane lung was assessed directly by the ECCO2R device. Results: Before the initiation of ECCO2R, the median PpreCO2 was 102.50 (95.30–118.20) mmHg. Using fixed incremental steps of the sweep gas flow and maintaining a fixed blood flow of 600 mL/min, VCO2 progressively increased from 0 mL/min (gas flow of 0 mL/min) to 170.00 (160.00–200.00) mL/min at a gas flow of 10 L/min. In particular, a high increase of VCO2 was observed increasing the gas flow from 0 to 2 L/min, then, VCO2 tended to progressively achieve a steady-state for higher gas flows. No animal or pump complications were observed. Conclusions: Medium-flow ECCO2R devices with a blood flow of 600 mL/min and a high surface membrane lung (1.8 m2 ) provided a high VCO2 using moderate sweep gas flows (i.e., &gt;2 L/min) in an experimental swine models with healthy lungs. © 2020 by the authors.

Intense cooling capacity has been reported under a variety of climates, however, there is a growing need to define specific design guidelines towards an informed and optimized use of the technology. Parametric analysis on validated models would assist in determining type and degree of correlation between key parameters, as well as magnitude and predictability of the cooling capacity. In this paper, for the first time, a 3D microclimatic model in ENVI-met is used to simulate a misting system installed in Rome, Italy, with high prediction accuracy for the air temperature (R2≃0.87, RMSE≃0.84 °C). The calibrated ENVI-met model is used then to perform parameterizations on the water mist system, focused on the role of three key design variables: i) water flow rate, ii) injection height and iii) local wind speed. Results show that the most significant thermal drops tend to occur close but out of the misted perimeter following the wind direction, with cooling effects further stretched for tens of meters. The cooling capacity increases with the total water flow rate (+0.2 °C per 10 l/h increment) and in presence of calm air (+35–40% per 0.8 m/s deceleration). Lower injections intensify the cooling a pedestrian height, which could be especially beneficial under windy conditions. Further research would target climate dependencies to extend the applicability of the above results and build up cohesive guidelines at the hands of urban planners and practitioners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ENVI-met; Evaporative cooling; Heat mitigation; Outdoor comfort; Urban climate; Water mist spray","Cost effectiveness; Flow of water; Hydraulics; Wind; Degree of correlations; Design variables; Experimental validations; Mitigation strategy; Parametric -analysis; Prediction accuracy; Water mist systems; Windy conditions; 3D modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097451575

Society creates ever increasing amounts of poly-urethane (PU) waste. A major part of this waste can be recycled or recovered in order to be put into further use. The PU industry is committed to assist and play its part in the process. The recycling and recovery of PU foam cover a range of mechanical, physical, chemical and thermo-chemical processes. In addition to the well-documented mechanical and chemical processing options, thermo-chemical treatments are important either as ultimate disposal (incineration) or towards feedstock recovery, leading to different products according to the thermal conditions of the treatment. The review focuses on these thermo-chemical and thermal processes. As far as pyrolysis is concerned, TDI and mostly polyol can be recovered. The highest recovery yields of TDI and polyols occur at low temperatures (150–200 °C). It is however clear from literature that pure feedstock will not be produced, and that a further upgrading of the condensate will be needed, together with a thermal or alternative treatment of the non-condensables. Gasification towards syngas has been studied on a larger and industrial scale. Its application would need the location of the PU treatment plant close to a chemical plant, if the syngas is to be valorized or considered in conjunction with a gas-fired CHP plant. Incineration has been studied mostly in a co-firing scheme. Potentially toxic emissions from PU combustion can be catered for by the common flue gas cleaning behind the incineration itself, making this solution less evident as a stand-alone option: the combination with other wastes (such as municipal solid waste) in MSWI's seems the indicated route to go. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Polyurethane foam; Recycling; Thermal degradation; Thermo-chemical treatment","aluminum; carbamic acid; flame retardant; isocyanate; polyol; polyurethan foam; urethan; polyurethan; polyurethan foam; combustion; condensate; exopolymer; foam; gas flow; incineration; polymer; pyrolysis; recycling; thermochemistry; Article; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; combustion; energy recovery; exhaust gas; flue gas; foam; gasification; incineration; low temperature; municipal solid waste; physical chemistry; pyrolysis; recycling; thermo chemical recycling; waste water treatment plant; solid waste; waste disposal; Chandipura virus; Incineration; Polyurethanes; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094147384

We investigated the role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) belonging to the CYP3 and CYP4 clans using colonies derived from individuals collected in 2016 from almond orchards in two counties. One colony (ALM) originated from an almond orchard in Madera County with no reported pyrethroid resistance and the second colony (R347) originated from the same Kern County orchard where pyrethroid resistance was first reported. We used high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses of 65 P450s in the CYP3 and CYP4 clans of A. transitella to identify P450s induced by bifenthrin and associated with pyrethroid resistance. Nine P450s were constitutively overexpressed in R347 compared to ALM, including CYP6AE54 (11.7-fold), belonging to a subfamily associated with metabolic pesticide detoxification in Lepidoptera and CYP4G89 (33-fold) belonging to a subfamily associated with cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) synthesis and resistance via reduced pesticide penetrance. Cuticular hydrocarbons analysis revealed that R347 produced twice as many total CHCs in the egg and adult stages as ALM. Topical toxicity bioassays for R347 determined that egg mortality was reduced at low bifenthrin concentrations and larval mortality was reduced at high concentrations of bifenthrin compared to ALM. Our discovery of both changes in metabolism and production of CHCs for R347 have implications for the possible decreased efficacy of other classes of insecticide used to control this insect. The threat of widespread pyrethroid resistance combined with the potential for cross-resistance to develop through the mechanism of reduced penetrance warrants developing management strategies that facilitate insecticide passage across the cuticle. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

While there are political, social and economic factors that impact agricultural development, this paper will not be focusing on those factors, instead focusing on the potential use of cover crops as a nutrient management tool, a soil and water conservation practice, and a good approach to adapting to a changing climate. The potential of using cover crops for climate change adaptation and mitigation will be reviewed. Cover crops are a key tool that could contribute to increased yields, conservation of surface and groundwater quality, reduced erosion potential, sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C), and improved soil quality and health across the tropics. However, there are a lot of research gaps, and there is a need for additional research about the potential use of cover crops for soil, human, and animal health, as well as a need for an open-access data information system about research on cover crops in the tropics. While cover crops show a lot of promise, they are not a silver bullet, and in some circumstances, they can also contribute to reduced yields. We evaluated the use of cover crops and we ranked the different ways that cover crops can contribute to climate change adaptation, on a scale ranging from very low potential to contribute to climate change adaptation to very high potential. For example, cover crops have very high potential to reduce erosion generated by a changing climate in humid systems. On average, cover crops appear to be a good practice for climate change adaptation and mitigation across the tropics, and nutrient managers, agronomists, and soil and water conservation practitioners could add them to their management toolbox for different regions of the tropics. The 4 Rs of cover crops should be applied when using this tool (the right cover crop, the right timing of placement, the right timing of killing, and the right management). © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Cropping systems; Nematode management; Nitrate leaching; Nitrogen management; Soil health; Soil quality; Water quality; Weed management",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096117881

Little is known, however, about the environmental determinants of plant pathogen communities. Therefore, we explored the impact of climate gradients and anthropogenic disturbance on root-associated pathogens in grasslands. We examined the community structure of two pathogenic groups—fungal pathogens and oomycetes—in undisturbed and anthropogenically disturbed grasslands across a natural precipitation and temperature gradient in the Midwestern USA. In undisturbed grasslands, precipitation and temperature gradients were important predictors of pathogen community richness and composition. Oomycete richness increased with precipitation, while fungal pathogen richness depended on an interaction of precipitation and temperature, with precipitation increasing richness most with higher temperatures. Disturbance altered plant pathogen composition and precipitation and temperature had a reduced effect on pathogen richness and composition in disturbed grasslands. Because pathogens can mediate plant community diversity and structure, the sensitivity of pathogens to disturbance and climate suggests that degradation of the pathogen community may mediate loss, or limit restoration of, native plant diversity in disturbed grasslands, and may modify plant community response to climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"anthropogenic effect; climate change; community response; community structure; grassland; pathogen; plant community; species diversity; species richness; temperature gradient; United States; biodiversity; fungus; genetics; grassland; microbiology; plant; soil; Biodiversity; Fungi; Grassland; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091606810

Machado, Toulouse Cedex 9, 31058, France","In the lower Rhône Valley, many sites are attributed to the Early Neolithic and dated between 5600 and 4800 cal. BC. According to their ceramic production, they are associated with two cultural facies: the Cardial and the Epicardial. The relation between these two entities is still under debate (chronological, cultural or functional distinctions?). However, little is known about the lithic production of the region since the chipped stone industries are rarely evoked in the socioeconomic and cultural understanding of these first agropastoral societies. The objective of this paper is to propose a regional synthesis regarding Early Neolithic lithic industries, based on typo-technological studies of several assemblages in the Rhône Valley: The Montclus rockshelter (layers 5 to 2), the Baume de Ronze rockshelter, Le Taï and the Aigle cave. These sites are considered to be the key sites for understanding the Cardial/Epicardial complex in this area, but their lithic assemblages have never been thoroughly studied. Special attention will be given to the factors of variability or, on the contrary, to the permanence in the ""schema opératoire""and we will propose explanations related to geological, functional, chronological and cultural constraints. We will also focus on lithic blade production made from honey flint and the spacialisation of ""chaine opératoire""which could highlight circulation of this raw material and specialised distribution network. Finally, this synthesis is based on a renewed corpus of radiocarbon dates in order to understand this evolutionary dynamic as finely as possible. © 2021 Elsa Defranould, published by De Gruyter.","cardial; epicardial; lithic industry; Neolithisation; southern France",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116145916

However, solar energy penetration in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its capital Sarajevo, is not in line with the possibilities. Furthermore, the Sarajevo Canton is extremely polluted during the winter months because of the use of unacceptable heating fuel. The aim of this paper is to introduce photovoltaic power systems use in heating electrification system. In this paper AQI is calculated based on historical data and the hybrid model EMD-SARIMA for air pollution and a solar production forecast is presented. The methodology was tested in the Sarajevo Canton, taking into account 35,000 households. In order to ensure clean air, renewable electric energy use for household heating should be implemented. The widespread use of inefficient individual heating systems characterized by inefficient and expensive use of firewood and the use of coal in individual furnaces in populated areas are the main problems of internal and urban air pollution in Sarajevo Canton. In order to reduce energy poverty in Sarajevo Canton, the use of a floating photovoltaic power plant located on Lake Jablanica with a capacity of 30 MW and the solar prosumers with capacity of 115 MW to provide the 196 GWh necessary for heating electrification of 35,000 households is implemented in this paper. Finally, based on correlation between AQI forecast and solar production it was calculated that the values of the AQI, considering the application of solar energy during 150 days (five months) in one heating season, have significantly decreased. Also renewable energy sources have a very important role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions into the atmosphere and reducing urban pollution. With this approach, households would be heated by renewable electricity, which would make Sarajevo a cleaner, smarter city. © 2020 by the authors.

A key element to overcoming some of these barriers is effective communication of complex scientific information. The use of visualizations, such as photographs or interactive maps, can increase knowledge dissemination, helping community members understand climatic and environmental changes. These techniques have been utilized in many disciplines but have not been widely embraced by climate change scholars. This paper discusses the utility of climate change data visualization as a tool for climate change knowledge mobilization. This paper draws on the case studying drivers of coastline change of Lake Ontario in the Town of Lincoln, Ontario, Canada. Historical aerial photographs were used to measure the rate of coastline change and visualize vulnerable sections of the coast. To better visualize the changes that occurred over time from a resident viewpoint, selected land-based historical photographs were replicated by taking new photographs at the same locations. These visualization tools can be useful to support the community in developing strategies to adapt to climate change by increasing understanding of the changes and knowledge through social learning. These tools can be generalized to other case studies dealing with community engagement in coastal adaptation efforts. © 2021 DeCock-Caspell and Vasseur.

Implicit in this number is the conventional wisdom among many communicators that increasing people's understanding, awareness, concern or even fear of climate change are necessary precursors for action and behavior change. In this article we review scientific theories of mind and brain that explain why this conventional view is flawed. In real life, the relationship between beliefs and behavior often goes in the opposite direction: our actions change our beliefs, awareness and concerns through a process of self-justification and self-persuasion. As one action leads to another, this process of self-persuasion can go hand in hand with a deepening engagement and the development of agency - knowing how to act. One important source of agency is learning from the actions of others. We therefore propose an approach to climate communication and storytelling that builds people's agency for climate action by providing a wide variety of stories of people taking positive action on climate change. Applied at scale, this will shift the conceptualization of climate change from 'issue-based' to 'action-based'. It will also expand the current dominant meanings of 'climate action' (i.e. 'consumer action' and 'activism') to incorporate all relevant practices people engage in as members of a community, as professionals and as citizens. We close by proposing a systematic approach to get more reference material for action-based stories from science, technology and society to the communities of storytellers - learning from health communication and technologies developed for COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).

The role played by meso-institutions has hardly been addressed. This article draws on recent institutionalist approaches which introduce meso-institutions as a third layer of the analysis. Meso-institutions on the adoption of environmental technologies is the focus of attention. The Brazilian policy on climate change offered an opportunity for this investigation. Different meso-institutions were created or adjusted to accelerate and monitor the actions and targets of the Brazilian Low Carbon Agriculture Plan. The effects of these meso-institutions on both farmers’ decision to adopt Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems (ICLS) and farms performance were estimated through a Simultaneous Equation System (SES). The analyses were based on a survey sample of 175 farmers from the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Our main results corroborate the hypothesis that meso-institutions are of utmost importance to improve resource utilization by the farmers. Economic incentives, risk reduction, capacity building and knowledge sharing provided by meso-institutions had significant impacts on the probability of adopting ICLS and on farms performance. These results suggest that meso-institutions can foster a favorable environment for the adoption of more sustainable technologies at farm-level. The paper innovates in the use of SES to investigate the impacts of meso-institutions on resource allocation decisions of Brazilian cattle farmers.

Climate information often remains underutilized and even when used, its influence on policy making is far from clear. In the Netherlands, climate stress tests were introduced to inform and stimulate climate adaptation policy on a municipal level. In the stress tests, risks and vulnerabilities were estimated for scenarios of extreme precipitation, heat stress, drought, and flooding. This article examines whether and how this new tool has effectuated mainstreaming of climate adaptation information into municipal policy. Based on interviews with municipal officials and document analysis we show that the stress tests did so along two general pathways. In the ‘applied’ pathway, the stress tests were used in an instrumental way to influence policy goals and measures. In the ‘configuring’ pathway, stress tests were primarily used for learning and persuasion, and mostly influenced problem perceptions and actor involvement. In the ‘applied’ pathway, the accuracy and resolution of the information were key factors; in the ‘configuring’ pathway, its influence depended on the accessibility of information and the kind of interaction during policy formulation. Which of the pathways predominated depended on how an adaptation problem fitted with existing policy arrangements. The findings show that stress tests are a promising tool for policy mainstreaming and for promoting local climate adaptation. They also highlight the importance of identifying the pathways of information use, in order to increase the impact of climate information. © 2021","Climate adaptation; Climate information use; Dutch municipalities; Mainstreaming; Stress tests",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106455067

Some international organizations and governments are integrating processes on forced eviction of urban residents into policies that are primarily designed to manage displacements due to climate change and disasters—such as Vanuatu’s 2018 National Policy on Climate Change and Disaster-Induced Displacement. Purpose: This article contextualizes the classification of evictions as “disasters.” We argue that evictions are not disasters and should not be so classified. We make these arguments from an empirical position, based on community response to the declaration of eviction as disaster, and also from the perspective of international law. Approach and Methods: Our data come from the following sources:. Communities: We use a storytelling method to interview around 100 women and men. The policy: We review the language of the Vanuatu policy in the context of international guidance on displacement generally and on forced eviction specifically. Public records: We use court records and newspaper reporting to understand claims of government, land claimants and survivors. Policy-makers: A limited number of unofficial conversations with policy-makers inform this work. Findings: Urban forced evictions should not be treated as “disasters” in policy on forced displacement. Our interviewees identify the equation of eviction and “disaster” as one that removes the agency of the government to protect their human rights. The evidence presented here suggests that the Government of Vanuatu does not have sufficient powers to intervene in some forced evictions from customary land. This raises critical questions about whether the government will be able to fulfil the promises made in the policy and in its obligations under international law relating to displacement. Policy Implications: Classifying forced evictions together with land conflicts, infrastructure and development as potential “crises,” and so “disastrous,” as the Vanuatu policy does, creates a new set of challenges that must now be managed as the policy is operationalized. This includes serious consideration of how countries that take this path will fulfil their obligations to protect against, avoid and minimize displacement, in the context of customary land, and meet other international policy standards, in order to ensure no one is left worse off nor denied the benefit of development opportunity. This is a timely issue for peer countries. Right now, other Pacific countries, like the Solomon Islands, are looking to Vanuatu’s example to develop internal displacement policies of their own. © The Authors 2020.

Groundwater-dominated systems are sustained by underground aquifers that are recharged by rain that has fallen in the distant past, while surface water-dominated systems are fed by recent local rain or floods. Some waterbodies are fed by a mixture of these sources. Perennial, groundwater-dominated systems will act as refuges and refugia under future rainfall declines associated with global warming. We sought to identify climate refugia, based on groundwater dominance, by using isotope hydrology to characterise water samples collected by citizen scientists across arid central Australia. There is a linear relationship between hydrogen isotopes (2H/1H, δ2H) and oxygen isotopes (18O/16O, δ18O) in rainfall. This relationship is known as the meteoric water line (MWL). By comparing our samples with the Australian MWL, and developing a local evaporation line, we were able to test the hypotheses that groundwater-dominated systems will follow the Australian MWL while temporary systems follow the local evaporation line, and, accordingly, distinguish between groundwater and surface water-dominated systems. The isotopic composition of samples collected over a 36-month period was determined using isotope ratio infrared spectrometry. The electrical conductivity of each sample was recorded to determine where freshwater is available for biota within this arid region. Over 240 water samples were collected from 62 waterbodies and seven bores (groundwater wells) spanning an area of more than 250,000 km2. Approximately 75% of the samples were collected by citizen scientists and 25% by research scientists. Twenty groundwater-dominated waterbodies, characterised by a small range of δ2H and δ18O values (c. −55 to −20‰ and c. −9 to −3‰, respectively) clustered around the long-term mean composition of rainfall (δ2H = −37.5‰, δ18O = −6.4‰), were identified as future evolutionary refugia. These sites are likely to contain water through the most severe of droughts and will be critically important for the persistence of water-dependent species. Based on their isotopic composition, we identified 45 waterbodies (rockholes/waterholes) as temporary or ephemeral (δ2H c. −40 to −100‰ and δ18O c. −4 to +25‰), that is, with no evidence of groundwater inflow. These, together with waterbodies supported by a mix of groundwater and surface water, can act as stepping stones and form part of the aquatic mosaic that is critical to supporting species in arid regions. Over two-thirds of the waterholes sampled were very fresh (electrical conductivity &lt;0.8 mS/cm), indicating that they provide the freshwater needed to support much of the regional aquatic and terrestrial fauna. All evolutionary refugia are located within protected areas (i.e. national parks or Indigenous Protected Areas), but some are subject to the impacts of feral animal species and invasive plants. Our findings indicate where control programmes and restoration actions can be prioritised to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation. Our approach, combining citizen science and isotope hydrology, can be used to identify future refugia in other remote and arid regions where water scarcity is likely to increase under global climate change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biodiversity conservation; climate change adaptation; springs; temporary waters; water sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089108452

This paper presents a new decision-support model-the BAR-HAP Tool-that is aimed at guiding planning of policy interventions to accelerate transitions towards cleaner cooking fuels and technologies. The conceptual model behind BAR-HAP lies in a framework of costs and benefits that is holistic and comprehensive, allows consideration of multiple policy interventions (subsidies, financing, bans, and behavior change communication), and realistically accounts for partial adoption and use of improved cooking technology. It incorporates evidence from recent efforts to characterize the relevant set of parameters that determine those costs and benefits, including those related to intervention effectiveness. Practical aspects of the tool were modified based on feedback from a pilot testing workshop with multisectoral users in Nepal. To demonstrate the functionality of the BAR-HAP tool, we present illustrative calculations related to several cooking transitions in the context of Nepal.

Researchers typically ignore the large degree of uncertainty translated from climate projections to the estimated climate change magnitudes while applying pre-processing approaches on climate change projections. General Circulation Models (GCM) exhibit substantial uncertainty in projecting future changes in the seasonal temperature, which is evaluated by estimating the shift in either the mean or variance. Bias between the observed changes (1950–1999) and GCM simulated changes vary across models, climate regions, seasons, and under emission scenarios. The simplest approach to reduce model structural uncertainty, equal weighting of GCMs, does not consider superiority of one or multiple GCMs compared to the rest. The current study adopts a performance-based model combination approach that has shown efficiency in streamflow and weather forecasting, and GCM precipitation simulation. The optimal model combination approach has been modified to combine multi-model climate change information, while yielding the spatial correlation in climate change information within a geographic region. The optimal model combination approach, along with a simple bias-correction, is applied on 10 GCMs over nine climate regions across the coterminous United States (CONUS). We found that the optimal combination exhibits lower RMSE values as compared to the equal combination. Correlations between the model combined projections under optimal combination and the observed changes are strong and positive (>0.5). Future (2000–49) model combined projections exhibit an increase in the mean seasonal temperature by 2°C for winter and by 1°C for summer over almost all climate regions. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; equal weighting; GCM; genetic algorithm; model combination; seasonal temperature","Climate models; Uncertainty analysis; Weather forecasting; Climate change projections; Degree of uncertainty; General circulation model; Mean seasonal temperatures; Model structural uncertainties; Multi-model combination; Performance-based models; Seasonal temperature changes; Climate change; air temperature; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate prediction; computer simulation; correlation; genetic algorithm; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092790920

The biofuels, produced from food crops are restricted in their capacity to accomplish biofuel generation targets, mitigation of climate change and socio-economic development. These issues have exaggerated the curiosity in flourishing biofuels generated from non-food feedstocks like agricultural wastes, forest wastes, municipal wastes, and microalgae, which substantially offer golden opportunities in the longer run. The anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residues is the potential alternate of energy production (357.85 bcm biomethane) and has the capability of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) (979 Mt CO2 eq. per year). This makes it a potential contributor to attain climate neutrality by 2050. However, the various physical, structural and compositional factors impeding the hydrolysis of agricultural residues in AD are to be eliminated. Conjoint application of biological pretreatment with other pretreatment approaches has proven to be more efficacious than applying individually. Furthermore, the well-planned policies are vital in making the AD technology adoption viable and successful. The policies regarding bioenergy production must make sure to supply food and feed items sustainably by the agricultural sector.

Consequently, governance models that integrate collaboration among diverse stakeholders are seen as crucial in increasing adaptation efforts around the world. However, at present, there is little insight into the mechanics of collaborative adaptation governance (CAG) at the local, regional, national or global levels. Drawing on collaborative governance theory and literature on climate change adaptation, we use multiple qualitative research methods to identify and explore CAG in Northern Ghana. We examine the conceptualization and implementation of CAG projects as well as the motivation behind them and their ensuing benefits. Results show that perceived climatic changes, diminishing agricultural livelihoods, adaptation resource needs and opportunities largely drive CAG. Local state actors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide leadership in CAG, bridging gaps in access to adaptation resources through the provision of agricultural inputs, climate services, infrastructure and human capacity development. However, in parallel to these, there exist interwoven governance challenges that include questions of trust, commitment, transparency, accountability and the representation of diverse interests. We demonstrate how powerful state actors and NGOs set the agenda, frame problems, and implement rules and incentives that are contrary to the normative tenets of collaborative governance theory. Ultimately, the results of this study shows that CAG is attempted but the challenges of CAG in Northern Ghana are large, while also providing insight into the extent to which CAG approaches can facilitate adaptation to climate change globally. © 2021 The Authors","Adaptive capacity; Climate change adaptation; Collaborative governance theory; Northern Ghana; State and non-state actors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103721740

However, the sensing and imaging of lipid organization specifically in different organelles of live cells remain challenging. Here, we designed an array of solvatochromic probes based on Nile Red bearing ligands for specific targeting of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lysosomes, Golgi apparatus, plasma membranes, and lipid droplets. These polarity-sensitive probes detected variations in the lipid order by changing their emission maximum, as evidenced by fluorescence spectroscopy in model membranes. In colocalization microscopy experiments with reference organelle markers, they exhibited good organelle selectivity. Using two-color fluorescence microscopy, the new probes enabled imaging of the local polarity of organelles in live cells. To exclude the biased effect of the probe design on the sensitivity to the membrane properties, we calibrated all probes in model membranes under the microscope, which enabled the first quantitative description of the lipid order in each organelle of interest. Cholesterol extraction/enrichment confirmed the capacity of the probes to sense the lipid order, revealing that organelles poor in cholesterol are particularly affected by its enrichment. The probes also revealed that oxidative and mechanical stresses produced changes in the local polarity and lipid order that were characteristic for each organelle, with mitochondria and lysosomes being particularly stress sensitive. The new probes constitute a powerful toolbox for monitoring the response of the cells to physical and chemical stimuli at the level of membranes of individual organelles, which remains an underexplored direction in cellular research. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Cell membranes; Cell proliferation; Cholesterol; Cytology; Fluorescence imaging; Fluorescence microscopy; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Mitochondria; Stresses; Endoplasmic reticulum; Fluorescent probes; Mechanical stress; Membrane properties; Organelle selectivity; Quantitative description; Sensing and imaging; Solvatochromic probes; Probes; 2,3,4,5,6 pentafluoro n [37 oxo 41 (5 oxo 5h benzo[a] phenoxazin 9 yl) 6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33 undecaoxa 36,41 diazatritetracontyl]benzamide; 4 [ethyl (5 oxo 5h benzo[a]phenoxazin 9 yl)amino] n (3 morpholinopropyl)butanamide; cholesterol; fat droplet; fluorescent dye; lipid; n (2 aminoethyl)dodecanamide; n (3 chloropropyl) 4 [ethyl (5 oxo 5h benzo[a]phenoxazin 9 yl)amino]butanamide; n (35 amino 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33 undecaoxapentatriacontyl) 2,3,4,5,6 pentafluorobenzamide; n [2 [4 [ethyl (5 oxo 5h benzo[a]phenoxazin 9 yl)amino]butanamido]ethyl]tetradecanamide; n,n dicyclohexyl 4 [ethyl (5 oxo 5h benzo[a]phenoxazin 9 yl)amino]butanamide; nile red; tert butyl [1 oxo 1 (perfluorophenyl) 5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35 undecaoxa 2 azaheptatriacontan 37 yl]carbamate; tert butyl(2 dodecanamidoethyl)carbamate; unclassified drug; [3 [4 [ethyl(5 oxo 5h benzo[a]phenoxazin 9 yl)amino] butanamido]propyl]triphenylphosphonium; fluorescent dye; lipid; Article; cell membrane; cell organelle; cell polarity; controlled study; drug structure; drug synthesis; endoplasmic reticulum; extraction; fluorescence microscopy; Golgi complex; imaging; live cell imaging; lysosome; mechanical stress; mitochondrion; oxidative stress; spectrofluorometry; cell organelle; chemical structure; chemistry; fluorescence imaging; human; mechanical stress; oxidation reduction reaction; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Lipids; Molecular Structure; Optical Imaging; Organelles; Oxidation-Reduction; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100039847

Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between cholinergic basal forebrain gray matter density (GMD) and gait in PD patients. Methods: We investigated 66 PD patients who underwent a pre-surgical evaluation for a neurosurgical procedure to treat motor symptoms of PD. As part of this evaluation patients had a brain MRI and formal gait assessments. By applying probabilistic maps of the cholinergic basal forebrain to voxel-based morphometry of brain MRI, we calculated gray matter density (GMD) for cholinergic nucleus 4 (Ch4), cholinergic nucleus 1, 2, and 3 (Ch123), and the entire cortex. Results: Reduced Ch4 GMD was associated with reduced Fast Walking Speed in the “on” medication state (FWSON, p = 0.004). Bilateral cortical GMD was also associated with FWSON (p = 0.009), but Ch123 GMD was not (p = 0.1). Bilateral cortical GMD was not associated with FWSON after adjusting for Ch4 GMD (p = 0.44). While Ch4 GMD was not associated with improvement in Timed Up and Go (TUG) or Cognitive TUG in the “on” medication state, reduced Ch4 GMD was associated with greater percent worsening based on dual tasks (p = 0.021).

Reversible oxidation of PTPs is counteracted by reductive enzymes, including thioredoxin (Trx) and Trx-related protein of 14 kDa (TRP14), keeping PTPs in their reduced active states. Different modes of oxidative inactivation of PTPs concomitant with assessment of activating reduction have been little studied in direct comparative analyses. Determining PTP1B activities, we here compared the potency of inactivation by bicarbonate-assisted oxidation using H2O2 with that of polysulfide-mediated inactivation. Inactivation of pure PTP1B was about three times more efficient with polysulfides as compared to the combination of bicarbonate and H2O2 . Bicarbonate alone had no effect on PTP1B, neither with nor without a combination with polysulfides, thus strengthening the notion that bicarbonate-assisted H2O2-mediated inactivation of PTP1B involves formation of peroxymono-carbonate. Furthermore, PTP1B was potently protected from polysulfide-mediated inactivation by either TRP14 or Trx1, in contrast to the inactivation by bicarbonate and H2O2 . Comparing reductive activation of polysulfide-inactivated PTP1B with that of bicarbonate-and H2O2-treated enzyme, we found Trx1 to be more potent in reactivation than TRP14. Altogether we conclude that inactivation of PTP1B by polysulfides displays striking qualitative differences compared to that by H2O2 together with bicarbonate, also with regard to maintenance of PTP1B activity by either Trx1 or TRP14. © 2021 by the authors.

The authors perform an assessment of the potential transition of the municipality of Rome to a more sustainable transport system, based on the economic feasibility of production of biomethane as analysed with the Discounted Cash Flow methodology. The potential reduction of emissions is quantified considering biomethane, to be used as vehicle fuel instead of natural gas. The provision of subsidies is found to be an essential condition to support the development of the biomethane sector. The subsidies must be coordinated with other policies such as the construction and operation of new fuelling stations and the increase of vehicles fuelled by biomethane. Several economic indicators are used to support investors by defining the conditions in which the profitability and economic opportunities are quantified. The transformation of bio-wastes into clean energy, closes the loop and helps societies to make progress toward becoming circular economies, which can contribute to decarbonizing the transport sector.

Public offices – including universities – are being called to participate in the solar energy transition, as the availability of their rooftops represents an opportunity. The present study aimed at evaluating the economic feasibility of a photovoltaic (PV) plant at the University of L'Aquila, approximately 10 years after an earthquake devastated the region. The reconstruction process is ongoing, and a solar PV plant could potentially move the city in a sustainable direction. The development of sustainability models requires the economic verification of relevant projects and a complete list of indicators for decision-makers. The present work found that a 210 kW PV plant at the University of L'Aquila would reduce emissions by 184.9 t CO2eq/year and generate 1500 € profits for each kW installed; and a 115 kW PV plant would reduce emissions by 101.5 t CO2eq/year and generate profits of 1370 € for each kW installed. The analysis of alternative scenarios gave solidity to the results, confirming the pivotal role of the share of self-consumed energy. Level of insolation and plant size were also found to significantly influence economic performance.

Significant advances have already been achieved in understanding how some characteristics of copper electrodes, the current state-of-the-art catalyst for multi‑carbon formation via CO2RR, affect the product spectrum. Advances and insights have been reported for, among others, the effect of crystallographic orientation, active surface area, and composition of M‑copper (M = Au, Ag, Zn, etc.) materials, and how these alter the distribution of CO2RR products. However, a systematic study evaluating the significance of these variables in the CO2RR to C2+ products is still lacking in the literature and represents an important step in the development of new materials with optimized properties that can be more selective to C2+ compounds. In this paper, we have systematically investigated the effect of the roughness factor, chemical composition, and surface morphology of CuxZny electrocatalysts on the product distribution during CO2RR. Firstly, Cu, Cu90Zn10, and Cu75Zn25 electrodes were exposed to oxidation-reduction cycles to produce Cu and CuxZny electrodes with different morphologies, roughness factors, and chemical composition. Our results show that an increase in the roughness factor and Zn content lead to higher faradaic efficiency (FE) to C2+ products. Furthermore, the influence of the nanoscale morphology is imperative for the production of C2+ compounds. Specifically, nanocubes of Cu and CuxZny presented the highest FE to C2+ products among the different surface morphologies studied in this work (polished flat surface, nanosheres, nanocubes, nanodendrites, and nanocauliflowers), showing that C–C coupling during CO2RR is mainly shape dependent. © 2020 The Author(s)","CO2 electroreduction; Cu; CuZn; Roughness factor; Shape","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Morphology; Surface morphology; Surface roughness; Active surface area; Chemical compositions; Copper electrodes; Crystallographic orientations; Faradaic efficiencies; Nanoscale morphology; Oxidation reduction cycles; Product distributions; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099611579

While adaptation responses are generally recognised to be place-based, policy processes on adaptation often reside with central (state or national) governments that may be remote from regional communities. In this paper, we contribute to the literature regarding how diverse regional communities engage with planning and policy for climate adaptation, which is important for successful implementation. We adopt a social network analysis (SNA) approach that enables an exploration of the interaction of community networks with policy information. There are limited empirical studies of information sharing about climate adaptation policy through community knowledge networks. One previous study, located in coastal New South Wales, Australia, mapped the community’s knowledge acquisition and diffusion to reveal the underlying network structures that influenced policy engagement pathways. However, further studies are needed to determine how the features of community networks may change with local context (e.g., coastal versus inland). This paper extends previous studies to compare and contrast adaptation knowledge networks in three NSW communities: Shoalhaven (the original coastal study site), Bega (coastal) and Orange (inland). Findings suggest that the presence of a natural resource-dependent industry, local geographies and boundary spanners acting as network knowledge brokers are factors influencing community knowledge flows. The work further demonstrates the utility of SNA to measure knowledge networks that can inform government engagement and communication with communities on climate adaptation policy. © 2021 by the authors.

Different renewal strategies, such as redevelopment, refurbishment and conservation, not only contributes to quality improvement and energy consumption reduction of dilapidated urban area, but also to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation. Such integrated benefits are often termed as co-bene-fits. However, choosing the most co-benefits strategy to adopt requires a holistic understanding of social-economic and environmental aspects, which has been less reported in the existing literature. Under such circumstance, this article aims to shed light on the co-benefits of different renewal strategies by adopting the Emergy-Life cycle assessment method. Then, the method is applied to one case study of the refurbishment of an educational building located in Chongqing, China. Resource allocation, CO2 emissions and emergy-based indicators are calculated to assess the co-benefits during a 60-year research period, to compare the impacts of the complete demolition followed by a new one (rebuilding strategy) and the refurbishing of the existing building (refurbishment strategy). The case study shows that the annual emergy in the O&M phase of rebuilding strategy and refurbishment strategy were lower than existing building. Rebuilding and refurbishment strategies released approximately 59.1% and 80.6%, respectively, of the total CO2 emissions that would be produced by the existing building. The results reveal that substantial environmental benefits can be obtained in both the refurbishment and rebuilding strategies. On the other hand, it can be concluded that the emergy yield ratio (EYR) for the rebuilding strategy is higher than refurbishment strategy, which demonstrate the better performance of refurbishment considering that less resources are required to generate greater benefits. In addition, the value of environmental loading ratio (ELR) and emergy sustainability index (ESI) also suggests that the refurbishment strategy performs better from the perspective of the environment. Thereby, the refurbishment strategy is more suitable than the rebuilding strategy. Findings from this study can be useful to urban planners and decision-makers in choosing the most suitable strategy to improve the quality of existing buildings. © 2021 by the authors.

However, current studies do not reveal the macro patterns of the evolution of cities. This work uses the evolution-based city emission scenario (ECES) model, which tracks the city evolution patterns by probability methods based on multiple cities’ emissions of different periods, to reveal the underlying evolution rules of cities’ CO2 emissions. By the K-means clustering method, five clusters of cities are divided, and the evolution patterns of the city clusters are analyzed.

The main objective of this work was to study how variegation, pigment composition or reflective features modifies leaves' photophysical behavior. For this purpose, green leaves (Ficus benjamina), purple leaves (Tradescantia pallida), green leaves covered by white trichomes (Cineraria maritima) and variegated leaves (Codiaeum aucubifolium) were analyzed. Firstly, foliar surface morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. UV-vis and near-IR reflectance and transmittance spectra were obtained to calculate absorption (k) and scattering (s) coefficients. The theoretical approaches of Pile of Plates and Kubelka–Munk's theory resulted still valid for nonstandard leaves with differing surface conditions. However, frequently used spectral indices were not reliable for predicting water content, when leaves differed from conventional ones. The proportionality between the absorption factor and chromophore/pigment concentration was also lost for hairy leaves. A simplified model to describe these facts was presented here. Fluorescence spectra were recorded and corrected, due to light re-absorption. Water-optical parameter connection and pigment-optical parameter connection were thoroughly discussed. Leaf surface morphology and pigmentation have not only influenced the optical features of leaves but also played a role in the effect that particulate matter could cause on leaf photosynthesis. © 2020 American Society for Photobiology",,"classification; fluorescence; light; particulate matter; physiology; pigmentation; plant; plant leaf; species difference; surface property; Fluorescence; Light; Particulate Matter; Pigmentation; Plant Leaves; Plants; Species Specificity; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085355180

The paper focuses on the issue of existing hotels, with the aim of investigating the possibility of meeting the ambitious zero-carbon targets for this category of buildings, in which guests’ comfort and satisfaction is the core business. A reference hotel and different retrofit scenarios are assessed in two Italian climatic zones. Models are evaluated with a multi-objective approach, by introducing a set of hotel-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), to evaluate the simulated models on three main dimensions: thermal comfort, energy and environmental impacts. The obtained results have emphasized the difficulty to achieve the zero-carbon targets, due to the high energy consumptions caused by the comfort-based nature of hotels and of the space constraints for on-site renewable sources. These outcomes help highlighting the need to shift the focus from single building to district or city scale, proving that the zero-carbon building definition must go hand-in-hand with the Post-Carbon City concept. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Comfort-based building; Key performance indicators; Multi-objective assessment; Post-Carbon City; Retrofit scenarios; Zero-carbon hotel","Benchmarking; Emission control; Hotels; Plasma interactions; Retrofitting; Building sectors; Climatic zone; Core business; Hand in hands; Multi objective; Renewable sources; Simulated model; Space constraints; Carbon; building; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental impact; heating; hotel industry; residential energy; targeting; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090980986

We aimed to evaluate the suitability of LabSkin as an alternative to animal testing for the development of topical formulations. More than 2000 proteins were identified and quantified from total cellular protein. Alcohol dehydrogenase 1C, the most abundant phase I XME in human skin, and glutathione S-transferase pi 1, the most abundant phase II XME in human skin, were present in similar abundance in LabSkin. Several esterases were quantified and esterase activity was confirmed in LabSkin using substrate-based mass spectrometry imaging. No cytochrome P450 (P450) activity was observed for the substrates tested, in agreement with the proteomics data, where the cognate P450s were absent in both human skin and LabSkin. Label-free protein quantification allowed insights into other related processes such as redox homeostasis and proteolysis. For example, the most abundant antioxidant enzymes were thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin-1. This systematic determination of functional equivalence between human skin and LabSkin is a key step toward the construction of a representative human in vitro skin model, which can be used as an alternative to current animal-based tests for chemical safety and for predicting dosage of topically administered drugs.

However, there are local environmental detrimental effects, and empirical evidence is not consistent as to the support of local communi-ties. In the present paper, we analyse the antecedents of public generic perceptions of renewables grounded on objective location-related factors. Personal location-related factors can originate in the involvement of individuals with renewable energy sources. Regional location-related factors concern the importance of the renewable energy source in the district of residence and in relation to other renewables. We implement a questionnaire on public perceptions of renewable energy sources by the general population in mainland Portugal and complement respondent-level responses with renewable energy district information. Regression analysis shows that these objective location-related factors, both personal and regional, help explain public perceptions of renewables and thus we find empirical support for the proposed approach.

Although considerable attention has been paid to understanding particulate matter (PM) deposition on GI, there has been little focus on identifying which leaf traits might maximise airborne PM removal. This paper examines existing literature to synthesize the state of knowledge on leaf traits most relevant to PM removal. We systematically reviewed measurement studies that evaluated particulate matter accumulated on leaves on street trees, shrubs green roofs, and green walls, for a variety of leaf traits. Our final selection included 62 papers, most from field studies and a handful from wind tunnel studies. The following were variously promoted as useful traits: coniferous needle leaves; small, rough and textured broadleaves; lanceolate and ovate shapes; waxy coatings, and high-density trichomes. Consideration of these leaf traits, many of which are also associated with drought tolerance, may help to maximise PM capture. Although effective leaf traits were identified, there is no strong or consistent evidence to identify which is the most influential leaf trait in capturing PM. The diversity in sampling methods, wide comparison groups and lack of background PM concentration measures in many studies limited our ability to synthesize results. We found that several ancillary factors contribute to variations in the accumulation of PM on leaves, thus cannot recommend that selection of urban planting species be based primarily on leaf traits. Further research into the vegetation structural features and standardization of the method to measure PM on leaves is needed. © 2020 Elsevier LtdThere is some consensus that coniferous needle leaves; small, rough and textured broadleaves; extended oval shapes; waxy coatings and high-density trichomes are traits considered to be effective in retaining particulate matter. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Agronomy; Coatings; Forestry; Needles; Pollution; Textures; Urban planning; Wind tunnels; Airborne particulate matters; Drought tolerances; Green infrastructure; Measurement study; Particulate Matter; Pm concentrations; Structural feature; Systematic Review; Particles (particulate matter); atmospheric pollution; knowledge; leaf; literature review; particulate matter; shrub; tree; urban planning; urban pollution; atmospheric particulate matter; drought tolerance; field study; human; nonhuman; review; shrub; standardization; systematic review; trichome; urban area; vegetation; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; plant leaf; tree; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Trees",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097873816

It traces the influence of precedent and practice developed under British rule in the nineteenth century on government in the 26-county Free State established in 1922 (subsequently declared the Republic of Ireland in 1949). It demonstrates the enduring influence of the liberal principle of minimal intervention in cultural life on the approach of successive Irish governments to the formulation of cultural policy, right up to the 1970s. From 1973 onwards, however, the state began to take a more interventionist and welfarist approach to culture. This was marked by increasing professionalization of the arts and heritage, and a decline in state support for amateur and voluntary cultural bodies.

Achieving more efficient and low‐carbon mobility is crucial to ensuring urban systems are sustainable and tackling important challenges, such as reduction of CO2 emissions, air and noise pollution, and traffic congestion. Identifying effective strategies and design solutions that boost multimodal mobility and effective interchange among different sustainable means of transport can be a significant contribution in this area. This paper presents an easy‐to‐use methodology to assess the performance of policy measures and design solutions‐oriented to foster modal interchange, with special regard to the configuration of the interchange hubs. The methodology is based on identifying key factors necessary to ensure an efficient multimodal interchange and the different types of interchanges that are frequently present in the urban realm. By grouping the key factors into nine different domains, and by weighing the key factors in relation to their importance, the methodology creates a decision support system to assess the performance of the current interchange, as well as of different planning and design scenarios. This methodology has been developed in the framework of the Interreg Europe MATCH‐UP project and is conceived to support both designers and decision-makers whenever they have to reorganise existing transport hubs and policies, or design and plan new ones. © 2021 by the authors.

They play an important contribution in the climate change mitigation due to their ability to emit and remove greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. These emissions/removals are subject to an inventory which must be reported annually under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This study investigates the use of Sentinel-2 data for analysing lands conversion associated to Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sector in the Wallonia region (southern Belgium). This region is characterized by one of the lowest conversion rates across European countries, which constitutes a particular challenge in identifying land changes. The proposed research tests the most commonly used change detection techniques on a bi-temporal and multi-temporal set of mosaics of Sentinel-2 data from the years 2016 and 2018. Our results reveal that land conversion is a very rare phenomenon in Wallonia. All the change detection techniques tested have been found to substantially overestimate the changes. In spite of this moderate results our study has demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 regarding land conversion. However, in this specific context of very low magnitude of land conversion in Wallonia, change detection techniques appear to be not sufficient to exceed the signal to noise ratio. © 2021 by the authors.

Studies on species from the northwest Atlantic are lacking. Furthermore, information on the roles of intergenerational exposure and biological sex in bivalve responses to low pH, particularly in an aquaculture-specific context, is scant. We tested if short-term (1 month) exposure to CO2-induced reductions in pHNBS affected the reproductive development of male and female eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) during hatchery-specific reproductive conditioning and whether maternal and/or paternal exposure influenced larval responses. Reduced pH (7.5-7.7) increased the rate of reproductive development in both males and females. There was no indication of intergenerational effects; adult pH conditions did not affect early larval development. In contrast, low pH conditions experienced by gametes during spawning, fertilization, and embryo incubation (48 h) resulted in higher larval survival (+6-8% from control), reduced shell height (-2 to 3 μm), and increased deformities (abnormal shell shape; +3-5%). We suggest that local adaptation to acidic land runoff may account for the positive effects of low pH observed in this study.

In this sense, the biorefineries platforms are a strategic factor to increase the bioeconomy in the economic balance. The incorporation of renewable sources to produce fuels, chemicals, and energy, includes sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), and creating more manufacturing jobs fostering the advancement of regional and social systems by implementing the comprehensive use of available biomass, due to its low costs and high availability. This paper describes the emerging biorefinery strategies to produce fuels (bio-ethanol and γ-valerolactone) and energy (pellets and steam), compared with the currently established biorefineries designed for fuels, pellets, and steam. The focus is on the state of the art of biofuels and energy production and environmental factors, as well as a discussion about the main conversion technologies, production strategies, and barriers. Through the implementation of biorefineries platforms and the evaluation of low environmental impact technologies and processes, new sustainable production strategies for biofuels and energy can be established, making these biobased industries into more competitive alternatives, and improving the economy of the current value chains. © 2021 by the authors.","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Biomass; Lignocellulosic wastes; Sustainable feedstocks","biofuel; economic conditions; environmental factor; renewable resource; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099813657

A climate storyline is an event-based approach which aims at building “physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways”. As such, climate storylines may profit from downward counterfactual thinking, which aims at analyzing how past events could have been worse. Notwithstanding the various applications of downward counterfactual thinking in the natural risk management literature, no study relates this with the climate storyline approach. The main goal of this paper is thus to introduce a framework that supports the development of climate storylines from downward counterfactuals. The framework is event-oriented, it focuses on impact, and it is designed to be applied in a participatory fashion. As a proof-of-concept application, we study the impact of tropical cyclone events on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) and do not conduct a participatory analysis. These events represent a serious threat to the European outermost regions, and their impact to the EUSF capital availability has never been studied. We find that payouts due to tropical cyclones can hamper a recovery of the fund if large payouts concurrently occur in mainland Europe. To avoid this also considering future changes, an increase in capitalization up to 90 % percent may be required. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate storylines; Downward counterfactuals; European Union Solidarity Fund",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112315491

Plenty of new chemical additives have been incorporated to materials to comply with current legislation and safety rules. Consequently, the emission profiles of contaminants detected indoors may change over time, requiring continuous monitoring. In this study, dust samples were collected from 25 homes located in the Flemish region of Belgium during different seasons (winter and summer). Our aim was the development of a suspect screening workflow for the identification of new chemicals which might have been applied to indoor goods, released into the indoor environment, and accumulated in dust. An in-house suspect list was curated including selected groups of compounds, namely “phthalates”, “phosphates”, “terephthalates”, “citrates”, “trimellitates”, (di-, tri-, tetra-) “carboxylic acids”, “adipates”, “azelates”, “sebacates”, (di-)“benzoates”, and “succinates”. 63 chemicals were prioritized based on their level of identification and detection frequency in samples. Seasonal comparison was tested, indicating that higher temperatures of summer might facilitate the release of few chemicals from the products into the indoor environment.

The study period was March 2007 through February 2017 during which numerous measures to reduce air pollutants were implemented in both Korea and China. Major aerosol components, including mineral dust (MD), secondary inorganic ions (SII), and carbonaceous materials were estimated from optical properties, such as fine mode volume fraction (FMVF), single scattering albedo (SSA), and the difference of absorption aerosol optical depth (dAAOD) between 400 and 870 nm. Monthly variations in aerosol characteristics estimated from the optical properties were mostly consistent with the previous studies based on in-situ measurement data. As many studies reported the reduction of particulate matter (PM) in Northeast Asia, AOD also decreased along with the reductions of MD and SII. Secondary formation during the long-range transport played an important role in elevating AOD. However, for the specific case of high FMVF, high SSA, or low dAAOD, potential source regions of aerosols tended to be distributed in the eastern Korean Peninsula and over the East Sea, as the effects of local emissions became larger than those of long-range transport. Although AOD variations successfully revealed the overall characteristics of PM on the whole, in some cases, the variations of optical properties were not clearly related to those of aerosol components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Long-range transport; Long-term trends; Monthly variations; Potential source regions; Secondary formation","Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric movements; Aerosol characteristics; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol optical property; Carbonaceous materials; Long-term measurements; Overall characteristics; Potential source regions; Single scattering albedo; Optical properties; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; long range transport; measurement method; metropolitan area; mineral dust; optical depth; optical property; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; albedo; article; China; mineral dust; optical depth; particulate matter; Sea of Japan; South Korea; China; Korea; Northeast Asia; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Japan; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094564760

The Angkor Temple Complex area consists of historical moats and barays (reservoirs) which are currently used to store the water from the Siem Reap River to maintain temple foundation, irrigate cultivation areas and provide floodwater storage. The Angkor Wat Temple, which is located in the complex, was constructed on a sandy alluvial substrate and needs a stable supply of water to avert land subsidence and destabilization of the temple foundation. In light of changing climate, land use and land cover (LULC) trends, it is crucial to examine the wide-ranging implications of reduced water supply for the Angkor Temple Complex. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, this study seeks to assess the conditions necessary to provide sustainable streamflow to the Angkor Temple Complex. We modelled 30 scenarios of co-varied LULC and precipitation regime under a changing climate. The results show that under most LULC scenarios, sufficient water resources can be harvested to supply the complex—however—any further loss of forest cover is likely to impact groundwater conditions, flood management and dry season shortages. Conversely, the water supply to the complex is shown to be sensitive under the range of climate scenarios explored; a reduction of more than 10–20% in mean annual precipitation was enough to put the water supply under stress for the current and future conditions of the complex. © 2021, The Author(s).","Angkor Wat temple; Climate change; Land use change; Siem reap river; Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT); Water supply","Catchments; Climate change; Flood control; Floods; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Land use; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Climate scenarios; Groundwater conditions; Headwater catchment; Land use and land cover; Mean annual precipitation; Precipitation regimes; Soil and Water assessment tools; Sustainable water management; Reservoirs (water)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100800579

Accelerating the development of renewable energy technology innovation is one of the major measures to stimulate the utilization of renewable resources. This paper analyzes the impact of renewable energy technology innovation on carbon intensity in 30 Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2015. Using the recent panel estimation methods that take cross-section dependence and slope heterogeneity into account, the results show that for every 1% increase in the innovation level of renewable energy technology, carbon intensity was significantly reduced by 0.051%. Specifically, renewable energy technology innovation does not affect carbon intensity in the short term. But in the long term, the influences are negative and significant. Moreover, the environmental benefits are most evident in eastern China, while there is no significant influence on the western regions. Finally, this paper provides some policy implications to further discuss the impetus of renewable energy technology innovation. © 2020","Carbon intensity; Cross-section dependence; Renewable energy; Slope heterogeneity; Sustainable development; Technology innovation","Carbon; Emission control; Environmental protection; Global warming; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon intensity reductions; Cross section dependence; Environmental benefits; Environmental issues; Policy implications; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy technologies; Engineering research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089659603

However, studies regarding the facet effect of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on the photocatalytic process are in infancy. In this study, NH2-MIL-125(Ti) with different ratios of {001} and {111} facets was exactly controlled and synthesized, and it was found that the activity in photoreduction of CO2 is enhanced with gradually increasing exposed proportion of {111} facets. The {111} facets exhibit photocatalytic activity with the maximal CO and CH4 yields of 8.25 and 1.01 μmol g-1 h-1, which are 9 and 5 times higher than those of {001} facets, respectively. Also, the {111} facets give the highest quantum yields of 0.14 and 0.07% for CO and CH4 production, respectively. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectra reveal the importance of inhibiting the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes for the sample with {111} facets. Besides, TiIII formed during the reaction process exhibits strong reducibility for CO2. Starting from NH2-MIL-125(Ti), the photocatalytic performance can be enhanced by regulating exposed {111} facets. This work not only provides a strategy for further enhancing photocatalytic performance by tuning the exposed active facets of MOFs, but also provides a deep understanding of the factors for improving the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","CO2reduction; facets; metal-organic frameworks; NH2-MIL-125(Ti); photocatalytic reaction","Carbon dioxide; Photo-reduction; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic process; Photocatalytic reactions; Photocatalytic reduction; Photoinduced electrons; Reaction process; Time-resolved fluorescence spectra; Photocatalytic activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099148670

In this work, a spatial within-between logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition model was developed by using cluster analysis to evaluate the potential role of fiscal decentralization in driving interprovincial differences in CO2 emissions in China. The results revealed that the direct impact of fiscal decentralization emerged as a major emission driver after 2009. The differences of provincial CO2 emissions from the national average can be mainly attributed to emission differences between the distinct provincial clusters. The direct and indirect impacts of fiscal decentralization contributed to the shaping of differences in CO2 emission between provinces and their provincial cluster average, and between provincial cluster average and the national average. Reducing the differences in CO2 emission between distinct provincial clusters should be considered a breakthrough for the Chinese government. The provinces with CO2 emissions below the national average and above the average emissions of its provincial cluster still have the potential for further mitigation. Optimizing the expenditure authority of the central and provincial governments and improving the energy efficiency of the provincial fiscal expenditure are the two effective ways to further promote CO2 mitigation. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Cluster analysis; Energy efficiency; Chinese Government; CO2 mitigation; Direct and indirect impacts; Direct impact; Divisia index; Fiscal expenditures; Logarithmic mean; Spatial differences; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decentralization; energy efficiency; spatial variation; Article; China; cluster analysis; decentralization; decomposition; exhaust gas; government; China; government; politics; China; Carbon Dioxide; China; Government; Politics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099092489

Here, a set of CW matrix systems (Control, Fe-CWs, and FeB-CWs) was established to analyze the CH4 emission reduction from various angles, including the valencies of iron, microbial community structure and enzyme activity. The results revealed that the addition of iron oxides promoted the electron transfer between methanogens and Geobacter to promote CH4 production, but it was interesting that iron oxides also reduced the enzymes involved in the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction pathway and promoted the enzymes that participated in anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) thereby leading to the overall reduction in CH4 emissions.

A dual-chamber system was installed with an antimony-doped tin oxide anode (Ti/SnO2-Sb) for the electrocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals to degrade ciprofloxacin (CIP), and a CO2-reducing methanogenic biocathode was enriched based on a three-dimensional (3D) graphitized granular activated carbon (GGAC) for microbial electromethanogenesis. The anode achieved removal efficiencies as high as 99.99% and 90.53% for CIP (14 mL, 50 mg L−1) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD, 89 mg L−1), respectively. The biocathode was rapidly enriched within 15 days and exhibited a methane production rate that stabilized at 15.12 ± 1.82 m3 m−3 d−1; additionally, the cathodic coulombic efficiency reached 71.76 ± 17.24%. The energy consumption of CIP degradation was reduced by 3.03 Wh L−1 compared to that of a single electrochemical oxidation system due to the lower cathodic overpotential of CO2 bioelectrochemical reduction in the EO-M system. A detailed analysis of the biofilm evolution in the 3D biocathode during the start-up process demonstrated that the enhanced absorption of extracellular polymeric substances by the GGAC cathode accelerated the enrichment of methanogens and induced the formation of methanogens with a large number of flagella. An analysis of the microbial community showed that a high relative abundance of Methanobacterium movens could promote a flagella-mediated direct electron transfer of the biocathode, eventually reducing the cathodic overpotential and energy costs of the EO-M system. © 2020","Antibiotics; Biocathode; CO2 reduction; Electrochemical degradation; Energy costs","Activated carbon; Anodes; Antibiotics; Antimony compounds; Carbon dioxide; Cells; Chemical oxygen demand; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Energy utilization; Free radical reactions; Methanogens; Nanocomposites; Tin oxides; Titanium oxides; Antibiotic degradation; Antimony-doped tin oxide; Bioelectrochemical reductions; Cathodic overpotentials; Direct electron transfer; Extra-cellular polymeric substances; Granular activated carbons; Threedimensional (3-d); Electrochemical oxidation; activated carbon; antibiotic agent; carbon dioxide; ciprofloxacin; hydroxyl radical; methane; antiinfective agent; methane; antibiotic resistance; biodegradation; biotechnology; carbon dioxide; energy efficiency; methane; methanogenesis; oxidation; absorption; Article; bacterial flagellum; biofilm; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; degradation; electrochemical oxidation; electrochemistry; electrolysis; electron transport; energy cost; Methanobacterium movens; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; electrode; Methanobacterium; Methanobacterium; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Carbon Dioxide; Electrodes; Methane; Methanobacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090011193

Low phosphate (LP) availability is a critical limiting factor affecting soybean pro-duction. Soybean plants develop a series of strategies to adapt to phosphate (Pi) limitation condi-tion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for LP stress response remain largely unknown. Here, we performed a label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis of soybean leaves grown under low and high phosphate conditions. We identified 267 induced and 440 reduced differential proteins from phosphate-starved leaves. Almost a quarter of the LP decreased proteins are involved in translation processes, while the LP increased proteins are accumulated in chlorophyll biosynthetic and carbon metabolic processes. Among these induced proteins, an enolase protein, GmENO2a was found to be mostly induced protein. On the transcriptional level, GmENO2a and GmENO2b, but not GmENO2c or GmENO2d, were dramatically induced by phosphate starvation. Among 14 enolase genes, only GmENO2a and GmENO2b genes contain the P1BS motif in their pro-moter regions. Furthermore, GmENO2b was specifically induced in the GmPHR31 overexpressing soybean plants.

Although numerous efforts have focused on the integration of both materials with optimized photocatalytic performance in recent years, the direct parameters for this emerging enhancement are not fully summarized yet. Fully understanding the synergistic effects between g-C3N4 and carbon materials on photocatalytic action is vital to further development of metal-free semiconductors in future studies. Here, recent advances of carbon/g-C3N4 hybrids on various photocatalytic applications are reviewed. The dominant governing factors by inducing carbon into g-C3N4 photocatalysts with involving photocatalytic mechanism are highlighted. Five typical carbon-induced enhancement effects are mainly discussed here, i.e., local electric modification, band structure tailoring, multiple charge carrier activation, chemical group functionalization, and abundant surface-modified engineering. Photocatalytic performance of carbon-induced g-C3N4 photocatalysts for addressing directly both the renewable energy storage and environmental remediation is also summarized.

The pollutant emission parameters could be estimated with the observed pollutant and meteorology data using an air dispersion model. Most of the fast response source term estimation methods are based on the Gaussian plume model for the low computation complexity. The concentration profile estimated by the Gaussian plume model can hardly represent the observation result affected by the complicated terrain with buildings in dense industrial area. Besides, the dispersion models with well characterized building profile like computation fluid dynamic (CFD) are time consuming. In this paper, a metamodelling method with downwash effect of buildings in the domain to estimate the air pollutant emission is proposed. The dispersion model (Aermod) with combined plume rise and building down wash (PRIME) model preferred by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is used to establish an emission inventory which covers most possible release scenarios in a dedicated area such as a chemical industrial park. The initial emission inventory is then fed to a neural network. The emission inventory will be updated as well as the neural network with an increasing number of scenarios until the trained neural network meets the pre-set criteria. The well-trained neural network is then used to predict the source emissions with observed data collected in a fine chemical industrial park. A case study is performed with a localized Aermod model with geometry and surface character data collected from an industrial park. The results show that the building down wash effect in the industrial parks is responsible for some source estimating error produced by the inverse Gaussian dispersion model. It shows the advance of time consumption and competitive prediction accuracy compared to typical least square in version methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aermod; Air Pollution; Emergency Management; Metamodelling; Source Term Estimation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110420624

This study evaluated the performance of the one-year archived AQF PM2.5 forecasts (October 2018 to September 2019) and developed a bias-correction method to improve the accuracy of the PM2.5 forecasts. The bias-correction method incorporates a cluster-analysis-based synoptic weather pattern (WP) classification (one type of analog method). In principle, the historical model errors are categorized according to the synoptic WP and used to adjust the PM2.5 forecast. First, the synoptic WPs are determined using K-means cluster analysis (six WPs were identified). Second, the historical AQF PM2.5 bias at each surface station is estimated for each classified WP. Third, a linear-regression relationship between the AQF PM2.5 bias and PM2.5 forecasts for the six WPs is developed to postprocess the PM2.5 forecasts. The AQF PM2.5 bias is found to have a strong dependency on the synoptic WP. A performance assessment of the AQF PM2.5 forecasts reveals systematic PM2.5 underprediction, with the most pronounced underprediction occurring on days associated with weak synoptic weather conditions. Under these conditions, a severe PM2.5 event is likely to occur in Taiwan. The bias-correction method is able to reduce the PM2.5 forecast error and improve the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias (MB) calculations. The improvement is most significant on days associated with a weak synoptic WP and in regions where high PM2.5 concentrations are likely to occur. The method is shown to be effective at reducing the AQF PM2.5 bias. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality forecasting system; Bias correction; PM2.5 forecast; Synoptic weather pattern; WRF-CMAQ","Air quality; Cluster analysis; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Errors; K-means clustering; Mean square error; Air quality forecasting; Community multi-scale air quality models; Meteorological modeling; Regression relationship; Root mean square errors; Synoptic weather conditions; Synoptic weather patterns; Weather research and forecasting; Weather forecasting; air quality; climate conditions; climate modeling; forecasting method; particulate matter; performance assessment; real time; synoptic meteorology; weather; air quality; article; calculation; cluster analysis; forecasting; linear regression analysis; particulate matter 2.5; Taiwan; weather; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091097268

The empirical results reveal a statistically and economically significant positive impact of the TGP on manufacturing firms’ productivity, and various robustness checks confirm the soundness of our findings. We also verify three channels, the capital deepening effect, the scale effect, and the competition effect, robustly. This productivity impact suggests that hydropower projects have an economic benefit in addition to the other well-known ones, such as flood control and improvement of the shipping capacity.

However, the impact of NH3 emissions from AFOs on the formation of secondary inorganic PM2.5 (iPM2.5) has not been well understood and systematically assessed. Under the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) Network, the hourly concentrations of iPM2.5 chemical compositions and its precursor gases as well as meteorological data were measured at eight urban/nonurban sites labeled as JST/YRK, BHM/CTR, GFP/OAK, and PNS/OLF during 1998–2016. Using the SEARCH data, this research investigated the spatiotemporal variations of atmospheric chemical conditions in those rural and urban areas. The spatiotemporal variations of atmospheric chemical conditions at the eight sites are characterized by four parameters, including (1) gas ratio (GR), (2) gas-phase NH3 molar fraction (NH3/NHx), (3) total available NH3 (gaseous ammonia + aerosol ammonium) to sulfate (SO42−) molar ratio (TA/TS), and (4) PM2.5 ammonium + nitrate to total PM2.5 mass ratio (AN/PM2.5). Results indicate that the NH3 emissions from AFOs may explain the greater values of GR, NH3/NHx, and TA/TS in the wind directions coming from AFOs at YRK and OAK rural sites than the other wind directions. In the wind directions coming from AFOs at YRK and OAK, NH3 was in excess of fully neutralizing acidic gases, more NH3 stayed in gas phase than those in other wind directions, and both ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate existed in iPM2.5. The upward trend in NH3/NHx indicates that gas-particle partitioning ofNH3–NH4+shifted toward gas phase, while the downward trend in AN/PM2.5 may implicate that smaller fraction of PM2.5 was directly NH3 sensitive. Understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of atmospheric chemical condition provides insights to improve our understanding of iPM2.5 formation under rural and urban conditions, the reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions resulted in the reduction of iPM2.5 formation despite the increase in NH3 emissions in the Southeastern U.S. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AFOs NH3 emissions; Chemical condition; Precursor gases; Secondary inorganic PM2.5","Aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Gases; Meteorology; Molar ratio; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Urban growth; Ammonium Sulfate; Animal feeding operation (AFOs); Chemical compositions; Chemical conditions; Gas-particle partitioning; Meteorological data; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatio-temporal variation; Ammonia; aerosol; ammonia; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); emission control; particulate matter; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089262576

For a clearer insight, the total potential output gap (TOG) is further decomposed into technical efficiency gap (TEG), environmental regulation gap (ERG) and equipment utilization gap (EUG). Furthermore, Tobit regression is used to explore the factors influencing these output gaps. The results show that: (1) TOG generally has an upward trend from 2002 to 2014. It is the highest in Northeast area, followed by Central area, while Qinghai has not suffered from any output losses. (2) EUG is the main cause of the huge potential output gaps. Although ERG is relatively small, it has been rising rapidly since 2002. (3) Renewable power expansion and economy scale impose certain crowding-out effect on the actual output, electricity price is helpful to reducing EUG and ERG, and a higher coal proportion reduces TEG but increases EUG.

Results indicate that driving restrictions have not improved the air quality in terms of average treatment effect as there is no clear evidence that people turn from private cars to busses or subways. Furthermore, heterogeneous effects of driving restrictions exist across different regions and cities of China.

The upper-level model determines minimum social loss induced by water exploitation, the middle-level one focuses exclusively on pollutant emissions, and the lower-level one aims to achieve maximum economic benefits. An improved multi-level interactive algorithm is proposed to balance the satisfaction degree of constraints and goals to achieve optimal. The effectiveness of the developed multi-level model is illustrated through a real-world case in Wuhan City Circle. Results indicate that the overall water resources performance in Wuhan City Circle is satisfactory, especially in Xianning and Huanggang, whereas some water footprint deficits exist in Wuhan, Xiaogan, and Tianmen. Climate scenarios have a remarkable effect on social loss but only slightly affect water supply strategies, pollutant emissions, and economic benefits. A high satisfactory degree results in a low risk of insufficient water supply and excessive pollutant emissions. Thus, satisfactory degree can be used as an evaluation indicator for identifying the amount of credible and reliable risk on final decisions.

This paper proposes a traffic management and control platform from the perspective of sustainable development to reduce both vehicle emission and delay along arterial with contraflow left-turn lane (CLL). Unlike the traditional intersection layout and the control strategy, the existence of the contraflow left-turn lanes at intersections brings difficulties in setting phase sequences due to the complex interactions among upstream and downstream lanes. Furthermore, the queueing conditions are totally different from traditional intersections due to the complex queueing phenomenon between pre-signals and main signals. A macroscopic traffic model is proposed to model the intersection along arterial with CLL and is established on the basis of finite capacity queueing models. The optimization framework derives fixed-time traffic signal control plans, in which the green splits of the main signal and the pre-signal are explicitly considered. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to solve problem. A case study based on the field data of four intersections along the West Yan'an Road in the city of Shanghai is carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed framework. The microscopic simulator AIMSUN is used to evaluate and compare the travel delay and vehicle emissions obtained by the newly proposed signal plans and the signal plans derived by using traditional traffic control method. The simulation results indicate that the proposed framework successfully reduce travel delay and vehicle emission at intersections along arterial road with CLL. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Contraflow left-turn lanes; Delay minimization; Emission minimization; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainable traffic signal control","Genetic algorithms; Highway administration; Intersections; Queueing theory; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Control strategies; Finite capacity; Macroscopic traffic modeling; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Optimization framework; Traffic management and controls; Traffic signal control; Vehicle emission; Traffic signals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092499537

Based on the strong link between urbanization and carbon dioxide emissions has been proven, using a panel data of 23 provinces of China over the period of 1997–2013, this paper explores the impact of polycentric structure on carbon dioxide emissions. The results reveal that there is a u-shaped relationship between polycentric structure and carbon dioxide emissions, and the relationship is obviously different between coastal and inland areas. At the same time, market integration can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and there is a substitution relationship between polycentric structure and market integration. In addition, urban distance and transportation infrastructure within provinces play a significant non-linear regulating effect on the relationship between polycentric structure and carbon dioxide emissions.

In parallel with the discovery of emerging photocatalytic materials, strenuous efforts are devoted to maneuvering these surface-related parameters in a predictable manner or to endowing materials with an engineered surface/interface to meet the requirements of photocatalytic reactions. This review endeavors to reveal the inherent functionality of the surface and interface in photocatalysis, with 2D Bi-based photocatalysts as the platform. Herein, we start with various parameters at the surface/interface molecular level, such as defects, surface terminations, facets, pore structures, band bending etc., to gain insight into the structural sensitivity of the surface/interface to the reactivity and selectivity of photocatalytic reactions. As a bridging section, advanced characterization techniques that can visualize the fine structure of the surface/interface at the atomic level are discussed. Special attention is placed on engineering protocols to design and tune 2D Bi-based photocatalysts to ameliorate the performance: Surface engineering via heteroatom doping, defect tailoring, and surface state/facet/lateral size and thickness regulation, together with an equal focus on interface engineering including the basal interface and lateral interface. Moreover, the advancements of diversiform photocatalytic applications of 2D Bi-based photocatalysts in ambient molecule activation, including but not limited to CO2 reduction, O2 activation, H2O dissociation, N2 fixation and activation of other molecules, are discussed, with an emphasis on the surface/interface-activity relationship. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are featured based on its current development. The critical thinking on surface/interface chemistry facilitates consolidating and advancing the fundamental theory of heterogeneous photocatalysis and also broadening insights into the rational design of high-performance photocatalysts. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chemical activation; Electronic structure; Molecules; Photocatalysis; Pore structure; Characterization techniques; Heterogeneous photocatalysis; High surface-to-volume ratio; Photocatalytic application; Photocatalytic materials; Photocatalytic reactions; Surface and interfaces; Surface-related parameters; Interface states",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099241912

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between air pollutants and cognitive impairment using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and its sub-domains. In this study, we used data from the Taiwan Biobank combined with detailed daily data on air pollution. Cognitive function was assessed using the MMSE and its five subgroups of cognitive functioning. After multivariable linear regression analysis, a high level of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5), low ozone (O3), high carbon monoxide (CO), high sulfur dioxide (SO2), high nitric oxide (NO), high nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and high nitrogen oxide (NOx) were significantly associated with low total MMSE scores. Further, high SO2 and low O3 were significantly associated with low MMSE G1 scores. Low O3, high CO, high SO2, high NO2, and high NOx were significantly associated with low MMSE G4 scores, and high PM2.5, high particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤10 µm (PM10), high SO2, high NO2, and high NOx were significantly associated with low MMSE G5 scores. Our results showed that exposure to different air pollutants may lead to general cognitive decline and impairment of specific domains of cognitive functioning, and O3 may be a protective factor. These findings may be helpful in the development of policies regarding the regulation of air pollution. © 2021 by the authors.

We develop an integrated modeling approach to analyze the combination of biomass prices and CRP land rental payment reductions that can incentivize energy crop production on CRP land and its potential to increase soil carbon stocks and displace fossil fuel emissions. We find that conversion of 3.4 million ha in the CRP can be economically viable at a minimum biomass price of $75 Mg-1 with full CRP land rental payment or at $100 Mg-1 with 75% of this land rental payment; this conversion can result in savings of 0.52 and 1.25 billion Mg CO2-eq in life-cycle emissions through the displacement of energy-equivalent fossil fuels and coal-based electricity, respectively, and an additional 0.11 billion Mg CO2-eq soil carbon sequestration relative to the status quo, with CRP left unharvested over the 2016-2030 period. The soil carbon debt due to the transition from unharvested CRP land to energy crops is short-lived and more than offset by the reduction in fossil fuel emissions. The net discounted benefits from producing energy crops on CRP land through a reduced need for government payments to maintain existing enrollment, higher returns to CRP landowners, and the value of the reduction in GHG emissions could be as high as $16-$30 billion by using them for cellulosic biofuels to displace gasoline and $35-$68 billion by displacing coal-based electricity over the 2016-2030 period if biomass prices are $75-$125 Mg-1 and land rental payments are reduced by 25%. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cellulosic ethanol; Coal industry; Costs; Crops; Cultivation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Proven reserves; Soils; Cellulosic biofuels; Conservation reserve program; Economically viable; Fossil fuel emissions; Integrated modeling approaches; Life cycle emissions; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil carbon stock; Fossil fuels; biofuel; carbon; carbon dioxide; coal; fossil fuel; gasoline; magnesium; biofuel; assessment method; energy crop; greenhouse gas; land management; nature reserve; agricultural worker; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; controlled study; cost control; crop production; electricity; energy crop; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; land use; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; crop; greenhouse effect; Matthiola; Biofuels; Biomass; Crops, Agricultural; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100223718

As monetary costs are incurred for renting computing resources on edge servers to enable service provisioning, ASP has to cautiously decide where to deploy the application and how much resources would be needed to deliver satisfactory performance. However, the service provisioning problem exhibits complex correlations with multifarious factors in EC systems, ranging from user behavior to computation offloading, which are difficult to be fully captured by mathematical modeling and also put off traditional machine learning techniques due to the induction of high-dimension state space. The recent success of deep learning (DL) underpins new tools for addressing our problem. While previous works provide valuable insights on applying DL techniques, e.g., distributed DL, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and multi-agent DL, in EC systems, these techniques cannot solely handle the distributed and heterogeneous nature of EC systems. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multi-agent DRL, distributed neural network orchestration (N2O), and knowledge distilling. The multi-agent DRL enables edge servers to learn deep neural networks that shelve distinct features learned from local edge sites and hence caters to the heterogeneity of EC systems. N2O coordinates edge servers in a fully distributed manner toward a common goal of maximizing ASP's reward. It requires only local communications during execution and provides provable performance guarantees. The knowledge distilling is further utilized to distill the N2O policy for reducing the communication overhead and stabilizing the decision-making. We also carry out systematic experiments to show the advantages of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","deep reinforcement learning; distributed optimization; Edge computing; multi-agent learning","Behavioral research; Decision making; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Application service provider; Communication overheads; Computation offloading; Distributed neural networks; High dimension state space; Machine learning techniques; Performance guarantees; Systematic experiment; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096392010

This study investigates the impacts of climate change on surface solar radiation in the United States using a set of climate projections from global and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs). Multi-model ensemble mean of GCMs in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) show a significant increase in annual mean surface solar radiation over the eastern and southern US. The projected solar brightening is consistent among different future periods and pathways. However, RCMs in North American Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) and convection-permitting simulations of the climate of North America exhibit a significant decrease in surface solar radiation over large areas of the US. Those conflicting responses between the GCMs and RCMs are evident throughout the year with the greatest disagreement during fall. When scrutinizing the mechanism of solar radiation changes, we find that cloud behavior alone cannot adequately explain the contrasting changes in solar radiation. Instead, if a climate model considers transient aerosols is the key for solar brightening or dimming. Future solar brightening is mainly associated with the declining aerosols that have been implemented in most of the CMIP5 GCMs. In contrast, solar dimming becomes evident because of the greenhouse gas effects in those GCMs and RCMs without considering the aerosol effects. This study highlights the importance of the aerosol effects in solar energy-related climate assessment, and it is necessary to implement the aerosol forcing in regional climate downscaling. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aerosols; CMIP5 projections; Convection-permitting WRF; NA-CORDEX; Surface solar radiation","aerosol; assessment method; climate modeling; CMIP; solar radiation; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092762333

In this study, the chemical composition, morphology and nano-structure of particulate emissions between conventional diesel and light hydrocarbon PCCI engine were performed with thermogravimetric analysis, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy technology. The results show that the volatile matter content of light hydrocarbon is much higher than that of diesel, and thermogravimetry and differential thermogravimetry curves of light hydrocarbon shift to low temperature regions. The total organic components of particulate matter of light hydrocarbon PCCI engine are less, and the corresponding separation time is shorter. The structure of particles produced in light hydrocarbon PCCI engine is more open, and the size of aggregates is smaller. Fractal dimensions of 1.774 and 1.691 are obtained for soot particles in light hydrocarbon PCCI engine, compared to that of 1.81 and 1.785 in conventional diesel engine. Compared to conventional diesel engine, fringe separation distance and fringe tortuosity in light hydrocarbon PCCI engine are smaller while fringe length is larger. The primary particle nanostructures of light hydrocarbon PCCI engine incline to graphitize and change into the orderly structure.

Hence, days with a relatively higher UHI intensity should be selected for UHI observation and analysis. However, there is still a lack in the method and criteria for selecting the typical meteorological days for UHI survey and simulation. In this study, field measurements were conducted based on Local Climate Zone (LCZ) schemes over a one-year period to assess the UHI behavior in Guangzhou, China. The relationship between the diurnal temperature range (DTR) and UHI intensity was evaluated and analyzed quantitatively under different meteorological conditions classified by precipitation. The average daily maximum UHI intensity (UHIImax) during precipitation days was approximately 1.8 °C lower than that during non-precipitation days, confirming that precipitation has a negative effect on UHI development. The monthly DTR distribution was similar to the daily UHIImax distribution, which was higher in autumn and winter, but lower in spring and summer. DTR has a significant linear correlation with the daily UHIImax, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of >0.7 and statistical significance of <0.001. Based on a quantitative evaluation of our results, we determined that 10 °C could be regarded as the appropriate DTR threshold to identify the meteorological conditions conducive to UHI development; the meteorological conditions exhibited a high daily UHIImax in Guangzhou. This study provides a simple method to select typical meteorological days for UHI measurement and simulation, and a method to early-warning of intense UHI events based on weather forecasts. © 2020 by the authors.

Practical mitigation technologies are needed to minimize emissions from stored manure and improve air quality inside barns. In our previous research, the one-time surficial application of biochar to swine manure significantly reduced emissions of NH3 and phenol. We observed that the mitigation effect decreased with time during the 30-day trials. In this research, we hypothesized that bi-weekly reapplication of biochar could improve the mitigation effect on a wider range of odorous compounds using a larger scale and longer trials. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of biochar dose and reapplication on mitigation of targeted gases (NH3, odorous, volatile organic compounds VOCs, odor, greenhouse gases (GHG)) from stored swine manure on a pilot-scale setup over 8-weeks. The bi-weekly reapplication of the lower biochar dose (2 kg/m2 ) showed much higher significant percentage reductions in emissions for NH3 (33% without and 53% with reapplication) and skatole (42% without and 80% with reapplication), respectively. In addition, the reapplication resulted in the emergence of a statistical significance to the mitigation effect for all other targeted VOCs. Specifically, for indole, the percentage reduction improved from 38% (p = 0.47, without reapplication) to 78% (p = 0.018, with reapplication). For phenol, the percentage reduction improved from 28% (p = 0.71, without reapplication) to 89% (p = 0.005, with reapplication). For p-cresol, the percentage reduction improved from 31% (p = 0.86, without reapplication) to 74% (p = 0.028, with reapplication). For 4-ethyl phenol, the percentage emissions reduction improved from 66% (p = 0.44, without reapplication) to 87% (p = 0.007, with reapplication). The one-time 2 kg/m2 and 4 kg/m2 treatments showed similar effectiveness in mitigating all targeted gases, and no statistical difference was found between the dosages. The one-time treatments showed significant percentage reductions of 33% and 42% and 25% and 48% for NH3 and skatole, respectively. The practical significance is that the higher (one-time) biochar dose may not necessarily result in improved performance over the 8-week manure storage, but the bi-weekly reapplication showed significant improvement in mitigating NH3 and odorous VOCs. The lower dosages and the frequency of reapplication on the larger-scale should be explored to optimize biochar treatment and bring it closer to on-farm trials. © 2020 by the authors.

Assimilation took place through the French language, through religious peace (Catholics and Protestants), and then through secularism (the superiority of secular power over spiritual power). However, the massive immigration over the last forty years of African (Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa) and Muslim origin has caused the French model of assimilation to explode. The combination of demography and the Islamic radicalization of a significant proportion of Muslims in France now poses a risk of identity breakdown. Civil unity is weakened by a combination of identity and social fractures. Externally, French geopolitical design is characterized by a constant desire for independence from empires. For centuries, France has tried to escape from the spiritual empire of the Papacy and the temporal empire of the Holy Roman Empire. The French Revolution was a rupture: France went from Capetian sovereignty to a desire for European imperialism inspired by the philosophy of the Enlightenment. This French form of ideological imperialism can be found even in the construction of Europe today. The multipolar policy towards the United States and the desire to maintain particular policies with Russia, China, and even Iran are part of the ancient heritage of the French policy of national independence. Faced with a real decline in terms of “hard power” (economic and military power), France is trying to maintain its influence by using soft power that draws on the multilateral issues of the moment: climate, international law, human rights, etc. The balance between transatlantic relations, European policy, and multipolar policy is, however, increasingly difficult to maintain. The French maritime domain (the second largest in the world) is France’s main future asset in global geopolitics. Thanks to its ultramarine territory, France is present in almost all the major regions of the world and has not said its last word in terms of international influence. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108926985

The exponential use of chemicals especially metal ions has raised the pollution index and affected the health of living beings. Therefore, it is highly essential need to monitor and remove these metal ion toxins by the advanced materials which itself non-lethal, bio-congenial and easily workable with high selectivity and sensitivity. To solve these issues, the current study proposed the efficient utilization of Pearl Millet seeds into value-added carbon dots (C-dots) via using simple thermal treatment. Engaging agricultural product as a starting precursor for C-dots synthesis made the process economically more viable. The basic structural properties (size ∼ 4–5 nm, shape ∼ spherical, and crystalline nature) were assessed through HRTEM, PXRD, FTIR and EDX analysis. The optical and luminescence properties were appraised by investigating the variation in the absorbance and emission intensity as a function of pH (2–12) and excitation wavelength (245 nm–305 nm). The developed strategy has provided the better control over the aqueous solubility, quantum yield (52%) and optical properties of C-dots. The high loading amounts of C-dots ranging from 100 to 5000 mg/L has produced a significant enhancement in the biocompatibility rate of C-dots against bacterial strains, fungus, algae, chromosomal compatibility on Allium cepa and seeds germination activity of Vigna radiate. The strong fluorescence emission and optical properties of as prepared C-dots made them efficient for selective and sensitive detection of Pb2+ ion (detection limit = 0.18 nM) from waste water via using colorimetric, UV–vis. absorption and fluorescence based sensory methods. The development sensor performed well in water obtained from different natural resources with 90% average recovery rate. These findings would make the economically feasible C-dots as an effective material for wastewater treatment via overcoming the barriers of low selectivity and advanced the implementation of the process on large scale. Furthermore, the usage of biowaste as starting precursor offers a solution for ecological burdens while synchronically reducing the pernicious effect of the waste on the ecosystem and cleans up the environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biocompatibility; Carbon dots; Colorimetric sensing; Metal ion; Pearl millet; Toxicity","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Biocompatibility; Carbon; Colorimetry; Ecology; Fluorescence; Metal ions; Metals; Nanocrystalline materials; Optical properties; Urban growth; Wastewater treatment; Aqueous solubility; Average recovery rate; Effective materials; Emission intensity; Excitation wavelength; Fluorescence emission; Luminescence properties; Sensitive detection; C (programming language)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089809609

The Kaohsiung House Project, undertaken by the city government, encourages the installation of greening facilities in buildings, such as photovoltaic (PV) panels on rooftops and vertical gardens on balconies, in order to preserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. In the present study, the urban heat island effect and temperature distribution within the city was examined through the establishment of 16 temperature measurement sites within a 7.5 km × 6 km area. A between-site temperature difference of 2◦C was observed between April and August. Areas with higher temperature are recommended to increase their green space ratio through the project. Moreover, relocating PV panels in low-temperature areas increased the overall generation efficiency by 0.8%. Through the analysis of the measured data, this study determined which areas were more appropriate for green space expansion, and which would best serve for green energy generation, all with the aim of improving external environmental comfort and maximizing carbon reduction.

As China continues to urbanize, the increase in the number of street light facilities will exacerbate the energy and environmental burdens of urban areas. Adopting energy-efficient lighting luminaires and using renewable energy can improve the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of urban roadway lighting, contributing to the development of a low-carbon urban environment. In this study, we used a bottom-up approach to estimate GHG mitigation potential associated with replacing current high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps with light-emitting diode (LED) lamps and deploying solar-wind hybrid street lights, solar street lights, and wind street lights in China. Four classes of urban roads in 662 cities were examined with specific considerations for luminaire specifications, lighting design requirements, and urban-specific availability of solar and wind energy resources. The results showed that the incremental GHG emissions associated with a set of street lights using renewable energy technologies range from 475 to 1631 kg CO2e, yielding a GHG payback time of 1.7-7.7 years, which is environmentally cost-effective. The LED-HPS lamp replacement and renewable energy utilization can annually reduce GHG emissions by 21.2 million tons (Mt) of CO2e, which is dominated by branch (38%) and trunk roads (31%). East China, especially Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, has the largest GHG mitigation potentials. Dalian, Shanghai, and Tianjin are among the top cities with the greatest GHG mitigation potential. For cities with different administrative levels, prefecture-level cities can achieve a GHG mitigation potential of 56%, approximately 11.9 Mt CO2e/year. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; greenhouse gas mitigation; luminaire replacement; solar energy; urban roadway lighting; wind energy","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Light emitting diodes; Solar energy; Wind power; Bottom up approach; Energy efficient lighting; Environmental burdens; Greenhouse gas (GHG); High-pressure sodium lamps; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Solar and wind energies; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; adaptive management; alternative energy; bottom-up approach; design; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; solar power; traffic emission; urban transport; wind power; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; energy efficient lighting luminaire; engineering and technology; geospatial analysis; highway; illumination; life cycle assessment; light; renewable energy; solar energy; spatial analysis; street light; urban area; urban roadway lighting; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093700130

Increased primary production and stimulated microbial activity have been widely observed in warming permafrost. However, the fate of permafrost soil organic carbon (SOC) remains elusive, and the potential mechanisms underlying warming-mediated SOC formation and old C decomposition are poorly understood. Here, using in situ six-year manipulative warming experiments with two scenarios (+2.4 °C and +4.9 °C for lower and higher scenarios, respectively, above the ambient temperature) at a permafrost site in the Tibetan Plateau, we observed that soil C sink increased in the surface 5 cm layer under the two warming scenarios. SOC exhibited a linear increase with warming duration at rates of 6.8% and 6.4% annually in the silt & clay fractions and aggregates, respectively. Warming-induced accumulations of SOC in the aggregates and silt & clay fractions were contributed mainly by plant-derived C and minorly by microbial necromass. However, the increased input of new plant-derived C was accompanied with an increasing loss of old C via enhanced respiration under warming, likely due to the mobilization and degradation of C in the aggregates and silt & clay fractions. Our study provides field-based evidence of the enhanced SOC accumulation in the Tibetan permafrost regions under warming, and improves process-based understanding of warming-induced new plant-derived C that could replace the protected old C in the aggregates and silt & clay fractions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amino sugars; Permafrost; Plant-derived carbon; Warming duration; Δ14C","Aggregates; Global warming; Organic carbon; Silt; Clay fractions; Microbial activities; Permafrost area; Permafrost region; Potential mechanism; Primary production; Soil organic carbon; Tibetan Plateau; Permafrost; degradation; microbial activity; permafrost; primary production; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil organic matter; warming; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096357892

Excessive emissions of CO2 are the leading cause of global climate change. As economy grows, China's CO2 emissions grows rapidly correspondingly. Since 2006, China has ranked first in terms of total CO2 emissions, results of different contributions of different provinces. In view of the shortcomings in the previous regional classification, this work adopted a new regional classification framework which combines factor analysis and Ward clustering method, and classified 30 provinces into four regions by using panel data from 2002 to 2016. Then, this work investigated the regional differences in terms of the effect of population size, GDP per capita, energy structure, energy intensity, urbanization level and industrialization level on CO2 emissions by STIRPAT model. The outcomes indicated that population size, GDP per capita and energy intensity were the top three factors affecting CO2 emissions for all regions. The impact of population size on carbon emissions is not only determined by the size of the population. Along with the process of urbanization, the role of urbanization on CO2 emissions gradually changes from positive to negative. The factor urbanization had positive impacts in region (Ⅲ and Ⅳ) but negative impacts in region (Ⅰ and Ⅱ). The greatest positive impacts of energy structure can be seen in region IV. Yet, statistically, energy structure shows no significant impact in region Ⅱ. As for industrialization level, it demonstrated negative effect in region Ⅱ but positive effect in the other three regions. From these results, implications for CO2 emission-reduction policies in each region were discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emissions; Factor analysis; Regional classification; STIRPAT model; Ward cluster analysis","Carbon dioxide process; Cluster analysis; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Population statistics; Carbon dioxide emissions; Clustering methods; CO2 emission reduction; Energy structures; Global climate changes; Regional classifications; Regional differences; Urbanization levels; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089684675

Existing studies disagree on how radial growth varies in European beech in response to droughts. We aimed to find the impact of multiple droughts on beech trees’ annual radial growth at their ecological drought limit created by soil water availability in the forest. Besides, we quantified the influence of competition and canopy openness on the mean basal area growth of beech trees. We carried out this study in five near-natural temperate forests in three localities of Germany and Switzerland. We quantified available soil water storage capacity (AWC) in plots laid in the transition zone from oak to beech dominated forests. The plots were classified as ‘dry’ (AWC < 60 mL) and ‘less-dry’ (AWC > 60 mL). We performed dendroecological analyses starting from 1951 in continuous and discontinuous series to study the influence of climatic drought (i.e., precipitation-potential evapotranspiration) on the radial growth of beech trees in dry and less-dry plots. We used observed values for this analysis and did not use interpolated values from interpolated historical records in this study. We selected six drought events to study the resistance, recovery, and resilience of beech trees to drought at a discontinuous level. The radial growth was significantly higher in less-dry plots than dry plots. The increase in drought had reduced tree growth. Frequent climatic drought events resulted in more significant correlations, hence, increased the dependency of tree growth on AWC. We showed that the recovery and resilience to climatic drought were higher in trees in less-dry plots than dry plots, but it was the opposite for resistance. The resistance, recovery, and resilience of the trees were heterogeneous between the events of drought. Mean growth of beech trees (basal area increment) were negatively impacted by neighborhood competition and positively influenced by canopy openness. We emphasized that beech trees growing on soil with low AWC are at higher risk of growth decline. We concluded that changes in soil water conditions even at the microsite level could influence beech trees’ growth in their drought limit under the changing climate. Along with drought, neighborhood competition and lack of light can also reduce beech trees’ growth. This study will enrich the state of knowledge about the ongoing debate on the vulnerability of beech trees to drought in Europe. © 2021 by the authors.

China’s rapid economic growth and high carbon energy structure contribute to its large carbon emissions. To achieve sustainable development, China must transform its industrial structure to conserve energy, reduce emissions, and adapt to climate change. This study measured the carbon entropy and carbon emission efficiency of 25 industries in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2000 to 2015 by building carbon entropy models and total factor industrial carbon emission efficiency evaluation models. The study showed that: (a) Priority development industries in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region were expanding, the regional competitiveness of the moderate development industry was improving, and the proportion of restricted development industries had dropped significantly; (b) the spatial distribution of the three types of industries presented a pattern of concentric rings, with priority industries at the core, surrounded by moderate, then by restricted development industries; (c) the status of medium-and high-efficiency industries had improved, while the status of low-efficiency industries had decreased.

The main thrust of the literature on this issue is that FLW reduction can make a major contribution to making food systems more sustainable. Using a stylized analytical framework, we find that reducing FLW always improves resource use efficiency for land and water, and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted per unit of food consumed. However, whether the actual environmental outcome is improved will depend on where environmental damage and FLW reduction occur, and the way price transmission connects these along the food supply chain. We find that, while a food waste reduction at the consumer level always improves the environmental outcome, this is not guaranteed when reducing losses from farm to retail. We thus derive a condition linking the price transmission mechanism and the environmental impact of a loss reduction. Simulating environmental outcomes based on a range of parameter values found in the literature, we find that reducing losses at or close to the farm level can increase the aggregate amount of GHG emissions, and therefore focusing on reducing consumer waste is more effective in reducing emissions. As for reducing natural resource use, both loss and waste reductions reduce the amount of land and water use, but effectiveness is reduced by heterogeneity in environmental impact. Relative to loss reductions, effectiveness of a waste reduction is amplified if there are environmentally damaging losses upstream in the value chain, but also dampened by vertical heterogeneity of sourcing along a value chain. The paper makes the case that more targeted instruments may be better suited to address typically local water scarcity and land use and degradation issues. © 2020 The Authors","Environmental targeting; Food loss; Food waste; Greenhouse gas emissions; Policy design; Resource use efficiency","efficiency measurement; emission inventory; environmental impact; food availability; food waste; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; policy development; resource scarcity; resource use; targeting; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084196323

Predictive models and simulations make it possible to explore new approaches and optimize proceedings, potentially helping companies reduce costs and limit carbon emissions. Nevertheless, as the different phases of the food processing chain are highly specialized, advances in modelling are often unknown outside of a single domain, and models rarely take into account more than one step. This paper introduces the first high-level overview of modelling techniques employed in different parts of the cereal supply chain, from farming to storage, from drying to milling, from processing to consumption.

The scientific objective is to perform mono and multi-objective optimizations of the HMSC to provide effective support for the study of deployment scenarios, with the Occitania region (France) as a case study. The formulation developed is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach with augmented ε-constraint, implemented in the GAMS environment following a multiperiod approach (2035-2050). The three objectives to be minimized are the Total Annual Cost, the Total Global Greenhouse Gas emissions, and Total Exergy Lost/Destroyed, which are related to the whole HMSC over the entire period studied. The results show that hydrogen can be competitive with SMR with carbon rates below 270 €/tonCO2, whereas other drivers (i.e., ambitious policies to reduce GHG emissions) are expected for synthetic methane. Furthermore, coupling with other energy systems and processes is essential to increase the exergetic performance of HMSC. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","exergy analysis; hydrogen; methanation; MILP; Power-to-Gas; supply chain optimization",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110488555

For the multiple ride hailing ride-sharing demands and multiple ride hailing services in the urban road network in a specific period, the objective function is established with the shortest route of the system. The constraint conditions of the optimization model are constructed by considering factors of the rated passenger capacity, route rationality, passenger benefits, driver benefits and time window. Based on the idea of the Genetic Algorithm, the solution algorithm of the optimization model is developed. According to the supply and demand data of taxi during peak hours in the local road network in the city of Dalian, the optimization model and algorithm are used to optimize the ride-sharing route scheme. Research results indicate that the optimization model and algorithm can find the approximate optimal solution of the system in a short time. Compared with the traditional non-ride-sharing mode, the ride-sharing scheme can not only effectively reduce the taxi empty-loaded rate and the travel cost of passengers, improve the efficiency of drivers, but also save energy and reduce emissions, and promote the sustainable development of urban traffic. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is a knowledge gap regarding coupling systems that entail methane oxidation, nitrification, and denitrification, which restricts their industrial application. In this study, we acclimated a mixed culture to deal with simultaneous nitrification-denitrification coupled to methane oxidation in a laboratory-scale hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor, which achieved a steady ammonia removal rate of 38.09 mg N/(L•d). Furthermore, a series of batch experiments were conducted to test methane oxidation coupled to nitrate denitrification (AME-D3), nitrite denitrification (AME-D2), and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (ME-SND). The molar ratio between methane consumed and nitrate reduced (C/N) equals 10 and 5 mol CH4[sbnd]C mol−1 NO3[sbnd]N in AME-D3 and AME-D2, averagely and respectively. Without methane injection, the removal of nitrates and nitrites was very low, indicating that the coupling of nitrate/nitrite denitrification and methane oxidation was beneficial. The average ammonia removal rates in the 20% O2 and 25% O2 groups were 20.06 and 22.03 mg N/(L•d) in the ME-SND system, respectively. Without methane, the ammonia oxidation rate declined, and large amounts of nitrite accumulated. As traditional ammonia and nitrite oxidation approaches are autotrophic, we proposed the possibility of heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification (HN-AD). To study the coupling systems, the microbial communities and functional bacteria were analyzed. The results indicated that the system contained a guild of methanotrophs (mainly Methylobacter) and HN-AD bacteria (mainly Chrysobacterium and Comamonas). © 2020","Coupling mechanism; Heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification; Methane oxidation; Microbial diversity","Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Denitrification; Molar ratio; Nitrates; Nitrification; Oxidation; Functional bacteria; Heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrifications; Hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor; Microbial communities; Nitrification-denitrification; Nitrite denitrification; Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification; Simultaneous nitrification denitrifications; Methane; ammonia; amoa protein; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; bacterial RNA; genomic DNA; methane; nitrate; nitrite; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; oxygen; pmoa protein; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; methane; nitrite; ammonia; anaerobic digestion; biofilm; bioremediation; denitrification; methane; methanotrophy; microbial activity; nitrite; oxidation; pollutant removal; aerobic metabolism; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Article; batch process; carbon source; chemical parameters; Chrysobacterium; Comamonas; controlled study; denitrification; denitrifying bacterium; heterotrophy; high throughput sequencing; illumina sequencing; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylobacterium; Methylomonas; microbial community; microbial interaction; mixed cell culture; molar ratio; nitrification; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; RNA sequencing; bioreactor; denitrification; Bacteria (microorganisms); Comamonas; Methylobacter; Ammonia; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Methane; Nitrification; Nitrites; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094588580

The uncertainty and magnitude of environmental change have been superimposed on longstanding issues of marginalization and multidimensional poverty among rural farmers. The combined and interactive effects of these conditions create complex trade-offs that hinder the uptake of effective climate action. In the last two decades or so, Jamaica's coffee sector has been severely affected by socioeconomic, environmental and institutional stressors resulting in rapid declines in the production and livelihood conditions of thousands of farmers across the island. To address these challenges, multilateral donors, government and non-government agencies have advanced several climate resilience programs in the last decade. Yet, there is a paucity of research on the livelihood resilience of farmers to socio-ecological change, and effective metrics to monitor and evaluate adaptation responses . In this paper, the experience and knowledge of coffee farmers (n = 219) in the Cedar Valley region of Jamaica are used to examine the factors shaping patterns of livelihood resilience within the context of socio-ecological changes. Quantitative survey data are combined with qualitative information from focus group discussions and key informant interviews to develop storylines around the domains of livelihood resilience. The results provide baseline information on the livelihood resilience of local coffee farmers and within the context of changing social, agronomic and environmental conditions. Understanding how these factors shape local livelihood resilience processes can strengthen local response options, identify possible entry points for improving climate action and establish monitoring and evaluation metrics to track progress and outcomes of climate resilience interventions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Coffee farming; Jamaica; Livelihoods; Resilience","adaptive management; climate change; coffee; farmers knowledge; livelihood; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Jamaica; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095739185

In the building environment, climate-responsive design may help to enhance the adaptation capacity through a better building energy performance. In this sense, this study addresses an adaptation strategy to reduce the effects of global warming on low-income houses, for which bioclimatic passive strategies should be prioritized, aiming to improve environmental sustainability. The technique chosen to be analyzed is thermal mass for cooling. Thus, the goal is to evaluate the energy consumption and thermal performance impact of implementing bermed earth-sheltered walls on bedrooms in low-income housing (LIH), considered deployed in tropical climate regions. For that, a base scenario (1961–1990) is considered, alongside two future scenarios: 2020 (2011 to 2040) and 2050 (2041 to 2070), both considering the effects of climate change, according to the Fourth Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The methodologies adopted are (i) computational simulation to estimate the annual energy consumption demand and (ii) quantification of the cooling degree-hours (CDH), with the subsequent comparative analysis based on Brazilian regulation for energy efficiency in buildings (RTQ-R). The predictions show that there will be an increase in the energy consumption for cooling and in the CDH in both 2020 and 2050 scenarios, regardless of using a bermed earth-sheltered wall. Nonetheless, this adaptive measure enables the building to be resilient in terms of cooling energy demand in the 2020s, since it is 12.3% lower than in the building without the strategy use, compared with the base scenario. In the 2050s, resilience was almost reached with energy consumption only 10.7% higher, for the same conditions described previously. Therefore, bermed earth-sheltered walls work as a climate-responsive design strategy to face the potential global warming effects, promoting building sustainability in tropical climate regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Beijing was particular badly affected by lockdown measures during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has significantly reduced the CO2 emission and toxic air pollution (CO and NO2 ). We use column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 and CO (XCO2 and XCO) observed by a ground-based EM27/SUN Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), the tro-pospheric NO2 column observed by MAX-DOAS and satellite remote sensing data (GOSAT and TROPOMI) to investigate the variations in anthropogenic CO2 emission related to COVID-19 lock-down in Beijing. The anomalies describe the spatio-temporal enhancement of gas concentration, which relates to the emission. Anomalies in XCO2 and XCO, and XNO2 (∆XCO2, ∆XCO, and ∆XNO2 ) for ground-based measurements were calculated from the diurnal variability. Highly correlated daily XCO and XCO2 anomalies derived from FTS time series data provide the ∆XCO to ∆XCO2 ratio (the correlation slope). The ∆XCO to ∆XCO2 ratio in Beijing was lower in 2020 (8.2 ppb/ppm) than in 2019 (9.6 ppb/ppm). The ∆XCO to ∆XCO2 ratio originating from a polluted area was significantly lower in 2020. The reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emission was estimated to be 14.2% using FTS data. A comparable value reflecting the slowdown in growth of atmospheric CO2 over the same time period was estimated to be 15% in Beijing from the XCO2 anomaly from GOSAT, which was derived from the difference between the target area and the background area. The XCO anomaly from TROPOMI is reduced by 8.7% in 2020 compared with 2019, which is much smaller than the reduction in surface air pollution data (17%). Ground-based NO2 observation provides a 21.6% decline in NO2 . The NO2 to CO2 correlation indicates a 38.2% decline in the CO2 traffic emission sector. Overall, the reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emission relating to COVID-19 lockdown in Beijing can be detected by the Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and MAX-DOAS in urban Beijing. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the key strategies to achieve these goals entails a disconnection of all households from the natural gas supply by 2040 and connecting them to the existing city-wide heat grid. This paper aims to demonstrate the value of considering local energy potentials at the city block level by exploring the potential of a rooftop greenhouse solar collector as a renewable alternative to centralized district heating. An existing supermarket and an ATES component complete this local energy synergy. The thermal energy balance of the three urban functions were determined and integrated into hourly energy profiles to locate and quantify the simultaneous and mismatched discrepancies between energy excess and demand. The excess thermal energy extracted from one 850 m2 greenhouse can sustain up to 47 dwellings, provided it is kept under specific interior climate set points. Carbon accounting was applied to evaluate the system performance of the business-as-usual situation, the district heating option and the local system. The avoided emissions due to the substitution of natural gas by solar thermal energy do not outweigh the additional emissions consequential to the fossil-based electricity consumption of the greenhouse’s crop growing lights, but when the daily photoperiod is reduced from 16 h to 12 h, the system performs equally to the business-as-usual situation. Deactivating growth lighting completely does make this local energy solution carbon competitive with district heating. This study points out that rooftop greenhouses applied as solar collectors can be a suitable alternative energy solution to conventional district heating, but the absence of growing lights will lead to diminished agricultural yields. © 2021 by the authors.

The layer depth did not increase as the self-oscillatory reaction time was increased to 2–3 h. The porous layer consisted of nickel oxide crystals 100–200 nm in size or metallic Ni crystallites (indistinct crystals) of the above size in an oxidative gas atmosphere or a reducing atmosphere, respectively. The formation of the layer caused a great increase in the catalytic activity of nickel in the carbon dioxide conversion of methane (CDCM). Immediately after the self-oscillatory reaction, the crystals in the porous layer were in an oxidized state. In this state, they can remain at 750°C in a flow of an inert gas or CO2 without catalytic activity losses. On the contrary, the oxide crystals were reduced to the metal in a reducing atmosphere (H2, CH4), and they gradually stuck together to form a spongy structure whose surface area was much lower than that of the initial oxidized sample. A decrease in the catalytic activity of nickel after reducing pretreatment and in the course of the catalytic CDCM (where the catalyst was also reduced) confirmed the above conclusion. The porous layer on the Ni surface was similar to a Ni foam sample with pores of ~1 μm (metallic membrane) in catalytic and reactive properties, but it differed in a limited depth on the surface of the bulk metal. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","CO2 conversion of methane; methane oxidation; Ni foam; nickel; self-oscillations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102124929

We analyse about 2500 blog articles from prominent CTTs in the USA and Germany between 2008 and 2016. Our results show that sceptical arguments about climate policy and science dominate the countermovement. At the same time, we detect that the prevalence of counterclaims is CTT-specific and that US think tanks show a greater variability compared to their German counterparts. In a surprising outcome, we find that the Paris Agreement did not affect the climate denial movement.

Urban soils play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Due to natural and human influences on various forms of C, quantifying soil inorganic carbon (SIC) becomes critical in urban areas. In this study, the suitability of diffuse reflectance mid-infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (mid-DRIFTS) to rapidly estimate calcite and dolomite concentrations was tested. Also, the effectiveness of HCl acid pre-treatment to remove carbonates to enable proper estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in urban soils was evaluated. Specific mid-infrared frequencies known to be associated with carbonates, i.e. dolomite and calcite, were identified, and specific peak areas were measured and calibrated with results obtained with the volumetric calcimeter method. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate total carbonates with peaks areas at 2930 cm−1, 2515 cm−1 and 730 cm−1 resulting in a 3.72% root mean squared error of an independent validation set (RMSEV). Greater prediction accuracy of calcite (875 cm−1) and dolomite (875 cm−1 and 730 cm−1) were achieved using single peaks in bivariate relationships resulting in RMSEV of 1.27% and 4.22%, respectively. Soil samples were treated with 1 M HCl for 24 h to remove carbonates, and total carbonate, dolomite, and calcite contents were estimated again using both volumetric calcimeter and mid-DRIFTS. The reduction in carbonate concentrations post-acid treatment was considerable (97% for dolomite, and 96% for calcite and total carbonates), but was not complete. Thus, this could compromise quantification of other soil carbon fractions such as total SOC. Using mid-DRIFTS peak areas of CO3−2 functional groups represents a robust alternative for rapid, fast, and low-cost laboratory measurements of soil carbonates, and this high-throughput approach may be used in assays aiming to minimize carbonate interference in SOC estimations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Calcite; Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy; Dolomite; Gasometric method; Soil inorganic carbon; Urban soils; Volumetric calcimeter","Calcite; Carbonation; Chlorine compounds; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrochloric acid; Infrared devices; Linear regression; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Soil surveys; Urban planning; Carbonate concentrations; Fourier transform spectroscopy; High-throughput approaches; Laboratory measurements; Multiple linear regressions; Root mean squared errors; Soil inorganic carbons; Soil organic carbon; Soils; assessment method; calcite; carbon cycle; carbonate; concentration (composition); detection method; dolomite; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil property; urban area; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093685292

Decarbonization of the energy sector is one of the main aims and sustainable use of biogas is one of the ways to reach these targets. Although the biogas sector in Latvia is now mainly based on the production of electricity and heat in cogeneration plants, often using specially grown energy crops, and payments of the mandatory procurement component have expired, biogas plants are preparing for reconstruction for the production of biomethane with the help of European fund investments. It means that the biogas sector is moving towards a completely different operating model, based primarily on the management of agricultural waste as a feedstock, the conversion of biogas to biomethane and it is used mainly in the transport sector, but its implementation in practical terms faces various challenges. In this context, this article offers a clear vision of the development of the biogas sector in the next decade in Latvia.

Two plateaus in flux are separated by a variable interval lasting ∼10 ks, which shows dipping then flaring stages. The variability is strongest (with fractional variability up to FVar ∼ 10 per cent) at high energies and reduces as the contribution from disc emission becomes stronger. Flux-resolved spectra show that the variability is primarily due to the power-law flux changing. We also find a long soft lag of the thermal behind the power-law emission, which is 20+1.6 -1.2 s during the flaring phase. The lag during the dipping stage has a different lag-energy spectrum, which may be due to a wave passing outwards through the disc. Time-resolved spectral fitting suggests that the lag during the flaring stage may be due to the disc re-filling after being disrupted to produce the power-law flare, perhaps related to the system settling after the jet ejection which occurred around 1 d before. The time-scales of these phenomena imply a low viscosity parameter, α ∼ 10-3, for the inner region of the disc. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

Therefore, traditional control strategies and diagnosis approaches cannot achieve these goals. Accordingly, to address these shortcomings, researchers have developed plenty of innovative methods based on their applications and features. The main purpose of this paper is to review recent publications that include both hard and soft computing implementations such as model predictive control and machine learning algorithms with applications also on both fourth and fifth generation district heating and cooling networks.

Non-polar (112¯0) (or a-plane) GaN exhibits a range of different extended defects compared with its more commonly used c-plane counterpart. In order to reduce the number of defects and investigate their impact on luminescence uniformity, non-polar GaN was overgrown on four different GaN microstructures. The micro-patterned structures consist of a regular microrod array; a microrod array where the -c-side of the microrods has been etched to suppress defect generation; etched periodic stripes and finally a subsequent combination of etched stripes and etched microrods (double overgrowth). Overall the presence of extended defects, namely threading dislocations and stacking faults (SFs) is greatly reduced for the two samples containing stripes compared with the two microrod samples. This is evidenced by more uniform emission and reduction in dark regions of non-radiative recombination in room temperature cathodoluminescence imaging as well as a reduction of the SF emission line in low temperature photoluminescence. The observed energy shifts of the GaN near band edge emission are related to anisotropic strain relaxation occurring during the overgrowth on these microstructures.

We model zero-carbon electricity systems for the continental US using technologies currently deployed at gigawatt-scale—solar, wind, existing hydropower, lithium-ion batteries, and transmission. Inter-state operational coordination reduces the cost of decarbonization; allowing new inter-state transmission reduces cost further. Nuclear power and long-duration energy storage have the potential to reduce system cost but are not necessary for decarbonization; all sensitivity cases deploy hundreds of gigawatts of new solar and wind. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Preventing global warming in excess of 1.5°C–2°C requires a transition to zero-carbon electricity systems by midcentury along with the widespread electrification of other sectors. Current state-level renewable portfolio standards and regional transmission arrangements do not capture the benefits of inter-regional transmission or coordination of planning and dispatch for renewable-energy integration. Here, using a co-optimized capacity-planning and dispatch model over 7 years of hourly operation, we show that inter-state coordination and transmission expansion reduce the system cost of electricity in a 100%-renewable US power system by 46% compared with a state-by-state approach, from 135 $/MWh to 73 $/MWh. Sensitivity analyses show that reductions in the cost of photovoltaics, wind, and lithium-ion batteries lead to the lowest electricity costs for systems in which transmission expansion is allowed, while cost reductions for nuclear power or long-duration energy storage lead to greater electricity cost reductions for isolated systems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Averting the worst effects of climate change requires decarbonizing the electricity sector as rapidly as possible. Given the urgency of action and the uncertainty inherent in new technology development, it is prudent to explore zero-carbon electricity systems limited to technologies currently being deployed at gigawatt-scale. Here, we model zero-carbon electricity systems for the continental US using solar photovoltaics, wind power, existing hydropower, lithium-ion batteries, and transmission, incorporating 7 years of hourly weather data from tens of thousands of available sites. New and existing long-distance transmission significantly reduces the system cost of electricity and the amount of energy storage required for reliable zero-carbon electricity. Streamlining the planning and permitting process for new transmission and coordinating decarbonization at the national (rather than state) level could enable a more efficient and rapid transition to a zero-carbon electricity system. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","capacity-expansion modeling; electric power systems; energy storage; energy system modeling; linear optimization; renewable energy; solar power; transmission; wind power","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission; Emission control; Expansion; Global warming; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Sensitivity analysis; Transmissions; Wind power; Climate change mitigation; Long distance transmission; New technology development; Regional coordination; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable portfolio standard; Solar photovoltaics; Transmission expansion; Electric load dispatching; alternative energy; climate change; electricity generation; energy storage; linearity; optimization; solar power; wind power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098110725

Net losses in salt marsh areas, both modelled globally and measured regionally, are therefore of concern. Amongst other controls, the persistence of salt marshes in any one location depends on the ability of their substrates to resist hydrodynamic forcing at the marsh front, along creek margins and on the vegetated surface. Where relative sea level is rising, marsh elevation must keep pace with sea-level rise and landward expansion may be required to compensate for areal loss at exposed margins. This paper reviews current understanding of marsh substrate resistance to the near-instantaneous (seconds to hours) forcing induced by hydrodynamic processes. It outlines how variability in substrate properties may affect marsh substrate stability, explores current understanding of the interactions between substrate properties and erosion processes, and how the cumulative impact of these interactions may affect marsh stability over annual to decadal timescales. Whilst important advances have been made in understanding how specific soil properties affect near-instantaneous marsh substrate stability, less is known about how these properties interact and alter bulk substrate resistance to hydrodynamic forcing. Future research requires a more systematic approach to quantifying biological and sedimentological marsh substrate properties. These properties must then be linked to specific observable erosion processes, particularly at the marsh front and along creek banks. A better understanding of the intrinsic dynamics and processes acting on, and within, salt marsh substrates will facilitate improved prediction of marsh evolution under future hydrodynamic forcing scenarios. Notwithstanding the additional complications that arise from morphodynamic feedbacks, this would allow us to more accurately model the future potential protection from flooding and erosion afforded by marshes, while also increasing the effectiveness of salt marsh restoration and recreation schemes. © 2020 The Authors.

This very ambitious goal will require many political, social and economic activities. Huge financial resources will also be needed to change the economy in order to reduce the emissions of harmful substances into the environment. The implementation of such an ambitious climate policy requires the development of a very reasonable economic plan, backed by many analyses, to ensure adequate financing of this idea. One of the basic objectives of such a plan should be to appropriately target aid funds to a group of countries with a similar structure of the emissions in question. The identification of the groups of similar countries in terms of the structure of harmful substance emissions requires the development of both appropriate methodology and applicable studies. Such methodology is presented in this paper, namely the Kohonen's artificial neural network model. The main objective of the developed methodology was to divide the European Union countries into groups similar in terms of the emissions of selected gases and dusts into the atmosphere. In addition to the division of the European Union countries into similar groups by the total volume of the emissions of studied substances, completely new division criteria were introduced. It was assumed that in order for the results of this study to be practically used, it is necessary to broaden the scope of the analysis. Therefore, an additional division of the European Union countries was made in relation to the volume of the emissions per capita, the value of gross domestic product and the area of a given country. This new approach was intended to show the diversity of the European Union countries in economic, demographic and geographical terms. The grouping results should be regarded as additional information to be utilized when preparing specific action plans to improve the state of the environment. Definitely, these plans need to be dedicated both to the groups of countries and the entire sectors in these groups. This will enable the efficient use of financial resources and can be a huge impetus for the European Union economic development. It will also allow smaller and less prosperous countries to achieve their goals. Undoubtedly, the developed methodology and conducted research allowed the authors to solve a significant research problem, and the results can be successfully used in practice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Greenhouse gases; Kohonen's neutral network; Similarity of european union countries; The european green deal","Economics; Finance; Artificial neural network modeling; Division criteria; Economic activities; European Union countries; Financial resources; Gross domestic products; Harmful substances; Research problems; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089660415

Most predictive models of community responses to climate change ignore individual-level biotic interactions despite their known importance for community diversity and functioning. Here, we consider plant fitness and diversity responses to climate change associated factors at three organisational levels: communities, populations and individual plants, to increase our understanding of how plant communities respond to climate change. Location: Montane grassland, Tasmania, Australia. Methods: In two plant communities, we manipulated temperature using open-top chambers and removed random and dominant species biomass. Two years after experimental manipulations, we assessed the impact of treatments on species diversity, community- and population-level functional traits and individual plant fitness. Results: Species diversity was affected by warming in one of the two communities, while community-level functional trait diversity metrics were unaffected by treatments. Mean community trait values were strongly impacted by dominant species biomass removal in both communities, notably increasing specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length. SLA showed the strongest population-level trait response, with higher values found in warmed plots and lower values found in dominant species biomass removal plots. Neighbours had a stronger competitive effect on individual plant fitness in warmed compared to unwarmed conditions at the higher-elevation site and facilitation was common in both communities. Conclusions: We demonstrated that over short time scales, plant communities respond to experimental warming and biomass removal across multiple organisational levels. Competitive and facilitative interactions played a significant role in determining fitness outcomes, but competitive interactions dominated under warmed conditions. We highlight the importance of local-scale biotic interactions in mediating individual responses to warming and recommend their inclusion in future studies of how climate change will impact the long-term structure and function of plant communities through short-term impacts on individual plant fitness. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","biomass removal; biotic interactions; climate change; competition; facilitation; fitness; functional diversity; grassland; trait; warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101865499

The possibility of converting the greenhouse gas CO2 into useful materials that can be used as synthetic building blocks or, remarkably, as carbon fuels makes Ni-CODH a very promising target for reverse-engineering studies. In this context, in order to provide insights into the chemical principles underlying the biological catalysis of CO2 activation and reduction, quantum mechanics calculations have been carried out in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) on different-sized models of the Ni-CODH active site. With the aim of uncovering which stereoelectronic properties of the active site (known as the C-cluster) are crucial for the efficient binding and release of CO2, different coordination modes of CO2 to different forms and redox states of the C-cluster have been investigated. The results obtained from this study highlight the key role of the protein environment in tuning the reactivity and the geometry of the C-cluster. In particular, the protonation state of His93 is found to be crucial for promoting the binding or the dissociation of CO2. The oxidation state of the C-cluster is also shown to be critical. CO2 binds to Cred2 according to a dissociative mechanism (i.e., CO2 binds to the C-cluster after the release of possible ligands from Feu) when His93 is doubly protonated. CO2 can also bind noncatalytically to Cred1 according to an associative mechanism (i.e., CO2 binding is preceded by the binding of H2O to Feu). Conversely, CO2 dissociates when His93 is singly protonated and the C-cluster is oxidized at least to the Cint redox state. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculations; Carbon monoxide; Density functional theory; Dissociation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Iron compounds; Protonation; Proven reserves; Quantum theory; Reduction; Reverse engineering; Synthetic fuels; Associative mechanisms; Biological catalysis; Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; Chemical principles; Dissociative mechanisms; First-principles calculation; Reversible reduction; Synthetic building blocks; Carbon dioxide; aldehyde dehydrogenase; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; iron; multienzyme complex; nickel; binding site; chemical structure; chemistry; density functional theory; metabolism; molecular model; X ray crystallography; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Binding Sites; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Crystallography, X-Ray; Density Functional Theory; Iron; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Multienzyme Complexes; Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098982638

The road transport sector is a major contributor to this poor air quality. To reduce the emission of particulate matter, all diesel passenger cars were equipped with diesel particulate filters since the EURO5b emission standard. Unfortunately, these filters can be damaged or intentionally removed during the lifetime of a vehicle. This work presents the particle number emission factors for EURO5 and EURO6 diesel passenger cars, based on the measurements of 757 vehicles. These measurements were performed at low idle, which shows a high correlation to particle number emission factors obtained during homologation cycles or real-driving emission measurements. The results show that the average Particle Number (PN) emission factors are highly impacted by high emitters present in the fleet and that the mileage has a significant impact on the PN emission factors. Finally, the estimated PN emission factors based on low idle measurements were higher by a factor 5.6 for EURO5a, 2.5 for EURO5b and 5.5 for EURO6, compared to their respective HBEFA (Handbook Emission Factors for Road, Transport) emission factors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Degradation; Diesel Particulate Filter; Emission factor; Emission model; Particle number; Particulate matter","Air quality; Automobiles; Diesel engines; Roads and streets; Diesel particulate filters; Diesel passenger cars; Emission factors; Emission measurement; Emission standard; Particle number emission; Particulate Matter; Road transport sectors; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; automobile; diesel; emission; equipment; factor analysis; pollution effect; road transport; traffic emission; age distribution; air quality; ambient air; arithmetic; Article; child; controlled study; diesel engine; human; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; ultrafine particulate matter; urban population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092491451

Fluvial sediments spanning the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary of southern Saskatchewan, Canada contain well preserved plant wax n-alkanes that provide a means of reconstructing changes to plant ecology and carbon and water cycling during this mass extinction event. We measured n-alkane carbon (δ13C) and hydrogen (δ2H) isotope ratios in two sedimentary sections and applied established fractionation factors to estimate the isotopic compositions of precipitation and bulk sedimentary organic matter sources. We also analyzed the distribution of n-alkanes as an indicator of the relative abundance of aquatic and terrestrial plants. We find a consistent shift towards a greater relative abundance of longer-chain n-alkanes across the boundary, implying a persistent increase in the relative abundance of terrestrial plants in the sedimentary basin. This is consistent with an increase in birch and elm palynomorphs immediately above the boundary. We hypothesize the extinction of all large herbivores at the boundary may have facilitated this transition to a terrestrial angiosperm dominated flora immediately after the boundary. We also find that the region was characterized by isotopically light precipitation, with δ2H values between −95‰ to −160‰, but do not observe evidence for major millennial-scale changes in regional precipitation isotopic composition spanning the boundary. n-Alkanes derived from both aquatic and terrestrial plants at one site display an upward trend in δ13C values of approximately 2‰ across the K-Pg boundary. This suggests millennial-scale local or global carbon-cycle variability altering either plant carbon isotope fractionation or the carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon and atmospheric CO2. Overall our results suggest that carbon and water cycle changes associated with the K-Pg impact in terrestrial environments in western Canada were short-lived, but ecological shifts in plant communities were longer-lasting. © 2020","Carbon isotopes; Compound specific isotope analysis; Hydrogen isotopes; Mass extinction; Paleohydrology; Plant wax lipids","angiosperm; carbon isotope; Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; extinction; fluvial deposit; isotopic composition; isotopic fractionation; plant community; reconstruction; terrestrial ecosystem; Canada; Saskatchewan; Indicator indicator; Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095851890

Seventeen sustainable development goals were defined. Algae (macro and microalgae) have the potential to respond to some of the world's most pressing challenges. In this chapter, the sustainable development goals will be approached by proposing solutions based on algae and on key players who utilize them in a healthy functioning of the global ecosystem. We propose a vision of a responsible seaweed industry, playing a globally significant role in food security, climate change mitigation, and supporting the marine ecosystem, as well as contributing to job-creation and economic growth.

For instance, COVID-19 and climate change affect deprived and vulnerable communities the most, which implies that effectively designed policies that mitigate these risks may also reduce the widening inequalities that they cause. Both problems can be characterized as low-probability–high consequence (LP-HC) risks, which are associated with various behavioral biases that imply that individual behavior deviates from rational risk assessments by experts and optimal preparedness strategies. One could view the COVID-19 pandemic as a rapid learning experiment about how to cope more effectively with climate change and develop actions for reducing its impacts before it is too late. However, the ensuing question relates to whether the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath will speed up climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, which depends on how individuals perceive and take action to reduce LP-HC risks. Using insights into behavioral biases in individual decisions about LP-HC risks based on decades of empirical research in psychology and behavioral economics, we illustrate how parallels can be drawn between decision-making processes about COVID-19 and climate change. In particular, we discuss six important risk-related behavioral biases in the context of individual decision making about these two global challenges to derive lessons for climate policy. We contend that the impacts from climate change can be mitigated if we proactively draw lessons from the pandemic, and implement policies that work with, instead of against, an individual's risk perceptions and biases. We conclude with recommendations for communication policies that make people pay attention to climate change risks and for linking government responses to the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath with environmental sustainability and climate action. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral biases; Climate policy; COVID-19; Decision making under risk; Risk perception",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091992209

This paradigm entails the inclusion of aspects not strictly related to energy exploitation but referring to environmental, social, and economic domains, such as improvement in local energy security, people’s opinion on different energy solutions, economic co-benefits for private users, environmental externalities, and so on. In this domain, it is of particular importance to provide the decision makers with evaluation tools able to consider the complexity of the impacts, thus leading to the choice of the most sustainable solutions. The paper aims to investigate the scientific literature in the context of evaluation frameworks for supporting decision problems related to the energy transition. The review is carried out through the scientific database SCOPUS. The analysis allows for systematizing the contributions according to the main families of evaluation methodologies, discussing to what extent they can be useful in real-world applications. The paper also proposes emerging trends and innovative research lines in the domain of energy planning and urban management. While the energy transition is an important trend, the analysis showed that few studies were conducted on the evaluation of projects, plans, and policies that aim to reach post-carbon targets.

Analysis for buildings in the United States show that current thermal load is more than one order of magnitude higher than TMTL. To realize the TMTL, this perspective proposes technology needs in the near and long term, such as advanced zonal control, radiative heating, thermal textiles, and thermal energy storage. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Building cooling and heating accounts for a large portion of total global energy use and requires commensurate amounts of resources, which contribute significantly to global warming. Traditionally, addressing this issue has meant improving the efficiency of equipment supplying the thermal energy, reducing envelope heat transfer, and reducing air infiltration. However, this approach is already reaching practical limits. In this perspective, we explore (1) how to reduce thermal load in buildings theoretically and (2) how to achieve that reduction and dramatically lower the energy required to support building loads practically. First, we discuss our framework developed for calculating the theoretical minimum thermal load (TMTL) in buildings. Our analysis shows that current thermal loads in buildings are more than an order of magnitude higher than the TMTL. We also introduce an approximate formula to calculate energy savings from zonal control of thermal load, which shows that the majority of zonal control benefits can be achieved with fewer than 10 zones. Then, we discuss pros and cons of various approaches and strategies to achieve the TMTL. We conclude our perspective with some longer-term R&D ideas, such as thermally adaptive clothing and thermal storage to help approach the TMTL, while providing the additional benefit of interacting with the renewable grid of the future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Space conditioning for thermal comfort within buildings is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions globally, creating an urgent need to realize deep energy reductions in this energy service to meet climate goals. Our current approach to providing thermal comfort relies on conditioning large spaces. In this perspective, we show that this approach is inherently energy inefficient by introducing and calculating the TMTL needed to keep building occupants thermally comfortable. The TMTL is approached when the space conditioning volume aligns with the immediate volume occupied by the individual. We show that such an approach could deliver 10× reductions in energy use for space conditioning in buildings and homes in the US. To investigate near-term solutions to approaching the TMTL, we develop a simple approximate model to calculate the energy savings from increasing zonal control of buildings and homes. We use this model to show that increasing the number of zones in a building to 10 with modest temperature setbacks can deliver up to a 70% energy reduction. We highlight technologies available today that could facilitate increased zonal control. We also identify long-term technology development needs, highlighting current research that supports approaching the TMTL. Specifically, we highlight advances and research needs in thermally adaptive clothing, radiative heating, and thermal energy storage combined with thermal switches that could further facilitate the TMTL. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","heating and cooling of buildings; human comfort in buildings; thermal load in buildings; thermal storage; thermal zoning in buildings; thermally active clothing; thermally active textiles","Approximation algorithms; Buildings; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat radiation; Heat storage; Radiant heating; Thermal comfort; Thermal energy; Thermal load; Approximate formulas; Approximate model; Energy reduction; Minimizing energy; Radiative heating; Space conditioning; Technology development; Theoretical minimum; Energy efficiency; building; cooling; energy use; heat transfer; heating; temperature anomaly; textile industry; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099205377

The aim of this study is to: (1) evaluate the land use change in Chonburi Province; the most urbanised city in the EEC of Thailand between 2006 and 2016, and (2) assess the land use change impact on ESV. Secondary data from land use maps for 2006 and 2016 was used to evaluate land use change and its impact on ESV using the land use transition matrix, land use dynamic degree, and the benefit transfer method. Urban and built-up land use were found to dominate other use types. The top three highest annual rates of land use change were found in water bodies, rangeland, and urban and built-up land. The ESV in 2016 was found to be 1.31% higher than for 2006. The ecosystem service functions (ESFs) contributing to the increase in ESV were waste treatment, hydrological regulation, climate regulation and recreation and service culture. Future land use planning should focus on increasing wetlands and protecting agricultural land in the study area since these contribute to the highest ESV.

Precipitation extremes will change due to global warming, but these low frequency events are difficult to analyse using (short) observed time series. In this study, we analysed large 2000 year ensembles of present day climate and of a 2 and 3°C warmer world produced with the EC-Earth model. We performed a regional assessment of climate indicators related to temperature and precipitation (positive degree days, accumulated precipitation, [pre- and post-] monsoon precipitation), their sensitivity to temperature change and the change in return periods of extreme temperature and precipitation in a 2 and 3°C warmer climate. In general, the 2°C warmer world shows a homogeneous response of changes in climate indicators and return periods, while distinct differences between regions are present in a 3°C warmer world and changes no longer follow a general trend. This non-linear effect can indicate the presence of a tipping point in the climate system. The most affected regions are located in monsoon-dominated regions, where precipitation amounts, positive degree days, extreme temperature, extreme precipitation and compound events are projected to increase the most. Largest changes in climate indicators are found in East Himalaya, followed by the Hindu Kush and West and Central Himalaya regions. Western regions will experience drier summers and wetter winters, while monsoon dominated regions drier winters and wetter summers and northern regions a wetter climate year round. We also found that precipitation increases in HMA in a 3°C warmer world are substantially larger (13%) compared to the global average (5.9%). Additionally, the increase in weather extremes will exacerbate natural hazards with large possible impacts for mountain communities. The results of this study could provide important guidance for formulating climate change adaptation strategies in HMA. © 2020 The Authors International Journal of Climatology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Meteorological Society.","climate change; compound events; EC-Earth; High Mountain Asia; large ensemble modelling; mountain; return periods; weather extremes","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Disasters; Global warming; Landforms; Precipitation (meteorology); Climate change adaptation; Climate indicators; Extreme precipitation; Extreme temperatures; Monsoon precipitation; Natural disasters; Precipitation extremes; Sensitivity to temperatures; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; future prospect; mountain environment; numerical model; regional climate; return period; weather; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089527431

In 2017, energy industries accounted for 46% of all CO2 emissions globally, which shows a large potential for reduction. This paper proposes a novel short-term CO2 emissions forecast to enable intelligent scheduling of flexible electricity consumption to minimize the resulting CO2 emissions. Two proposed time series decomposition methods are developed for short-term forecasting of the CO2 emissions of electricity. These are in turn bench-marked against a set of state-of-the-art models. The result is a new forecasting method with a 48-hour horizon targeted the day-ahead electricity market. Forecasting benchmarks for France show that the new method has a mean absolute percentage error that is 25% lower than the best performing state-of-the-art model. Further, application of the forecast for scheduling flexible electricity consumption is studied for five European countries. Scheduling a flexible block of 4 h of electricity consumption in a 24 h interval can on average reduce the resulting CO2 emissions by 25% in France, 17% in Germany, 69% in Norway, 20% in Denmark, and just 3% in Poland when compared to consuming at random intervals during the day. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Demand flexibility; Forecasting","Carbon dioxide; Electric industry; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Scheduling; Day-ahead electricity market; Decomposition approach; Electricity-consumption; Forecasting methods; Intelligent scheduling; Mean absolute percentage error; Short-term forecasting; Time series decomposition; Power markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094104891

It may help to improve the simulation of biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes on regional and global scales in the framework of climate and land use change. In this study, the performance of the crop module of the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) was evaluated at point scale with site-specific field data focusing on the simulation of seasonal and inter-annual variations in crop growth, planting and harvesting cycles, and crop yields, as well as water, energy, and carbon fluxes. In order to better represent agricultural sites, the model was modified by (1) implementing the winter wheat subroutines following Lu et al. (2017) in CLM5; (2) implementing plant-specific parameters for sugar beet, potatoes, and winter wheat, thereby adding the two crop functional types (CFTs) for sugar beet and potatoes to the list of actively managed crops in CLM5; and (3) introducing a cover-cropping subroutine that allows multiple crop types on the same column within 1 year. The latter modification allows the simulation of cropping during winter months before usual cash crop planting begins in spring, which is an agricultural management technique with a long history that is regaining popularity as it reduces erosion and improves soil health and carbon storage and is commonly used in the regions evaluated in this study. We compared simulation results with field data and found that both the new crop-specific parameterization and the winter wheat subroutines led to a significant simulation improvement in terms of energy fluxes (root-mean-square error, RMSE, reduction for latent and sensible heat by up to 57 % and 59 %, respectively), leaf area index (LAI), net ecosystem exchange, and crop yield (up to 87 % improvement in winter wheat yield prediction) compared with default model results. The cover-cropping subroutine yielded a substantial improvement in representation of field conditions after harvest of the main cash crop (winter season) in terms of LAI magnitudes, seasonal cycle of LAI, and latent heat flux (reduction of wintertime RMSE for latent heat flux by 42 %).

Such practice is responsible for extra reactive N (Nr) load to the environment, but data are not available. Nitrous oxide (N2O) data were collected from a field trial following static closed-chamber technique, which were used for calibration and validation of DeNitrification and DeComposition model along with soil clay fraction, pH, bulk density and organic carbon contents. The model was well fitted and estimated about 364 g N2O–N ha−1 emission in Rajshahi region and only 15 g N2O–N ha−1 in Barisal region. District-wise N2O–N emissions varied from &lt; 1–15.96 t season−1. In 2011–2016, N2O–N emissions from wheat fields were about 103–129 t yr−1 in Bangladesh. The model estimated nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3) and nitrate (NO3) fluxes varied from 0.012 to 0.447, 7 to 12.5 and 0 to 4.7 kg N ha−1, respectively, under ambient temperature condition. In about 79% yield variabilities were explainable by N2O emission. In dominant wheat growing areas, if sowing is started from 15 to 30 November, N2O emission could be reduced by 8–40% with 5–13% reduction in yields compared to 10 November sowing. In similar areas and same sowing date with 1.5 °C temperature rise, N2O emission may increase by 8–45% and wheat yield might reduce by about 4–8%. Time of seeding and other cultural management in wheat cultivation would be the main avenue for reducing Nr loads to the environment. © 2021, The Author(s).","DNDC; Sowing time; Static close chamber; Temperature rise; Yield","Ammonia; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Calibration and validations; Cultural management; Decomposition model; Organic carbon contents; Reactive nitrogen species; Soil clay fractions; Spatiotemporal distributions; Temperature conditions; Cultivation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100807860

It is a prominent collective intelligence application producing significant benefits both for individuals (reduced costs) and for the entire community (reduced pollution and traffic). Despite these very promising potential advantages, the percentage of users who currently adopt ridesharing solutions is very low, well below the adoption rate required to achieve said benefits. One of the reasons of this insufficient engagement by the public is the lack of effective incentive policies by regulatory authorities, who are not able to estimate the costs and the benefits of a given ridesharing adoption policy. Here we address these issues by (i) developing a novel algorithm that makes large-scale, real-time peer-to-peer ridesharing technologically feasible; and (ii) exhaustively quantifying the impact of different ridesharing scenarios in terms of environmental benefits (i.e., reduction of CO2 emissions, noise pollution, and traffic congestion) and quality of service for the users. Our analysis on a real-world dataset shows that major societal benefits are expected from deploying peer-to-peer ridesharing depending on the trade-off between environmental benefits and quality of service.

The community is not currently overwhelmed by climate change impacts, and has local agents and institutions in place to facilitate anticipatory climate adaptation planning. However, as seen with many other coastal communities, implementation of adaptation action is lagging in practice. Framed through the lens of resilience theory, this research investigates climate change threats and the dynamic relationship between local scale adaptation policy development, integration and implementation in practice. With Surrey as a case study, this research examines key actor narratives and strategic planning documents in order to understand how the community acts on climate change adaptation while being mandated to address mitigation. Findings suggests that while resilience building agents (e.g. senior management, elected officials) can spearhead and organize climate action, their ability to implement goals and policies in practice is largely determined by the robustness of institutions (e.g. strategic plans, policies) and systems (e.g. infrastructure, ecosystems). This case may provide decision-makers in other communities coping with similar climate threats with insight into the factors that can enable and challenge local adaptation planning processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change impacts; Climate resilience; Coastal community; Strategic policy; Urban planning","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone management; decision making; environmental planning; environmental policy; mitigation; policy implementation; strategic approach; urban planning; British Columbia; Canada; Surrey [British Columbia]; Chlorocrambe hastata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094097842

This is vital to save energy, diminish energy costs and attain global emission targets. This paper proposes the design of a voting based smart energy management system (VSEMS) of a grid-connected solar-wind-biomass based hybrid energy system. VSEMS utilizes a novel rule-based energy management algorithm (EMA) for taking its decisions. The proposed approach increases customer participation in the decision-making related to their energy supply and also control the intermittency of renewable energy sources efficiently. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm in the real-world environment is validated by doing a case study analysis using yearly usage profile.

METHODS: Cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 366 research participants selected through multi-stage random sampling technique in Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan. Heat Index was assessed using secondary analysis of meteorological data of Nepalgunj (Airport) station. Chi-square test was done to analyze the primary data. RESULTS: Out of 366 participants, 224 (61.2%) participants had heat related symptoms in the past 6 months (April to September) from the date of the interview. Sex, education, income, roof construction, Cross-ventilation, working hour per day, presence of chronic disease, and medications use had a significant association with heat related symptoms among the participants (p<0.05) The most common coping strategies adopted to manage heat stress were the use of cooling methods, wearing light clothing, and bathing by cold water. The average monthly heat index was highest in August (42 °C) and lowest in April (29°C). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the participants had heat related symptoms in the study area. In order to mitigate the heat stress in the urban town like Nepalgunj, measures such as tree plantation, reducing vehicle smoke emissions, and developing proper housing ventilation can be applied.","Climate change; coping strategy; heat index; heat stress; Nepal.","climate change; cross-sectional study; heat; heat injury; heat shock response; human; Nepal; Climate Change; Cross-Sectional Studies; Heat Stress Disorders; Heat-Shock Response; Hot Temperature; Humans; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100526269

Climate data derived from some terrestrial and marine sediments from the Neogene suggests the onset and intensification of the SAM to a near-modern state occurred during the Miocene, while modelling and other terrestrial proxies point to a much earlier origin for the proto-East Asia monsoon (EAM) and proto-SAM. Angiosperm leaves, particularly dicot leaves, provide a good indication of prevailing climatic conditions as a result of key adaptations in their leaf structure. Here we use Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) in conjunction with general circulation models to decode the Lower (~13–11 Ma) and Middle (9.5–6.8 Ma) Siwalik climate signal inherent in the physiognomy of fossil leaves. The reconstructed climate data indicates that the Middle Siwalik was warmer and wetter than the Lower Siwalik, particularly in the cooler part the year. The leaf physiognomy of Lower and Middle Siwalik assemblages is indistinguishable to that of the modern leaf assemblages, which are influenced by today's SAM climate. This shows that the SAM was already well established as an independent domain during the late middle Miocene (~13–11 Ma) and has remained nearly the same from the perspective of leaf adaptations since then. A quantitative monsoon intensity index indicates an intensified monsoon during the late Miocene (9.5–6.8 Ma), a finding replicated by climate modelling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CLAMP; Dicot leaves; Nepal; Siwalik","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Multivariant analysis; Submarine geology; Climate signals; Climatic conditions; Complex nature; General circulation model; Marine sediments; Middle Miocene; Monsoon intensity; Tibetan Plateau; Climate models; angiosperm; climate signal; historical record; leaf; marine sediment; Miocene; monsoon; Neogene; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; China; Far East; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Siwalik Hills; South Asia; Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096239467

Information about the possible development and marketability of RES in the electricity sector is essential for assessing future funding needs. However, rising shares of fluctuating RES generation in the energy system reduce the average market prices and increase price volatility. Balancing price variations requires a considerable degree of flexibility. Additional flexibility in the electricity market through closer interconnection between the electricity sector and other demand sectors makes it possible to keep the market values of RES closer to the general market price level, irrespective of their shares. Such sector coupling can thus contribute to a cost-efficient transition to a low-carbon energy system. This paper examines the impact of efficient sector coupling on the market values of RES in a European energy system with ambitious decarbonization. We analyze different scenarios by applying the Enertile model, which uses an integrated cost optimization approach with flexibility options due to sector coupling and provides a detailed future development of RES. In our analysis, we examine three flexibility options: smart charging of electric vehicles, decentralized heat pumps in buildings, and multivalent district heating grids. We show that the flexible use of electricity in district heating has a significant impact on market values, while the impact of both flexible electric vehicle charging and flexible heating with heat pumps is rather small. Short-term flexibility due to load shifting of the charging or heating process shows only a limited effect on market values. Fuel switching in district heating, however, offers the possibility to change the absolute demand for electricity in direct response to RES feed-in and drastically reduces the curtailment of RES. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","European energy system; Flexibility; Market value; Optimization model; Renewable electricity integration; Sector coupling","District heating; Electric automobiles; Electric industry; Fossil fuels; Heat pump systems; Renewable energy resources; Vehicle-to-grid; Additional flexibilities; Climate protection; Cost-efficient transition; Degree of flexibility; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity sector; Low-carbon energy systems; Renewable energy source; Commerce; alternative energy; cost analysis; electric vehicle; electricity generation; fossil fuel; heating; price dynamics; pumping; scenario analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094892425

The effect of feedstock composition on co-digestion efficiency was examined. Two feedstocks with different contents of WG (6%, 13%) were used, which affected the COD:TKN ratios in those feedstocks (60, 100). LeachateOFMSW provided nitrogen and the micro- and macroelements. In both feedstocks, the N–NH4:TKN ratio was low (0.08), indicating that the dominant form of nitrogen was organic nitrogen (Norg). Co-digestion was carried out in upflow anaerobic-sludge blanket reactors (37 ± 2 °C; OLR, 4 kg COD m−3 d−1). This process ensured highly effective COD removal (over 97%). At a feedstock COD:TKN ratio of 60, specific biogas production (SBP) was ca. 0.22 m3 kg−1 COD, and methane content, 61.6%. Increasing the COD:TKN ratio to 100 significantly increased SBP to ca. 0.36 m3 kg−1 COD, but reduced biogas quality (54.2% CH4). Although Norg had to be ammonified to ammonium because of the low N–NH4:TKN ratio in the feedstocks, the ammonium concentration in the post-processing wastewater remained low. Moreover, the low ammonium concentrations meant that the pH (8.8) did not have a toxic effect on anaerobic co-digestion (free ammonia concentrations were merely ca. 28 and 5.5 mg L−1, respectively). However, at higher feedstock COD:TKN ratios than those tested, ammonium could be exhausted, which would impede methane production. These results indicate that WG is an effective co-substrate for leachateOFMSW if an appropriate amount of WG is added to the feedstock. © 2020","Co-digestion; Leachate from aerobic stabilization of OFMSW; Low N–NH4:TKN ratio In the feedstock; Specific biogas production; Waste glycerine from saponification","Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Feedstocks; Glycerol; Hydrolysis; Leachate treatment; Methane; Nitrogen; Sludge digestion; Stabilization; Wastewater treatment; Aerobic stabilization; Ammonium concentrations; Anaerobic co-digestion; Biogas production; Methane production; Organic nitrogen; Specific biogas productions; Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors; Municipal solid waste; ammonia; ammonium; biogas; leachate; methane; municipal solid waste; stabilization; wastewater; wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096975395

The present study evaluates, through an innovative method, the influence of both vegetation cover and climate change on landslide hazards in a Pyrenean valley from the present to 2100. We first focused on assessing future land use and land cover changes through the construction of four prospective socioeconomic scenarios and their projection to 2040 and 2100. Secondly, climate change parameters were used to extract the water saturation of the uppermost layers, according to two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The impacts of land cover and climate change based on these scenarios were then used to modulate the hydromechanical model to compute the factor of safety (FoS) and the hazard levels over the considered area. The results demonstrate the influence of land cover on slope stability through the presence and type of forest. The resulting changes are statistically significant but small and dependent on future land cover linked to the socioeconomic scenarios. In particular, a reduction in human activity results in an increase in slope stability; in contrast, an increase in anthropic activity leads to an opposite evolution in the region, with some reduction in slope stability. Climate change may also have a significant impact in some areas because of the increase in the soil water content; the results indicate a reduction in the FoS in a large part of the study area, depending on the landslide type considered. Therefore, even if future forest growth leads to slope stabilization, the evolution of the groundwater conditions will lead to destabilization. The increasing rate of areas prone to landslides is higher for the shallow landslide type than for the deep landslide type. Interestingly, the evolution of extreme events is related to the frequency of the highest water filling ratio. The results indicate that the occurrences of landslide hazards in the near future (2021-2050 period, scenario RCP8.5) and far future (2071-2100 period, scenario RCP8.5) are expected to increase by factors of 1.5 and 4, respectively. © Author(s) 2021.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; computer simulation; frequency analysis; global change; landslide; saturation; valley; Pyrenees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099541975

However, conducting large-scale population-based surveys is often a difficult task due to time and resource constraints. This paper outlines a machine learning framework—grounded in statistical learning theory and natural language processing—to augment climate change opinion surveys with social media data. The proposed framework maps social media discourse to climate opinion surveys, allowing for discerning the regionally distinct topics and themes that contribute to climate opinions. The analysis reveals significant regional variation in the emergent social media topics associated with climate opinions. Furthermore, significant correlation is identified between social media discourse and climate attitude. However, the dependencies between topic discussion and climate opinion are not always intuitive and often require augmenting the analysis with a topic’s most frequent n-grams and most representative tweets to effectively interpret the relationship. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of how these results can be used in the policy framing process to quickly and effectively understand constituents’ opinions on critical issues. © 2021 Bennett et al.

Wastewater reuse has been constrained by severe clogging of emitters, which caused technical and financial problems. This study aimed to perform an in-depth characterization of the treated wastewater (TWW) in relation to its susceptibility to cause clogging, and to assess the capacity of an aeration post-treatment to reduce the clogging potential. The post-treatment consisted of injecting different airflows (0-33 L/(h Lreactor) into the TWW. The structural, morphological and elemental composition of the clogging matter collected in the irrigation pipeline was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. The 15-day aeration post-treatment at 16.5 L/(h Lreactor) presented the best cost-benefit ratio. Organic matter was totally degraded. Calcium was reduced by 9%, bicarbonates by 54%. The analysis of the deposits induced by the aeration post-treatment revealed a relevant decrease of the major constituents of the clogging deposits found in the irrigation pipeline. The results show the effectiveness of post-aeration in biodegrading residual organic matter and precipitating several salts, thus reducing the clogging potential. © 2021 The Authors Water Science & Technology","Biodegradation; Clogging; Irrigation; Post-aeration; Precipitation; Wastewater reuse","Biogeochemistry; Cost benefit analysis; Deposits; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Golf; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Irrigation; Organic compounds; Pipelines; Scanning electron microscopy; Wastewater reclamation; Clogging potential; Cost benefit ratio; Elemental compositions; Financial problems; Industrial wastewaters; Irrigation pipelines; Treated wastewater; X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy; Wastewater treatment; bicarbonate; calcium; chloride; organic matter; phosphorus; aeration; bicarbonate; detection method; golf course; instrumentation; organic matter; pipeline; wastewater; wastewater treatment; aeration; Article; biodegradation; clogging deposit; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; crystallization; data analysis software; electric conductivity; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; irrigation (agriculture); Morocco; pH; scanning electron microscopy; scanning transmission electron microscopy; waste water management; wastewater; water quality; water supply; X ray diffraction; Agadir; Agricultural Irrigation; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100237129

We measured length growth and net primary production (NPP) of two abundant Sphagnum species across 99 Holarctic peatlands. We tested the importance of previously proposed abiotic and biotic drivers for peatland carbon uptake (climate, N deposition, water table depth and vascular plant cover) on these two responses. Employing structural equation models (SEMs), we explored both indirect and direct effects of drivers on Sphagnum growth. Variation in growth was large, but similar within and between peatlands. Length growth showed a stronger response to predictors than NPP. Moreover, the smaller and denser Sphagnum fuscum growing on hummocks had weaker responses to climatic variation than the larger and looser Sphagnum magellanicum growing in the wetter conditions. Growth decreased with increasing vascular plant cover within a site. Between sites, precipitation and temperature increased growth for S. magellanicum. The SEMs indicate that indirect effects are important. For example, vascular plant cover increased with a deeper water table, increased nitrogen deposition, precipitation and temperature. These factors also influenced Sphagnum growth indirectly by affecting moss shoot density. Synthesis. Our results imply that in a warmer climate, S. magellanicum will increase length growth as long as precipitation is not reduced, while S. fuscum is more resistant to decreased precipitation, but also less able to take advantage of increased precipitation and temperature.

We describe the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and drives of fruit-feeding butterfly diversity in the mountainous region of Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Seven elevations from 822 to 1,388 m a.s.l. were selected for evaluating the effects of abiotic factors and vegetation characteristics on butterfly diversity. A total of 44 fruit-feeding butterfly species were recorded in a two-year study. Species richness (local and regional) of fruit-feeding butterflies decreased with increasing elevation. The interaction between temperature or humidity and precipitation influenced the abundance and β-diversity of butterflies in the elevation gradient, whereas β-diversity decreased with increasing plant richness. Butterfly richness (local and regional) and β-diversity varied with the sampling period, with fewer species in July (2012 and 2013), the dry period, as expected for Neotropical insects. β-Diversity in space and time was due to species replacement (turnover), indicating that butterfly composition differs throughout the mountain and over time. In summary, climate and plant richness largely influence butterfly diversity in the elevational gradient. Climatic changes in conjunction with increasing anthropic impacts on mountainous regions of southeast Brazil will likely influence the community of mountaintop butterflies in the Espinhaço Mountain Range.

During the process, copper chips were loaded into the chamber; then, a rotating tool was plunged into the chips at a specified rotational speed and feed rate. Due to the huge amount of heat generated, the softened material was compressed and synthesized to form a consolidated part.

Sustainable energy is the most appropriate solution to rising energy demand. Because of global interest to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and provide sustainable energy, efforts are being made to supplement the use of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. In this context, wind energy has been identified as one of the promising environmentally friendly, social, and economically beneficial, as a renewable energy option. Wind turbines using the Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) have attracted particular attention because of their advantages such as variable speed, constant frequency (VSCF) operation, reduced voltage flicker, and independent control capabilities for maximum power point tracking (MPPT), active and reactive power controls, and voltage control strategy at the point of common coupling (PCC). When such resources have to be integrated into the existing power system, the operation becomes more challengeable particularly in terms of stability, security, and reliability. This paper presents the study that was used to develop and implement a model to investigate the impacts of the integration of wind energy into the distribution network. This entails the rapid control prototype testing of a grid-connected, variable speed DFIG wind turbines to investigate the steady state and dynamic behavior of each grid integrated wind turbine under normal and disturbance conditions. This model was implemented in the MATLAB / Simulink environment. The control strategy was experimentally validated in a laboratory designed wind turbine (EWT) driven by the CO3208-3A controller, integrated to grid-connected DFIG. © 2021 IEEE.","DFIGs; Distribution Network; Experimentation; Integration; MATLAB / Simulink; Renewable Sources; Wind Energy","Asynchronous generators; Electric fault currents; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Maximum power point trackers; Power control; Reactive power; Sustainable development; Wind power; Wind turbines; Active and reactive power controls; Doubly fed induction generators; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Point of common coupling; Rapid control prototypes; Renewable energy source; Voltage control strategies; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103738604

They are also often exposed to levels of light that are greater than lichen photobionts can use in carbon fixation. Unless regulated, excess energy absorbed by the photobionts can convert ground state oxygen to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can attack the photosynthetic apparatus, causing photoinhibition and photo-oxidative stress, reducing the ability of the photobionts to fix carbon. Here, we outline our current understanding of the effects of high light on lichens and the mechanisms they use to mitigate or tolerate this stress in hydrated and desiccated states. Tolerance to high light can be achieved first by lowering ROS formation, via synthesizing light screening pigments or by thermally dissipating the excess light energy absorbed; second, by scavenging ROS once formed; or third, by repairing ROS-induced damage. While the primary focus of this review is tolerance to high light in lichen photobionts, our knowledge is rather fragmentary, and therefore we also include recent findings in free-living relatives to stimulate new lines of research in the study of high light tolerance in lichens.

However, little is known of the impacts of climate change on deep-water sponges. The deep-water glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii is distributed off eastern North America, forming dense sponge grounds with enhanced biodiversity on the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, Canada. While the strong natural environmental variability that characterizes these sponge grounds suggests this species is resilient to a changing environment, its physiological limitations remain unknown, and the impact of more persistent anthropogenic climate change on its distribution has never been assessed. We used Random Forest and generalized additive models to project the distribution of V. pourtalesii in the northwest Atlantic using environmental conditions simulated under moderate and worst-case CO2 emission scenarios. Under future (2046-2065) climate change, the suitable habitat of V. pourtalesii will increase up to 4 times its present-day size and shift into deeper waters and higher latitudes, particularly in its northern range where ocean warming will serve to improve the habitat surrounding this originally sub-tropical species. However, not all areas projected as suitable habitat in the future will realistically be populated, and the re duced likelihood of occurrence in its core habitat on the Scotian Shelf suggests that the existing Vazella sponge grounds may be negatively impacted. An ef fective monitoring programme will require tracking changes in the density and distribution of V. pourtalesii at the margins between core habitat and where losses and gains were projected. Species distribution models showed that the suitable habitat of the deep-water glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii will ex-pand under climate change scenarios.

Steps taken by governments now will have a significant effect on public health outcomes, including the food system and food security. Method: This study reviewed municipal public health and well-being plans from 79 local government areas (LGAs) in Victoria, Australia. Documents were included if they explicitly mentioned climate change and food insecurity. Of the 79 LGAs, 13 met the selection criteria and a content and framing analysis was conducted to identify the level of recognition of climate change on food security and proposed mitigation actions and strategies. Results: Of the 13 LGAs, the documents of six were identified as having a high level of responsiveness to climate change and food insecurity, five were assessed as medium and two low. Framing analysis identified council acknowledgment of how climate change effects food access through availability and price, and growing food locally and sustainably is seen as a common action to improve food security. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that planning for climate change and food insecurity is not a high priority for Victorian LGAs. Given the current political climate in Australia, where many in federal government continue to deny the existence of climate change or are reluctant to implement mitigation strategies, it is now and will be increasingly important into the future that local governments plan for the impact of climate change on food insecurity. So what?: Climate change will impact how people access food and what foods are available to them. Unless all levels of government start to address and plan for climate change, the impact on communities will continue to intensify and grow more costly and damaging. © 2020 Australian Health Promotion Association","climate change; food security; LGA; MPHWP; public health","article; climate change; food insecurity; food security; government; human; public health; Victoria; wellbeing; catering service; food insecurity; Climate Change; Food Insecurity; Food Supply; Humans; Local Government; Victoria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081249588

Rising municipal waste quantity poses a challenge for human beings and the environment, therefore recycling becomes important for environmental sustainability and circular economy. This study explores the effects of municipal waste recycling and renewable energy on the environment sustainability proxied by CO2 emissions in EU member states over the period from 2004 to 2017 through panel cointegration and causality analyses. Recycling is considered an efficient way to reduce CO2 emission, but surprisingly our results indicate mixed findings. The causality analysis revealed no significant interaction among recycling rate, renewable energy and CO2 emissions. However, in the long run, the negative impact of recycling and renewable energy use on CO2 emissions were revealed but varied among the countries. Results indicate that increasing renewable energy consumption will play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These findings must raise awareness among policymakers that should focus on the adoption and implementation of different types of sustainable energy policies that can affect directly or indirectly renewable energy sector development. © 2021 by the authors.

As patterns of ice loss around Antarctica become more uniform, there is an underlying increase in carbon capture-to-storage-to-sequestration on the seafloor. The amount of carbon captured per unit area is increasing and the area available to blue carbon is also increasing. Carbon sequestration could further increase under moderate (+1°C) ocean warming, contrary to decreasing global blue carbon stocks elsewhere. For example, in warmer waters, mangroves and seagrasses are in decline and benthic organisms are close to their physiological limits, so a 1°C increase in water temperature could push them above their thermal tolerance (e.g. bleaching of coral reefs). In contrast, on the basis of past change and current research, we expect that Antarctic blue carbon could increase by orders of magnitude. The Antarctic seafloor is biophysically unique and the site of carbon sequestration, the benthos, faces less anthropogenic disturbance than any other ocean continental shelf environment. This isolation imparts both vulnerability to change, and an avenue to conserve one of the world's last biodiversity refuges. In economic terms, the value of Antarctic blue carbon is estimated at between £0.65 and £1.76 billion (~2.27 billion USD) for sequestered carbon in the benthos around the continental shelf. To balance biodiversity protection against society's economic objectives, this paper builds on a proposal incentivising protection by building a ‘non-market framework’ via the 2015 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This could be connected and coordinated through the Antarctic Treaty System to promote and motivate member states to value Antarctic blue carbon and maintain scientific integrity and conservation for the positive societal values ingrained in the Antarctic Treaty System. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Antarctic Treaty System; biodiversity conservation; blue carbon; carbon sequestration","Antarctic Treaty; biodiversity; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental protection; global warming; incentive; Antarctica; Matthiola; Rhizophoraceae; carbon; Antarctica; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; France; Antarctic Regions; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094877120

This article presents the results of a low-carbon tourism case study in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia, where the Low-Carbon Living Program has successfully designed and implemented a low-carbon rating and certification scheme. This scheme covers emissions related to energy, waste and water and is based on regionally-specific data. The program has also succeeded in its aim of using the tourism industry as a catalyst for broader community action, having been expanded to schools and retailers in the case study region. A transferable regional model has been developed that is being adapted for use in new regions under a modular and decentralised program structure.

The Bt-maize Cry protein targeting Lepidoptera species detrimental to the crop is also expressed in pollen which is dispersed by wind and can thus reach habitats of NTLs. To better assess the current ecological risk of Bt-maize at landscape scales, we developed a spatially-explicit exposure-hazard model considering (i) the dynamics of pollen dispersal obtained by convolving GM plants emission with a dispersal kernel and (ii) a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) model accounting for the impact of toxin ingestion on individual lethal effects. We simulated the model using real landscape observations in Catalonia (Spain): GM-maize locations, flowering dates, rainfall time series and larvae emergence date of the European peacock butterfly Aglais io. While in average, the additional mortality appears to be negligible, we show significant additional mortality at sub-population level, with for instance a mortality higher than 40% within the 10m for the 10% most Bt-sensitive individuals. Also, using Pareto optimality we capture the best trade-off between isolation distance and additional mortality: up to 50 m are required to significantly buffer Bt-pollen impact on NTLs survival at the individual level. Our study clears up the narrow line between diverging conclusions: those claiming no risk by only looking at the average regional effect of Bt on NTLs survival and those pointing out a significant threaten when considering the variability of individuals mortality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Average population at risk; Bt-maize; Ecological risk assessment; Landscape exposure; Non-target Lepidoptera; Spatio-temporal exposure-hazard model","butterfly; cultivation; ecological impact; genetically modified organism; maize; physiological response; pollen; protein; risk assessment; survival; Aglais; Article; biological activity; butterfly; Catalonia; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental indicator; environmental monitoring; flowering; food intake; ingestion; larva; Lepidoptera; maize; mortality rate; nonhuman; plant dispersal; pollen; risk assessment; seasonal variation; survival rate; toxicokinetics; toxin analysis; transgenic crop; animal; Bacillus thuringiensis; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; physiology; Spain; toxicity; transgenic plant; Catalonia; Spain; Aglais; Junonia coenia; Lepidoptera; Zea mays; bacterial protein; endotoxin; hemolysin; insecticidal crystal protein, Bacillus Thuringiensis; Animals; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins; Bacterial Proteins; Butterflies; Endotoxins; Hemolysin Proteins; Larva; Plants, Genetically Modified; Pollen; Spain; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090600517

Anthropogenic factors which intensify the land degradation process include mining, road erosion, overgrazing, agriculture soil erosion, and soil pollution, which all have direct impacts on the environment. In 2009-2010, eroded mining land in Mongolia increased by 3,984.46 ha, with an expansion in surrounding road erosion. By rough estimation, transportation eroded 1.5 million ha of land. This area is nearly equal to the total amount of agricultural land in Mongolia. Road erosion reduces pastureland capacity and furthermore creates gullies, a very severe result of soil erosion. Overgrazing is one of the main reasons for land degradation in Mongolia. Pastureland in the vicinity of water bodies, settlements, lakes, and along livestock driving roads has severely degraded. Sand movement and free sand cover is becoming one main indicator of overgrazing and desertification. The 145 settlement areas in the Gobi desert steppe region of Mongolia are affected by sand problems. Agricultural soil loss is another big issue. Research results show about 46.9% of total arable land was eroded, and of that 33.7% of the land has experienced moderate to severe erosion. The shallow soil, sparse vegetation cover, and extra-continental climate are additional factors for soil erosion. To determine soil erosion intensity in the Mongolian steppe areas, we used fallout radionuclide techniques-Cs-137. In the study catchment of Baga Boor valley of central Mongolian steppe areas, soil erosion rates varied from 0.93 to 23.83 t ha-1yr-1 and average erosion was 5.613 t ha-1yr-1. The soil sedimentation and accumulation patterns were complicated due to the combination of water and wind erosion. The agricultural soil erosion rates in the case of Selenge aimag Nomgon soum and Central aimag Sumber soum are 32.6 and 49.6 t ha-1yr-1. This is 5.5-8.8 times more than the rate found in the pasture area. The soil erosion in agricultural fields of Mongolia is thus significant. Land conservation policy and adequate land management practice is therefore currently very important in Mongolia. © 2014 Higher Education Press and Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

Methane production capability of OFMSW was examined in biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. The factors affecting the high-solid anaerobic digestion (AD) of feedstock were investigated in a series of long-term semi-continuous digestion tests performed at dry mesophilic and thermophilic conditions in a continuously rotating drum reactor with working volume of 0.013 m3. OFMSW presented low biogas and methane generation capacity due to its contained non-biodegradable components and the low proteins and starch proportions. Dry mesophilic AD allowed only a relatively limited fraction of OFMSW volatile solids to be consumed for biogas and methane production. Reducing particle size favoured utilization of higher proportions of the available digestible organic substances, and concurrently promoted biogas and biomethane generation rate. Stability of methane generation was also significantly improved by particle downsizing. Small particles compensated the limited mass transfer and restricted distribution of methane production intermediate metabolites caused by water absence in the dry AD system. Dry thermophilic AD converted sufficient quantity of OFMSWs biodegradable content. The average methane released from dry thermophilic AD (0.176 m3kgVS −1) was higher than that of dry mesophilic AD of fine particles (0.148 m3kgVS −1) and much higher than that of dry mesophilic AD of same grain size (0.114 m3kgVS −1).

With this in mind, we recruited forty-three children with asthma from suburban Shanghai and deployed air cleaners (with HEPA and activated carbon filters) in their bedrooms. During both 2-week filtration and non-filtration periods, low-cost PM2.5 and O3 air monitors were used to measure pollutants indoors, outdoors, and for personal exposure. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations were reduced substantially with the use of air cleaners, from 34 ± 17 to 10 ± 8 µg/m3, with roughly 80% of indoor PM2.5 estimated to come from outdoor sources. Personal exposure to PM2.5 was reduced from 40 ± 17 to 25 ± 14 µg/m3. The more modest reductions in personal exposure and high contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to indoor concentrations highlight the need to reduce outdoor PM2.5 and/or to clean indoor air in multiple locations. Indoor O3 concentrations were generally low (mean = 8±4 ppb), and no significant difference was seen by filtration status.

A predominant approach to vulnerability assessment is indicator-based, wherein variables are aggregated to assess the vulnerability of units in a system (e.g., neighborhoods in a city). Here we show that a particular evidence-based predictive statistics approach can address two shortcomings of the most commonly-used indicator-based approach: lack of a means of validation and problematic weighting of individual indicators. We demonstrate how robust evidence-based models can produce frameworks that overcome these limitations. Using the case study of Hurricane Sandy in the State of New Jersey, we conducted two-pronged validated vulnerability assessments, based on insurance claim payouts and assistance grants. The latter needs-based assessment shows that “Minorities” are substantially more vulnerable than others based on a significant negative association with assistance approval rate (approved claims divided by all claims). Our findings highlight issues discussed in the literature within the context of climate justice and equity. Such an approach is helpful locally, but also when adaptation plans are developed over broad scales of time and space considering disparities between regions or across multiple jurisdictions.

These technologies have found success in light-duty vehicle applications and are in development for heavy-duty trucks. This study presents the first detailed stochastic techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of biomass feedstock supply systems with diesel, fuel cell hybrid electric, and fully electric trucks and determines their impacts on biofuel production considering butanol as a representative biofuel. This study finds that fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric trucks consume less energy relative to the diesel-powered truck regardless of the evaluated circumstances, including payloads of truck (loaded and empty), pavement types (gravel and paved), road conditions (normal and damaged), and road networks (local and highways). The use of fuel cell hybrid and fully electric trucks powered by H2-fuel and renewable sources of electricity, respectively, results in a large reduction in cost and carbon footprint, specifically for a long-distance hauling, and minimize other economic and environmental impacts. While the economic advantage of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle is dependent on the price of H2-fuel and road conditions, use reduces the GHG emissions of biobutanol per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.98–10.9 gCO2e/MJ. Results show that converting to fully electric truck transport decreases the biobutanol production cost and GHG emissions per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.4–7.3 cents/L and 0.78 to 9.1 gCO2e/MJ, respectively.

Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy of polyaniline (PAni) thin films with varying polaron doping has helped us to realize polaron density-dependent photoluminescence quenching mechanisms inside the thin films. A sharp reduction in photoluminescence emission spectra has been observed at doping densities between 1017 and 1019 cm-3. This doping concentration-dependent photoluminescence phenomenon in PAni is modeled quantitatively using quenching of excitons by polarons through long-range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and short-range charge transfer (CT) mechanisms. The results match well with the experimental findings that demonstrate that both models need to be considered to explain the mechanisms of luminescence quenching. FRET and CT phenomena inside an emissive layer of PLEDs have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the quantum efficiency roll-off phenomenon at high current density using experimentally obtained and theoretically calculated kinetic quenching parameters. To get rid of low luminescence in PAni, it has been blended with poly(methyl) methacrylate (PMMA) that enhances its luminescence manifold. The blending of PMMA leads to the introduction of a new photophysical phenomenon - donor PMMA concentration-dependent FRET contrary to original FRET theory proposed by Förster. Concentration-dependent FRET leads to a sharp drop in luminescence from the polymer blend after reaching a critical concentration of PMMA. Therefore, the present study explores the reason behind low luminescence in conducting polymers and demonstrates ways to mitigate it along with providing an account of the photo-physics of the conducting polymer as an emissive layer in PLEDs. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Blending; Charge transfer; Emission spectroscopy; Energy transfer; Forster resonance energy transfer; Photoluminescence; Photoluminescence spectroscopy; Photophysics; Polarons; Polyaniline; Polymer blends; Quenching; Semiconductor doping; Thin films; Concentration-dependent; Photoluminescence emission spectra; Photoluminescence quenching; Photophysical phenomena; Polymer light-emitting diodes; Resonance energy transfer; Short-range charge transfer; Time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099135212

This study focuses on the need for access to clean and affordable energy consumption, responsible energy consumption, sustainable economic growth, and climate change mitigation. To this end, this paper evaluates the relevance of the renewable energy sector on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework in Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain for the period 1995–2015. As an econometric strategy, we adopt the use of panel data over the highlighted countries. In the first step, we apply the unit root test recommended by Levin, Lin, and Chu in conjunction with ADF-Fisher, and Phillips-Perron for robustness and consistency. We found that the variables used in this study are integrated I (1) in the first difference. In the second step, we apply the Pedroni cointegration test, and Kao Residual cointegration test, and we observe that the variables are cointegrated in the long run. The generalized least squares (GLS), the panel fully modified least squares (FMOLS), ordinary least squares robust (OLS), and panel quantile regression are considered in this research. The econometric results validate the assumption of the environmental Kuznets curve, i.e., and there is a positive correlation between income per capita and a negative effect of squared income per capita on carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, we observe that renewable energy reduces CO2 emissions. Finally, we also find a direct connection between the urban population and the environmental degradation in the examined blocs. These results show that in Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain, more is required to achieve environmental sustainability in the respective countries growth trajectory.

Annex 4 of the Latvian National Energy and Climate Plan for 2030 (hereinafter - NECP) provides an overview of policies and measures to achieve the climate targets. The NECP does not provide information on the impact of the policies or which measures are more important and which are less crucial Similarly, the measures in Annex 4 of the NECP were not determined by industry experts but by ministry officials, therefore, it is not clear whether the proposed measures will achieve the set climate targets, a point also made by European Commission in its evaluation report on NECP. The aim of the study is to develop a tool for the early assessment of the impact of energy and climate policy measures. The study developed a methodology to pre-assess the impacts of the policies identified in the NECP, impacts were described by measures effectiveness and stage of development. With this methodology, it is possible to assess the impact of energy policies using indicators to characterize the effectiveness of the policy and the level of development. The study confirmed that both the multi-criteria analysis and composite index method can be used as methods. The results showed that high impact measures were related to the promotion of energy efficiency in buildings, but low impact measures were comprehensive horizontal measures such as measures related principle 'energy efficiency first' and review of energy efficiency obligation schemes. The indicators with the highest impact on sustainability rate were possible side effects and transparency of policies. © 2021 Lauma Balode, Kristiāna Dolge, Peter D. Lund, Dagnija Blumberga.

To compare the environmental effects of end of life disposal and recycling options for plastic/sand roof tiles in Uganda, we use an extended exergy analysis (EEA) to quantify the resources used in the disposal process, the resources saved from replaced virgin materials by recycling, and any additional resources needed to bring the tiles, byproducts, and pollutants to an environmentally acceptable end state. We evaluated disposing of waste plastic/sand roof tiles through open burning, burying, landfilling, pyrolyzing, incinerating in cement kilns, mixing into asphalt to pave roads, and recycling into plastic pavers. With a net exergy avoided of 16,462 MJ/tonne of tiles, mixing the waste plastic/sand tiles into asphalt roads proved to be the best option followed by pyrolysis with 11,303 MJ/tonne of net exergy avoided (including remediation). Recycling the tiles into pavers also saved net exergy while burying, landfilling, and incinerating all had negative net exergy values showing that inputting some thermal energy to recycle waste can add value and save net resources. We determined it is not practically feasible to bring all of the pollutants from open burning to an environmentally acceptable end state with the limited technology available in Uganda. However, the method we recommend for remediating CO2 by planting trees requires only 0.7% of the exergy used in CO2 scrubbers currently used in developed countries. Such an empirical study focusing specifically on plastic products and disposal options feasible in developing countries has not been done before, so our paper can be useful to policy makers, multilateral organizations, and NGOs making decisions about solid waste management practices in less-industrialized nations.

To achieve such standards, many initiatives and programs have been launched to achieve sustainable goals while meeting the needs of the present without compromising the requirements of future generations. Sustainable buildings are highly important in achieving sustainable development goals due to their excellent ability to reduce energy consumption, increase building efficiency, and reduce harmful emissions of greenhouse gases. The Kingdom aims to be the largest investor in the world in the sustainable buildings sector. To this end, the “Mostadam” evaluation service was recently launched in order to assist existing and new buildings in achieving sustainable building standards in a way that is in keeping with the privacy and principles of Saudi society. The present paper presents an extensive investigation to assess the current state of sustainable buildings in Saudi cities. Moreover, the main categories of sustainable residential buildings according to the “Mostadam” rating systems are discussed, and the potential of such categories in Saudi Arabia is explored. Finally, suggestions are given for some practical strategies and future policies targeting the total transformation towards sustainable buildings and, consequently, towards sustainable cities.

However, as one of the major coal-production bases and intensive energy-consuming provinces in China, Shanxi has still been suffering from severe air quality problems in recent years. In this study, by combining a detailed bottom-up emission inventory and the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model/comprehensive air quality model with extensions (CAMx) model, the evolution of pollutant concentrations, source apportionment, and migration potentials from 2012 to 2015 in Shanxi are investigated. Estimated primary air pollutants emission declined significantly during 2012–2015. Compared with 2012, the simulated concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 in January of 2015 are reduced by 24.7%, 24.1%, 23.0% and 18.0%, respectively. In contrast, heavy contaminated areas have shown negligible variations, which are highly concentrated in Taiyuan, Linfen, Jincheng, Changzhi, Lvliang, Yangquan and Jinzhong cities. In terms of contribution by source categories, the other industries and residential sources are identified as the most significant local contributors for PM2.5 and PM10, while SO2 and NO2 are mainly emitted by other industries and power plants. Scenarios analysis of 50% emission mitigation suggests that the emission reduction measures are generally more effective in summer than in winter. Moreover, the mitigation potential for each city varies from each other. These results indicate that more appropriate seasonal-specific emission reduction measures in each prefecture-level city should be implemented to further improve regional air quality and thus better protect public health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Mitigation potentials; Prefecture-level city; Primary air pollutants; Sectoral contribution; Shanxi province of China; WRF-CAMx model","Air quality; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Weather forecasting; Air pollution prevention; Air quality modeling; Emission inventories; Emission mitigation; Pollutant concentration; Regional air quality; Source apportionment; Weather research and forecasting models; Coal industry; coal; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; particulate matter; resource availability; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; city; comprehensive air quality model with extension; electric power plant; environmental policy; industry; meteorology; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; residential area; sensitivity analysis; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; weather research and forecasting model; winter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091199472

Although the effects of altitude, temperature and rainfall on organic carbon have been studied extensively, it is difficult to increase SOC storage by changing these factors in actual forest management. This study determined the SOC, soil physical and chemical properties, nutrient elements, heavy metal elements, soil minerals and microbial biomass in the 0–140-cm soil layer of the monsoon broad-leaved forest in the acid red soil region of southwestern China by stratification. We tried to identify the soil factors affecting the SOC storage of the forest in the acid red soil region and determine the weights of the factors affecting the SOC, with the aim of improving the SOC retention capacity in forest management by changing the main soil factors affecting SOC storage. The results showed that the soil factors affecting the forest SOC storage in this area are total nitrogen (N, 22.7%) &gt; soil water content (19.9%) &gt; active iron (including poorly crystalline iron, Feo, 15.5%) &gt; pH (9.5%) &gt; phosphorus (P, 9.4%) &gt; aluminium (Al, 8.9%) &gt; silicon (Si, 7.1%) &gt; sulphur (S, 6.8%). Of these factors, N, the water content, Feo, and P are practical factors for forest management, whereas the pH, Al, Si and S are not. SOC was significantly positively correlated with the soil N concentration, water content, active iron content and P concentration (p &lt;.05). In acidic red soil areas, with active iron as the highlight, N, soil water content, phosphorus and active iron jointly regulate the forest SOC storage capacity. Consequently, in actual forest management, any measures to promote soil N and water content and to activate inactive iron can enhance the storage of SOC, as appropriate input of N and P fertiliser and irrigation in dry years and the dry season. Highlights: The soil environmental factors affecting SOC storage in forest soil are quantified Activation of inactive iron helps SOC storage in forest soil Irrigation and N and P input are effective for helping SOC storage in forest soil N, WC, P and Feo jointly regulate SOC in tropical acid red soil forest. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","carbon cycle; forest; soil environment; soil microorganisms; soil organic carbon","acid soil; broad-leaved forest; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon storage; forest management; forest soil; precipitation (climatology); red soil; reduction; soil organic matter; soil water; temperature effect; water content; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087317495

Thus the durability of the cement sheath can be threatened due to the degradation process and the stress state resulting from the new conditions found underground. The integrity of the cement sheath is a function of the cement composition, surrounding rock type, fluid pressure, stress state, temperature, and the type of well. This paper provides a methodology to investigate the stability of the rock-cement-casing assemblage. The assemblage's mechanical behaviour is coupled with the chemical alterations resulting from it being in contact with CO2-bearing fluids. The cement matrix is a quasi-brittle material which shows a plastic behaviour. The character of the geomechanical part and the geochemical aspect mutually affects each other which is studied in this paper. A plastic-damage approach benefiting from the concept of embedded bands is also introduced to characterise the performance of the cement sheath within CO2 storage sites. This approach considers both the failure and the deformation phenomena occurring within altered zones. In this paper, injection and abandoned wells are hypothesised at depths between 800 and 2500 m and their performance investigated. It is shown that abandoned wells are considered more likely to remain safe while the interfacial transition zones in injection wells are predicted to fail, which converts them to potential leakage pathways. Nevertheless, caution should be taken when the real wells are considered to match the required assumptions in the Introduction Section.

The dynamics of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems depend on processes like photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and combustion, anthropogenic activities like emission of greenhouse gases and climatic variations in rainfall and temperature, and is stored as biomass in different forms. The quantification of biomass is necessary to understand the productivity of forests, carbon sink and source dynamics and recommend ways to aid sequestration through supply side interventions like afforestation and demand side measures that check wood consumption. In this study, carbon sequestration based on the change in total carbon in two different scenarios using Markov chain and InVEST model is evaluated for the years 2000, 2018 and predicted for 2035. The results show that 1.351 Tg carbon has already been lost from 2000 to 2018 in the forest area of Sariska Tiger Reserve and another 0.107 Tg of carbon is expected to be lost in the predicted future, when we compare the land use land cover of the year 2035 with the present scenario. The local communities extract fuelwood by cutting down tree branches illegally, which leads to carbon loss into the atmosphere. The lower release of carbon in 2035 as compared to 2018 is because of forest management practices e.g., plantations done in the range Tehla-Talabberi, Sariska- Ganeshpura, Alwar buffer-Shoydanpura, Talvriksh-Manavaas, Akbarpur-Kalikhol, Ajabgarh-Jatwana. The study shows that the economic value of carbon lost from 2000 to 2018 is million $ 214.57 and if we see the economic value of the predicted year 2035, carbon sequestration is worth million $ 17.19. Outputs demonstrate the potential for restoration/reforestation and afforestation as the most practical carbon loss mitigation strategy and calls for improved access to cleaner energy sources where the renewable energy industry and government may pitch in. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Carbon pool; Carbon sequestration; Economic evaluation of carbon stock; Ecosystem services; Markov chain model","Climate change; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Markov chains; Reforestation; Anthropogenic activity; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Forest management practices; Land use/ land covers; Mitigation strategy; Renewable Energy industries; Terrestrial ecosystems; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089734200

The assessment of the impact of local actions has been a challenge, even from a strictly technical perspective. This happens because the total change observed is the result of multiple factors influencing local energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, many of them not even influenced by local authorities. A methodology was developed, based on a recently developed decomposition model, that disaggregates the total observed changes in the local energy system into multiple causes/effects (including local socio-economic evolution, technology evolution, higher-level governance frame and local actions). The proposed methodology, including the quantification of the specific effect associated with local actions, is demonstrated with the case study of the municipality of Malmö (Sweden) in the timeframe between 1990 and 2015. © 2021 by the authors.

These environments are also affected by other inherent abiotic and biotic factors that affect the structure and function of these ecosystems. Numerous factors influence nutrient availability, plant productivity in an arid and semi-arid environment. One influential factor is the soil rhizospheric microbial community, which is an integral part of the terrestrial ecosystem. With climate change already affecting crop yield in drylands, the potential role of these organisms in land restoration for enhancing plant productivity needs to be exploited. Maximizing the rhizospheric microbial functions in these agroecosystems is essential in the reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands for optimum productivity in a wide range of environmental perturbations. In this review, we present the applications of rhizospheric plant growth-promoting (PGP) archaea and bacteria in the solubilization of nutrients, production of growth regulators, carbon sequestration, competitive exclusions of pathogens, and remediation of arid and semi-arid soils. © 2020","Antagonism; Biodegradation; Drought; Nitrogen-fixation; Plant-microbe interactions; Rhizosphere",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090978855

Burnt offerings were made in ceremonies with various parts including fire rites, from which the carbonised macro-remains testify to a significant use of plants. The individual finds and records provide information about diet, firewood supply, economic and social behaviour, faith, skills, crafts, and trade. In this study, the focus was on plant uses and in rites at 25 Bronze and Iron Age burnt offering sites in the Eastern Alps. Wood was the basis for the burnt offering rite, similar to the cremation rite, which was also beginning in the Bronze Age. The most consistently found fuel remains were charcoal from coniferous wood, especially Picea/Larix-type (most probably Picea, spruce), probably due to its burning qualities and easy availability during this period. Corylus avellana (hazel) was the commonest deciduous wood. All identified wood taxa correspond with the local natural vegetation types of the time. Overall, they suggest low-density woodland stands and more or less sustainable human land use near the burnt offering sites, in the hill and mountain vegetation zone. The wood for the pyre was collected near the offering sites, so there are variations in firewood taxa resulting from the differences in the local natural landscape, (micro)climate, geology and edaphic conditions. The charred wood, crops and wild fruit and nut remains were ritually deposited in pits after the fire rite, which is another link to cremation. Food plant remains were usually present in low quantities due to the nature of burnt offerings, but their consistent records at the burnt offering sites point to a deep spiritual connection to nature and a high appreciation for plants as sources of food, raw materials and energy. They show that essentials were central elements of the burnt offering rite and that everyday matters overlapped with spiritual or religious concerns. Altogether, the finds of 15 different crops and 15 different edible plant taxa demonstrate a fairly high food plant diversity at the sites during the Bronze and Iron Ages. Hordeum vulgare (barley), Triticum dicoccum (emmer), Panicum miliaceum (broomcorn millet) and Vicia faba (broad bean) were the most consistent and important crops. They reflect a common food trend, which most probably resulted from climate extremes and deterioration. Plants naturally growing outside the Eastern Alpine vegetational zones were nearly absent, showing a lack of trade in food at the time, while native fruits and nuts were often used as ritual plants and played an important role as food plants. They are an argument for local agriculture and economy. Of the wild plants, Corylus avellana (hazel) was the most often found by far, followed by Fragaria vesca (strawberry), Rubus idaeus (raspberry), R. fruticosus (blackberry) and Sambucus nigra (elder). Like the wood taxa, the fruits and nuts indicate a human influenced environment and point to woodland edges, margins and clearings. Some of the firewood and food plants may also have been elements of the offering rite due to their medicinal and psychedelic effects, burning characteristics and symbolic background. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Archaeobotany; Bronze Age; Burnt offering sites; Eastern Alps; Iron Age; Plant rite; Plant use",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098637316

Mapping the outputs behavior as a function of the inputs and quantifying the uncertainty contribution of inputs to the variability of outputs are crucial for understanding and applying complex mathematical models to a new environment. Objectives of present research are (i) to calibrate and evaluate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) cropping system model using detailed experimental datasets on maize production in arid sandy soils (Entisol) and (ii) to determine the model's sensitivity to soil, genotype and crop management inputs under the currently explored conditions (low fertility and water holding capacity) based on multivariate analysis and variance decomposition methods. The goodness-of-fit statistics between observed and simulated data indicated that the calibrated model reasonably well simulates maize phenology, growth and yield, evapotranspiration, soil water content, grain N concentration, and postharvest soil NO3-N in eight year site field experiments. A global sensitivity analysis using the co-inertia method was carried out to link 14 output variables and 25 soil and genotype input parameters. Maize growth and yield variables were strongly correlated with soil hydrological and fertility input parameters such as soil water upper limit (SDUL) and soil organic carbon (SOC), whereas simulation of maize phenology was largely determined by phenological genotype-specific cultivar input parameters. A strong association was also observed between the output variables of yield and soil fertility. The effect of carbon (C) related soil input parameters of initial SOC and stable SOC and crop management factors of maize residue retention and compost application under no-till system on the long-term (10 years) simulation of yield and SOC dynamics was further explored using Sobolʹ method. Simulated grain yield, water productivity, active SOC, and cumulative soil CO2 efflux were most sensitive to initial stable SOC and compost application. Maize residue retention significantly affected the simulation of cumulative N mineralization, SOC % in 0.2 m depth, and cumulative soil CO2 efflux through interactions effect, i.e. total-order sensitivity index (STi) &gt; 0.05, with other inputs. Compost application increased grain yield by 13 %, SOC stock by 5%, and cumulative soil CO2 efflux by 95 % compared with no application. However, compost application with maize residue retained significantly reduced cumulative soil CO2 efflux by 12 % compared with compost application with maize residue removed. Therefore, the application of compost with maize residue retained under no-till system is a plausible crop management option for agronomically improved and environmentally sound maize production in arid sandy soils. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Arid Environments; DSSAT; Maize; Sandy soil; Sensitivity analysis; Soil carbon dynamics","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; crop plant; crop yield; detection method; genotype; growth; maize; Mediterranean environment; Mediterranean Water; phenology; sandy soil; sensitivity analysis; simulation; soil carbon; Middle East; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094966520

Modulating root system function provides opportunities to improve crop yield under biotic and abiotic stresses. With this aim, a commercial hybrid tomato variety was grafted on a geno-typed population of 123 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Solanum pimpinellifolium, and compared with self-and non-grafted controls, under contrasting watering treatments (100% vs. 70% of crop evapotranspiration). Drought tolerance was genetically analyzed for vegetative and flower-ing traits, and root xylem sap phytohormone and nutrient composition. Under water deficit, around 25% of RILs conferred larger total shoot dry weight than controls. Reproductive and vegetative traits under water deficit were highly and positively correlated to the shoot water content. This association was genetically supported by linkage of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling these traits within four genomic regions. From a total of 83 significant QTLs, most were irrigation-regime specific. The gene contents of 8 out of 12 genomic regions containing 46 QTLs were found significantly enriched at certain GO terms and some candidate genes from diverse gene families were identified. Thus, grafting commercial varieties onto selected rootstocks derived from S. pimpinelli-folium provides a viable strategy to enhance drought tolerance in tomato. © 2020 by the authors.

Further, in order to mitigate the loss of forest lands diverted for hydropower projects, countries like India have compensatory afforestation policies, which have meant more physical interference in natural landscapes, whose long-term consequences remain under-researched. This study conducted between 2012 and 2016 uses information from government data and ground research to examine the extent, nature and impact of forest diversion for hydropower projects in the remote, ecologically vulnerable Kinnaur Division of Himachal Pradesh in the Western Himalayas. It also studies the implementation of ‘compensatory afforestation’ undertaken as a ‘mitigation’ strategy as part of this forest diversion process. The study found that not only have construction activities for hydropower projects impacted existing land-use, disturbed forest biodiversity and fragmented the forest landscape, but the related compensatory afforestation plantations are also ridden with problems. These include abysmally low presence of surviving saplings (upto 10%) interspecies conflict, infringement on local land usage, and damage by wildfires and landslides. The study critically examines the role of state led institutions and global green growth policies in driving and legitimizing these developments in the name of ‘mitigation’, ultimately causing more harm to fragile local ecosystems and communities dependent on these. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","climate change mitigation; forest governance; Himalayan ecosystem; land use change; plantation; renewable energy","afforestation; alternative energy; climate change; hydroelectric power plant; mitigation; renewable resource; strategic approach; vulnerability; Himachal Pradesh; Himalayas; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090246793

In order to calculate effective stress, despite knowing the stress and pore pressure conditions, measuring of the Biot's coefficient for different rocks is required. The Biot's coefficient has been studied separately in previous studies using both static and dynamic methods. In this study, the static and dynamic values of the Biot's coefficients have been calculated simultaneously with the aid of measuring volumetric strain and compressional wave velocity, by making changes through the confining and pore pressures. Being equipped with an advanced triaxial system, we were able to measure the velocity of compressional waves along with the volumetric strain of the rock sample by applying hydrostatic confining pressure and pore pressures in a different state of temperature. Six similar samples were selected from one of the Iranian gas reservoirs, and Biot tests were conducted on three samples under ambient condition and three samples under reservoir condition (90°). The results showed that the value of grain modulus is not pressure-dependent, but the temperature decreased the grain modulus by about 42 percent. Measurements also showed that the bulk modulus is dependent on pressure and temperature, so that by raising the Terzaghi effective stress and temperature Bulk modulus increases. The calculation of Biot's coefficients showed that the static and dynamic Biot's coefficients are dependent on pressure and temperature so that both coefficients decrease as a result of increasing them. Increasing effective stress lead to a considerable decrease in the static coefficient around 6.2% and 15.1% in the ambient and reservoir conditions in turn. Also, with applying heat, the dynamic Biot's coefficient in Terzaghi effective stress of 2–8 and 8–20 MPa witnessed a remarkable decline about 8.4 and 17.1%, respectively. The results of the experiment show a good correlation between dynamic and static coefficients. Also, the reducing effect of temperature on the Biot's coefficient at high pressures is higher than this effect for low pressure in both static and dynamic conditions. Moreover, reducing trend of pressure on Biot's coefficients has a more significant impact in the reservoir condition than ambient condition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic Biot's coefficient; Grain and bulk moduly; Static Biot's coefficient; Temperature dependent","Elastic moduli; Pore pressure; Wave propagation; Carbonate reservoir; Compressional wave velocity; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Hydrostatic confining pressure; Pressure and temperature; Reservoir conditions; Reservoir temperatures; Static and dynamic conditions; Petroleum reservoirs; Biot theory; bulk modulus; carbonate rock; effective stress; experimental study; hydraulic fracturing; hydrocarbon reservoir; pore pressure; pressure field; reservoir rock; rock mechanics; temperature effect; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093667777

In this study, we used the life cycle assessment concept for greenhouse gas emissions (LCA-GHG) to evaluate and compare GHG emissions from individually farmed units and large-scale farming operations. Results showed that large-scale farming resulted in GHG emissions 11% lower than those arising from individual farming. Moreover, reducing rice seed and transportation used were outstanding under large-scale farming. Production cost was reduced by 28.3%, whereas farmer's profit was increased by 31.2%. Producing rice seed, open windrows compost, manures, and bio-fermented juice for using inside the farm gate had potential to mitigate GHG emissions by 40.7 (−85.9%), 732.3 (−12.3%), 188.8 (−46.8%), and 115.6 (−75.4%) kg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, respectively.

In the absence of explicit adaptation, risks will increase across the whole of the UK, but at different rates and from different starting values in different regions. The likelihood of heat extremes affecting health, the road and rail network and crop growth will increase very markedly. Agricultural and hydrological drought risks increase across the UK, as does wildfire danger. River flood risk increases particularly in the north and west. Demand for cooling energy will increase, but demand for heating energy will decline. Crop growing degree days will increase, benefiting the production of perennial crops. In general, the risks associated with high temperature extremes will increase the most in warmer southern and eastern England, but the rate of increase from a lower base may be greater further north and west. Reducing emissions reduces risks in the long term but has little effect over the next two or three decades. The results provide evidence to support the development of national and local climate and resilience policy. Measures to enhance resilience are needed alongside policies to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Resilience policy should recognise the variability in change in risk across the UK, and therefore different local priorities. Explicit choices need to be made about ‘worst case’ emissions scenarios as they can influence strongly estimated changes in risk: the increase in risk with RCP8.5 can be considerably higher than with a pathway reaching 4 °C by 2100. © 2020","Adaptation; Climate risk; Droughts; Floods; Heatwaves; Resilience; UKCP18; Wildfire",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099609982

As potential candidates for reducing greenhouse gases, hydrates have attracted attention from both the industry and scientific community. Under high pressure and low temperature, hydrates are formed spontaneously from a mixture of CO2 and water via nucleation and growth. Yet, for moderate undercooling, i.e., moderate supersaturation, studying hydrate formation with molecular simulations is very challenging due to the high nucleation barriers involved. We investigate the homogeneous nucleation mechanism of CO2 hydrate as a function of temperature using transition path sampling (TPS), which generates ensembles of unbiased dynamical trajectories across the high barrier between the liquid and solid states. The resulting path ensembles reveal that at high driving force (low temperature), amorphous structures are predominantly formed, with 4151062 cages being the most abundant. With increasing temperature, the nucleation mechanism changes, and 51262 becomes the most abundant cage type, giving rise to the crystalline sI structure. Reaction coordinate analysis can reveal the most important collective variable involved in the mechanism. With increasing temperature, we observe a shift from a single feature (size of the nucleus) to a 2-dimensional (size and cage type) variable as the salient ingredient of the reaction coordinate, and then back to only the nucleus size. This finding is in line with the underlying shift from an amorphous to a crystalline nucleation channel. Modeling such complex phase transformations using transition path sampling gives unbiased insight into the molecular mechanisms toward different polymorphs, and how these are determined by thermodynamics and kinetics. This study will be beneficial for researchers aiming to produce such hydrates with different polymorphic forms. ©",,"Carbon dioxide; Crystallization; Greenhouse gases; Hydration; Hydrogen bonds; Nucleation; Carbon dioxide hydrates; Homogeneous nucleation; Increasing temperatures; Molecular simulations; Molecular understanding; Nucleation and growth; Thermodynamics and kinetics; Transition path sampling; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100070174

The results reveal that trees and the mixing of biochar into growing medium can increase the CSS considerably. The CSS potential of the case area is 520 kg CO2 per resident during 50 years. The added biochar accounts for 65 % of the capacity and the biomass of trees accounts for 35 %. At the city scale, it would lead to 330 000 t CO2 being stored during 50 years. The findings suggest that green planning could contribute more strongly to climate change mitigation by encouraging the use of biochar and the planting of trees, in addition to ensuring favourable growing conditions. © 2020 The Authors","Biochar; Carbon sink; Green infrastructure; LCA; Urban trees; Urban yards","biochar; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; greenhouse gas; greenspace; life cycle analysis; residential location; Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098628461

The mechanisms underpinning later Pleistocene human behavioural evolution, however, remain contested. Many complex behaviours evolved in Africa, but early evidence for these behaviours varies both spatially and temporally. Scientists have not been able to explain this flickering pattern, which is present even in sites and regions clearly occupied by Homo sapiens. To explore this pattern, here the presence and frequency of evidence for backed stone artefact production are modelled against climate-driven, time-series population density estimates (Timmermann and Friedrich. 2016 Nature 538, 92. (doi:10.1038/nature19365)), in all known African Late Pleistocene archaeological sites (n = 116 sites, n = 409 assemblages, n = 893 dates). In addition, a moving-window, site density population estimate is included at the scale of southern Africa. Backed stone artefacts are argued in many archaeological contexts to have functioned in elaborate technologies like composite weapons and, in the African Pleistocene, are accepted proxies for cultural complexity. They show a broad but sporadic distribution in Africa, prior to their association with Homo sapiens dispersing into Europe 45-40 ka. Two independent population estimates explain this pattern and potentially implicate the interaction of climate change and demography in the expression of cultural complexity in African Pleistocene Homo sapiens.

Limiting soil consumption, improving urban greening and restoring abandoned areas are three of the most important strategies towards a sustainable land use. The extent to which these three actions can be effectively implemented depends on the specific biophysical and cultural characteristics of the local context as well as on the preferences of residents. We conducted a Choice Experiment (CE) on a sample of 500 people living in four municipalities of the lake Garda western coastal strip, in Italy, to assess the willingness to pay (WTP) towards these three planning strategies based on alternative land-use. The proposed land use strategies are presented as a feasible way to improve the mitigation and adaptation capacity of the local context. Our results suggest that the local community perceives the growth rate of sealed areas as the most pressing issue, and people are in favour of measures aimed at containing the phenomenon. Efforts in this direction are needed and should inform the current policy debate on local land-use planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Choice experiment; Land-use policies; Soil functions; Willingness to pay","climate change; greenspace; land use planning; policy making; urban area; willingness to pay; Italy; Lake Garda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089029909

New alternative technologies in transportation such as electric vehicles aim to reduce substantially vehicle emissions, particularly in urban areas. Incentives of using two-wheel electric vehicles such as bicycles in big cities centres are promoted by local governments, and in fact, some countries are already trying to adopt this transition. An interesting case consists of the use of hydrogen fuel cells in such vehicles to increase their driving range under short refuelling times. To this end, this paper investigated the social and financial prospects of hydrogen infrastructure for city-oriented fuel cell electric vehicles such as bicycles. The results of the research indicated that a light mobility urban hydrogen refuelling station able to provide refuelling processes at pressures of 30 bar with a hydrogen fuel cost of 34.7 €/kgH2 is more favourable compared to larger stations. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Fuel cell electric bicycle; Hydrogen cost; Hydrogen pressure; Hydrogen refuelling station","Electric bikes; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Petroleum prospecting; Sporting goods; Vehicles; Alternative technologies; Developed countries; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Hydrogen infrastructure; Hydrogen refuelling stations; Local government; Road transportation; Transportation markets; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096842682

The first simulation was labelled as CN-TOP, while the second simulation was hereafter referred to as CN-VIC. The results were evaluated and compared against various observation-based satellites and reanalysis products. Results showed that the CN-TOP overestimates leaf area index (LAI) and slightly underestimates the terrestrial carbon fluxes in comparison with the reference product; meanwhile, the CN-VIC severely underestimates both LAI and terrestrial fluxes particularly over the Congo basin. In addition, the CN-VIC shows a superior performance for simulating the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) than when it is simulated by the CN-TOP. In summary, the coupled RegCM4-CLM45-CN-VIC model can be recommended for future studies of NEE over Africa. To obtain robust results for simulating the terrestrial carbon fluxes especially the NEE; it is highly recommended to calibrate the four parameters of the VIC surface data set over Africa particularly over the Congo basin against in-situ observations. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","Africa; carbon–nitrogen cycle; net ecosystem exchange; regional climate modelling; runoff scheme","Carbon; Carbon fluxes; In-situ observations; Land surface hydrology; Leaf Area Index; Net ecosystem exchange; Regional climate modeling; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Variable infiltration capacities; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090064266

However, relatively few studies have been conducted that investigate how the capacities of agricultural extension agents can be built to more effectively assist smallholder farmers in managing climate risks and impacts. As climate change is a key threat to smallholder food production, addressing this issue is increasingly important. This paper aims to identify how agricultural extension agents in Ghana can better support smallholder farmers in navigating and addressing the effects of climate change on food production. It asks: (i) what are the sources of information used by agricultural extension agents in Ghana's Upper East region? (ii) what are the capacity building needs of agricultural extension agents for effective communication of climate information for building resilient agricultural systems? (iii) what are the key barriers to successful extension outcomes for climate change adaptation? The paper uses a mixed methods approach including three regional stakeholder workshops, expert interviews and surveys with 32 agricultural extension agents in northeastern Ghana. Results addressing question (i) indicated that radios and television are the dominant sources of climate information for agricultural extension agents in the Upper East region. Findings targeting question (ii) identified capacity building needs such as developing extension agents’ technical skills, improving communication skills, improving knowledge and use of climate smart agricultural interventions such as soil moisture conservation methods, and training on information communication technologies (ICT) to deliver extension advice on climate change. Other needs included developing skills in field demonstration and project monitoring and evaluation. Addressing question (iii), key barriers confronted by agricultural extension agents in the delivery of extension on climate change included lack of transportation facilities for extension agents, lack of appropriate extension materials, high agricultural extension agent to farmer ratios, and inadequate funds to implement adaptation practices. Wider barriers reducing the effectiveness of extension efforts included farmer resistance to change and complex land tenure arrangements that do not allow investment. Periodic workshops should be organised for agricultural extension agents on the use of ICT to deliver extension services, whilst encouraging the use of audio-visuals in extension delivery. These efforts should be supported by regular assessments of extension agents’ capacity building needs. © 2021 The Author(s)","Capacity building; Climate services; Climate vulnerability; Crop production; Extension services; Training; West Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103722170

Using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) reports, we evaluate the impact of projected natural gas prices on these emissions. We find that while lower natural gas prices have historically resulted in lower CO2 emissions, the projections from the 2017 and 2019 AEOs differ dramatically in both the projected gas price and the associated impact on CO2 reduction. This change in the marginal emission-reduction rate relative to the natural gas price coincides with decreasing capital costs for solar and wind generation sources. As such, the contribution of the power sector to the Paris Agreement targets for 2020 and 2025, and the CPP 2030 target may be meet as early as 2020.

This study provides the first quantitative assessment of spatial and seasonal variation of outdoor BC and PM2.5 concentrations in several densely populated slums of Mumbai, India. Mobile outdoor real-time BC and PM2.5 monitoring was conducted along pre-designed monitoring routes in seven slums in Mumbai during the summer (May–June 2015 and May 2016) and repeated in four of them during the winter (February 2016). The measurements were repeated on the routes during different hours and days to account for the temporal variability of air pollution (nsummer = 80 trips; nwinter = 48 trips). PM2.5 exhibited homogenous distribution inside each slum (coefficient of divergence (COD) = 0.11–0.23), while BC varied significantly showing increasing concentrations with proximity to major roads (COD = 0.26–0.64). BC/PM2.5 ratio, an indicator of impact of traffic emissions, was higher along major roads of all slums (14–43%) and minor roads and alleys of high-traffic slums (10–17%) while lowest along alleys and minor roads of low-traffic slums (7–11%). Comparison of pollutant concentrations among major roads revealed the dominant effect of emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and traffic congestion. Significantly high concentrations were observed during winter season compared with summer for both PM2.5 (125 ± 46 μg m-3 in winter and 41 ± 25 μg m-3 in summer) and BC (12 ± 6 μg m-3 in winter and 7 ± 6 μg m-3 in summer). The results of this study indicate that slum residents in Mumbai and similar slums around the world are at a higher risk of traffic-related air pollution, with risk being more severe in winters due to poorer dispersion conditions.

It contributes towards the diversification and expansion of fuel supply chain in the aviation industry due to its unique properties, as it is ultraclean releasing lower levels of Sulphur Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxides and particulate emissions upon burning. The State of Qatar, with its vast quantities of natural gas resources, can lead in the widespread adoption of jet fuel-GTL. The GTL technology also can contribute positively toward CO2 emission reduction through the integration between GTL and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technology, as this will enhance the total production of refined products and reduce CO2 emissions level. The concept model of integrating of CO2 product with GTL plant has been discussed in (Al-Yaeeshi et al., 2020a) and the results are demonstrated positively in terms of techno-economic-environmental aspects. In fact, fuel production in Pearl GTL has prompted Qatar Airways (QA) to become the first commercial airliner to trial jet fuel-GTL. However, mainstream utilisation is challenged due to: (a) lack of availability of jet fuel-GTL for the purpose of re-fuelling at QA's worldwide destinations. As such, the presence of GTL plants is limited globally due to the availability of natural gas and the high capital costs for GTL plant construction; (b) volatility in jet fuel-GTL prices and the uncertainty in petroleum product markets. The objective of this study is to assess the techno-economic-environmental feasibility of a novel methodological framework based on decentralised LNG-to-GTL processes (or hubs) at optimal locations of LNG terminals. The objective is to enhance the availability of jet fuel-GTL and other GTL products in global aviation and other transportation sectors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aviation; Gas-To-Liquid (GTL); Jet Fuel; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110534333

Hence, flex crops and commodities complexes consolidate within former strongholds and set off to new territories to take down today's crises. Bridging critical and intersectional political economy, ecology and sociology perspectives, and grounded in Guatemala from 2005 onwards, I discuss the implications of the rise of the flex crops and commodities complexes in transitions to sustainability for jobs, labor regimes, and socioecological reproduction. Specifically, the operations of the flex (sugar)cane and (oil) palm complexes in Guatemala involve a predatory form of agrarian extractivism which is driving a process of ‘impairing destruction’. This works by means of a job-poor, culturally insensitive, toilsome and unpaid labor-based ‘productive’ model, and the manufacturing of environmentally and socially toxic landscapes, to fuel a purge of the countryside that leaves nothing and no one, neither friend nor foe, unscathed. However, the purge hits harder on the many working families (and especially on women) who are deemed redundant for the new renewables-led corporate model of sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Many struggle to avoid falling into this outcast condition. But the life purging agro-extractivism of the cane and palm companies both increases and stagnates the reserve army of labor, while simultaneously pushing the relative surplus population to the limits of subsistence. These findings about ‘renewable but unlivable’ futures call into question business as usual, non-transformative climate stewardship and sustainable development initiatives that constrain the (re)production of fairer and more climate-proof, culturally-sound, and youth-friendly life projects. © 2020 The Author","Agrarian extractivism; Relative surplus population; Renewables; Social reproduction; Sustainability transitions; Toxic landscapes","agrarian change; alternative energy; business; rural development; rural planning; sustainability; sustainable development; Guatemala [Central America]; Elaeis; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097242122

New technologies, wide implementation of energy efficiency measures and smart energy management are needed for the industry to ensure local and global competitiveness and reduce emissions. Since the industrial sector is often comprised of sub-sectors that are unique and with local specifics, this paper focuses on three of them, taking Latvia as the case. The sectors are: manufacture of wood and wood products, non-metallic mineral products, as well as food products and tobacco. These sub-sectors together consume around 80 % of the total final energy use in the country's industrial sector. Comprehensive analysis and decomposition of the sub-sectors was made to identify future development pathways. TIMES model was used to elaborate a process-oriented modelling approach to analyze the impact of measures defined in the National Energy and Climate Plan until 2030 as well to gauge the impact of additional measures.

Everyday human activities such as open burning, deforestation, burning of fossil fuels and agricultural activities significantly contribute to Earth warming. Preventing the aforementioned activities reduce the greenhouse gas emission to the atmosphere and subsequently slows the changes in climate. Thus, climate change education is integral to educate people on the destructive consequences of their actions to the climate. Past studies revealed that well-established theories and models guided the designing of education to deliver behavioral change in many countries and reportedly improved participants’ knowledge, attitude and motivation. However, these theories and models exist as an after effect of the education and the long-term impact of the initiative frequently not found and less information available on the sustainability of such education. Additionally, effective climate change education is typically context-based and designed based on factors related to local students’ behavior. Hence, this study examined how knowledge and psychological factors such as belief and motivation explain the formation of climate conserving behavior among secondary school students. A total of 221 questionnaires was distributed to 14 years old Malaysian secondary school students to measure knowledge, motivation and belief. The data obtained were later analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. The findings revealed that knowledge (β = 0.259, p < 0.05), belief (β = 0.295, p < 0.05) and motivation (β = 0.546, p < 0.05) positively affects the behavior. These findings reflected that knowledge, belief and motivation collectively explain a total of 65.5% of variances in the formation of climate conserving behavior among Malaysian secondary school students. © 2020 by the authors.

Besides, the fluctuation of conventional fuel prices continues to obstruct the establishment of stable commercial strategies for the airlines. Meanwhile, Jet Biofuel (JBF) has been identified as a reliable alternative to conventional Jet-A fuel. Amongst the tested promising feedstocks for JBF production, Jatropha oil has gained growing attention and is believed to play a key role in the JBF industry. Though, no in-depth reviews on Jatropha JBF are found in literature, it is believed that there is a need to evaluate Jatropha as feedstock for JBF production after over 10 years of intensive research. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of Jatropha JBF production. The article offers a thorough review of the hydroprocessing of Jatropha by investigating its optimum operating conditions, recent catalyst application developments, the feasibility of JBF, its performance and environmental impact. This study concludes that Jatropha JBF production by hydroprocessing can achieve up to a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to Jet-A. While Jatropha JBF can be produced with a levelised cost as low as $0.6/kg. The main challenges facing Jatropha JBF industry has been identified to be the availability of feedstock and achieving a competitively priced JBF. As such, alternative routes to utilise the remaining parts of the Jatropha fruit into JBF production are proposed to reduce the land footprint, enhance JBF yield and minimise its selling price. The proposed pathways are expected to achieve a significant fuel yield increment of 24–89% as compared to utilising Jatropha oil alone, which remain to be evaluated in terms of technical and economic aspects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation; Fischer-tropsch; Hydroprocess; Jatropha; Jet biofuel; Seedcake","Biofuels; Environmental impact; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocracking; Jet fuel; Petroleum prospecting; Alternative routes; Application development; Biofuel production; Conventional fuel; Economic aspects; Intensive research; Optimum operating conditions; State-of-the art reviews; Petroleum industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091988714

To carry out this multivariable analysis of response, a comprehensive model for the N cycle was developed and evaluated against experimental data from a laboratory-scale deammonification granular sludge sequencing batch reactor. Different aeration strategies were tested, and the manipulated variables comprised the dissolved oxygen (DO) set point in the aerated phase, aeration on/off frequency (F), and the ratio (R) between the non-aerated and aerated phase durations. Experimental results showed that a high ammonium utilization rate (AUR) in relation to the low nitrate production rate (NPR) (NPR/AUR = 0.07-0.08) and limited N2O emissions (EN2O < 2%) could be achieved at the DO set point = 0.7 mg O2/L, R ratio = 2, and F frequency = 6-7 h-1. Under specific operational conditions (biomass concentration, NH4+-N loading rate, and temperature), simulation results confirmed the feasible aeration strategies for the trade-offs between the NOB suppression and N2O emission. The intermittent aeration regimes led to frequent shifts in the predominating N2O production pathways, that is, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidation (aerated phase) versus autotrophic denitrification (non-aerated phase).

Mass coral bleaching and mortality have recently occurred where reefs have experienced chronic low oxygen events. However, the mechanistic basis of tolerance to oxygen levels inadequate to sustain normal functioning (i.e. hypoxia) and whether it contributes to bleaching susceptibility, remain unknown. We therefore experimentally exposed colonies of the environmentally resilient Acropora tenuis, a common reef-building coral from the Great Barrier Reef, to deoxygenation–reoxygenation stress that was aligned to their natural night–day light cycle. Specifically, the treatment involved removing the ‘night-time O2 buffer’ to challenge the inherent hypoxia thresholds. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that coral possess a complete and active hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxia response system (HRS) homologous to other metazoans. As expected, A. tenuis exhibited bleaching resistance and showed a strong inducibility of HIF target genes in response to deoxygenation stress. We applied this same approach in parallel to a colony of Acropora selago, known to be environmnetally susceptible, which conversely exhibited a bleaching phenotype response. This phenotypic divergence of A. selago was accompanied by contrasting gene expression profiles indicative of varied effectiveness of their HIF-HRS. Based on our RNA-Seq analysis, we propose (a) that the HIF-HRS is central for corals to manage deoxygenation stress and (b) that key genes of this system (and the wider gene network) may contribute to variation in coral bleaching susceptibility. Our analysis suggests that heat shock protein (hsp) 70 and 90 are important for low oxygen stress tolerance and further highlights how hsp90 expression might also affect the inducibility of coral HIF-HRS in overcoming a metabolic crisis under deoxygenation stress. We propose that differences in coral HIF-HRS could be central in regulating sensitivity to other climate change stressors—notably thermal stress—that commonly drive bleaching. © 2020 The Authors.

We explore farmers’ perceptions about the impacts of their land management and the impact of social information flows on their management through a case study in a farming community in Navarra, Spain, that is undergoing agricultural intensification due to adoption of large scale irrigation. We found that modern technology adopters are aware that their management practices often have negative social-ecological implications; by contrast, more traditional farmers tend to recognize their positive impacts on non-material benefits such as those linked with traditions and traditional knowledge, and climate regulation. We found that farmers’ awareness about nature contributions to people co-production and their land management decisions determine, in part, the structure of the social networks among the farming community. Since modern farmers are at the core of the social network, they are better able to control the information flow within the community. This has important implications, such as the fact that the traditional farmers, who are more aware of their impacts on the environment, rely on information controlled by more intensive modern farmers, potentially jeopardizing sustainable practices in this region. We suggest that this might be counteracted by helping traditional farmers obtain information tailored to their practices from outside the social network. © 2021 Albizua et al.

In the pure element thorium-228 in distilled water, the radioactivity decreased faster after cavitation than the natural decay. The more complex molecule of Nickel Nitrate, made of radioactivenickel-63, in solution of nitric acid and distilled water was investigated before and after ultrasound irradiation. The X-rays produced by Bremsstrahlung of the electrons from the beta decay of Ni-63 were recorded and a 13% decrease of intensity was measured after 100 s of sonication. A decrease of nickel and an increase of other elements was detected by mass spectrometry in the sonicated sample. The Cobalt-57 decay was investigated by detecting the gamma and X-ray intensity from the Iron-57 resulting after its beta emission. In this third case too, an anomalous decay was observed after sonication. These three cases of anomalous behavior can be explained at the light of the Deformed Space-Time theory. It assumes that a suitable sudden variation of energy density can induce a local deformation of space-time, thus violating the Local Lorentz Invariance. This variation can be created by the ultrasounds in the matter, thus, allowing reactions that cannot occur in a flat (Minkowskian) space-time. The ""neutralization""of a radionuclide occurs when it undergoes a DST transformation changing the radionuclide into non-radioactive nuclides. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","deactivation; deformed space-time (DST); local Lorentz invariance (LLI) breakdown; neutralization; Nuclear reactions; radionuclides; ultrasounds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096770738

These rules are typically founded on research using well-known terrestrial taxa as models and it is thus uncertain whether aquatic macrophytes follow these macroecological rules. Our purpose is to draw together available information from broad-scale research on aquatic macrophytes growing in lakes, ponds, wetlands, rivers and streams. We summarize how different macroecological rules fit the patterns shown by freshwater plants at various spatial scales. Finally, we outline future actions which should be taken to advance macroecological research on freshwater plants. Our review suggested that some macroecological patterns are relatively well-evidenced for aquatic macrophytes, whereas little information exists for others. We found, for example, that the species richness-latitude relationship follows a unimodal pattern, and species turnover prevails over species nestedness, whereas higher nestedness-related richness differences are found in low beta diversity regions. Contrary to terrestrial plants, climate or history seem not to be dominant determinants explaining these broad-scale patterns; instead local explanatory variables (e.g., water quality, such as alkalinity and nutrients, and hydromorphology) are often important for freshwater plants. We identified several knowledge gaps related, for example, to a smaller number of studies in lotic habitats, compared with lentic habitats, lack of spatially-adequate aquatic plant studies, deficiency of comprehensive species traits databases for aquatic macrophytes, and absence of a true phylogeny comprising most freshwater plant lineages. We hope this review will encourage the undertaking of additional macroecological investigations on freshwater plants across broad spatial and temporal scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic plants; Biogeography; Freshwaters; Helophytes; Hydrophytes; Lakes; Ponds; Rivers; Streams","aquatic plant; freshwater ecosystem; macroecology; macrophyte; nestedness; phylogeny; spatiotemporal analysis; species richness",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096474924

For that purpose, the 309-km2 Lebanese Nahr Ibrahim watershed, extending over 3% of Lebanon’s surface, was chosen as a representative of the targeted settings. Generally, holistic climate change assessments encompass both climate trend analysis and future forecasting. According to the World Meteorological Organization, a continuous, homogenous, and uninterrupted climatic record for at least 30 years is needed to fulfill these tasks. Often, some Mediterranean watersheds lack such data and are hence characterized by climatic data scarcity. Such is the case of Lebanon where 30 years of wars have considerably disrupted the country’s climatic record. In an effort to overcome this state of data scarcity, remote sensing–derived drought indicators were used to determine the climate’s evolution during the last 28 years. For that purpose, several remote sensing indices were extracted from LANDSAT imageries for the period 1990–2018 at a 3-year interval, and were coupled to meteorological indicators. Forecasting was then performed using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Meteorological indices showed increased variability of precipitations and aridity periods, while remote sensing indicators collectively revealed slight shifts towards increasing droughts. Projections using ARIMA models forecasted increases of 0.9 °C, 0.7 °C, and 0.8 °C for average, maximal, minimal temperatures, and an average 6 mm decrease of precipitations at the 95% confidence level for the year 2030. The presented approach can serve as a tool for proactive climate change mitigation or adaptation plans. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"assessment method; climate change; Mediterranean environment; numerical model; remote sensing; watershed; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094648533

The use of ammonia as hydrogen carrier to meet hydrogen demands is under consideration and the goal of this paper is to evaluate environmental aspects of green hydrogen production from green ammonia imported from Australia. In the present work, a cradle to gate life cycle assessment of hydrogen production from imported green ammonia imported is carried out by using commericial life cycle assessment software Simapro. The scope of life cycle assessment includes; green ammonia production in Australia, shipping to South Korea, ammonia transportation from port to hydrogen refuelling stations in Korea, and hydrogen production through catalytic craking of ammonia. Mass and energy balance data obtained from process flow modelling are used as an input for life cycle assessment. In terms of energy consumption, hydrogen production through water electrolysis consume more than 90% of total power while ammonia synthesis only consume 5.5%. The results of life cycle assessment show that transportation of the green ammonia was the major contributor having 95% of total CO2 emissions while hydrogen production through water electrolysis was producing about 4.5% of total carbon emissions. This study reveals that considering environmental sustainability, using imported green ammonia is not a viable option until transportation fuel is replaced with an environmental friendly fuel. However, if marine fuel is replaced by a green fuel it can further reduce the transport related emissions turning this case into a viable option to meet the hydrogen related demands. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Green Ammonia; Green Hydrogen; Life Cycle Assessment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110520374

Electric mobility in different forms may be a solution. While in recent years a major focus was put on private electric vehicles, e-mobility in public transport is already a very well-established and mature technology with a long history. The core objective of this paper is to analyze the economics of e-mobility in the Austrian capital of Vienna and the corresponding impact on the environment. In this paper, the historical developments, policy framework and scenarios for the future development of mobility in Vienna up to 2030 are presented. A major result shows that in an ambitious scenario for the deployment of battery electric vehicles, the total energy demand in road transport can be reduced by about 60% in 2030 compared to 2018. The major conclusion is that the policies, especially subsidies and emission-free zones will have the largest impact on the future development of private and public e-mobility in Vienna. Regarding the environmental performance, the most important is to ensure that a very high share of electricity used for electric mobility is generated from renewable energy sources. © 2021 by the authors.

Methanol and H2 are considered as cleaner fuels, which are vastly used in my process and product base industries due to excellent combustion properties. This study aims to develop the alternative models using Aspen Plus for dual production of methanol and H2 with the control on greenhouse gas emissions. The base case model represents the coal to methanol and H2 production process, whereas, the alternative model presents the process integration approach to integrate the state-of-art coal gasification and natural gas reforming models to utilize the key technical benefits for each technology. Both the models are techno-economically compared in terms of methanol and H2 production rates, specific energy requirements, carbon conversion, CO2 specific emissions, overall process efficiencies, fuel production costs and project feasibilities. The results showed that the case 2 design offers 4.28% higher process efficiency and 18.3% reduction in specific energy requirements (GJ) for each metric ton (MT) of fuel (methanol and H2) production compared to the base case. Moreover, fuel production cost (€/MT) for the case 2 design is also 13% lower compared to the case 1 design. The comparative analysis also showed that the case 2 design reduces the CO2 specific emissions up to 34.3% compared to the case 1 design.

Research has shown that the total freshwater influx to the Arctic Ocean has been increasing, while at the same time, the rate of change in the Arctic climate is significantly higher than in other parts of the globe. This study assesses the large-scale atmospheric and surface climatic conditions affecting the magnitude, timing and regional variability of the spring freshets by analyzing historic daily discharges from sub-basins within the four largest Arctic-draining watersheds (Mackenzie, Ob, Lena and Yenisei). Results reveal that climatic variations closely match the observed regional trends of increasing cold-season flows and earlier freshets. Flow regulation appears to suppress the effects of climatic drivers on freshet volume but does not have a significant impact on peak freshet magnitude or timing measures. Spring freshet characteristics are also influenced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, particularly in their positive phases. The majority of significant relationships are found in unregulated stations. This study provides a key insight into the climatic drivers of observed trends in freshet characteristics, whilst clarifying the effects of regulation versus climate at the sub-basin scale. © 2021 by the authors.

This preliminary short-term in vitro trial using Mootral (garlic and citrus extracts), a novel natural feed supplement, was conducted to evaluate its efficacy on rumen fermentation characteristics, methane production, and the bacterial and archaeal community. The experiment was performed as a batch culture using rumen fluid collected from sheep, and Mootral was supplemented in three concentrations: 0% (Control), 10%, and 20% of the substrate (50% Grass:50% Concentrate). The rumen fermentation data and alpha diversity of microbial community were analyzed by ordinary one-way analysis of variance. The relative abundance and statistical significance of families and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among the groups were compared by Kruskal–Wallis H test using Calypso software. After 24-h incubation at 39°C, Mootral in a dose-dependent manner improved the production of total volatile fatty acids and propionate while it reduced the acetate proportion and acetate/propionate ratio. The total produced gas was two times higher in the Mootral-supplemented groups than control (P < 0.01), while the proportion of methane in the produced gas was reduced by 22% (P < 0.05) and 54% (P < 0.01) for 10 and 20% Mootral, respectively. Mootral did not change pH, digestibility, and ammonia-nitrogen. Microbial community analyses showed that Mootral effectively changed the ruminal microbiome. The bacterial community showed an increase of the relative abundance of the propionate-producing family such as Prevotellaceae (P = 0.014) and Veillonellaceae (P = 0.030), while there was a decrease in the relative abundance of some hydrogen-producing bacteria by Mootral supplementation. In the archaeal community, Methanobacteriaceae was decreased by Mootral supplementation compared with control (P = 0.032), while the Methanomassiliicoccaceae family increased in a dose-dependent effect (P = 0.038). The results of the study showed the efficacy of the new mixture to alter the ruminal microbial community, produce more propionate, and reduce microbial groups associated with methane production, thus suggesting that Mootral is a promising natural mixture for methane reduction from ruminants. © Copyright © 2021 Ahmed, Yano, Fujimori, Kand, Hanada, Nishida and Fukuma.","archaea; bacteria; methane emission; mootral; rumen","acetic acid; hydrogen; methane; propionic acid; volatile fatty acid; Article; bacterium culture; controlled study; Corriedale sheep; fermentation; in vitro study; Methanobacteriaceae; methanogenesis; Methanomassiliicoccaceae; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; population abundance; Prevotellaceae; rumen fluid; rumen microorganism; Veillonellaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100659712

This study examines wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) crop yields’ sensitivity to primary climate variables (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and related changes in irrigation water demand at different spatial (i.e., province/state, districts and grid cell) and temporal (i.e., seasonal and crop growth phase) scales. To estimate the climate driven variations in crop yields, observed and modelled data applying the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) model are used for six selected study sites in the IGB river basins over the period 1981–2010. Our statistical analysis underscores the importance of impacts assessments at higher spatio-temporal scales. Our grid cell (aggregated over study sites) scale analysis shows that 27–72% variations in wheat and 17–55% in rice crop yields are linked with temperature variations at a significance level of p < 0.001. In the absence of irrigation application, up to 39% variations in wheat and up to 75% variations in rice crop yields are associated with precipitation changes in all study sites. Whereas, observed crop yields show weak correlations with temperature at a coarser resolution, i.e., up to 4% at province and up to 31% at district scales. Crop yields also showed stronger sensitivity to climate variables at higher temporal scale (i.e., vegetative and reproductive phases) having statistically strong negative relationship with temperature and positive with precipitation during the reproductive phase. Similarly, crop phase-specific variations in climate variables have considerable impacts (i.e., quantity and timing) on irrigation water demand. For improved crop water planning, we suggest integrated climate impact assessments at higher spatio-temporal scales which can help to devise appropriate adaptation strategies for sustaining future food demand. © 2020 by the authors.

The latter is a characteristic generally associated with solid-state only. Since the idea of porous liquid was exploited over a decade ago, the researchers see an opportunity of solving the solid material's limitation in gas capture and separation. In this discussion, we present the most recent developments on porous liquids and, in our perspectives, how they can tackle energy and environmental issues by their coupling with membrane technology. In a broader context, the need to reduce greenhouse gas, chlorofluorocarbons and other gaseous emissions is essential for tackling climate change and to achieve the 2015 Paris Agreement goals. In addition, the energy used for chemical separations in industrial processes accounts for 10–15% of the world's energy consumption. Thus, improved separation technologies will reduce energy consumption and the spreading of negative-emission technologies such as carbon capture sequestration and utilization (CCSU). Despite the imperative necessity of CCSU, many candidates are still considered the key technology due to the complex balancing between economic, technical and ecological advantages and drawbacks. Porous materials, which are usually solids, are of great interest for absorption due to the presence of permanent cavities, but liquids are easier to handle at the industrial scale. Porous liquids are a good compromise between these two traditional classes of materials. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon capture; Greenhouse gas emission; Membrane separation; Permanent porosity; Porous liquid",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102079322

However, there is still no consensus on the magnitude of the impacts of a transition to a circular economy and on whether it will generate a ‘win-win-win’ situation in terms of macroeconomic, social and environmental benefits. In this paper, we review more than 300 circular economy scenarios in the time frame from 2020 to 2050. We classify each scenario according to the degree of intervention (i.e. ambitious or moderate), and perform a meta-analysis of the changes in gross domestic product, job creation, and CO2 emissions generated by each circular economy scenario compared with a business-as-usual scenario. Among other results, we find that in 2030 the implementation of ambitious circular economy scenarios could generate a ‘win-win-win’ situation with marginal or incremental changes in gross domestic product (median (mdn) = 2.0%; interquartile range (IQR) = [0.4–4.6]%) and employment (mdn = 1.6%; IQR = [0.9–2.0]%), while reducing CO2 emissions in a more substantial way (mdn = −24.6%; IQR = -[34.0–8.2]%). Furthermore, we discuss the modelling features (e.g. resource taxes, technology changes, and consumption patterns) suggested in the literature which yield the greatest changes in gross domestic product, job creation, and CO2 emissions. The outcomes of this paper are relevant to the scientific community and policy makers for understanding the magnitude of the macroeconomic, social and environmental impacts of circular economy scenarios. © 2020 The Author(s)","Circular economy; Computable general equilibrium; Input-output analysis; Resource efficiency; Scenario analysis","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Employment; Consumption patterns; Gross domestic products; Incremental changes; Inter quartile ranges; Prospective study; Scientific community; Social and environmental; Social and environmental impact; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089743358

This study addresses the latter response category. In particular, it examines the extent to which political partisanship influences states’ energy efficiency policies. For context, energy efficiency improvement is one of the leading tools used to deal with energy consumption-related environmental problems, including climate change. Analysis of panel data spanning several years, indeed, shows that political partisanship is a leading driver of states’ energy efficiency policies. More specifically, there is evidence that Republican Party dominance in states is negatively related to these policies, which is consistent with findings from prior studies and the political partisanship explanation of environmental commitment and protection. However, part of this relationship is influenced by the strength of the fossil fuel industry, that is, coal production. It would seem that the political consideration among Republicans that has stymied policy response to climate change at the federal level is exerting a likewise influence at the state level. Based on the findings reported here and in prior studies, getting a handle on the environmental challenges of today will require getting Americans identifying as Republicans to embrace the need for environmental protection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy efficiency policy; Environmental policy; Political partisanship","coal; fossil fuel; natural gas; petroleum; American; Article; climate change; dependent variable; energy consumption; environmental policy; environmental protection; government; government regulation; greenhouse gas; human; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095749156

Estimated health impacts of the reduction of these emissions under three scenarios are presented. The EMEP4PL model and base year emission inventory were used to estimate average annual PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations with spatial resolution of 4 km × 4 km. The change in emissions under each of the scenarios was based on data from a survey on household boilers and insulation. Scenario 1 included replacement of all poor-quality coal-fired boilers with gas boilers; Scenario 2 included replacement of all poor-quality coal-fired boilers with low-emission boilers but still using solid fuels; and Scenario 3 included the thermal refurbishment of houses with the worst insulation. Impacts on the following health parameters were estimated: premature deaths (PD), Chronic Bronchitis (CB), Bronchitis in Children (BiC) and Work Days Lost (WDL). The concentration–response functions recommended by the WHO HRAPIE project were used. The analysis was conducted for two regions: Lower Silesia and Lodzkie province. The largest reduction of health impact was observed for Scenario 1. For Lower Silesia, the annual PD decreased by 1122 (34.3%), CB by 1516 (26.6%), BiC by 9602 (27.7%) and WDL by 481k (34.7%). For Lodzkie province, the largest impacts were estimated as decreases in PD by 1438 (29.9%), CB by 1502 (25.3%), BiC by 9880 (26.8%) and WDL by 669k (30.4%). © 2020 by the authors.

The present work has been aimed at analyzing the atmospheric pollutants concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) and spatio-temporal distribution of cases and deaths (specifically incidence, mortality and lethality rates) across the whole Italian national territory, down to the level of each individual territorial area, with the goal of checking any potential short-term correlation between these two phenomena. The data analysis has been limited to the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the lockdown-dependent biased effects on the atmospheric pollutant levels as much as possible. The analysis looked at non-linear, monotonic correlations using the Spearman non-parametric correlation index. The statistical significance of the Spearman correlations has also been evaluated. The results of the statistical analysis suggest the hypothesis of a moderate-to-strong correlation between the number of days exceeding the annual regulatory limits of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 atmospheric pollutants and COVID-19 incidence, mortality and lethality rates for all the 107 territorial areas in Italy. A weak-to-moderate correlation seems to exist when considering the 36 territorial areas in four of the most affected regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). Overall, PM10 and PM2.5 showed a higher non-linear correlation than NO2 with incidence, mortality and lethality rates. As to particulate matters, PM10 profile has been compared with the incidence rate variation that occurred in three of the most affected territorial areas in Northern Italy (i.e., Milan, Brescia, and Bergamo). All areas showed a similar PM10 time trend but a different incidence rate variation, that was less severe in Milan compared with Brescia and Bergamo. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Non-parametric correlation; PM10; PM2.5, and NO2; Short-term exposure","Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Atmospheric pollutants; Non-linear correlations; Particulate Matter; Short-term correlation; Short-term exposure; Spatiotemporal distributions; Spearman correlation; Statistical significance; Population statistics; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); correlation; COVID-19; disease spread; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollution exposure; viral disease; air pollution; air quality; Article; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; disease transmission; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; human; incidence; Italy; lethality; mortality; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; Italy; pollutant; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Lombardy; Piedmont [Italy]; Veneto; Coronavirus; Emilia; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; COVID-19; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Italy; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093673556

Road networks, as a part of a transport system, are among the most important lifeline systems. Urban road networks experience serious congestion because of infrequent major disruptions. Due to these disruptions the traffic system performance is reduced and the travel time and emissions in a road network are increased. This paper describes a method for optimising traffic signal settings (i.e. green times and offsets) to assist drivers to avoid partial or complete blockages, to minimise the travel time or carbon dioxide emissions in the case of disruptions in road networks. This method involves applying the Cross-Entropy optimisation method, along with a semi-dynamic approach, to optimise traffic signal control in disrupted road networks. This includes investigating two objective functions: minimising the travel time or minimising carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve this, short-term blockages are tested with different durations (a degradation for 4 minutes up to full hour) and level of capacity reductions (i.e. 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). The results for minimising the travel time, in the Cambridge (UK) network, show that applying signal optimisation reduces the travel time by almost 6% and carbon dioxide emissions by almost 8% for a complete capacity reduction at the most congested node, compared to not optimising the signal settings. © 2020 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies","Carbon dioxide emissions; Cross-Entropy method; Disrupted networks; Resilience; Semi-dynamic assignment; Traffic signal optimisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091218326

Therefore, this study highlights the potential of retrofitting the existing rural house utilizing pervasive construction technologies in diminishing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions as a climate change mitigation strategy. The current modern rural house and the construction typologies were characterized. This study selected a typical modern rural dwelling located in Al-Gharbia Governorate in the Delta region. The suggested retrofitting strategies were applied to the external building envelope. The impact on the annual energy consumption of cooling and heating loads was evaluated using an Energy Performance Assessment Tool (Design Builder). An optimal envelope configuration was suggested, then an economic assessment and an investigation to the local acceptance were provided. The results showed that using the commonly used construction techniques as a retrofitting strategy can plummet the energy consumption and CO2 emissions by one-third worthy of mentioning that the locals have shown a lack of interest in the investment in retrofitting their buildings as well as the economic model showed that the investment is not profitable.

Thus, this study use UAVs to develop a method to estimate the biomass and carbon stock of native desert shrubs. The method integrates different techniques and software to monitor native plants' coverage, biomass, and carbon stock. The techniques used in this work are also applicable for other native desert shrubs in the region and could support ecosystem managers in assessing and monitoring arid ecosystems and restoration and revegetation programs.

Considering a widespread in the composition and properties of potential oil sludge raw materials and their tendency for either formation of stable emulsions or phase separation, we have conducted in-depth modern physical and chemical studies and defined the need to develop a commercial oil-containing wastes purification method. We have designed the device, in which oil product hydrocarbons undergo thermal treatment using solar energy. Following oil-containing wastes purification using solar energy, the particulate load in soil does not exceed 6.65-6.79 % and the absolute molecular weight of hydrocarbons approaches that of bitumen.

Ecological concepts from (semi)natural grasslands suggest that manipulating plant community composition using plant species with different traits may represent a promising opportunity to face this challenge. Here, we translate these trait-based concepts to agricultural systems in a field experiment, aiming to reveal the main determinants of how plant community composition regulates N-cycling in intensively managed grasslands. We focused on key N pools (plant N from soil and from biological N-fixation, soil mineral N and N2O emissions) as well as on biological drivers of N-cycling in soil (abundance of N-cycling microbial communities, earthworm populations and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), using three common grass and one legume species in monoculture, two- and four-species mixtures. We hypothesized that: (a) plant species mixtures increase plant N uptake, reduce soil mineral N concentrations and N2O emissions and promote the abundance of biological N-cyclers; (b) legume presence stimulates N pools, fluxes and biological N-cycling activity, (c) but in combination with a grass with acquisitive traits, more N is retained in the plant community, while N2O emissions are reduced. We found that mixtures increased plant N and lowered the soil mineral N pool compared to monocultures. However, plant species identity played an overarching role: Legume presence increased N2O emissions, plant N pools, soil mineral N and the abundance of N-cycling microbes and earthworms. Combining the legume with a grass with low leaf dry matter content and high root length density (and with high root biomass) reduced the higher soil mineral N and N2O emissions induced by the legume, while harnessing positive effects on plant N pools and biological N-fixation. Synthesis and applications. Our results show the potential of plant community composition to steer N-cycling in fertilized agroecosystems, paving the way for a more biologically based agriculture. Legumes will play a crucial role, but selecting an optimum companion species is key for the sustainability of the agroecosystem. © 2020 The Authors.

The study of soil microbiome in such areas is crucial for both understanding the forces driving soil formation and optimization of the reclamation techniques. This study is aimed to investigate the soil microbiome of different ages of soil formation on the heaps of limestone mines in conditions of boreal climate of North-West of Russia. Soil microbiome analysis was performed using high-throughput sequencing. Soils of the investigated sites were predominantly Rhendzic Leptosols. The initial set (2 years) of OTUs in the entire period of soil formation remains unchanged, accumulating more than 98% of the total microbiome in each time point. Analysis of beta-diversity (weighted and unweighted) demonstrated a clear differentiation of microbiomes of all time points, which suggests that underlying taxonomic structure variations can be attributed to variation of the minor taxa set composition. The most significant differences occur in Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria, but majority of these phyla have different sets of OTUs demonstrating opposite trends. Generally time positively correlate with microbiome of carbonate soils in all cases of benchmark and newly formed soils is familiar because of the uniform zonal environmental conditions in geochemically specific landscape of Izhora upland. © 2021 Eveny Abakumov et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.","high-throughput sequencing; microbiome; North-West Russia; self-restoration; soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101607139
