Sustainable prosperity becomes apprehensive in contemporary society, marked by inequalities and wars within and among nations, and sustainable development appears ambiguous. Berry believes humans should recognize their role as guardians of the earth and live in partnership and solidarity with all living beings. He critiques the modern era’s dominant principles of acquisitiveness, self-centeredness, and short-sightedness, as well as the destructive aspects of prosperity, justice, and peace. His arguments have an essential role in this society when we envision the Planetary Management mission primarily through the SDGs – Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG13) according to SDG 2030 agenda. This paper analyses the possibility of maintaining sustainable prosperity through a culture of agriculture, where one does not denigrate human labour, lose family farms, and destroy nature for economic development. The ethical interface of this paper emphasizes that everyone should consider it imperative to safeguard natural harmony, food security, and people’s wellbeing; without which sustainability becomes questionable and impossible. © 2021 Journal of Dharma: Dharmaram Journal of Religions and Philosophies (DVK, Bangalore), ISSN: 0253-7222.","Boomers and stickers; Culture of agriculture; Ecological interconnectedness; Exploiter and nurturer; Linear and cyclical vision; Local community; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120786666

This study implements a sharp regression discontinuity (RD) design and makes an assessment on air quality control effectiveness of the Method based on the high-volume big data acquired from 173 cities in China. The results show that the Method has significantly improved air pollution control on the overall air quality index (AQI) and reducing concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO across the country in the observation periods. However, no reduction effect was observed for O3. The robustness tests support the conclusion as well. Besides, the heterogeneity analysis illustrates that the policy had a significant short-term treatment effect in East, South, Central, North, Northwest, Southwest, and Northeast China. However, the Method’s effect is found to decline over time either nationwide or regionally according to the persistence analysis. Therefore, this article puts forward several suggestions regarding the formulation of long-term regulations for air pollution control, the transformation of the growth model for sustainable development, and optimization of the incentive system for improved pollution control and prevention. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Huang, Zhang, Xia, Xu and Nong.","air quality; big data; policy assessments; pollutant concentration; sharp regression discontinuity design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117114773

Therefore, walkability is a core urban design element because of being advantageous onto three fronts: health, livability, and sustainability. Adopting walkability as urban solution relieves conceptual and practical tensions between the individualistic interests manifested in the desire to own and use private cars, and the need to reduce transportation-based consumption. This review advocates that long-term health benefits from walking and physical activity are the premier incentive to repurpose our cities to be more sustainable and more walking friendly, and spark behavioral change into reducing car dependency for all daily transportations. The review inspects physical elements of the built environment that make the walking trip feasible and desirable, such as connectivity, accessibility, and closeness of destination points, presence of greenness and parks, commercial retail, and proximity to transit hubs and stations. Hence, this review explores a few popular walkability evaluation indices and frameworks that employ subjective, objective, and/or distinctive methods within variant environmental, cultural, and national context. There is no unified universal standardized walkability theory despite the need for rigorous evaluation tools for policy makers and developers. Furthermore, there is a lack of emphasis on air quality and thermal stress while approaching walkability, despite being important elements in the walking experience. Research opportunities in the field of walkability can leverage location tracking from smart devices and identify the interaction patterns of pedestrians with other transportation modes, especially for those with fundamental movement challenges such as wheelchair users. © Copyright © 2021 Baobeid, Koç and Al-Ghamdi.","built environment; health; livability; sustainability; walkability evaluations",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117087292

An introduction of boron atoms along the short axis of the diazapentacene backbone induces multiple emission characteristics. Our studies reveal that the weak molecular orbital (MO) coupling of the S3-S1 transition is responsible for the slow internal conversion rates. Such MO coupling-regulated anti-Kasha emission is different from the large band gap-induced anti-Kasha emission character of classical azulene derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that a strong MO coupling of the S3-S0 transition is responsible for the higher photoluminescence quantum yield of the anti-Kasha emission in a more polar solution (tetrahydrofuran: 11%; cyclohexane: 0%). Such an MO coupling factor is generally overlooked in anti-Kasha emitters reported previously. Furthermore, the multiple emission can be regulated by solvent polarity, solvent temperature, and fluoride anion binding. As a proof of concept of harvesting high-energy emission, the multiple emission character has allowed us to design single-molecule white-light-emitting materials. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Boron; Chromophores; Energy gap; Excited states; Fluorine compounds; Light emission; Solvents; Azulene derivatives; Boron atom; Emission characteristics; Energy; Excited-state energy; Excited-states; Functionalized; Internal conversion rates; Large band; Organic chromophores; Molecular orbitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116663103

Here, confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to map the electrolyte pH near a copper gas diffusion electrode during CO2reduction with micron spatial resolution in three dimensions. We observed that the local pH increased from pH 6.8 to greater than pH 10 as the current density was increased from 0 to 28 mA/cm2in a 100 mM KHCO3electrolyte. Variations in the pH across the surface indicate areas of locally increased activity. Within deep trenches of the active layer, the local pH increases as trench width decreases. Computational models confirm these experimental results and also showed that the catalyst found within narrow trenches is more active than that found at the surface of the electrode.

The risk of invasion by individual species was also assessed using species' predicted area in combination with some biological traits associated with invasiveness (growth form, reproduction mechanisms, and age of maturity). A higher number of species would find suitable climatic conditions along the coast; the Central Western (CW) and South Western (SW) were ecoregions where a higher number of species were predicted. Overall, hot spots of species distribution were similar under current and future climatic conditions; however, individual species' predicted area (increase or decrease) was variable depending on the climate change scenario and the greenhouse gas emission. Out of the 170 species assessed, 22% ranked as high-risk species, with herbs, grasses, and vines accounting for 78% within this risk class, and a high proportion (67%) of Asteraceae species ranked as high risk.

Exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion to the eastern coastlines of China has been shown to alter trophic relationship of benthos in mangrove wetlands, but little is known about potential effect of exotic litter decomposition on food sources of benthic macrofauna. We took the advantage of significant differences in the δ13C values of exotic S. alterniflora (C4 plant) from a native mangrove species Kandelia obovata (C3 plant) to investigate leaf carbon assimilation by polychaetes during litter decomposition. We found that exotic S. alterniflora leaf litter decomposed more slowly than that of native mangrove species at the mangrove site (P = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between them at the salt marsh site (P = 0.270). The polychaetes assimilated major organic matter from K. obvata and the particulate organic matter (&gt; 90%) at the mangrove site. But the polychaetes assimilated major organic matter from S. alterniflora (&gt; 60%) at the salt marsh site. However, after adding S. alterniflora leaf litter at the mangrove site, polychaetes assimilated more carbon from S. alterniflora (&gt; 45%) than that from K. obovata (&lt; 25%). Furthermore, the significant carbon assimilation only occurred within a short period time (1–2 months) during decomposition. Our results suggested that Spartina invasion can change food sources of local mangrove polychaetes through utilizing the organic matter released from litter decomposition, but such assimilation of exotic foods is of short time nature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biological invasion; Cordgrass; Decomposition; Food source; Kandelia obovata; Stable isotope analysis","leaf litter; mangrove; particulate organic matter; polychaete; saltmarsh; China; Kandelia obovata; Polychaeta; Spartina; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111311878

Close to nature forestry may help forests to continue to acting as carbon sinks by promoting their resilience against disturbances. The EU decided to carry out carbon accounting of emissions and removals from managed forests under the Paris Agreement (PA) by using a projected Forest Reference Level (FRL) based on the continuation of recent management practices. Methods: We developed four conceptual scenarios that could build the Swiss Forest Reference Level and performed simulations over 50 years using Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) data and the empirical forest model MASSIMO. To improve MASSIMO, we further developed a new tree species-specific model for small scale mortality that accounts for the Swiss NFI design. Then, using projected biomass and mortality from MASSIMO, carbon budgets of mineral soil, litter, and dead wood were estimated using the Yasso07 model. Results: The U-shaped mortality model performed well (AUC 0.7). Small as well as large trees had the highest mortality probabilities, reflecting both young trees dying due to self-thinning and old trees from age, pests or abiotic influences. All scenarios matched their given harvesting and growing stock targets, whereby the share of broadleaves increased in all regions of Switzerland. This resulted in decreasing biomass growth, possibly due to a species shift from typically fast growing and more shade tolerant conifers to broadleaves. The CO2-balance of the conceptual scenarios ranged from 1.06 to −3.3 Mt CO2 a–1 under Increased Harvesting and Recent Management Practices (RMP), respectively. Rotation periods are shortened under Increased Harvesting, which is an important climate adaptive management strategy, but forests were predicted to become a net carbon source. In contrast, RMP resulted in similar harvesting amounts and forests as carbon sinks, as reported in the past. Further, the RMP scenario does not involve political assumptions and reflects the idea of the CMP approach used by the EU member states, which makes it comparable to other countries. Therefore, we propose the scenario RMP as a suitable and ideal candidate for the Swiss FRL. © Copyright © 2021 Stadelmann, Portier, Didion, Rogiers and Thürig.","carbon; CMP; forest model; forest reference level; FRL; MASSIMO; Paris Agreement; Yasso07",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117084105

Herein, we report the design of novel Fe doped CoP hierarchical double-shelled nanocages (Fe-CoP HDSNC) via a MOF-templated approach for highly efficient visible-light-driven CO2reduction. The unique hierarchical double-shelled hollow architectures can greatly shorten the charge transfer distances and also expose abundant reactive sites. Moreover, Fe atoms doping is able to reduce the CO2activation energy barrier through stabilizing the *COOH intermediates and promote the CO desorption by destabilizing the CO* adduct. As expected, the Fe-CoP HDSNC achieves an unprecedented catalytic efficiency in visible-light-driven CO2reduction with an up to 3.25% apparent quantum yield and 90.3% CO selectivity, superior to most of the state-of-the-art photocatalysts under comparable conditions. More importantly, the Fe-CoP HDSNC is also highly effective under diluted CO2atmosphere, suggesting the practicability of the present photocatalytic system. © 2021 American Chemical Society","heteroatom doping; hierarchical double-shelled nanocages; metal phosphides; metal−organic frameworks; photocatalytic CO2 reduction","Activation energy; Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Iron; Light; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Phosphorus compounds; Quantum theory; CO 2 reduction; Heteroatom doping; Heteroatoms; Hierarchical double-shelled nanocage; Metal phosphides; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Nanocages; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic CO2reduction; Visible-light-driven; Organometallics; Activation Energy; Carbon Dioxide; Charge Transfer; Iron; Light; Phosphorus Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116667027

However, biomass burning emissions and smoke remain among the largest sources of uncertainties in air quality forecasts. In this study, we evaluate the smoke emissions and plume forecasts from 12 state-of-the-art air quality forecasting systems during the Williams Flats fire in Washington State, US, August 2019, which was intensively observed during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign. Model forecasts with lead times within 1 d are intercompared under the same framework based on observations from multiple platforms to reveal their performance regarding fire emissions, aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface PM2.5, plume injection, and surface PM2.5 to AOD ratio. The comparison of smoke organic carbon (OC) emissions suggests a large range of daily totals among the models, with a factor of 20 to 50. Limited representations of the diurnal patterns and day-to-day variations of emissions highlight the need to incorporate new methodologies to predict the temporal evolution and reduce uncertainty of smoke emission estimates. The evaluation of smoke AOD (sAOD) forecasts suggests overall underpredictions in both the magnitude and smoke plume area for nearly all models, although the high-resolution models have a better representation of the fine-scale structures of smoke plumes. The models driven by fire radiative power (FRP)-based fire emissions or assimilating satellite AOD data generally outperform the others. Additionally, limitations of the persistence assumption used when predicting smoke emissions are revealed by substantial underpredictions of sAOD on 8 August 2019, mainly over the transported smoke plumes, owing to the underestimated emissions on 7 August. In contrast, the surface smoke PM2.5 (sPM2.5) forecasts show both positive and negative overall biases for these models, with most members presenting more considerable diurnal variations of sPM2.5. Overpredictions of sPM2.5 are found for the models driven by FRP-based emissions during nighttime, suggesting the necessity to improve vertical emission allocation within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Smoke injection heights are further evaluated using the NASA Langley Research Center's Differential Absorption High Spectral Resolution Lidar (DIAL-HSRL) data collected during the flight observations. As the fire became stronger over 3-8 August, the plume height became deeper, with a day-today range of about 2-9 km a.g.l. However, narrower ranges are found for all models, with a tendency of overpredicting the plume heights for the shallower injection transects and underpredicting for the days showing deeper injections. The misrepresented plume injection heights lead to inaccurate vertical plume allocations along the transects corresponding to transported smoke that is 1 d old. Discrepancies in model performance for surface PM2.5 and AOD are further suggested by the evaluation of their ratio, which cannot be compensated for by solely adjusting the smoke emissions but are more attributable to model representations of plume injections, besides other possible factors including the evolution of PBL depths and aerosol optical property assumptions. By consolidating multiple forecast systems, these results provide strategic insight on pathways to improve smoke forecasts.

The regulation of the light emission shows great application potential in next-generation optoelectronic devices. Herein, by the physical vapor deposition strategy, we synthesize monolayer hexagonal-shaped WS2, and its photoluminescence intensity mapping show three-fold symmetric patterns with alternating bright and dark regions. Regardless of the length of the edges, all domains with S-terminated edges show lower photoluminescence intensity, while all regions with W-terminated edges exhibit higher photoluminescence intensity. The photoluminescence segmentation mechanism is studied in detail by employing Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy, and it is found to originate from different strain distributions in the S-terminated region and the W-terminated region. The optical band gap determined by the photoluminescence in the dark region is ∼2 meV lower than that in the bright region, implying that more strain is stored in the S-terminated region than in the W-terminated region. The photoluminescence segmentation vanishes in transferred hexagonal-shaped WS2from the initial substrate to a fresh silicon substrate, further confirming the physical mechanism.

With the increased demand of energy and faster depletion of conventional energy sources like petroleum extracts, the alternative solutions to retain the reserves are increasing Energy Efficiency and integration of renewable energy sources. World action plans with respect to CO2 mitigation and climate change has a remarkable action in cutting down of coal and gas based conventional power generation. For a sustainable development, the penetration of renewable energy sources to the power grid has a commendable increase in the past five years and will continue as such. With the increased tying of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind has resulted in attachment of more power converters to the power system leading to power system stability issues.

We explored possible phylogenetic bases for tree RWU using two independent data sets: (a) observed root and local groundwater depths representing 502 tree species, and (b) groundwater, soil, and xylem water isotopic evidence for groundwater uptake representing 412 species. Maximum rooting depths (RDMAX), the ratio between RDMAX and mean water table depth (WT) (RDMAX/WT), and isotopic evidence of groundwater uptake showed significant phylogenetic signals, suggesting that tree RWU strategies are more similar among closely related species.

Herein, we used systematic screening of multi-doped Ca3LuAl3B4O15(CLAB) samples to evaluate singly and doubly doped down-converting phosphors that exhibit tuning emission and spectrally pure red emission with high color purity at the ultraviolet light excitation and enhanced thermal stability. A comprehensive kinetic model of the energy transfer (ET) mechanism was developed and validated with the extensive experimental data set. Applying this model, we elucidated the ET mechanisms producing a spectrally pure red emission via dipole-dipole interaction. Moreover, CL0.8AB:0.1Ce3+,0.1Sm3+revealed excellent chemical stability under 80% relative humidity and 80 °C severe thermal conditions. Interestingly, when the temperature was increased from 300 to 425 K, the intensity of Ce3+emission was reduced with the production of certain Sm3+emissions via ET.

The doping Bi3+ions selected in this study perfectly avoid this requirement, and they are environmentally friendly and safe. Nevertheless, the spectral tuning of Bi3+is a great challenge that limits its application. Herein, by regulating the value ofxin the new solid solution Sr2+xLa1−xGaO5−xFx, the luminescence of Bi3+is well promoted. Through an excitation-driven strategy, the emission peak position of Bi3+is redshifted, and the luminescence of trivalent bismuth is successfully adjusted, which can also be applied to anti-blue lighting. In addition, we constructed a Bi3+-Eu3+dual luminescence system, and, regardless of changes in the Bi3+/Eu3+concentration or excitation wavelength, a single matrix white light phosphor was realized. Through calculations, the activation energy of the phosphor doped with 2.5%Eu3+was found to be 0.257 eV, which is higher than the activation energy of some common compounds. This indicates that the phosphor has good application prospects in the field of solid-state lighting. It is worth noting that based on the different thermal response behaviors of Bi3+and Eu3+, when the Eu3+content is fixed at 1%, the maximum relative sensitivity of the optical thermometer based on its fluorescence intensity ratio is about 1.46% K−1at 383 K, which is higher than that of Bi3+and Eu3+co-doped phosphors previously reported. We also obtained a high absolute sensitivity of 0.00139 K−1at 403 K. Therefore, we also studied the thermal sensitivity of Bi3+and Er3+co-doped solid solutions. The results show that this solid-solution phosphor has far-reaching application prospects in the temperature sensing field. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Bismuth; Lighting; Luminescence; Phosphors; Solid solutions; Application prospect; Bismuth-doped; Co-doped; D-f Transitions; Gallate; Lanthanide ion; Modulation strategy; Synthesis conditions; Trivalents; Tunable emissions; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115614193

Thus, thymidine was converted to diacetylthymidine, which on potassium persulphate oxidation afforded 3′,5′-di-O-acetyl-5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine. In strategy A, diacetylated 5-formyldeoxyuridine was reacted with a variety of 2-aminopyridines and alkyl/aryl isocyanides under optimized GBB reaction conditions followed by deacetylation of the resulting GBB products to afford 5-azaindolizino-2′-deoxyuridines in 83 to 95% overall yields. In strategy B, diacetylated 5-formyldeoxyuridine was first deacetylated, which on GBB reaction under standardised conditions with 2-aminopyridines and alkyl/aryl isocyanides afforded the desired 5-azaindolizino-2′-deoxyuridines in 21 to 23% overall yields, which clearly indicates that strategy A is far more efficient than strategy B. The emission spectra of the synthesized 5-azaindolizino-2′-deoxyuridines exhibited a strong band around 360 nm (excitation at 239 nm) in fluorescence studies. Photophysical studies of these nucleosides showed a high level of fluorescence with Stokes shift in the range 59-126 nm, which indicated their potential for the study of the local structure and dynamics of nucleic acids involving them. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2021.",,"Acetylation; Cyanides; Emission spectroscopy; Potassium compounds; 2-Aminopyridine; Aryl isocyanides; Deacetylation; Deoxyuridine; Efficient synthesis; Persulfate oxidation; Photophysical properties; Potassium persulphate; Reaction conditions; Reaction under; Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115339829

Polyethylene glycol and 4,4-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate are used as hydrophilic soft and hydrophobic hard segments, respectively, for polymer self-assembly and polyurethane gelation in a nanoreactor. The nanocarrier synthesis and the pesticide loading are realized by a one-step integration procedure and suited well for hydrophobic active compounds. Modifying the molecular structure of the soft segment can adjust the flexibility of the nanocarriers and result in viscosity and deformation characteristics. After foliar spray application, the foliar flattening state of the nanogels increases the foliar protection area by 2.21 times and improves both pesticide exposure area and target contact efficiency. Concurrently, the flexibility and viscosity of the nanogels increase the washing resistance and the retention rate of the pesticide by approximately 80 times under continuous washing. The encapsulation of the nanogels reduces the foliar ultraviolet (UV) degradation and aquatic pesticide exposure, which increase the security of λ-cyhalothrine by 9.33 times. Moreover, the degradability of nanogels is beneficial for pesticide exposure and reducing pollution. This system has simple preparation, good properties, and environmental friendliness, making the nanocarriers promising for delivering pesticides. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","degradability; flexibility; foliar pinning; nanogels; self-assembly; washing and UV resistance","Adhesives; Condensation reactions; Gelation; Hydrophobicity; Nanostructured materials; Polyethylenes; Viscosity; Washing; Deformation Characteristics; Environmental friendliness; Environmental risks; Foliar application; Integration procedure; Nano-delivery systems; Polymer self-assembly; Ultraviolet degradation; Pesticides; pesticide; adhesion; Adhesiveness; Nanogels; Pesticides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114632528

The choice of the object of study-the city of St. Petersburg-is connected with the fact that the city has a network of posts for environmental monitoring of the state of the air environment, providing up-to-date information for making a forecast scheme. As a result of the conducted research, the authors identified groups of meteorological and synoptic characteristics, as well as formed databases of hydrometeorological data and series of concentrations of a number of impurities for the period from 2006 to 2014.

High working temperatures result in optimized kinetics and higher efficiencies in comparison to other fuel cell types. Among different designs, Anode Supported Cells (ASCs) and Electrolyte Supported Cells are currently the most promising configurations on a commercial scale. This work analyses these two designs with a focus on electrochemical features as the main performance marker. The study was carried out using both theoretical and experimental approaches on planar single cells. A detailed test campaign at different operating conditions in terms of temperature, fuel and oxidant composition was designed. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and current-voltage (I-V) measurements were used to identify the contributions of different cell components. The electrochemical kinetics derived from the individual resistance terms was implemented in a 2D simulation tool (SIMFC-SIMulation of Fuel Cells) to obtain the detailed global cell behaviour and to understand local occurring mechanisms on anodic and cathodic cell planes. The model was validated for an anode supported cell consisting of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSCF-CGO and an electrolyte supported cell consisting of Ni-CGO/YSZ/LSCF-CGO, showing the possibility to tune the parameters depending on analysed cells. © Copyright © 2021 Padinjarethil, Bianchi, Bosio and Hagen.","anode supported cell; EIS analysis; electrolyte supported cell; fuel cell microstructure; local modelling; semi-empirical kinetics; solid oxide fuel cell","Anodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Gas fuel purification; Kinetics; Solid electrolytes; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Anode supported cell; Cell microstructures; EIS analyse; Electrochemical modeling; Electrolyte-supported cells; Fuel cell microstructure; Local model; Semi-empirical; Semi-empirical kinetic; Solid-oxide fuel cell; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116893454

This study used the panel data of 11 provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2008 to 2016. A panel threshold model is constructed to explore the non-linear relationship between FDI and carbon emissions performance from the perspective of marketization level. The main conclusions are as follows: First, from the perspective of marketization level, a significant double threshold effect exists between foreign participation and carbon emission intensity, with threshold values of 4.4701 and 9.2516 respectively. Second, as the marketization level increases, the technology spillover effect of FDI increases, and the stimulation effect of foreign participation on carbon intensity decreases significantly, but it does not inhibit carbon intensity, indicating that the overall benefits brought by FDI technology spillovers are still insufficient to offset pollution caused by foreign investment. Third, the eastern region of the Yangtze River Economic Belt has crossed the second threshold. In the central and western regions, the marketization process is relatively slow except for Chongqing, and the regions are still firmly stuck between the first and second thresholds. In response to the conclusions of the empirical research, relevant policy suggestions are put forward from three dimensions, namely, the strategy of introducing foreign investment, construction of the marketization system, and environmental regulation, to achieve low-carbon and green development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. © Copyright © 2021 Hu, Wang, Zhao, Xi, Li, Shi, Lu, Yu, Liu, Li and Zhou.","carbon intensity; foreign direct investment; marketization level; threshold effect; Yangtze River Economic Belt",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116886405

Does conversion to RSC result in GWP reduction? Design Using BS PAS 2050:2011 principles, a retrospective, before/after intervention quantitative model together with a purpose-designed, attributional â € cradle-to-grave' life-cycle tool, were used to determine the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the two sharps containment systems. Functional unit was total fill line litres (FLL) of sharps containers needed to dispose of sharps for 1-year period in 40 trusts. Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions were included. Results were workload-normalised using National Health Service (NHS) national hospital patient-workload indicators. A sensitivity analysis examined areas of data variability. Setting Acute care hospital trusts in UK. Participants 40 NHS hospital Trusts using RSC. Intervention Conversion from SSC to RSC. SSC and RSC usage details in 17 base line trusts immediately prior to 2018 were applied to the RSC usage details of the 40 trusts using RSC in 2019. Primary outcome measure The comparison of GWP calculated in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 e) generated in the manufacture, transport, service and disposal of 12 months, hospital-wide usage of both containment systems in the 40 trusts. Results The 40 trusts converting to RSC reduced their combined annual GWP by 3267.4 tonnes CO2e (-83.9%); eliminated incineration of 900.8 tonnes of plastic; eliminated disposal/recycling of 132.5 tonnes of cardboard and reduced container exchanges by 61.1%. GHG as kg CO2 e/1000 FLL were 313.0 and 50.7 for SSC and RSC systems, respectively. A sensitivity analysis showed substantial GHG reductions within unit processes could be achieved, however, their impact on relevant final GWP comparison varied <5% from base comparison. Conclusions Adopting RSC is an example of a sustainable purchasing decision that can assist trusts meet NHS GHG reduction targets and can reduce GWP permanently with minimal staff behavioural change. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

In this study, 17 years of O3 sounding data from the Hong Kong Observatory with a weekly sampling frequency are analyzed to identify stratospheric intrusions and quantify their impact on O3 enhancement events in springtime from 2004 to 2020. 24.7% of O3 enhancement events are related to stratospheric intrusion whereas 31.7% of intrusions lead to the enhancement of O3 in the lower troposphere. Occurrences of stratospheric intrusion in springtime are closely related to tropopause folding and tropospheric convective activities in subtropical regions. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry simulations are conducted with the integrated process analysis to quantify the impact of stratospheric intrusions on the enhancement of O3 in the lower free troposphere as well as near the surface under different synoptic patterns. Synoptic patterns associated with stratospheric intrusion-driving O3 enhancements are classified into two categories: Saddle Point (“S”) and Cold Front (“F”). While downward transport of O3-enriched air from the enhancement layer exerts an important impact on surface O3 for synoptic pattern “S,” the impact on surface O3 is limited for surface pattern “F.” The impact of stratospheric intrusions together with entrainment on surface O3 may have a strong indication on the development of effective emission control strategies on surface O3 reduction in Hong Kong. © 2021.

Mixing ratios (median, 25th–75th percentiles) of CFC-11 (281, 255–318 ppt), CFC-12 (546, 473–591 ppt), CFC-113 (79, 73–85 ppt), CFC-114 (22, 19–25 ppt), HCFC-22 (345, 308–432 ppt), and CCl4 (88, 75–104 ppt) were often observed to be higher than their global tropospheric background levels. The significantly elevated mixing ratios of ozone depleting substances (ODSs) combined with strong correlations with anthropogenic tracers known to have substantial use and emission in this region (HCFC-22 and CH2Cl2) suggest continuing emissions of multiple Montreal Protocol-controlled gases at the time of measurement. We use HYSPLIT trajectory clusters and potential source contribution function methods to identify principal transport pathways of CFCs. We find the highest mixing ratios of ODSs in air originating from Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Shandong. The strong correlations between CFC-11 and CFC-12 with the feedstock CCl4 suggest new production is prevalent in all three regions. We find no evidence for new production of CFC-113, but the strong correlation of CFC-114 with the feedstock C2Cl4 suggests new production of CFC-114 from the southeast of China. The findings of this study confirm high mixing ratios of ODSs over Hebei in Spring 2016 and suggest new production and use (rather than release from banks), which is in conflict with the Montreal Protocol agreement that bans the production of CFCs. © 2021.

For this reason, the capture and reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals powered by renewable energy sources is on the forefront of electrocatalyst and photocatalyst research. The choice of catalyst, support structure, and electrolyte are the main factors that impact the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to value-added chemicals and fuels. Therefore, an understanding of each of these factors must be gained prior to large-scale applications. In this review, we provide an overview on the field of CO2RR electrocatalysis based on nonprecious transition metal based catalysts with a focus on their design, synthesis, characterization, and mechanisms of CO2RR. Special attention is paid to advanced catalysts design incorporating two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbide and nitride materials, and state-of-the-art in situ/operando spectroelectrochemical techniques.

We further quantify the micronutrient evenness of catches to identify countries where interventions can optimize micronutrient supply. Our global analysis, including &gt;800 marine fish species, reveals that, at a species level, micronutrient availability and vulnerability to both climate change and overfishing varies greatly, with tropical species displaying a positive co-tolerance, indicating greater persistence to both stressors at a community level.10 Global fisheries catches had relatively low nutritional vulnerability to fishing. Catches with higher species richness tend to be nutrient dense and evenly distributed but are more vulnerable to climate change, with 40% of countries displaying high vulnerability. Countries with high prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake tend to have the most nutrient-dense catches, but these same fisheries are highly vulnerable to climate change, with relatively lower capacity to adapt.11 Our analysis highlights the need to consolidate fisheries, climate, and food policies to secure the sustainable contribution of fish-derived micronutrients to food and nutrition security. © 2021 The Author(s)","fisheries ecology; food and nutrition security; micronutrients; nutrition; seafood; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112745228

The last few years have seen the worst mass coral bleaching events recorded, with more than one quarter of all reefs irreversibly impacted. Considering the widespread devastation, we need to increase our efforts to understanding the physiological and metabolic shifts underlying the breakdown of this important symbiotic ecosystem. Here, we investigated the proteome (PRIDE accession # PXD011668) of both host and symbionts of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora exposed to ambient (~ 28 °C) and elevated temperature (~ 32 °C for 2 days, following a five-day incremental increase) and explored associated biomolecular changes in the symbiont, with the aim of gaining new insights into the mechanisms underpinning the collapse of the coral symbiosis. We identified 1,230 unique proteins (774 host and 456 symbiont) in the control and thermally stressed corals, of which 107 significantly increased and 125 decreased in abundance under elevated temperature relative to the control. Proteins involved in oxidative stress and proteolysis constituted 29% of the host proteins that increased in abundance, with evidence of impairment to endoplasmic reticulum and cytoskeletal regulation proteins. In the symbiont, we detected a decrease in proteins responsible for photosynthesis and energy production (33% of proteins decreased in abundance), yet minimal signs of oxidative stress or proteolysis. Lipid stores increased > twofold despite reduction in photosynthesis, suggesting reduced translocation of carbon to the host. There were significant changes in proteins related to symbiotic state, including proteins linked to nitrogen metabolism in the host and the V-ATPase (-0.6 fold change) known to control symbiosome acidity. These results highlight key differences in host and symbiont proteomic adjustments under elevated temperature and identify two key proteins directly involved in bilateral nutrient exchange as potential indicators of symbiosis breakdown. © 2021.

SERBP1 (SERPINE1 mRNA Binding Protein 1) is an RBP that comprises two RG/RGG repeat regions yet lacks other recognizable RNA-binding motifs. It is involved in mRNA maturation, and translational regulation. It was initially identified as a hyaluronic acid binding protein, but recent studies have identified central roles for SERBP1 in brain function and development, especially neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. SERBP1 regulates One-carbon metabolism and epigenetic modification of histones, and increased SERBP1 expression in cancers such as leukemia, ovarian, prostate, liver and glioblastoma is correlated with poor patient outcomes. Despite these important regulatory roles for SERBP1, little is known about its structural and dynamic properties, nor about the molecular mechanisms governing its interaction with mRNA. Here, we define SERBP1 as an intrinsically disordered protein, containing highly conserved elements that were shown to be functionally important. The RNA binding activity of SERBP1 was explored using solution NMR and other biophysical techniques. The outcome of these experiments revealed that SERBP1 preferentially samples compact conformations including a central, stable α-helix and show that SERBP1 recognizes G-rich RNA sequences at the C-terminus involving the RGG box and neighboring residues. Despite the role in RNA recognition, the RGG boxes do not seem to stabilize the central helix and the central helix does not participate in RNA binding.

Herein, we have prepared Ag2BiI5silver bismuth iodide QDs via a simple ligand-assisted reprecipitation method, and the samples were passivated with the oleylamine-sulfide complex. The absorption and emission profiles were red-shifted, which implies that the overall size of the QDs has increased after the passivation. An increase in the emission intensity confirmed the reduction of non-radiative recombination and an increase in excited-state carrier lifetime, as observed from the time-correlated single-photon counting-lifetime measurements. Further, the photocurrent devices were fabricated and generated high-magnitude photocurrent values in the ranges of ∼1.1 to 1.8 μA (bare Ag2BiI5) and ∼0.27 to 0.54 μA (oleylamine-sulfide-passivated Ag2BiI5) for the biasing voltages of 0.1 and 0.2 V, respectively. Surprisingly, the oleylamine-sulfide-passivated Ag2BiI5sample exhibited a sharp rise in the photocurrent value with a high on/off ratio.

However, air pollution has been polluted everywhere, whether in the house, in cities. This is caused by a growing industry that produces air pollution. Room air pollution and various cities will contribute to air pollution, which will cause problems for human health. This work measures the carbon monoxide level using the MQ-7 sensor and measures the air's carbon dioxide level with the CCS811 sensor and MH-Z19 sensor. All three sensors are connected to the NodeMCU ESPS266, and we call it a NodeMCU module. Tests are carried out in three rooms in the house, and then three NodeMCU modules are used so that the three modules will send data alternately. Raspberry Pi3 (RPi3) functions as a server that collects data and acquires information data from sensors. Data from the CCS811 (TCOV) sensor, MH-Z19 (co2), will be processed first with fuzzy logic rules to make decisions about CO2, which are right, moderate, nasty conditions. The process is carried out on the Raspberry Pi 3 server with MQTT using publication, customer, fuzzy logic, and broker services.

Central to the functionality of MAPM is an inverse model. The input of the inverse model includes a spatially distributed prior emissions estimate and PM measurement time series from instruments distributed across the desired domain. In this proof-of-concept study, we describe the construction of this inverse model, the mathematics underlying the retrieval of the resultant posterior PM emissions maps, the way in which uncertainties are traced through the MAPM processing chain, and plans for future developments. To demonstrate the capability of the inverse model developed for MAPM, we use the PM2.5 measurements obtained during a dedicated winter field campaign in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 to infer PM2.5 emissions maps on a city scale. The results indicate a systematic overestimation in the prior emissions for Christchurch of at least 40ĝ€¯%-60ĝ€¯%, which is consistent with some of the underlying assumptions used in the composition of the bottom-up emissions map used as the prior, highlighting the uncertainties in bottom-up approaches for estimating PM2.5 emissions maps. © Copyright:",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); particulate matter; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis; Canterbury [South Island]; Christchurch [Canterbury]; New Zealand; South Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116051969

Here we reveal distinct microbiome structures and functions, amidst comparable pore fluid chemistries, along 300ĝ€¯cm sediment horizons underlying the seasonal (shallow coastal; water depth: 31ĝ€¯m) and perennial (deep sea; water depths: 530 and 580ĝ€¯m) oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the Arabian Sea, situated across the western Indian margin. The sedimentary geomicrobiology was elucidated by analyzing metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, enrichment cultures, and depositional rates measured via radiocarbon and lead excess dating; the findings were then evaluated in light of the other geochemical data available for the cores. Along the perennial-OMZ sediment cores, microbial communities were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, but in the seasonal-OMZ core communities were dominated by Euryarchaeota and Firmicutes. As a perennial-OMZ signature, a cryptic methane production-consumption cycle was found to operate near the sediment surface, within the sulfate reduction zone; overall diversity, as well as the relative abundances of anaerobes requiring simple fatty acids (methanogens, anaerobic methane oxidizers, sulfate reducers, and acetogens), peaked in the topmost sediment layer and then declined via synchronized fluctuations until the sulfate-methane transition zone was reached. The microbiome profile was completely reversed in the seasonal-OMZ sediment horizon. In the perennial-OMZ sediments, deposited organic carbon was higher in concentration and rich in marine components that degrade readily to simple fatty acids; simultaneously, lower sedimentation rate afforded higher O2 exposure time for organic matter degradation despite perennial hypoxia in the bottom water. The resultant abundance of reduced carbon substrates eventually sustained multiple inter-competing microbial processes in the upper sediment layers. The entire geomicrobial scenario was opposite in the sediments of the seasonal OMZ. These findings create a microbiological baseline for understanding carbon-sulfur cycling in distinct depositional settings and water column oxygenation regimes across the continental margins. © Copyright:",,"biogeochemistry; continental margin; depositional environment; geomicrobiology; microorganism; organic matter; remineralization; sedimentation rate; Alphaproteobacteria; Euryarchaeota; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115997418

On the other side, the presence of multiple energy sources significantly increases the powertrain complexity and requires the development of a suitable Energy Management System (EMS) whose performance can strongly affect the fuel economy potential of the vehicle. In such a framework, this article proposes a novel methodology to reverse engineer the control strategy of a test case P2 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) through the analysis of experimental data acquired in a wide range of driving conditions. In particular, a combination of data obtained from On-Board Diagnostic system (OBD), Controller Area Network (CAN)-bus protocol, and additional sensors installed on the High Voltage (HV) electric net of the vehicle is used to point out any dependency of the EMS decisions on the powertrain main operating variables. Furthermore, the impact that Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) connections have on the control law is assessed on several tests performing the same real-world route with the vehicle navigation system alternatively switched on and off. Finally, a virtual test rig of the tested vehicle, developed in the GT- SUITE environment, is used to validate the set of extracted rules against the experimental data. An error of about 1-2% on the prediction of the vehicle CO2 emissions and good matching of the State of Charge (SoC) profile in both Charge Depleting (CD) and Charge Sustaining (CS) phases prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © SAE 2021 International Journal of Electrified Vehicles.

We find that for rapidly rotating planets, the transit atmospheric thickness of the evening terminator (east of the substellar region) is significantly larger than that of the morning terminator (west of the substellar region). The asymmetry is mainly related to the spatial heterogeneity in ice clouds, as the contributions of liquid clouds and water vapor are smaller. The underlying mechanism is that there are always more ice clouds on the evening terminator, due to the combined effect of coupled Rossby–Kelvin waves and equatorial superrotation that advect vapor and clouds to the east, especially at high levels of the atmosphere. For slowly rotating planets, the asymmetry reverses (the morning terminator has a larger transmission depth than the evening terminator), but the magnitude is small or even negligible. For both rapidly and slowly rotating planets, there is strong variability in the transmission spectra. The asymmetry signal is nearly impossible to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), because the magnitude of the asymmetry (about 10 ppm) is smaller than the instrumental noise and the high variability further increases the challenge. © Copyright © 2021 Song and Yang.","asymmetry; exoplanet atmospheres; superrotation; tidally locked planets; transit spectroscopy; varability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117598109

The Fuel Economy (FE) improvement for heavy commercial vehicles is mandated through enforcement of Heavy-Duty Fuel Economy Norms (HDFE-I by April 2021, HDFE-II by April 2023) as part of BS-VI regulation in India. This is navigating the commercial vehicle industry to explore various technology options to improve FE. Commercial vehicle applications such as City Buses and Mining Tippers have long engine idle durations either due to traffic conditions or loading-unloading pattern. This makes engine idle control and specifically Stop-Start Technology a more viable and attractive option for FE improvement. The current paper provides an overall approach and details related to Stop-Start technology integration at engine and vehicle level. A real-world city bus duty cycles representing Urban City Traffic have been analyzed in detail for number of stop-start events, idle durations and potential fuel economy improvements.

With their higher thermal efficiencies through technical advancements, diesel engines are preferred powertrains in mass transportation of goods as well as people [14] [15]. A diesel engine always banks on excess air, which is subjected to higher compression ratios so as to achieve temperatures, enough to facilitate auto-ignition of diesel. With the advent of turbocharging and intercooling, the air availability is further enhanced, ensuring better combustion efficiency, lesser HC, CO and particulate matter (PM) emissions together with improved fuel efficiencies [2] [15]. Higher air availability also has its own shortcomings in the form of higher NOx (Nitrogen oxides) emissions. With stringent emission norms in place, reduction of NOx as well as PM, without sacrificing performance and fuel economy, is of utmost importance. A Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) essentially traps particulate emissions and hence reduces their outflow into the surrounding atmosphere. With the usage of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), particulate emissions are higher. Regeneration of DPF is a process where the accumulated particulates are burned at high temperatures, actively or passively [14]. This accumulation will otherwise lead to significantly higher back- pressures and DPF choking which will impede engine performance. However, frequent regeneration also contributes to higher dilution of engine oil, leading to shorter oil change intervals and under extreme circumstances, an engine failure due to improper lubrication. This emphasizes the need to estimate the amount of soot in the DPF. Two methods to estimate soot are explored. One of the methods uses important flow parameters (temperature & mass/volume flow) to estimate particulate emissions from the engine. Further, corrections based on temperature, NO2/ NOx ratio and mass/volume flow are used to estimate the amount of soot getting oxidized passively [12]. The second method monitors the differential pressure across the DPF to determine the amount of loading. A 4 cylinder, turbocharged, intercooled, direct injection (DI) diesel engine for LMDCV, certified for BS-VI emission norms is made use of to achieve the same. The soot model arrived is capable of predicting the accumulated soot in the DPF to ± 15% over different duty cycles (City, Extra Urban and Highway). © 2021 SAE International.

Ltd., India","Climate change is a global phenomenon now and countries across the globe are working towards reducing emissions by bringing in stricter legislations on emissions and CO2. India is also facing huge challenges on pollutions in large cities. Reports suggest that 7 of the 10 most polluted cities of the world lie in India. The growing public opinion towards cleaner air and reduced greenhouse gaseous emissions has sensitized the matter and has led to drafting of strict emission legislations in India during the past few years. The leap frogging from BS 4 to BS 6 in 2020 by skipping BS 5 norms showed the intent of the GOI towards emission reduction. The BS 6 legislation is not limiting to meeting norms with legislative emission cycle but will also focus from year 2023 onto real driving emissions on actual roads. GOI is also proposing to implement fleet CO2 emission norms (CAFÉ) by 2022 to regulate the CO2 emissions. With these stricter norms coming into place in India, the automotive industry has started to focus on hybridization and electrification of its fleet as a solution. SCV are major back bone of commutation in Indian cities, providing the last mile connectivity of people and goods. The market share of SCV's is approximately 50% of the total commercial vehicle sales in India and operate inside all big and small Indian cities. Predominantly this segment is powered by Diesel engines. Migration towards Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) for this market segment will bring a big change in the vehicular pollution levels in these cities. Electrification potential of this segment is driven by parameters like total cost of ownership, charging infrastructure and driving range [1]. Regarding the vehicle cost reduction, the GOI is working on bringing newer legislations like FAME to subsidies BEV's. GOI and the automotive industry is also collaborating towards improving the battery charging infrastructures as well. Other challenge on the driving range of BEV's still remains a major challenge for the automotive industry. BEV with Range Extenders as a solution towards an increased total operational driving range and lower operational cost is the main focus of this study. REEV architecture eliminates the use of large battery pack used in BEV needed to achieve higher driving range. The study uses the most selling SCV from the Indian market as donor vehicle. Typical driving range of SCV's has been studied in Pune city for various applications like transportation of goods & passenger the city and transportation of goods between two nearby cities. For such an application where driving range various on a day to day basis for a user, REEV architecture is more efficient due to use of smaller battery pack leading to lower vehicle weight and reduced cost. A small Gasoline engine operating as a range extender was used in the proposed REEV architecture because of its higher efficiencies compare to the conventional Gasoline engines. Additionally use of Gasoline engine also avoids sophisticated exhaust after-treatment system like DPF, LNT/SCR for emission control on Diesel engine needed for meeting BS 6 legislation, thus reducing the overall vehicle cost. The study evaluates BEV & REEV layout using cyclic vehicle simulations on FEV developed Matlab/Simulink based toolchain targeting the right sizing of the E-machine and battery pack, there by evaluating the energy efficiency of the REEV layout. © 2021 SAE International.

The pollutants emitted from a diesel engine are carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (HCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). These pollutants can be controlled using after treatment systems which comprise of a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit. With increasing vehicle density and lower speed driving scenarios, there is a need to improve the rate of oxidation and reduction in after treatment systems at lower exhaust gas temperatures for effectively decreasing pollutant emissions. There is a need to lower the light off temperature (LOT or T50, the temperature at which 50% conversion is achieved) for unburnt hydrocarbons (HCs) to improve quality of exhaust air during cold start conditions. In this work, the LOT for representative HCs were lowered using various techniques, such as decreasing basicity of the catalyst support, adding promoters of d block elements, and modifying the pore size distribution of the washcoat. The LOT were evaluated for the developed washcoat (Catalyst B) compared to a conventional benchmark washcoat (Catalyst A) using a Synthetic Gas Test Bench (SGTB) procedure at a space velocity of 60000 h-1. The LOT for THC and CO were lowered by 23°C and 40°C as fresh and 12°C and 9°C as aged, respectively, for a catalyst having the same Platinum Group Metal (PGM) loading and substrate volume. The performance of the developed catalyst was also evaluated on an engine test bench over Non-Road Steady State (NRSC) and Non Road Transient Cycle (NRTC) tests, and compared with the benchmark catalyst. Significant improvements in HCs and PM emission reduction of 45% and 27% in NRSC and 17% and 27% in NRTC tests were achieved. These improvements were achieved by lowering the LOT for HCs and decreasing the opacity with developed catalyst formulation. The diesel fuel oxidation performance of developed washcoat Catalyst B and benchmark washcoat Catalyst A were evaluated on the engine test bench under steady state conditions. Diesel fuel was dosed upstream of the DOC to raise the pre-DPF exhaust gas temperature to actively regenerate the DPF by PM oxidation. The catalysts were evaluated as aged. At a DOC inlet temperature of 220°C, Catalyst B raised the pre-DPF temperature up to 620°C, whereas Catalyst A only raised the temperature to 553°C. A similar trend was observed for DOC inlet temperatures of 250°C and 300°C. © 2021 SAE International.

This can be achieved by maximizing the share of renewable energy in India's overall energy mix, currently is dominated by fossil fuels. After industry and transportation sector comprising of air, water and surface modes is the second largest contributor of GHG emissions. Ever since the evolution of mobility, the transportation landscape continues to be occupied mostly by internal combustion engines (ICE) that employs fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are majorly import dependent and cause of huge foreign exchange outflow. Therefore, the need of the hour is to leverage captive alternative energy sources that can help mitigate risk of climate change besides positively impacting economy and society. Biofuel - a renewable transportation fuel, both in gaseous & liquid form, is a very promising, alternate clean energy source. Biofuels are environment friendly and help improve the rural economy. Besides facilitating energy self-reliance, biofuels utilize existing infrastructure and ecosystem of ICE automotive industry. Praj Bio-MobilityTM platform envisions the use of bio-based renewable feedstock for the production of low-carbon transportation fuels for all modes of transportation. This unique platform also works in tandem with e-mobility solutions. Bio-MobilityTM platform comprises of established solutions such as 1st generation bio-ethanol, Biodiesel and fast emerging advanced biofuel solution such as 2nd generation bio-ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), compressed bio-gas (CBG), Bio-hydrogen, marine bio-fuels, etc. This paper deals with the adoption of Bio-MobilityTM platform for transportation as they can create winners in the social, economic and environmental areas.

The most cutting-edge technological developments made in CRS and EGT system enables OEMs to achieve further more stringent emission norms and adopt the environmental protection compliances. Today's CRS systems are the most advanced generation fuel injection systems providing further high injection pressures, wide multiple injections capability with shorter dwell periods enabling real smoother Digital Rate Shaping (DRS) and injection control that benefits not only the engine combustion performance but also enables smarter thermal management of modern exhaust systems while meeting stringent emission compliances and achieving future CO2 reductions goal. Initial DRS developments were tried with a dwell period up to 800us-500us with limitations over injector durability. Later with the advances in FIE technology the dwell periods could further be reduced to 500us-200us. The recent technologies developed are capable of reducing dwell period -100us or further lower within the boundary conditions of system application limits. In this paper, an experimental study on the application of multiple injections coupled with an intelligent adoption of such DRS features are studied on 2 Cylinder Common Rail BSVI engine in order to improve engine part load BSFC performance and on road FE in vehicle city driving conditions.

For instance, in Europe a drop in fleet consumption of 15% and 30% is set as target by the regulation by 2025 and 2030. The use of carbon-neutral fuels offers possibilities regarding net-zero CO2 emissions - although not yet considered by the rules. Another challenging aspect is the drastic tightening of NOx emissions limits for future legislations, which is approved or being discussed both for the United States and for the EU. The current work describes the potentials of an innovative fuel, marketed as Gane fuel regarding performance, efficiency and emission behavior. First, the properties of the developed fuel are described: Gane is made from methanol blended with water and is tailored for diffusive combustion. The fuel blending is so defined to fulfill the combustion requirements. With DME the ignition can be initiated and adding water can reduce the combustion temperature to minimize the NOx. The innovative fuel system fumigates the DME into the inlet air and is combined with HPDI injection of the Methanol-Water blend. As baseline for the experimental investigations, a conventional in-line 6-cylinder HD diesel engine was selected and the fuel system modified. During the extensive engine testing, the complete engine map was calibrated for the Gane fuel without significant drawbacks regarding power density compared to the diesel baseline. The experimental results show that using Gane fuel leads to comparable high brake thermal efficiencies as in case of diesel fuel - even though the engine-out NOx emission level was reduced to under ca. 2 g/kWh compared to the diesel baseline with ca. 7 to 10 g/kWh. In addition, very low soot emissions occur, which makes the tested fuel possibly compliant to EURO VI without DPF. In order to assess the ignition process of the Gane fuel, the intake temperatures and also the mass flow rate of the port-injected DME were varied and the combustion processes compared. As expected, the lower the intake temperatures or the DME mass flow, the higher is the ignition delay. In order to estimate the effect on the ignition process in a predictive way, a simulation model based on in-cylinder kinetic reaction mechanisms was developed and validated.

A major pillar of the initiative is the generation of detailed experimental data and modeling capabilities to understand and predict cold-start behavior. Cold-start, as defined by the time between first engine crank and three-way catalyst light-off, is responsible for a large percentage of NOx, unburned hydrocarbon and particulate matter emissions in light-duty engines. Minimizing emissions during cold-start is a trade-off between achieving faster light-off of the three-way catalyst and engine out emissions during that period. In this study, gaseous and soot emissions were measured at a distance representative of the three-way catalyst position downstream of the engine at a 2 bar net indicated mean effective pressure (NIMEP) steady-state operating condition representative of cold-start. The test matrix included sweeps of ignition timing 15 degrees-before to 10 degrees-after top dead center firing (TDCf) across three different spark-plug heat dispersal ranges (HR). Additionally, the effect of varying exhaust valve opening (EVO) timing on combustion stability and emissions was also studied. Results show that the spark plug HR affects the coefficient of variation (COV) of NIMEP under all cold-start conditions, while the impact on emissions was found to be minimal. At very retarded spark timings, colder spark plugs required higher air and fuel flow to maintain the desired 2bar NIMEP load, but the fraction of fuel energy going into the exhaust was found to be similar for all spark plugs. Retarding exhaust valve timings showed a simultaneous reduction in emissions while increasing the fraction of fuel energy being fed into the exhaust. However, engine COV was also observed to increase with retarded exhaust timings. © 2021 UT-Battelle, LLC.",,"Catalysts; Combustion; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Fuels; Coefficients of variations; Cold-start; Combustion engines; Exhaust valves; Fuel energy; Indicated mean effective pressure; Light duty engines; Light off; Three way catalysts; Valve opening; Timing circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116926941

Hydrotreating of bio-oils is a sustainable way to produce premium quality diesel fuels from completely renewable feedstocks. The Finnish forestry company UPM has developed an innovative production process based on hydrotreatment to convert crude tall oil (CTO) into a high-quality renewable diesel fuel that can be used as a blending component or as 100% fuel in all diesel engines without modifications. Paraffinic, high cetane CTO renewable diesel allows efficient and clean combustion, reducing harmful air emissions in addition to not releasing any new CO2 into the atmosphere during their combustion. This study investigated the effect of CTO renewable diesel (BVO) on engine performance and exhaust emissions. Conventional market diesel served as a reference fuel. The research engine was a common-rail off-road diesel engine, operated by using the load points of the non-road steady state cycle C1 of the ISO8178 standard. The use of BVO reduced all regulated gaseous emissions (NOx -10%, CO -7%, HC -7%). A significant 26% reduction was obtained in cycle-weighted particulate number. In addition to low emissions, fuels are required to remain stable and of high quality even after long-term storage. Another target of the present study was to clarify the influence of long-term storage on CTO renewable diesel properties. In this context, the paper reports the comprehensive results of fuel analyses in a fresh state and after four years of storage, the focus being on parameters that may be affected by the formation of oxidation products.

Their emission control systems need to be enhanced to sustain the high conversion efficiencies seen during motorway conditions inother operating conditions. The European Commission is developing legislative proposals for Euro 7 emissions regulations for light- and heavy-duty vehicles. The new Euro 7regulation will likely focus on ensuring the emissions from heavy-duty vehicles are minimized over extensive on-road operating conditions and specifically on operating conditions such as urban driving and cold-start operation. These challenges are increased by the need to ensure low secondary emissions like NH3 and N2O, as well as a low impact on CO2 emissions. The paper outlines the low pollutant emissions achieved by a heavy-duty Diesel demonstrator vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with an innovative layout of state-of-the-art emission control technologies, combined with an advanced controlstrategy on an existing Euro VI long-haul truck. The new emissions control system integrates a close-coupled DOC, a catalyzed DPF, dual-SCR system -one in a close-coupled position-, with twin AdBlue® dosing controlled withFEV developed software. Both SCR catalysts contain an ammonia slip catalyst. The innovative system layout allows ultra-low NOx emissions and well controlled secondary emissions in even the most challenging conditions with minimal impact on CO2 emissions.

The development of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) type fuels has been strong in the Nordic countries, partly due to the early use of tall oil from the forest industry as feedstock. An innovative production process to convert crude tall oil (CTO) - a residue of pulp production - into high-quality renewable diesel fuel was developed by a Finnish forestry company UPM. Paraffinic, high cetane and low aromatic CTO renewable diesel allows efficient and clean combustion, resulting in reductions of local air pollution in addition to not releasing any new CO2 into the atmosphere during their combustion. This research investigated the influence of CTO renewable diesel on the performance and exhaust emissions of a non-road diesel engine. The examined fuels were neat CTO renewable diesel (BVN) and a blend of BVN and fossil diesel fuel oil (DFO) (50/50% v/v). Neat DFO served as the reference fuel. During a thorough test bench campaign, the engine was driven with the loads of the ISO 8178-4 C1 test cycle. The test engine had no exhaust after-treatment system, and no engine modifications or parameter optimizations were made during the tests. CTO renewable diesel proved to be beneficial in terms of CO, HC and particle number (PN) emissions. With neat BVN, a reduction of 9 % for CO, 10 % for HC, and 10% for PN compared with DFO were observed. The beneficial trends were most evident at low loads. Renewable fuel also slightly reduced brake specific NOx emissions. CTO renewable diesel proved to be a high-quality, sustainable alternative to fossil diesel and fully compatible with existing non-road diesel engines. © 2021 SAE International.

CO2 dilution by mass was introduced at 0%, 15%, and 30% levels with the O2:N2 mole ratio fixed at 1:3.76. This dilution strategy is used to represent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) substitution in spark ignition (SI) engines by using CO2 as a surrogate for major EGR constituents(N2, CO2, H2O). Experiments were conducted over the temperature range of 650K-900K and at 10 bar and 20 bar compressed pressure conditions for equivalence ratios of (φ =) 0.6-1.3. The full blend fuels were admitted directly into the combustion chamber for mixture preparation using the direct test chamber (DTC) approach. CO2 addition retarded the autoignition times for the fuels studied here. The retarding effect of the CO2 dilution was more pronounced in the NTC region when compared to the lower and higher temperature range. The effect of dilution was more pronounced for the higher RON fuel in comparison to the lower RON fuel. With CO2 dilution, ignition delay times of the low RON fuel matched the undiluted high RON fuel delay times showcasing octane relaxation potential. The ignition delay times of the gasoline fuels were compared with that of iso-octane, a major component in gasoline surrogates, at both diluted and undiluted conditions. The CO2 dilution did not affect the ignition delay curve of the fuels or iso-octane but rather shifted it horizontally, hence no significant chemical reactivity due to CO2 dilution was observed in this study. © 2021 SAE International; FCA US LLC.",,"Blending; Carbon dioxide; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gasoline; Ignition; Polyols; Auto-ignition delay time; CO2 dilution; Equivalence ratios; Gasoline fuels; Ignition delay time; Mole ratio; Pressure conditions; Rapid compression machine; Spark-ignition engine; Temperature range; Dilution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116872858

Moreover, these processes can often be driven by renewable energy under ambient conditions as a sustainable alternative to traditional high-temperature and high-pressure synthesis methods. In addition to the extensive studies on catalyst development, increasing attention has been paid to the regulation of gas transport/diffusion behaviors during gas-involving (photo)electrocatalytic reactions towards the goal of creating industrially viable catalytic systems with high reaction rates, excellent long-term stabilities and near-unity selectivities. Biomimetic surfaces and systems with special wetting capabilities and structural advantages can shed light on the future design of (photo)electrodes and address long-standing challenges. This article is dedicated to bridging the fields of wetting and catalysis by reviewing the cutting-edge design methodologies of both gas-evolving and gas-consuming (photo)electrocatalytic systems. We first introduce the fundamentals of various in-air/underwater wetting states and their corresponding bioinspired structural properties. The relationship amongst the bubble transport behavior, wettability, and porosity/tortuosity is also discussed. Next, the latest implementations of wetting-related design principles for gas-evolving reactions (i.e. the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction) and gas-consuming reactions (i.e. the oxygen reduction reaction and CO2 reduction reaction) are summarized. For photoelectrode designs, additional factors are taken into account, such as light absorption and the separation, transport and recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. The influences of wettability and 3D structuring of (photo)electrodes on the catalytic activity, stability and selectivity are analyzed to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Finally, remaining questions and related future perspectives are outlined. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Light absorption; Oxygen; Reaction rates; Surface reactions; Wetting; Ambient conditions; Electrolysis of waters; Energy carriers; High temperatures and high pressures; Industrial energy; Industrial feedstock; Photo electrolysis; Photo-electrocatalysis; Photoelectrode; Renewable energies; Gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115876936

A data assimilation scheme has been recently presented to assimilate daily observations of temperature and precipitation into downscaled reconstructions from a global extended reanalysis through an Ensemble Kalman fitting approach and to derive high-resolution fields. Recent studies also showed that assimilating observations at high temporal resolution does not guarantee correct multidecadal variations. The current paper thus proposes (1) to apply the data assimilation scheme over France and over the 1871-2012 period based on the SCOPE Climate reconstructions background dataset and all available daily historical surface observations of temperature and precipitation, (2) to develop an assimilation scheme at the yearly timescale and to apply it over the same period and lastly, (3) to derive the FYRE Climate reanalysis, a 25-member ensemble hybrid dataset resulting from the daily and yearly assimilation schemes, spanning the whole 1871-2012 period at a daily and 8ĝ€¯km resolution over France. Assimilating daily observations only allows reconstructing accurately daily characteristics, but fails in reproducing robust multidecadal variations when compared to independent datasets. Combining the daily and yearly assimilation schemes, FYRE Climate clearly performs better than the SCOPE Climate background in terms of bias, error, and correlation, but also better than the Safran reference surface reanalysis over France available from 1958 onward only.

Atmospheric concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 were mostly reduced when compared to observations taken for the same time period in previous years; however, concentration reductions may not only be caused by emission reductions but also by specific weather situations. In order to identify the role of emission reductions and the meteorological situation for air quality improvements in central Europe, the meteorology chemistry transport model system COSMO-CLM/CMAQ was applied to Europe for the period 1 January to 30 June 2020. Emission data for 2020 were extrapolated from most recent reported emission data, and lockdown adjustment factors were computed from reported activity data changes, e.g. Google mobility reports. Meteorological factors were investigated through additional simulations with meteorological data from previous years. The results showed that lockdown effects varied significantly among countries and were most prominent for NO2 concentrations in urban areas with 2-week-average reductions up to 55ĝ€¯% in the second half of March. Ozone concentrations were less strongly influenced (up to ±15ĝ€¯%) and showed both increasing and decreasing concentrations due to lockdown measures. This depended strongly on the meteorological situation and on the NOxĝ€¯/ĝ€¯VOC emission ratio. PM2.5 revealed 2ĝ€¯%-12ĝ€¯% reductions of 2-week-average concentrations in March and April, which is much less than a different weather situation could cause. Unusually low PM2.5 concentrations as observed in northern central Europe were only marginally caused by lockdown effects. The lockdown can be seen as a big experiment about air quality improvements that can be achieved through drastic traffic emission reductions. From this investigation, it can be concluded that NO2 concentrations can be largely reduced, but effects on annual average values are small when the measures last only a few weeks. Secondary pollutants like ozone and PM2.5 depend more strongly on weather conditions and show a limited response to emission changes in single sectors. © Copyright:",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; emission control; meteorology; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; Central Europe; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115659834

Here, we estimated the ozone formation potential (OFP) and SOA formation potential (SOAP) of anthropogenic and biogenic VOC emissions to evaluate (1) anthropogenic VOCs and associated sectors that dominate OFP and SOAP and (2) the potential impacts of enhanced biogenic VOCs from urban greening programs on air quality in Los Angeles county. In the present-day scenario, ethylene had the largest OFP followed bym&p-xylene, toluene, propylene, and formaldehyde. The top five contributors to SOAP were toluene, mineral spirits, benzene, heptadecane, and hexadecane. Mobile and solvent sources were the dominant VOC sources for both OFP and SOAP. The potential increases in biogenic VOC emissions due to future urban greening had significant effects on urban air quality that offset the benefits of reducing anthropogenic VOC emissions. This study demonstrates that urban greening programs in Los Angeles county, and likely other cities as well, need to account for both anthropogenic and biogenic VOC contributions to secondary pollution, and greening cities should consider using vegetation types with low VOC emissions to avoid further degradation to urban air quality. © 2021 The Authors.

To assess the public health implications of adopting the PM2.5standards proposed by the panel, the health benefits are quantified from their implementation based on both current (observed) and future (simulated) air quality data for California.

Here, we systematically investigate a family of dilute Cu-based alloys to explore their viability as active and selective catalysts for eCO2R through a combined theoretical-experimental approach. Using a quantum-classical modeling approach that accounts for dynamic solvation effects, we assess the stability and activity of model single-atom catalysts under eCO2R conditions. Our calculations identify that the presence of eCO2R intermediates, such as CO*, H*, and OH*, may dynamically influence the local catalyst surface composition. Additionally, we identify through binding energy descriptors of the CO*, CHO*, and OCCO* dimer intermediates that certain elements, such as group 13 elements (B, Al, and Ga), enhance the selectivity of C2+ species relative to pure Cu by facilitating CO dimerization. The theoretical work is corroborated by preliminary testing of eCO2R activity and selectivity of candidate dilute Cu-based alloy catalyst films prepared by electron beam evaporation in a zero-gap gas diffusion electrode-based reactor. Of all studied alloys, dilute CuAl was found to be the most active and selective toward C2+ products like ethylene, consistent with the theoretical predictions. We attribute the improved performance of dilute CuAl alloys to more favorable dimerization reaction energetics of bound CO species relative to that on pure Cu. In a broader context, the results presented here demonstrate the power of our simulation framework in terms of rational catalyst design. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Binary alloys; Binding energy; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Copper alloys; Diffusion in gases; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Active catalyst; Carbon mitigation; CO 2 reduction; Cu based alloy; Cu-based catalyst; Electrochemical reductions; Electrochemicals; Experimental approaches; Selective catalysts; Value-added chemicals; Ethylene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115293549

CNTs bind rapidly with proteins, which result in the formation of a protein coating layer known as a “protein corona” around the surface of the nanomaterial. This hinders their applications as a drug carrier and influences the properties of biological macromolecules. The present work focuses on studying the thermal stability and molecular level interactions of two heme proteins, hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb), in the presence of carboxylated functionalized multi-walled CNTs (CA-MWCNTs). Through the current study, the following steps have been taken to distinguish the biocompatibility of the hydrophilic surface CA-MWCNTs for heme proteinsviaa series of spectroscopic techniques and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). UV-Visible and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy were used to reveal changes in the aromatic amino acid residues of heme proteins upon the addition of CA-MWCNTs. Circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) shows the alteration in the native structure of proteins in the presence of the nanomaterial. A tremendous increase in the size of the protein CA-MWCNTs system is observed in dynamic light scattering (DLS), which clearly manifests the protein corona formation. Unexpectedly, both proteins interact differently with CA-MWCNTs, which is observed in CD spectroscopy and DSC. In the presence of CA-MWCNTs, an increase in the transition temperature (Tm) was observed for Hb, while theTmvalue decreases for Mb. Different interactions with proteins at the molecular scale may be the reason for this unexpected behavior. Henceforth, the present results can help in the design of the next-generation drug carrier nanomaterials with the idea of the heme protein corona formation prior to development. © the Owner Societies 2021.",,"Biocompatibility; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Dichroism; Differential scanning calorimetry; Drug delivery; Dynamic light scattering; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Hemoglobin; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanotubes; Porphyrins; Aromatic amino acid; Biological macromolecule; Carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes; Drug delivery system; Hydrophilic surfaces; Molecular level interactions; Spectroscopic technique; Steady state fluorescences; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115122908

The fundamental understanding of such sensitivity can guide the development of advanced electrocatalysts, although it remains challenging at the atomic level. Here we demonstrated that planar defects, such as stacking faults, could drive the electrocatalysis of CO2-to-C2H4conversion with higher selectivity and productivity than Cu(100) facets in the intermediate potential region (−0.50 ∼ −0.65 Vvs.RHE). The unique right bipyramidal Cu nanocrystals containing a combination of (100) facets and a set of parallel planar defects delivered 67% faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H4and a partial current density of 217 mA cm−2at −0.63 Vvs.RHE.

The abundant and fast-dissolving mineral olivine has received the most attention for this application. However, olivine contains nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr), which may pose a risk to marine biota during a gigaton-scale ESW application. Herein we derive a first guideline for coastal olivine dispersal based on existing marine environmental quality standards (EQS) for Ni and Cr. Results show that benthic biota are at the highest risk when olivine and its associated trace metals are mixed in the surface sediment. Specifically, depending on local sedimentary Ni concentrations, 0.059-1.4 kg of olivine m-2of seabed could be supplied without posing risks for benthic biota. Accordingly, globally coastal ESW could safely sequester only 0.51-37 Gt of CO2in the 21st century. On the basis of current EQS, we conclude that adverse environmental impacts from Ni and Cr release could reduce the applicability of olivine in coastal ESW. Our findings call for more in-depth studies on the potential toxicity of olivine toward benthic marine biota, especially in regard to bioavailability and metal mixture toxicity. © 2021 The Authors.

As a major power producer and carbon emitter, Pennsylvania plans to join RGGI in 2022, which will affect both the carbon market (i.e., RGGI) and the regional electricity market (i.e., PJM). Combining a PJM power system model with a reduced-form model of CO2emissions abatement from RGGI states that are not in PJM, we find the annual average emissions from power plants in Pennsylvania can be reduced by 40%, 79%, 68%, and 76% for CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM2.5, respectively, during 2022-2030. Then, based on a range of source-specific marginal damage estimates, we find the cumulative monetized health cobenefits to be 17.7 to 40.8 billion USD. However, the reduced emissions and health damages in Pennsylvania are slightly offset by increases in the other states in PJM that do not participate in RGGI. Our study hence highlights the potential cross-state leakage issue that warrants careful consideration in the policy design and implementation process. © 2021 The Authors.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Boston, MA  02115, United States","ConspectusThe ability to perform multiplexed detection of various biomarkers within complex biological fluids in a robust, rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective manner could transform clinical diagnostics and enable personalized healthcare. Electrochemical (EC) sensor technology has been explored as a way to address this challenge because it does not require optical instrumentation and it is readily compatible with both integrated circuit and microfluidic technologies; yet this approach has had little impact as a viable commercial bioanalytical tool to date. The most critical limitation hindering their clinical application is the fact that EC sensors undergo rapid biofouling when exposed to complex biological samples (e.g., blood, plasma, saliva, urine), leading to the loss of sensitivity and selectivity. Thus, to break through this barrier, we must solve this biofouling problem.In response to this challenge, our group has developed a rapid, robust, and low-cost nanocomposite-based antifouling coating for multiplexed EC sensors that enables unprecedented performance in terms of biomarker signal detection compared to reported literature. The bioinspired antifouling coating that we developed is a nanoporous composite that contains various conductive nanomaterials, including gold nanowires (AuNWs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or reduced graphene oxide nanoflakes (rGOx). Each study has progressively evolved this technology to provide increasing performance while simplifying process flow, reducing time, and decreasing cost. For example, after successfully developing a semipermeable nanocomposite coating containing AuNWs cross-linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using glutaraldehyde, we replaced the nanomaterials with reduced graphene oxide, reducing the cost by 100-fold while maintaining similar signal transduction and antifouling properties. We, subsequently, developed a localized heat-induced coating method that significantly improved the efficiency of the drop-casting coating process and occurs within the unprecedented time of <1 min (at least 3 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art). Moreover, the resulting coated electrodes can be stored at room temperature for at least 5 months and still maintain full sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, this improved coating showed excellent antifouling activity against various biological fluids, including plasma, serum, whole blood, urine, and saliva.To enable affinity-based sensing of multiple biomarkers simultaneously, we have developed multiplexed EC sensors coated with the improved nanocomposite coating and then employed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format for signal detection in which the substrate for the enzyme bound to the secondary antibody precipitates locally at the molecular binding site above the electrode surface. Using this improved EC sensor platform, we demonstrated ultrasensitive detection of a wide range of biomarkers from biological fluids, including clinical biomarkers, in both single and multiplex formats (N = 4) with assay times of 37 and 15 min when integrated with a microfluidic system. These biosensors developed demonstrate the vast potential of solving the biofouling problem, and how it can enable potential clinically important diagnostic applications. This Account reviews our antifouling surface chemistry and the multiplexed EC sensor-based biodetection method we developed and places it in context of the various innovative contributions that have been made by other researchers in this field. We are optimistic that future iterations of these systems will change the way diagnostic testing is done, and where it can be carried out, in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114867917

The aim of the article is to identify the benefits of the chosen strategy of agribusiness (profit maximization, or yield maximization) based on the statistical observations of yields and production factors (fertilizers, plant protection products). Methodology / approach. To analyze productivity growth in grain production under the influence of innovative technologies the data of long-term observations of winter wheat yield in Germany and the United States were selected. In this paper, to analyze the prerequisites and prospects for stabilizing of the crop production, mineral fertilizers and plant protection products were selected as production factors affecting the yield of wheat. Methods of time series analysis and nonlinear econometric analysis were used to assess the impact of these factors. Long-term trends of growth of wheat yields in Germany, the USA and Ukraine were analyzed using regression models. The general model of agrarian business profitability in grain production is based on non-linear correlations of individual factors of intensification and panel regression. In order to substantiate the conclusions of the calculation, the estimation of climatic risks is used. For this purpose, dispersion methods, nonlinear optimization methodology are used. Results. Estimates of wheat yield fluctuations due to climate risks show that they will not significantly affect the problem of food security, so there is no need to impose restrictions on the export of wheat. On the choice of optimal strategy, based on analysis using econometric model of decreasing marginal utility of production resources, it is proved that the maximization of yields is achieved at lower costs than profit maximization. Originality / scientific novelty. The main contribution of the article to the level of application is to analyze the impact of production factors on wheat yield, taking into account climatic risk and reducing the marginal utility of production factors. At the theoretical level of the study, it represents a contribution to the discussion of the vectors of the optimal path of wheat production in Ukraine. Analysis of data on wheat yield variability in Germany and the USA showed correlation of profitability and risk (indicators of expected yield and its variance). However, this means that an increase in wheat yields in Ukraine will also increase its variability and therefore requires the implementation of a long-term strategy that can ensure stable growth. Practical value / implications. Based on the above calculations, it should be emphasized that the Ukrainian agrarian business (in particular, crop production) is developing its own way, not following the development path of Germany or the USA. However, some peculiarities of the development can be highlighted. After a rather long recession, the agricultural sector has embarked on a path of stable growth with an annual increase in wheat yields of around 1 hundred kg/ha. Furthermore, the extremely low proportion of forested land in Ukraine by European standards significantly increases the impact of weather and climate risks. Therefore, a further intensification of crop production while increasing the share of forested land at the expense of less productive land is probably the way to an ecologically balanced development of agriculture. © 2021, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

However, they can generate negative environmental impacts by contributing to increased greenhouse gas emissions, land degradation, and reduction of biodiversity. As a result of that, large amounts of resources have been allocated to research and development (R&D) in forage material improvement and a broad range of improved materials were released showing superior characteristics in terms of productivity and environmental impacts compared to native or naturalized materials. However, data are still scarce on both the economic and environmental “yields” of investments in R&D activities around improved forage materials. Through an ex-ante evaluation, this study aims at estimating the potential “yields” of the investment in R&D and diffusion activities of the improved forage variety Brachiaria brizantha 26,124 cv. Agrosavia Caporal in the Colombian Orinoquía region. The analysis used two evaluation methodologies: 1) a combined discounted free cash flow model and Monte Carlo simulation using the simulation software @Risk to determine the impact on individual welfare, and 2) an economic surplus model an risk analysis to determine the potential social benefits of the technologies and their distribution among producers and consumers, considering changes in adoption rates, productivity levels and probability of success. The results suggest that the evaluated material presents important economic benefits for the study region and results in a positive return on the investments made in R&D activities.

International Vehicle Emission Model was used to conduct emission inventory of taxis and motorcycles in HCMC in 2014 and project the total emission in 2020. CO2 equivalent of nine air pollutants including climate forcers was generated from the model. To estimate emissions from different vehicle types, Global Positioning System (GPS) and technical activities surveys were carried. Emission factors (EFs) of taxi and motorbike, as well as the reduction of CO2 equivalent of fuel switching scenarios, were figured out. Results showed that the annual emission of taxis and motorcycles of HCMC in 2020 for CO, NOx, SO2, CO2, N2O, CH4 were 0.539; 1.417; 0.047; 1.597; 0.064; 0.109; 0.014; 0.046 and 4.213; 1.329; 0.124; 0.696; 0.510; 2.035; 1.653; 5.370 Mt/year, respectively. The potentiality of air quality and climate co-benefits was determined by using Global Warming Potential (GWP) and EFs of emission species. Fuel switching would bring noticeable benefits, in CO2 equivalent. If 50% of taxis and motorcycles in HCMC switched from traditional fuels to compressed natural gas (CNG) (Scenario 1) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (Scenario 2), the total emission of nine selected pollutants for both taxi and MC fleets would reduce in Scenario 1 more than Scenario 2.

The current population of the city, including the number of visitors, is 10 millions. As a result, the urban structure is overloaded and has sprawled into suburbs without having adequate infrastructure. The overall aim of this paper is to review the resilient city theory to apply to the context of HCMC and address some of the emerging problems related to climate change and sustainable development for 'suburban areas of HCMC'. Based on the identified problems, the authors propose a modified and holistic approach method on developing a strategy framework for resilient HCMC suburban areas. Suburban regions surrounding cities are subjected to severely affected by any changes from urban. It is important to explore solutions to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities, the poor and urban peripheries. This strategy includes recommendations for policy initiatives to improve social-ecological resilience through planning for climate change, specifically in improving governance mechanism, sustainable strategy for ecosystem services in land use planning, green belt, green infrastructure and urban village. Hence, the paper objectives are: (1) Analyzing the context of the suburban areas in Ho Chi Minh City following resilient urban theories; (2) Developing a conceptual framework for suburban development issues in the development context and strategy framework for increased resilience in the suburban areas. In 2020, Thu Duc city was established, than the administrative boundary of Hochiminh City includes 1 city, 16 districts and 5 districts outside the city. The city is developed in many directions with an inner city radius of up to 15 km. The city develops multi-center in 02 main directions: East (Thu Duc City), sea - Southeast and two secondary development directions are Northwest and Southwest. © 2021 Author(s).","climate change; resilience; suburban; urbanization",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116335977

It is traditionally used in the building sector, where it has gained importance in recent years as a sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. Additionally, it is the basis for the development of novel bio-based functional materials. However, wood's sustainability as a green resource is often diminished by unsustainable processing and modification techniques. They mostly rely on fossil-based precursors and yield inseparable hybrids and composites that cannot be reused or recycled. In this article, we discuss the state of the art of environmental sustainability in wood science and technology. We give an overview of established and upcoming approaches for the sustainable production of wood-based materials. This comprises wood protection and adhesion for the building sector, as well as the production of sustainable wood-based functional materials. Moreover, we elaborate on the end of lifetime perspective of wood products. The concept of wood cascading is presented as a possibility for a more efficient use of the resource to increase its beneficial impact on climate change mitigation. We advocate for a holistic approach in wood science and technology that not only focuses on the material's development and production but also considers recycling and end of lifetime perspectives of the products.

The NCD@NiFe-LDH hybrid shows hierarchical three-dimensional flower-like morphology assembled with ~1.4 nm ultrathin nanosheets possessing higher surface area values and well conductivity. The as-synthesized NCD@NiFe-LDH hybrid exhibits excellent performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and just require 363 mV to achieve a higher current density of 500 mA cm−2 compared to the state-of-the-art IrO2 in 0.1M KOH. Besides, NCD@NiFe-LDH hybrid shows long-term stability and satisfactory durability even at 1000 mA cm−2.

Crystalline nanosheets of this compound that show a preferential [00Ι] facet orientation exhibit undiminished CO2RR activity after 16 hours with full retention of crystal structure and surface chemical speciation and no detectable corrosion. In contrast to the range of products formed on Cu metal, CuO, and Cu2O, the CO2RR on Cu3P [00Ι] produces mainly hydrogen and formate as the sole carbon product in KHCO3 electrolyte. Analysis of the Cu3P [00Ι] facet by HAADF-STEM was used to determine the surface lattice structure, while both XPS and Auger spectroscopies were used to determine the surface chemical speciation from the kinetic energies of ionized electrons. The presented analysis identifies isolated trigonal CuP3 sites on the Cu3P[00Ι]-Cu3P3 terminated surface and the Cu(I) oxidation state as precursor to the active catalyst. The CO2RR selectivity to formate and the higher turnover rate for H2 production on the [00Ι] facet allows a structure-activity analysis and chemical mechanism to be proposed. Formation of a surface hydride at isolated *H-CuP3 sites is proposed as the catalytic site in forming both H2 and formate, while the long Cu—Cu separation retards forming C-C coupling products. These results disprove previously published claims of Cu(I) oxidation state as a sufficient criterion to promote CO2RR to C2+ products, show that stronger bonded hydrides, *H-CuP3 on Cu3P, favor production of the C1 product formate over all other carbon products, and predict that stronger formate binding (bidentate) is needed for CO2RR currents to compete with H2 production. © 2021","Carbon dioxide; Carbon utilization; Catalysis; Electrochemistry; Energy storage","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical speciation; Copper oxides; Density functional theory; Electrochemistry; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Energy storage; Hydrides; Hydrogen production; Oxidation; Potassium compounds; Carbon products; Carbon utilization; Crystal surfaces; Crystals structures; Electro reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Energy; H$-2$/ production; Oxidation state; Surface chemicals; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111213195

Agricultural water and land utilization mode has a great impact on the amount of carbon emissions, and thus the aim of this work is to propose an optimal modeling approach for generating efficient agricultural water and land management alternatives and reducing carbon emission in agricultural water-energy-food nexus system. This study presents a novel approach consisting of carbon footprint lifecycle assessment method and bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming model. The proposed approach has contributions in following aspects: (1) the environmental impact of different resource allocation strategies can be measured in optimization (2) the spatial variability of spatial data (e.g., ET0 and precipitation); can be fully reflected via remote sensing information; (3) tradeoffs among two decision-making levels and their conflicting objectives under randomness of surface water availability can be addressed. The proposed approach was applied to the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China. After solving the proposed model, the optimal water and land use alternatives under different hydrological years can be generated. Decision makers can plan agricultural production strategy according to optimization schemes, and reduce carbon emission through increasing vegetable cultivation and surface water utilization. Furthermore, the performance comparison of different models indicated that fierce conflicts exist between income fairness and economic benefits. The comprehensive evaluation value of bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming model is 0.7036, which is highest among single- and multi-objective models, showing that such model has obvious advantage in dealing with multiple decision-making levels and conflicting objectives. This approach can help decision makers of similar regions manage the agricultural production system in a more efficient and environment-friendly way. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural water and land management; Bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming; Carbon footprint; Lifecycle assessment; Optimal modeling; Spatial data","Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Decision making; Emission control; Life cycle; Remote sensing; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Surface waters; Agricultural land; Agricultural water; Agricultural water management; Bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming; Carbon emissions; Land managements; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Model approach; Optimal model; Spatial data; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110743166

In Malaysia, almost 90% of the MSW is disposed of in open landfills with no energy recovery system. Due to the heterogeneous characteristics of MSW, it is essential to develop a combination of different waste processing facilities with simultaneous cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) minimization. A novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming with the augmented ε-constraint method is developed to assess the optimum MSW allocation on seven conventional waste processing facilities, including open landfills, material recycling facility, sanitary landfills, anaerobic digestion, composting, incineration, and plasma gasification. The avoided emissions of the valuable products valorized from MSW, which have been often neglected in the optimization model, are included in the study to investigate the extent of emissions reduction in the MSW management system. Compared to the current scenario in Malaysia (total cost: 66.66 MYR/tonne MSW, net GHG emissions: 0.42 tonne CO2-eq/tonne MSW), the least-cost solution (i.e., 74% open landfill, 10% sanitary landfill, and 15% material recycling facility) shows 26% reduction for both cost and GHG emissions, while the least GHG emissions solution (i.e., 20% sanitary landfill, 21% anaerobic digestion, 21% composting, 21% plasma gasification, and 17% material recycling facility) indicates 159% reduction of GHG emissions with 15% increase in cost. Among the 11 Pareto-optimal solutions, the 10th solution (34% sanitary landfill, 21% anaerobic digestion, 21% composting, 17% material recycling facilities, and 8% plasma gasification) reduces 3% of national greenhouse gas emissions and is recommended for future MSW management in Malaysia. The sensitivity analysis indicates that plasma gasification is more favorable when the electricity price is higher. A change of waste separation rate from 30% to 90% reduces total MSW management cost and the net GHG emissions by 18.24 MYR/tonne MSW and 0.30 tonne CO2-eq/tonne MSW, respectively.

Beyond the regulatory aspects of the legislation, the definition of economic incentives has open the possibility for the evaluation of the business models of the Renewable Energy Community initiative. The present work is focused on a methodology aimed at the sizing of the active part of an energy community: a solar photovoltaic system with electrochemical energy storage. It develops a multicriteria optimisation procedure by evaluating two independent and normalised key performance indices: self consumption and self sufficiency of the energy community. These two KPIs are evaluated on a hourly based energy balance by minimising the power flow to/from the electrical grid through a Mixed Integer Linear Programming scheme. Results obtained by changing the PV and the energy storage sizes are mapped in a Pareto plane and their distance from “utopia point” are evaluated. Economic indicators are then used to pick up the most performing configuration. Three different options of business model are considered on the optimal point: one where the Renewable Energy Community is taking on itself all the capital expenditure for photovoltaic and battery, a second one where an independent company is acting as a “technological partner” acquiring and managing the assets, sharing with the community the revenues and one intermediate case where costs and revenues are shared between community and developer.

However, data-mining methods are rarely used to study the coordination of multi-energy generation in published research results. In this study, from the perspective of power industry emissions, coordinated generation of various energy sources, and balance of power generation and consumption, a data-mining algorithm was used to analyze the development of thermal power, hydropower, wind power, waste heat, gas, and other power sources. The chi-square automatic interaction detection tree (CHAID), logistic regression, and two-step clustering methods were applied. The results show that: a) CO2 and SO2 emissions were mainly affected by thermal power generation, whereas NOx emissions were jointly affected by thermal power, garbage power, and gas-fired power, and the emissions of various pollutants increased with an increase in power consumption. The optimal power-generation scheme under minimum emission can be obtained. b) There was a strong correlation between thermal power generation and residential electricity consumption, and renewable energy (wind energy, photovoltaic, hydropower) exhibited the highest correlation with the electricity consumption of the tertiary industry, which indicates that renewable energy generation can be promoted by managing electricity consumption in the tertiary industry. c) When the electricity demand of all users was small, the proportion of renewable energy power generation increased; in contrast, the thermal power generation was larger. This indicates the importance of improving the sustainable and stable power supply of renewable energy. This study provides a data analysis model for the coordinated development of multiple energies, which will contribute to the decision-making basis for controlling power emissions, improving the utilization rate of renewable energy, and optimizing the energy structure. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analysis; Multi-energy power generation; Pollutant emission; Renewable energy generation; Thermal power","Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Decision making; Emission control; Gas emissions; Hydroelectric power; Structural optimization; Waste heat; Wind power; Big data analyse; Data analysis models; Multi-energy power generation; Pollutants emissions; Power; Power- generations; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Thermal power; Thermal power generation; Electric power utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109833354

It is ideal for regions that are mainly involved in agricultural activities and animal husbandry. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the energy potential and to optimize the allocation of electric power generation plants that use biogas in the mesoregions of Minas Gerais, Brazil, based on the distribution generation standards and availability of resources. To calculate the energy potential, data from governmental platforms were used, referring to the number of animals in the study regions as well as theoretical conversion models in the literature. To optimize the allocation of biogas plants, QGis software and a constructive algorithm that was developed for this study were used to build maps that demonstrated the optimal allocation of these plants, based on their potential and geographical location. To convert biomethane into electricity using a combustion engine (28% efficiency), energy potentials of 791.8 and 218.3 GWh yr−1 and 21 and 6 plants located in Zona da Mata and Campo das Vertentes, respectively, were estimated. With respect to the combine cycle (65% efficiency), energy potentials of 1838.2 and 506.7 GWh yr−1 and 47 and 14 plants in Zona da Mata and Campo das Vertentes, respectively, were estimated. New plants were calculated to increase the energy generation in the evaluated regions by 8–19%. The average cost of energy generation using stationary engine and combined cycle were USD 0.2384 kWh−1 and USD 0.0974 kWh−1, respectively. A reduction in CO2 emissions per inhabitant is expected for the assessed region, ranging between 6.05% and 14.52%. A significant portion of the state's rural electricity consumption could be supported by these new ventures, leading to an increase in energy security as well as reliability in meeting demand. In addition, the developed optimization algorithm can be used as a decision-making tool to determine locations for the construction of biogas plants in other regions of Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Biomass energy; Optimization; Plant allocation; Sustainability","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Animals; Biogas; Biomass; Decision making; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy security; Fertilizers; Optimization; Anaerobics; Animal production; Bio-mass energy; Biogas plants; Electricity-generation; Energy generations; Energy-potentials; Optimisations; Plant allocation; Production chain; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109781691

Although the carbon footprint of animal-based foods typically exceeds that of plants, trade-offs among nutritional outcomes and environmental sustainability in the context of regional self-selected diets are less understood. The objectives were to estimate the carbon footprint of Canadian self-selected diets and to compare intake of food groups, nutrients, and diet quality between low- and high-greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) diets. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-h recalls from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) – Nutrition for adults ≥19 y (n = 13,612). Estimates from the database of Food Impacts on the Environment for Linking to Diets were used to link foods and beverages reported in the CCHS to their GHGE. Boundaries for GHGE estimates were mostly cradle-to-farm gate and for certain processed products, cradle-to-processing gate. Data from Statistics Canada were used to account for food loss at the retail and consumer levels in our calculation of GHGE. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 was used to calculate diet quality. The study sample was divided into quintiles based on their diet-related GHGE expressed per 1,000 kcal; low- and high-GHGE diets were those of respondents in the lowest and highest quintiles, respectively. Dietary GHGE (mean ± SE) was 3.98 ± 0.06 kg carbon dioxide-equivalents (CO2-eq) per person per d or 2.15 ± 0.03 kg CO2-eq per 1,000 kcal. Animal-based foods contributed three-quarters of Canadians' total diet-related GHGE, with red and processed meat alone accounting for 47.05 ± 0.82%. High-GHGE diets contained more animal-based foods, vegetables and fruit, and miscellaneous foods and beverages, whereas low-GHGE diets contained more cereals, grains, and breads. Moreover, high-GHGE diet respondents had higher intakes of nutrients of public health concern (calcium, vitamin D, iron, and potassium), but also higher intakes of saturated fat and sodium, and a lower overall diet quality compared to low-GHGE diet respondents (47.27 ± 0.46 vs. 55.31 ± 0.49 points). These nutritional and environmental trade-offs warrant attention in shaping future food policy and dietary guidance in Canada aimed at meeting global targets for climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Canada's Food Guide; Canadian Community Health Survey; Dietary pattern; Life cycle assessment; Nationally representative survey; Sustainable diet","Animals; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Nutrients; Surveys; Sustainable development; Canada food guide; Canadian community health survey; Community health; Critical determinant; Dietary patterns; Greenhouse gas emissions; Health surveys; Nationally representative survey; Sustainable diet; Trade off; Nutrition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109622850

Unexpectedly, SIA concentrations with low levels of precursor emissions were much higher over the southern regions than those over the northern region with high levels of precursor emissions, based on ground observations and high-precision simulations. The sensitivity analysis of chemical processes suggests that the gas-phase chemistry was a critical factor determining the SIA pattern, especially the higher efficiency of nitrogen conversion to nitrate in southern cities controlled by favorable meteorological elements than that in northern city. However, the heterogeneous process led to the decrease of SIA in southern regions by 3% to 36% and the increasing of SIA in NCP by 26.9%, mainly attributing to the impact on nitrate. The reason was that sulfate enhancement by the heterogeneous reactions can compete ammonia (NH3) and the excessive nitric acid converted into nitrogen oxide (NOx), leading to nitrate decrease in southern regions under NH3-deficient regimes. Moreover, through sensitivity experiments of precursor emission reduction by 20%, NH3 control was found to be the most effective for reducing SIA concentrations comparing to sulfur dioxide (SO2) and NOx reduction and a more remarkable decrease of SIA was in southern regions by 10% to 15% than that in northern region by 6.7%. The effect of the synergy control of precursors emission varied in different city-clusters, inferring that the control strategy aimed at improving air quality should be implemented based on specific characteristics of precursors emission in different regions of China. © 2021","Chemical processes; Emission changes; Nonlinear response; Secondary inorganic aerosols","Air quality; Ammonia; Chemical analysis; Emission control; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Reduction; Sensitivity analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Aerosol concentration; Central chinas; Change process; Chemical process; Eastern China; Emission change; NH$-3$; Non-linear response; Northern regions; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Aerosols; ammonia; nitrate; nitric acid; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; air quality; concentration (composition); haze; nitrogen oxides; nonlinearity; source apportionment; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric transport; catalysis; chemical reaction; control strategy; geographic distribution; haze; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; nonhuman; nonlinear system; particulate matter; physical chemistry; physical phase; precursor; quantitative study; relative humidity; seasonal variation; secondary inorganic aerosol; sensitivity analysis; simulation; temperature; thermodynamics; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107817994

The existing life cycle assessment of PLA containers mainly focuses on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of PLA material model without fillers, and overlooked environmental impacts of functional fillers and the significant environmental problem-shifting on other indicators. This paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of cooking oil bottles made from PLA, PLA/Fibers and PLA/CaCO3 considering a wide spectrum impacts, and compares the environmental profile of them based on normalization and weighting analysis. The functional unit was set at 1000 bottles of 900 mL. The system boundary is from cradle to gate, including PLA-based particles production, bottle processing and transportation. The results showed that the contribution of the primary energy demand (PED) index of PLA-based bottles accounted for 159% to 192% of the global warming potential (GWP) index, which may be overlooked in previous studies. Compared to PLA and PLA/Fibers bottles, PLA/CaCO3 bottles have lower environmental impacts in most categories and the lowest integrated impact index. In terms of PLA/CaCO3 bottles, PLA particles and electricity contributed the most to energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) results, accounting for 63.09% and 28.26% to the integrated impacts index, respectively. The results imply that the use of fillers in PLA bottles tends to reduce the environmental impacts, especially calcium carbonate can efficiently minimize environmental impacts of PLA-based bottles. And PED, SO2 and NOX indicators ranking above CO2 should be taken into consideration to avoid the environmental problem-shifting, which can provide valuable reference for the creation of the method of making biodegradable plastic and carbon neutral policies. © 2021","Environmental profile; Fillers; Life cycle assessment; PLA-based bottles","Biodegradable polymers; Bottles; Calcium carbonate; Cost reduction; Emission control; Fillers; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Oils and fats; Assessment methodologies; Environmental problems; Environmental profile; Functional fillers; Impact index; Poly lactide; Polylactide fibers; Polylactide-based bottle; Primary energy demand; Using life; Life cycle; biodegradable plastic; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; lactic acid; polylactide; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; environmental protection; life cycle analysis; plastic waste; anaerobic digestion; Article; biocompatibility; biomass; cooking; cost benefit analysis; data base; electricity; energy conservation; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; methanogenesis; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; particulate matter; soil pollution; solid waste management; velocity; Bottles; Calcium Carbonate; Cost Control; Fillers; Greenhouse Gases; Life Cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107773267

As air pollution varies significantly in different urban areas, the assessment of urban emissions is key to taking appropriate actions and formulating policies for sustainable built environments and to promote the wellbeing of people. The overarching goal of this study was to generate fine resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) using Landsat imagery and examine both the socioeconomic inequalities of air pollution exposure and the air quality variation related to different land-use categories. This study has focused on a period of unusual population growth, 2000–2010, in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. It was found that socioeconomic factors, vegetation indexes, and land use land cover types are all strong predictors of AOD, and the negative coefficients of socioeconomic values reveal insight into the social inequality of air pollution exposure. Results suggest that the government regulation on air pollution during the study period helped to improve air quality. Meanwhile, planting vegetation to mitigate air pollution should be carefully examined in order to find the right vegetation species and spatial configuration of vegetation cover in urban settings. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; AOD; Lands use and land cover types; Landsat; Socioeconomic status; Vegetation","Air quality; Economics; Population statistics; Vegetation; Aerosol optical depths; Air pollution exposures; Built environment; Fine resolution; Land use and land cover type; LANDSAT; Socio-economic status; Socio-economics; Urban areas; Urban emissions; Land use; air quality; atmospheric pollution; desert; environmental assessment; metropolitan area; optical depth; socioeconomic status; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; article; desert; government regulation; human; human experiment; land use; optical depth; population growth; satellite imagery; social status; socioeconomics; vegetation; Arizona; Phoenix; United States; Phoenix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107645847

The coupled SWAT-MODFLOW modeling code is used as the hydrologic simulator and forced with five different CMIP5 climate models downscaled by Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA), each for two climate scenarios, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, for 1980–2100. The hydrologic model accounts for surface runoff, soil lateral flow, groundwater flow, groundwater-surface water interactions, irrigation from surface water and groundwater, and crop yield on a per-field basis. In all climate models and emission scenarios, an increase of 3 to 5 °C in annual average temperature is projected. Whereas, variation in the projected precipitation depends on topography and distances from mountains. Based on the results of this study, the worst-case climate model in the basin is IPSL-CM5A-MR-8.5. Under this climate scenario, for a 1 °C increase in temperature and the 1.3% reduction in annual precipitation, the basin will experience an 8.5% decrease in stream discharge, 2–5% decline in groundwater storage, and 11% reduction in crop yield. These results indicate the significant effect of climate change on water and food resources of a large river basin, pointing to the need for immediate implementation of conservation practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural productivity; Climate change; Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW; Hydrological modeling; Large scale watershed; Water availability","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Productivity; Rivers; Surface water resources; Topography; Watersheds; Agricultural productivity; Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW; Crop yield; Hydrological models; Large-scale watersheds; River basins; Surface water and groundwaters; Urban river; Water availability; Waters resources; Climate change; ground water; surface water; agricultural development; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; crop production; future prospect; water availability; water resource; Article; climate change; climate warming; crop production; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; evapotranspiration; harvest; hydrology; precipitation; river basin; urban area; water availability; water supply; South Platte River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106905247

One of the most negative effects on the environment can be seen in the transportation area. It has been seen as a promising way to reduce emissions from transport with various alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). This study aims to develop a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology to prioritize the various AFVs for sustainable transport. The assessment of AFVs can be considered an MCDM problem due to the involvement of several conflicting criteria. We thus develop a novel multi-criteria decision-making methodology based on fuzzy Full Consistency Method (FUCOM-F) and neutrosophic fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) framework for the assessment of the AFVs. The proposed methodology is applied to prioritize the various AFVs in New Jersey, U.S. According to the findings, the most significant drivers for AFV selection are purchase cost, energy cost, and social benefits, respectively. The evaluation results also show that electric vehicles can serve as an effective approach to reducing carbon emissions for New Jersey. In addition, a comparative analysis is conducted to indicate the out-performance of the proposed multi-criteria methodology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative fuel vehicles; Fuzzy FUCOM; GHG emissions; MARCOS; Neutrosophic fuzzy sets; Sustainable road transportation","Alternative fuels; Decision making; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Vehicles; Alternative fuel vehicles; Fuzzy FUCOM; Fuzzy measurements; Greenhouse gas emissions; Measurement alternative and ranking according to the compromize solution; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-criterion decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Neutrosophic fuzzy set; Sustainable road transportation; Gas emissions; biofuel; diesel fuel; fuel; gasoline; hydrogen; natural gas; alternative fuel; carbon emission; comparative study; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental impact assessment; fuzzy mathematics; greenhouse gas; multicriteria analysis; performance assessment; pollution monitoring; road transport; sustainability; transportation planning; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; comparative effectiveness; conceptual framework; cost benefit analysis; diesel engine; energy cost; environmental decision making; environmental sustainability; fuzzy system; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; traffic and transport; traffic pollution; United States; New Jersey; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106599431

Soil and topographical heterogeneity cause spatiotemporal variations, making nitrous oxide (N2O) estimation and management a challenge. Identification of representative monitoring locations, hotspots, and coldspots could facilitate the mitigation of agricultural N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize representative monitoring locations, hotspots, and coldspots of N2O emissions in agricultural fields (Baggs farm; BF and Research North farm; RN) in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, under humid continental climate. Soil in both fields was classified as Orthic Melanic Brunisol, with some areas categorized as Gleyed Brunisolic Gray Brown Luvisol and Orthic Humic Gleysol. In total, 28 sampling points were selected following conditional Latin hypercube design using topographical parameters (digital elevation, slope, topographical wetness index, and Pennock landform classification). Gas samples were collected over a two-year crop rotation with corn (2019) and soybean (2020). Additional sampling was conducted at BF at spring thaw (2020). Time stability analysis using mean relative difference (MRD) and standard deviation of mean relative difference (SDRD) was performed to test the hypothesis that “simultaneous analysis of spatiotemporal variations in N2O emissions could help to identify and characterize representative monitoring locations, hotspots, coldspots and areas with few hot and cold moments. Most of the hotspots were located at shoulder positions, coldspots, and cold moments at backslope, and representative monitoring points were located at leveled positions or localized depressions. Time stability analysis coupled with multivariate groping analysis supported our hypothesis and helped successfully identify hotspots, coldspots, and representative locations based on landform classification with few exceptions. However, inclusion of additional topographical (curvature, contributing area, aspect) and morphological parameters (texture, thickness of soil horizon, depth to bedrock, and water table) are suggested for consideration in future research to manage variable-rate fertilizer application and mitigate N2O hotspots at landscape level. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural landscape; Crop production; Greenhouse gas emissions; Multivariate grouping; Spatiotemporal analysis; Topography","Crops; Cultivation; Gas emissions; Groundwater; Landforms; Location; Multivariant analysis; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Textures; Topography; Agricultural landscapes; Crop production; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hot spot; Monitoring locations; Multivariate grouping; N$-2$/O; Spatiotemporal analysis; Stability analyze; Time stability; Greenhouse gases; agricultural land; agricultural soil; carbon emission; crop production; crop rotation; greenhouse gas; hot spot; multivariate analysis; nitrogen dioxide; soil emission; spatiotemporal analysis; topography; article; carbon footprint; climate; cold stress; crop rotation; fertilizer application; landscape; nonhuman; Ontario; shoulder; soil; soybean; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; thickness; topography; water table; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106462995

The variation pattern in Los Angeles was markedly different, with PM2.5 and ozone decreasing together over past decades. In this study, we utilize observation-based methods to establish the parametric relationship between PM2.5 concentration and key aerosol physical properties (including aerosol optical depth and aerosol surface concentration), and an observation-based 1-D photochemical model to quantify the response of PM2.5 decline in enhancing ground-level ozone pollution over a large PM2.5 concentration range (10–120 μg m−3). We find that the significance of ozone enhancement due to PM2.5 dropping depends on both the PM2.5 levels and optical properties of particles. Ozone formation increased by 37% in 2006–2016 due to PM2.5 dropping in Beijing, while it becomes less important (7%) as PM2.5 reaches below 40 μg/m3, similar to Los Angeles since 1980s. Therefore, the two cities show the convergence of air pollutant characteristics.

Paddy fields are a significant source of methane and account for 20% of global methane emissions, but the effect of electron acceptors on the methane emission process in flooded paddy fields has been poorly characterized. This study aimed to determine whether the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, and biochar, acting as an electron shuttle, can regulate the AOM process in paddy soil, with or without interaction between biochar and these two electron acceptors. We also aimed to characterize which microorganisms are actively involved. Here, we added 13C-labeled CH4 (13CH4) into anaerobic microcosms to evaluate the role of electron acceptors by measuring the methane oxidation rate and the enrichment of 13C-labeled CO2 (13CO2). We then combined DNA-stable isotope probing with amplicon sequencing to study the active microorganisms. We found for the first time that, in addition to nitrate, ferric iron can also effectively promote AOM in paddy soil. However, there was no significant effect of biochar. Ferric iron-dependent AOM was mainly carried out by iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter, Ammoniphilus and Clostridium), and nitrate-dependent AOM was mainly by nitrate-reducing bacteria (Rhodanobacter, Paenibacillus and Planococcus). Our results demonstrate that the AOM process, regulated by the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, can alleviate methane emission from paddy soil. The potentially active microorganisms related to electron acceptor reduction may be crucial for this methane sink and deserve further research. © 2021","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Electron acceptors; Microbial communities; Paddy soil","Bacteria; Electrons; Gene encoding; Iron compounds; Methane; Nitrates; Soils; % reductions; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Bio chars; Electron-acceptor; Ferric iron; Ferric nitrate; Methane emissions; Microbial communities; Paddy fields; Paddy soils; Oxidation; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; ferric ion; methane; nitrate; iron; nitric acid derivative; anoxic conditions; bacterium; electron; methane; microbial community; nitrate; oxidation; paddy field; soil microorganism; Ammoniphilus; anaerobic metabolism; Article; bacterium; biogeochemical cycle; carbon footprint; Clostridium; controlled study; gene sequence; Geobacter; microbial activity; microbial community; molecular interaction; molecular probe; molecular stability; nonhuman; oxidation; paddy soil; Paenibacillus; Planococcus; priority journal; Rhodanobacter; soil; anaerobic growth; archaeon; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; Ammoniphilus; Clostridium; Geobacter; Paenibacillus; Rhodanobacter; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Iron; Methane; Microbiota; Nitrates; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106365278

We aimed to elucidate whether and how differential organic material amendments (manure versus peat-vermiculite) affect, relative to sole chemical fertilizer application, the link between microbial life history strategies and soil organic carbon storage in a wheat-maize rotation field experiment. To achieve this goal, we combined bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing, metagenomics and the assembly of genomes. Fertilizer treatments had a significantly greater effect on microbial community composition than aggregate size, with soil available phosphorus and potassium being the most important community-shaping factors. Limitation in labile carbon was linked to a K-selected oligotrophic life history strategy (Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria) under sole chemical fertilizer application; defined by a significant enrichment of genes involved in resource acquisition, polymer hydrolysis, and competition. By contrast, excess of labile carbon promoted an r-selected copiotrophic life history strategy (Cytophagales, Bacillales, Mortierellomycota) under manure treatment; defined by a significant enrichment of genes involved in cellular growth. A distinct life history strategy was not observed under peat-vermiculite treatment, but rather a mix of both K-selected (Acidobacteria) and r-selected (Actinobacteria, Mortierellomycota) microorganisms. Compared to sole chemical fertilizer application, soil organic carbon storage efficiency was significantly increased by 26.5% and 50.0% under manure and peat-vermiculite treatments, respectively. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of organic material amendments, but in particular a one-time peat-vermiculite application, to promote soil organic carbon storage as a potential management strategy for sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Fungi; Life history strategy; MAGs; Metagenomics; Organic carbon","Agriculture; Bacteria; Fertilizers; Genes; Organic carbon; Peat; RNA; Soils; Storage (materials); Chemical fertilizers; Fertilizer applications; Labile carbon; Life history strategy; MAG; Metagenomics; Microbial life; Organic materials; Organics; Soil organic carbon storages; Fungi; fertilizer; organic carbon; phosphorus; potassium; vermiculite; carbon; fertilizer; RNA 16S; bacterium; carbon storage; crop rotation; fungus; genomics; life history theory; maize; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil microorganism; wheat; Acidobacteria; amplicon; Article; Bacillales; carbon storage; cell growth; comparative study; fertilizer application; Gemmatimonadetes (phylum); gene sequence; hydrolysis; life history; maize; manure; metagenomics; microbial community; Mortierella; Mortierellomycota; nonhuman; priority journal; soil microflora; Sphingobacteriales; sustainable agriculture; wheat; agriculture; microbiology; rotation; soil; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacillales; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gemmatimonadetes; Sphingobacteriales; Agriculture; Carbon; Fertilizers; Manure; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rotation; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Triticum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106355330

PFPeA (perfluorovaleric acid) (9.39%) and PFTrDA (perfluorotridecanoate acid) (8.61%) contributed more to microbial taxonomic spatial heterogeneity than did other factors, such as pH, dissolved oxygen and velocity. PFOA (pentadecafluorooctanoic acid) (R2 = 0.353) and PFBS (R2 = 0.297) drove turnover in archaeal communities within river sections (transversely), while PFHpA (R2 = 0.251) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulphonate) (R2 = 0.105) drove turnover in bacterial communities transversely and longitudinally, respectively. Phylogenetic null modeling suggested that archaeal (68.89–83.33%) community assembly was dominated by stochastic processes, and was balanced by PFHxA (R2 = 0.349) and PFOA (R2 = 0.290). Furthermore, PFOS inhibited the biosynthesis of several key amino acids in archaea, and PFBA enhanced the potential for bacterial infections in humans (p &lt; 0.05), threatening water quality. In sum, this study provides new insights into riverine ecological risk management. © 2021","Community assembly and coalescence; Microbial metabolic processes; Perfluorinated compounds; Planktonic microorganisms; Riverine ecological management","Bacteria; Dissolved oxygen; Ecosystems; Metabolism; Random processes; Risk management; River pollution; Rivers; Stochastic systems; Water quality; Archaeal; Community assembly; Community assembly and coalescence; Compound pollution; Microbial metabolic process; Perfluorinated compounds; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Planktonic microorganism; Riverine ecological management; Spatial heterogeneity; Biochemistry; amino acid; dissolved oxygen; DNA; pentadecafluorooctanoic acid; perfluoro compound; perfluorobutylsulfonate; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorotridecanoate acid; perfluorovaleric acid; surface water; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; bacterium; coalescence; ecosystem response; freshwater ecosystem; metabolism; microbial community; organofluorine; phylogenetics; plankton; river pollution; sampling; spatial analysis; amino acid synthesis; archaeon; Article; bacterial infection; DNA extraction; ecosystem; microbial community; nonhuman; pH; phylogeny; plankton; pollution; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; river; sequence analysis; stochastic model; taxonomy; velocity; water quality; environmental monitoring; human; water pollutant; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Phylogeny; Plankton; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106296613

It is clear that innovative charging solutions will be needed to align EVs charging with renewable energy generation and local grid needs. We propose a carbon-based pricing strategy to charge EVs that considers CO2 emissions from the grid, local solar photovoltaics (PV) electricity generation, building power usage, Time-of-Use (TOU) rates, and Carbon Allowance Prices (CAP). Our model generates day-ahead and three-hour-ahead carbon-based pricing predictions by learning the patterns of the data to incentivize users to charge at favorable times. Our model was created by using data from the Center for Environmental Research Technology (CE-CERT) at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). We generate three separated predictions: CO2emissions rate from the grid, as well as solar PV power and building power usage from CE-CERT. Results show that the predicted cost per mile for an average EV (33 kWh to travel 100 miles) should be decreased from 0.0249 to 0 during abundant solar hours when considering our carbon-based pricing strategy instead of a pre-programmed Time-of-Use scheme. Further, the predicted cost per mile should also increase from 0.0249 to 0.027 during non-solar hours. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Carbon; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental technology; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; California; Carbon neutralities; Carbon-based; CO2 emissions; Data driven; Dynamic data; Electric vehicle charging; Machine-learning; Power usage; Pricing strategy; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118449311

The first scenario replicates the status quo (two separate services for passenger and parcel delivery), while scenarios two and three examine different forms of combining on-demand mobility and city logistics. This study shows that about 80 % of the distance traveled to provide logistics services could be saved. Within the case study, this work also provides insights on the environmental impacts of Ride-Parcel-Pooling by analyzing the most prominent global and local emission parameters of road traffic.

Free floating car sharing (FFCS) is a transport mode whose real benefits and disadvantages are still largely discussed. Here we compare possible FFCS which adopt either internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) or electric vehicles (EV). We focus on three main aspects: satisfied demand, emission, and system profitability. We use a realistic simulator to thoroughly compare the different dynamics of ICEV and EV based FFCS systems. Our simulator models mobility demand, fleet status, refueling operations, and estimates the satisfied demand, determines the equivalent CO2 emission from the fuel production up to the fuel consumption, and computes operational profit. As case study we consider the city of Turin, where we compare 4 FFCS systems based on a fleet of Fiat 500 with different engines, i.e., gasoline, diesel, LPG, and electric. We run simulations using the demand as derived from trips recorded by the currently operational FFCS, and using the fueling infrastructures today present in the city. Results show that the EV FFCS system can satisfy the same demand as the ICEV based solutions. As expected, the EV fleet reduces emission. However, the current higher cost of EVs makes the FFCS system less profitable than ICEV solutions - questioning its adoption. Interestingly, cheap low-power chargers result the best solution for the EV FFCS, reducing also maintenance costs. We believe our approach and our simulator, which we make available for the community, is a first step to thoroughly compare the implications of different engines in shared mobility. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Climate change; Cost reduction; Fleet operations; Liquefied petroleum gas; Simulators; Car sharing system; CO2 emissions; Economic comparisons; Floating cars; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Modeling mobilities; Realistic simulators; Refueling operations; Simulator models; Transport modes; Profitability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118435348

Effective bike sharing system operations requires rebalancing analysis, which corresponds to transferal of bikes across various bike stations to ensure the supply meets expected demand. In this work, we present Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm(QAOA), a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that has shown significant computational advantages in solving combinatorial optimization problems such as bike sharing system rebalancing problem (BSS-RBP).

Intelligent electric vehicles have shown great potentials to improve traffic mobility and reduce emissions, especially at unsignalized intersections. Previous research has shown that vehicle passing order is the key factor in traffic mobility improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph-based cooperation method to formalize the conflict-free scheduling problem at unsignalized intersections. Firstly, conflict directed graphs and coexisting undirected graphs are built to describe the conflict relationship of the vehicles. Then, two graph-based methods are introduced to solve the vehicle passing order. One method is an optimized depth - first spanning tree method which aims to find the local optimal passing order for each vehicle. The other method is a maximum matching algorithm that solves the global optimal problem. The computational complexity of both methods is also derived. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Electric vehicles; Graphic methods; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Undirected graphs; Conflict free; Cooperation method; Development directions; Graph-based; Key factors; Scheduling problem; Traffic mobility; Two-graphs; Undirected graph; Unsignalized intersections; Directed graphs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118426120

The significance of this phenomenon is particularly noticeable during the time of the coronavirus pandemic. One of the consequences is the increased interest in the air purifier (AP) market, which resulted in a significant increase in sales of these devices. In this study, we tested the efficiency of APs in removing bacterial air contamination in the educational context in the Upper Silesia region of Poland during the “cold season” of 2018/2019. During the 6 months of measuring microbiological air quality, an 18% decrease in the concentration of microbiological pollutants as a result of the action of the APs was recorded. Additionally, the results of the particle size distribution of the bacterial aerosols showed a reduction in the share of the respirable fraction (particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 3.3 µm) by an average of 20%. The dominance of gram-positive cocci in the indoor environment indicates that humans are the main source of most of the bacteria present in the building. We conclude that the use of APs may significantly decrease the level of concentration of microbiological air pollutants and reduce the negative health effects of indoor bioaerosols; however, further work that documents this phenomenon is needed. © Copyright © 2021 Brągoszewska and Biedroń.","air purifiers (APs); bacterial aerosol; bioaerosol; indoor air quality (IAQ); kindergarten",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116472689

Herein, a facile one-step chemical etching strategy is provided for fabricating one-dimensional hierarchical nanorods array composed of CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) supported on carbon cloth as efficient and stable OER and UOR catalysts. By precisely controlling the etching rate, the ligands from Co-MOFs are partially removed, the corresponding metal centers then coordinate with hydroxyl ions to generate ultrathin amorphous CoFe LDH nanosheets. The resultant CoFe LDH/MOFs catalyst possesses large active surface area, enhanced conductivity and extended electron/mass transfer channels, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. Additionally, the intimate contact between CoFe LDH and MOFs modulates the local electronic structure of the catalytic active site, leading to enhanced adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates to facilitate fast electrocatalytic reaction. As a result, the optimized CoFe LDH/MOF-0.06 exhibits superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 276 at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with long-term durability. Additionally, it merely requires a voltage of 1.45 V to obtain 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH solution with 0.33 urea and is 56 mV lower than the one in pure KOH.

However, a comprehensive post-assessment on the policy's effectiveness is still lacking. This study developed a series of high-spatiotemporal ship emission inventories around China from 2016 to 2019 based on an updated Ship Emission Inventory Model (SEIM v2.0) and analyzed the interannual changes in emissions under the influence of both ship activity increases and gradually promoted policies. In this model, NOx, SO2, PM and HC emissions from ships in China's inland rivers and the 200ĝNm (nautical miles) coastal zone were estimated every day with a spatial resolution of 0.05ĝ0.05ĝbased on a combination of automatic identification system (AIS) data and the Ship Technical Specifications Database (STSD). The route restoration technology and classification of ocean-going vessels (OGVs), coastal vessels (CVs) and river vessels (RVs) has greatly improved our model in the spatial distribution of ship emissions. From 2016 to 2019, SO2 and PM emissions from ships decreased by 29.6ĝ% and 26.4ĝ%, respectively, while ship NOx emissions increased by 13.0ĝ%. Although the DECA 1.0 policy was implemented in 2017, it was not until 2019 when DECA 2.0 came into effect that a significant emission reduction was achieved, e.g., a year-on-year decrease of 33.3ĝ%, regarding SO2. Considering the potential emissions brought by the continuous growth of maritime trade, however, an even larger SO2 emission reduction effect of 39.8ĝ% was achieved in these 4 years compared with the scenario without switching to cleaner fuel. Containers and bulk carriers are still the dominant contributors to ship emissions, and newly built, large ships and ships using clean fuel oil account for an increasingly large proportion of emission structures. A total of 4 years of consecutive daily ship emissions were presented for major ports, which reflects the influence of the step-by-step DECA policy on emissions in a timely manner and may provide useful references for port observation experiments and local policy making. In addition, the spatial distribution shows that a number of ships detoured outside the scope of DECA 2.0 in 2019, perhaps to save costs on more expensive low-sulfur oil, which would increase emissions in farther maritime areas. The multiyear ship emission inventory provides high-quality datasets for air-quality and dispersion modeling, as well as verifications for in situ observation experiments, which may also guide further ship emission control directions in China. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; bulk carrier; container ship; emission control; emission inventory; exhaust emission; vessel; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108166913

Adopting the Difference-in-Difference (DID) model, we find that: 1) China’s ETS pilot policy can significantly improve the carbon emission performance of listed companies in the pilot provinces. 2) The heterogeneity analysis shows that the carbon emission performance of listed companies in the eastern coastal pilot areas has improved significantly, which is not significant in the central and western pilot areas. 3) We find that China’s ETS pilot policy can significantly improve innovation capabilities of listed companies, suggesting that innovation is a channel for the impact of the China’s ETS pilot policy on carbon emission performance in the pilot provinces. Overall, our study shows that ETS pilot policy has played a governance role in China and improved carbon emission performance. We further highlight some important policy implications with respect to helping companies save energy and reduce emissions, and promoting the further improvement of China’s ETS pilot policy. © Copyright © 2021 Zheng, Sun, Zhang, Wang and Mao.","carbon emission intensity; carbon emission performance; China; corporate innovation; difference-in-difference (DID); emission trading scheme (ETS)","Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emission performance; Carbon emissions; China; Corporate innovation; Difference-in-difference; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Emission trading scheme; Emissions performance; Emissions Trading Scheme; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116364678

Former growing conditions of the utilized trees, however, are largely unknown. Potential influences of historical forest management practices on climatic information, derived from TRW variability need to be considered but have not been assessed so far. Here, we examined the suitability of TRW series from traditionally managed oak forests (Quercus spp.) for climate reconstructions. We compared the climate signal in TRW chronologies of trees originating from high forests and coppice-with-standards (CWS) forests, a silvicultural management practice widely used in Europe for most of the common era. We expected a less distinct climate control in CWS due to management-induced growth patterns, yet an improved climate-growth relationship with TRW data from conventionally managed high forests. CWS tree rings showed considerably weaker correlations with hydroclimatic variables than non-CWS trees. The greatest potential for hydroclimate reconstructions was found for a large dataset containing both CWS and non-CWS trees, randomly collected from lumber yards, resembling the randomness in sources of historical material. Our results imply that growth patterns induced by management interventions can dampen climate signals in TRW chronologies. However, their impact can be minimized in well replicated, randomly sampled regional chronologies. © Copyright © 2021 Skiadaresis, Muigg and Tegel.","climate reconstruction; coppice-with-standards; forest management; hydroclimate sensitivity; Quercusspp; tree-rings",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116210034

The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However, the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural coastal wetlands-mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests- A nd two alternative agricultural land uses-sugarcane farming and pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot, and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with 1231±386mgm-2d-1, which were 200-fold higher than any other site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with 55±9mgm-2d-1 (wet-hot period) and 11±3mgm-2d-1 (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20±1gm-2d-1 (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower emissions, with salt marsh uptake of-0.55±0.23 and-1.19±0.08gm-2d-1 of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period. During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4+N2O) of 7142 and 56124CO2-eqkgha-1yr-1 compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO2-eqkgha-1yr-1 (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands could provide significant GHG mitigation. © 2021 Naima Iram et al.",,"agricultural land; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; coastal wetland; freshwater environment; greenhouse gas; saltmarsh; soil carbon; tropical region; Australia; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116035275

In particular, there has been a considerable reduction in emissions associated with road vehicles. Understanding the role played by different source sectors is important if effective air pollution control is to be achieved. Current atmospheric measurements are made at fixed monitoring sites, most of which do not include the measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so our understanding of the temporal and spatial variation of pollutants is limited. Here we describe the application of a mobile laboratory using a selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometer (SIFT-MS) and other trace gas instrumentation to provide on-road, high-spatial- A nd temporal-resolution measurements of CO2, CH4, VOCs and other trace gases. We then illustrate the potential of this platform for developing source characterisation methods that account for the similarity in correlation between species. Finally, we consider the benefits of high-spatial- A nd temporal-resolution measurements in characterising different types of sources, which would be difficult or impossible for single-species studies. © 2021 Rebecca L.

We established the explicit observation operator matrix between the ES and receptor concentrations and the background error covariance (BEC) matrix of the ES, which can reflect the impacts of uncertainties of the ES on assimilation. Then we constructed the inversion model of the ES by combining the sensitivity analysis with 3DVAR techniques. We performed the simulation experiment using the inversion model for a heavy haze case study in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during 27-30 December 2016. Results show that the spatial distribution of sensitivities of SO2 and NOx ESs to their concentrations, as well as the BEC matrix of ES, is reasonable. Using an a posteriori inversed ES, underestimations of SO2 and NO2 during the heavy haze period are remarkably improved, especially for NO2. Spatial distributions of SO2 and NO2 concentrations simulated by the constrained ES were more accurate compared with an a priori ES in the BTH region. The temporal variations in regionally averaged SO2, NO2, and O3 modeled concentrations using an a posteriori inversed ES are consistent with in situ observations at 45 stations over the BTH region, and simulation errors decrease significantly. These results are of great significance for studies on the formation mechanism of heavy haze, the reduction of uncertainties of the ES and its dynamic updating, and the provision of accurate ""virtual""emission inventories for air-quality forecasts and decision-making services for optimization control of air pollution. © 2021 Xinghong Cheng et al.",,"air quality; concentration (composition); data assimilation; emission; haze; inverse problem; numerical model; optimization; sensitivity analysis; spatial distribution; vector autoregression; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115292712

To extend the range of possibilities and explore new effects, in this work, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the presence of edge effects in the adsorption and activation of CO2on pristine and Fe-decorated (WS2)16nanoflakes. We found that Fe has an energetic preference for hollow sites on pristine nanoflakes, binding with at least two two-fold edge S atoms and one or two three-fold core S atoms. Fe adsorption on the bridge sites occurs only at the edges, which is accompanied by the breaking of W-S bonds in most cases (higher energy configurations). CO2activates on (WS2)16with an OCO angle of about 129° only at higher energy configurations, while CO2binds via a physisorption mechanism, linear structure, in the lowest energy configuration. For CO2on Fe/(WS2)16, the activation occurs at lower energies only by the direct interaction of CO2with Fe sites located near to the nanoflake edges, which clearly indicates the enhancement of the catalytic activity of (WS2)16nanoflakes by Fe decoration. Thus, our study indicates that decorating WS2nanoflakes with TM atoms could be an interesting strategy to explore alternative catalysts based on two-dimensional materials. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Atoms; Binding sites; Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Chemical activation; Density functional theory; Tungsten compounds; Ab initio study; Activation of CO2; Alternative catalysts; Direct interactions; Energy configurations; Linear structures; Scientific community; Two-dimensional materials; Iron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114881350

This conversion is referred to as “aerosol aging.” Many climate models represent this aging process with a fixed aging time scale, whereas in reality, it is a dynamic process that depends on environmental conditions. Here, we implement a dynamic aging parameterization scheme in the regional climate model RegCM4 in place of the fixed aging timescale of 1.15 days (∼27.6 h) and examine its impact on the aerosol life cycle over the Indian subcontinent. The conversion from hydrophobic to hydrophilic aerosol is usually lower than 27.6 h over the entire landmass and lower than 10 h over the polluted Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB), with seasonal variability. Due to the implementation of the dynamic aging scheme, the column burden and surface mass concentration of carbonaceous aerosols increase during the drier season (December–February) when washout is negligible. The burden is reduced during the wet season (June–September) due to a more efficient washout except over the IGB, where a reduction in precipitation as a result of radiative feedbacks increases the aerosol concentrations. Over the polluted IGB, surface dimming increases due to the dynamic aging scheme, with the top of the atmosphere forcing remaining mostly unchanged. As a result, atmospheric heating increases by at least 1.2 W/m2. Our results suggest that climate models should incorporate dynamic aging for a more realistic representation of aerosol simulations, especially in highly polluted regions. © 2021.

On-road NOx emissions from light and heavy-duty vehicles decreased by 9%–19% between February and March at the onset of the lockdown period in the middle of March in most of the US; between March and April, the on-road NOx emissions dropped further by 8%–31% when lockdown measures were most stringent. These precipitous drops in NOx emissions correlated well (r = 0.75) with tropospheric NO2 column amount observed by the Sentinel 5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P TROPOMI). Furthermore, the changes in TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 column amount across continental US between 2020 and 2019 correlated well with the changes in on-road NOx emissions (r = 0.68) but correlated weakly with changes in emissions from the power plants (r = 0.35). At the height of lockdown-related unemployment in the second quarter of 2020, the tropospheric NO2 column values decreased at the rate of 0.8 µmoles/m2 per unit percentage increase in the unemployment rate. Despite the lifting of lockdown measures, parts of the US continued to have ∼20% below normal on-road NOx emissions. To achieve this new normal urban air quality in the US, continuing remote work policies that do not impede economic growth may become one of the many options. © 2021 The Authors.

This study reports methane measurements in air samples from Hungary, placing them in the context of regional and global background data, to investigate the inputs to the methane burden in Central Europe. CH4 mole fraction and δ13CCH4 from the Hungarian tall tower station, Hegyhátsál, and additional data from Mace Head (Ireland) and Zeppelin (Svalbard) are used with back trajectory modeling to identify central European source areas and their seasonal variation between the summer vegetation and winter heating periods. Methane measurements in air masses sampled in the European interior, have significantly higher maxima and seasonal amplitudes than at the Mace Head and Zeppelin European background sites. The mean CH4 mole fraction value is about 80 ppb higher than the comparable marine background, and values above 2,000 ppb were frequently observed between February 2013 and December 2015. The mean δ13CCH4 value −47.5 ± 0.3‰ (2σ) was comparable to values at all three monitoring sites, but specific pollution events were detected at Hegyhátsál. Concentration weighted trajectory modeling, meteorological parameters, stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13CCH4), and Miller-Tans analysis show that the main factors influencing CH4 at the Hegyhátsál, apart from diurnal and seasonal changes in the planetary boundary layer, are emissions from residential heating and industrial CH4 emissions during the winter. © 2021 American Geophysical Union.

We have generally lacked city-wide concentration measurements that resolve the steep spatiotemporal gradients of primary pollutants required to describe intra-urban air pollution inequality. Here, we use observations from the recently launched TROPospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite sensor and physics-based oversampling to describe nitrogen dioxide (NO2) disparities with race, ethnicity, and income in 52 US cities (June 2018–February 2020). We report average US-urban census tract-level NO2 inequalities of 28 ± 2% (race-ethnicity and income combined), with many populous cities experiencing even greater inequalities. Using observations and inventories, we find diesel traffic is the dominant source of NO2 disparities, and that a 62% reduction in diesel emissions would decrease race-ethnicity and income inequalities by 37%. We add evidence that TROPOMI resolves tract-scale NO2 differences using relationships with urban segregation patterns and spatial variability in column-to-surface correlations. © 2021.

We show that the surface roughness lengths for heat and moisture over uninterrupted sea ice vary with roughness Reynolds number ((Formula presented.); itself a function of the roughness length for momentum, (Formula presented.), and surface wind stress), with a peak at the transition between aerodynamically smooth ((Formula presented.) &lt;0.135) and aerodynamically rough ((Formula presented.) &gt;2.5) regimes. A pre-existing theoretical model based on surface-renewal theory accurately reproduces this peak, in contrast to the simple parameterizations currently employed in two state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models, which are insensitive to (Formula presented.). We propose a new, simple parameterization for surface exchange over the MIZ that blends this theoretical model for sea ice with surface exchange over water as a function of sea ice concentration. In offline tests, this new scheme performs much better than the existing schemes for the rough conditions observed during the ‘Iceland Greenland Seas Project’ field campaign. The bias in total turbulent heat flux across the MIZ is reduced to only 13 W m−2 for the new scheme, from 48 and 80 W m−2 for the Met Office Unified Model and ECMWF Integrated Forecast System schemes, respectively. It also performs marginally better for the comparatively smooth conditions observed during the ‘Aerosol-Cloud Coupling and Climate Interactions in the Arctic’ field campaign. The new surface exchange scheme has the benefit of being physically-motivated, comparatively accurate and straightforward to implement, although to reap the full benefits an improvement to the representation of sea ice topography via (Formula presented.) is required. © 2021.

Despite advances in the spatial resolution of regional climate modeling, significant land cover changes occured at sub-grid scale still not properly treated. Here, we investigate the response of evapotranspiration, representing the fluxes of heat and water, to deforestation in Southeast Asian Massif by employing three LSSs (Noah mosaic, Noah-MP and Community Land Model (CLM)) with different approaches in representing sub-grid variability, implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Two experiments, with and without satellite-observed deforestation, were performed for each scheme. Results show that the simulations are highly sensitive to the subgrid-scale approaches embedded in the LSSs. Compared with the observed historical climate, CLM outperforms other schemes and Noah mosaic shows the largest bias. However, if we target the simulation of the climate impacts of land cover change, the Noah mosaic scheme taking the sub-grid approach can better capture the response of evapotranspiration to deforestation. The NoahMP and CLM schemes underestimate the evapotranspiration response in the grid cells where the dominant land cover type has not changed, but overestimate the response in those grid cells with dominant type changed, which is a characteristic of dominant-grid approach. To improve our understanding of climate impacts induced by fine-scale land cover change, future efforts to better represent subgrid-scale variability and land-atmosphere flux exchange in climate models are desirable. © 2021.

A positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis isolated nine different factors capturing the variability. Three factors were observed by all instruments, comprising over 30% of the organic carbon from each instrument. Of these three, one factor correlated with CO2, indicating a clear influence from human occupancy, and another was dominated by small carboxylic acids and was likely related to building materials. The third factor was dominated by HONO and ethylene glycol, with strong emission signatures after gallery painting. Additional factors correlated with ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide and are suggestive of indoor surface reaction products from outdoor-related oxidants. Outdoor-related factors contributed 20% of the measured organic carbon. Organic nitrogen compounds were measured and found to correlate with the estimated nitrate radical (NO3) concentration. The PTR-MS/I-CIMS/NO3-CIMS factors had higher, medium, and lower estimated volatility, respectively, while the carbon oxidation state followed the opposite trend. The majority of the VOC reactivity was due to indoor-related factors (52-77%) for all oxidants except O3(44%). Human occupancy increased the reactivity of the human-related (×14), small acid (×1.5), terpene (×2), and acetone (×5) factors.

By analyzing the observation data of automatic weather stations and environmental monitoring stations in Beijing from 2016 to 2018, we found a seasonally dependent interlink of the UHI intensity (UHII) and PM2.5 concentration in urban areas. PM2.5 pollution weakens the UHII in summer and winter night, but strengthens it during winter daytime. The correlation between the UHI and PM2.5 concentration has been regulated by the interaction of aerosol with radiation, evaporation and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. The former two change the surface energy balance via sensible and latent heat fluxes, while the latter affects atmospheric stability and energy exchange. In summer daytime, aerosol-radiation interaction plays an important role, and the energy balance in urban areas is more sensitive to PM2.5 concentration than in rural areas, thereby weakening UHII. In winter daytime, aerosol-PBL interaction is dominant, because aerosols lower the PBL height and stabilize atmosphere, weaken the heat exchange with the surrounding, with more heat accumulated in the urban areas and the increased UHII. Changes in evaporation and radiation strengthen the relationship. At night, the change of UHII more depends on the energy stored in the urban canopy. Aerosols effectively reduce the incident energy during daytime, and the long-wave radiation from the buildings of urban canopy at night becomes less, leading to a weakened UHII. Our analysis results can improve the understanding of climate-aerosols interaction in megacities like Beijing. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

The results show only an average of 5% decrease in the total PNCs in 2016–2018 relative to 2010–2012, although the PM2.5 mass concentration decreased by over 40%. Nucleation-mode PNCs decreased by 20%, which is attributable to reductions in primary emissions from on-road vehicles and secondary sources. Unexpectedly, the accumulation-mode PNCs increased by 11% in 2016–2018 relative to 2010–2012. The SO2 concentrations strongly decreased by ∼60%, and the NPF frequencies slightly decreased from 34% in 2010–2012 to 25% in 2016–2018. However, there were no significant changes in the apparent new particle formation rate (FR) or net maximum increase in nucleation-mode PNCs (NMINP). The increased concentrations of other precursors may substantially negate the effect of SO2 reduction, leading to the invariant FR and NMINP. The maximum sizes of grown new particles decreased by 50%; combined with the decreased NPF frequency, the contribution of grown new particles to accumulation-mode PNCs expectedly decreased in 2016–2018 relative to 2010–2012. Alternatively, the increased accumulation-mode PNCs in 2016–2018 mainly attribute to the enhanced primary combustion emissions excluding on-road vehicle emissions. The increase in accumulation-mode PNCs in 2016–2018 provides insights on the inter-annual variation in satellite-based cloud properties, which appeared insensitive to the large decrease in satellite-based aerosol optical depth. © 2021.

However, the region's climate is affected by complex multi-scalar processes and poorly represented in climate models, leading to uncertainty surrounding rainfall change. The importance of circulation features in controlling long-term rainfall variability provides an opportunity to constrain projections. We use a process-based climate model evaluation methodology to demonstrate links between Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) rainfall biases over Kenya and circulation biases in the Indian Ocean Walker Circulation (IOWC). During both the long and short rains, models with wet biases in historical runs continue to be wet in future. Wet future projections are associated with enhanced easterly winds over the equatorial Indian Ocean, as well as decreasing vertical velocity over Kenya and increasing vertical velocity over the Maritime Continent. We demonstrate that models with a simulated IOWC which is close to reanalysis in historical runs project different changes to Kenyan rainfall than those which do not. In particular, the projected rainfall increase during the long rains is confined to a single month (April) in these models. We call for a renewed focus on the Walker Circulation as a way to constrain uncertain rainfall projections elsewhere in the tropics. © 2021.

Globally, isoprene-derived OSs (iOSs) are the most abundantly reported OSs; however, total sulfur mass closure in PM2.5has not been conducted at the molecular level in order to understand how iOS contributions vary by season and by location in the United States (U.S.). In this work, iOSs were quantitively characterized in PM2.5collected from 20 ground sites within the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network during the 2016 summer and winter seasons. Total water-soluble sulfur (TWS-S) and sulfur from inorganic sulfate (Sinorg) were also chemically determined, with the imbalance between TWS-S and Sinorgused as an upper-bound estimate of water-soluble OrgS concentrations. Significantly higher fine particulate OrgS concentrations (∼20% of TWS-S) were observed at most sites only in summer, coincident with elevated iOS concentrations in the eastern U.S. On average, iOSs (130 ng m-3) explained 29 and 4% by mass of OrgS and of organic matter (OM), respectively, in the eastern U.S. In the western U.S., iOSs (11 ng m-3, on average) accounted for 6 and 0.5% by mass of OrgS and OM, respectively. In winter, iOSs were hardly detected, consistent with reduced isoprene emissions. Our study shows that ∼70 and 80% of OrgS mass in the eastern U.S. and western U.S., respectively, remain unexplained at the molecular level.

A predominance in the water splitting processes is observed in both materials obtaining competitive yields for H2 and O2 compared to the results reported in the literature. A better performance was observed in the Sr2Ta2O7 sample associated with its crystalline structure and morphology (H2 = 807 μmol g−1, O2 = 296 μmol g−1, CO = 5 μmol g−1 for 6 h). Besides, both materials were decorated with Co3O4 and CuO particles acting as cocatalysts. The presence of these oxides enhanced the evolution of the products considerably due to the efficient charges transport avoiding their recombination, being the Co3O4 loaded sample the most efficient in both cases. The presence of CuO favored the formation of CO in both tantalate materials; however, their rates are not comparable with the obtained for H2 and O2, being the water-splitting process also predominant with the use of both cocatalysts. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","CO2 reduction; Metal oxide decoration; Tantalates; Water splitting","Copper oxides; Pollution control; Strontium compounds; Tantalum compounds; Alkaline earth; Carbon dioxide reduction; Co catalysts; CO$-2$/ reduction; Co$-3$/O$-4$; Metal oxide decoration; Metal-oxide; Splitting process; Tantalate; Water splitting; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111910823

Nevertheless, the inherent alternating nature of wind power affects the stability of the grid as it results in frequency variations, voltage deviations, and increased ramp rates. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are incorporated in the microgrid to alleviate the aforementioned issues and to promote optimal operation by reducing the power fluctuations. Additionally, power firming filters and algorithms are also combined with the batteries for ramp rate curtailment, power flattening, and cost reduction. Widely used filters such as Low Pass Filters (LPF) and Moving Average (MA) filters are capable filters for fluctuating power control but have poor power tracking capabilities. To account for the resultant power lag, bigger batteries are needed which increases the operating costs. This paper presents a Hodrick Prescott Decomposition filter for wind power firming and enhanced power tracking. Simulation results conclude that the proposed methodology has significantly better power flattening and tracking capability than both the LPF and MA filters. As compared to the traditional filters, the proposed filter leads to decreased battery charging/discharging and appropriate state of charge control which in turn reduces the size of the batteries required for optimal operation. © 2021 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; Microgrid; Power smoothing; Renewable energy; Wind power","Battery management systems; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Greenhouse gases; Low pass filters; Microgrids; Operating costs; Power control; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Low-pass filters; Microgrid; Optimal operation; Power; Power flattening; Power smoothing; Power tracking; Ramp-rate; Renewable energies; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117565602

Challenges were to select major component of battery cooling system, so to have an efficient system all together and operate these part at optimum power. To achieve this an unique algorithm was written which closely monitor all conditions with help of various temperature sensor and pressure switches and generate pulse width modulation signal with different duty cycle to attend different thermal transfer need of battery pack. © 2021 SAE Technical Papers.

Rennes, CNRS, Géosciences Rennes, UMR 6118, Rennes, 35000, France","Numerical modelling offers a unique approach to understand how tectonics, climate and surface processes govern landscape dynamics. However, the efficiency and accuracy of current landscape evolution models remain a certain limitation. Here, I develop a new modelling strategy that relies on the use of 1D analytical solutions to the linear stream power equation to compute the dynamics of landscapes in 2D. This strategy uses the 1D ordering, by a directed acyclic graph, of model nodes based on their location along the water flow path to propagate topographic changes in 2D. This analytical model can be used to compute in a single time step, with an iterative procedure, the steady-state topography of landscapes subjected to river, colluvial and hillslope erosion. This model can also be adapted to compute the dynamic evolution of landscapes under either heterogeneous or time-variable uplift rate. This new model leads to slope-area relationships exactly consistent with predictions and to the exact preservation of knickpoint shape throughout their migration. Moreover, the absence of numerical diffusion or of an upper bound for the time step offers significant advantages compared to numerical models. The main drawback of this novel approach is that it does not guarantee the time continuity of the topography through successive time steps, despite practically having little impact on model behaviour. © 2021 Philippe Steer.",,"analytical method; hillslope; landscape evolution; numerical model; steady-state equilibrium; two-dimensional modeling; water flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115151840

Microbial electrolysis cell was established under four degressive cathode potential settings (from -0.15V to -0.60V) to regulate γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) reduction while CH4 cumulation in this study. The synchronous facilitation of γ-HCH reduction and CH4 cumulation was occurred in -0.15V treatment while the facilitation of γ-HCH reductive removal together with the inhibition of CH4 cumulation was showed in -0.30V treatment. Electrochemical patterns via cyclic voltammetry and morphological performances via scanning electron microscopy illustrated bioelectrostimulation promoted redox reactions and helped to construct mature biofilms located on bioelectrodes. Also, bioelectrostimulated regulation pronouncedly affected the bacteria and archaeal communities and subsequently assembled distinctly core sensitive responders across bioanode, biocathode and plankton. Clostridum, Longilinea and Methanothrix relatively accumulated in the plankton, and Cupriavidus and Methanospirillum, and Perimonas and Nonoarcheaum in biocathode and bioanode, respectively; while Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Methanoculleus and Methanosarcina were diffusely enriched. Microbial interactions in the ecological network were more complicated in -0.15V and -0.30V cathodic potential treatments, coincident with the increasement of γ-HCH reduction. The co-existence between putative dechlorinators and methanogens was less significant in -0.30V treatment when compared to that in -0.15V treatment, relevant with the variations of CH4 cumulation. In all, this study firstly corroborated the availability to synchronously regulate γ-HCH reductive removal and methanogenesis. Besides, it paves an advanced approach controlling γ-HCH reduction in cooperation with CH4 cumulation, of which to achieve γ-HCH degradation facilitation along with biogas (CH4) production promotion with -0.15V cathode potential during anaerobic γ-HCH contaminated wastewater digestion, or to realize γ-HCH degradation facilitation with the inhibition of CH4 emission with -0.30V cathode potential for an all-win remediation in γ-HCH polluted anaerobic environment such as paddy soil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic; CH4 cumulation; Microbial electrolysis cell; Synchronous regulation; γ-HCH reduction","Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Biofilms; Cathodes; Cyclic voltammetry; Dechlorination; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Electrophysiology; Greenhouse effect; Microbial fuel cells; Organic pollutants; Regenerative fuel cells; Scanning electron microscopy; Soils; % reductions; Anaerobics; Cathode potential; CH$-4$; CH4 cumulation; Hexachlorocyclohexanes; Methanogenesis; Microbial electrolyse cell; Synchronoi regulation; Γ-hexachlorocyclohexane reduction; Reduction; bioenergy; dechlorination; electrokinesis; HCH; methanogenesis; organic pollutant; Archaea; Cupriavidus; Methanoculleus; Methanosaeta; Methanosarcina; Methanospirillum; Pseudomonas; Stenotrophomonas; hexachlorocyclohexane; anaerobic growth; archaeon; Methanosarcina; soil; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Hexachlorocyclohexane; Methanosarcina; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112577094

Sustaining cotton production under declining groundwater availability in the underlying Ogallala Aquifer and changing climate remains a key challenge for stakeholders in this region. The objectives of this study were to assess climate change impacts on cotton yield and irrigation water use, and evaluate six ideotypes for adaptation. In this study, we used the DSSAT-CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model for simulating cotton production under 18 projected future climate scenarios and with six potential adaptation ideotypes at Bushland, Halfway and Lamesa in the northern, central, and southern parts of the THP region, respectively. Seed cotton yield and irrigation water use between baseline (1976–2005) and future periods (mid-century:2036–2065 and late-century: 2066–2095) were compared. The irrigated seed cotton yield is expected to increase by 12–21 % at cooler northern sites, and decrease by 2% at the warmer southern site, in the mid-century compared to the baseline. For the same period, seasonal irrigation water use is expected to increase by 6–11 % and dryland seed cotton yield is expected to change by +6 % to −11 % across the locations. The increases in irrigated seed cotton yield were attributed to increased vegetative growth under elevated CO2, while the decline in dryland seed cotton yield was due to poor boll retention at high growing season temperatures. Six potential climate change adaptive ideotypes with greater drought and heat tolerances, higher yield potential, and longer maturity were designed and compared to the reference cultivar. For irrigated conditions, increasing area of full leaf and enhancing partitioning of assimilates to reproductive growth (high yield potential) were preferred, because these characteristics increased seed cotton yield substantially (by 3–9 %) with a marginal change in irrigation water use (by −1 to 3 %). For dryland production, a long maturity ideotype with longer boll filling duration was the most effective ideotype with a substantial increase in seed cotton yield by 11–45 %. The results from this study will be useful to THP cotton producers and water managers in making appropriate decisions for adapting cotton production to projected changes in future climate and groundwater availability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Drought tolerance; DSSAT CSM CROPGRO-Cotton; Heat tolerance; High yield potential; Long maturity","climate change; cotton; decision making; drought; genotype; groundwater; growing season; irrigation system; simulation; water use efficiency; Bushland; Great Plains; Great Plains; Ogallala Aquifer; Texas; United States; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111915302

The central para-quaterphenyl backbone is wrapped by a 4,4’-di((Z)-styryl)-1,1’-biphenyl banister, with its aryl rings covalently attached to all four phenyl rings of the backbone. The resulting helical chiral bicyclic architecture consists exclusively of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. The target structure was assembled by expanding the central ortho-tetraphenylene subunit with the required additional phenyl rings followed by a twofold macrocyclization. The first macrocyclization attempts based on a twofold McMurry coupling were successful but low yielding; the second strategy, profiting from olefin metathesis, provided satisfying yields. Hydrogenation of the olefins resulted in a saturated derivative of similar topology, thereby allowing the interdependence between saturation and physico-chemical properties to be studied. The target structures, including their solid-state structures, were fully characterized. The helical chiral bicycle was synthesized as a racemate and separated into pure enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase.

This calls for urgent technological interventions to address the issue and improve the profitability of this cropping system. Objective was to study the effect of rice residue incorporation (RRI) and green gram inclusion (GGI) on amount of N applied, productivity and soil health in rice-wheat cropping (RWC) system. Combinations of RRI, nitrogen management and GGI with conventional rice-wheat rotation were tested for 7 years. Eleven treatments with combination of RRI, RR removal, GGI and N management were evaluated. Treatment effects on system productivity, profitability and soil health parameters were measured. Treatment R-W (-RR) - Gg + &lt;25 % N to R and R-W (+RR) - Gg+ &lt;25 % N to R +&gt;25 % N to W produced maximum rice (7677 kg ha−1) and wheat yield (5949 kg ha−1), though non-significant (P &gt; 0.05) compared to control (Rice = 7508 &amp; Wheat = 5724 kg ha−1). Nitrogen fertilizer up to 75 kg ha−1 was saved when GGI was taken up before rice. GGI and RRI was sustainable in terms of higher sustainability value index (SVI = 0.78), wheat equivalent yield (WEY = 20.0 t ha−1) and production efficiency (PE = 57.5 kg ha−1 day−1). The treatments with GGI + RRI produced 1015$ additional net returns with more than double B:C ratio. Soil health in the form of SOC (0.42 %) and available N (152.6 kg ha−1) were also improved with GGI + RRI in treatment R-W (+RR) - Gg+ &lt;25 % N to R +&gt;25 % N to W. Adoption of RRI + GGI over 3.64 m ha area under RWC system of studied ecology may save 45.1 million US $ worth N fertilizer annually in addition to substantial reduction in air pollution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Green gram; Nitrogen; Rice residue; Rice-wheat; Soil health","crop residue; cultivation; fertilizer application; legume; nitrogen; rice; soil improvement; sustainability; wheat; India; United States; Vigna radiata var. radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111207588

China, the major emitter of dioxin and the largest developing country, was chosen as an example to illustrate its emission reductions. The global dioxin emissions were about 97.0 kg TEQ/year, Asia and Africa emitted the most dioxins among the continents. Globally, open burning processes were the most important sources of dioxins. Dioxin emissions in developed countries have remained at low and stable level, while those in developing countries have remained at relatively high level or have continued to increase in recent years. It can be speculated that the global dioxin emissions will increase first and then decrease in the future. Chinese dioxin emissions were stable around 9 kg toxic equivalent (TEQ) in recent years, while 17 subcategories are the key sources of dioxin control in the future. Moreover, according to analysis toward China's dioxin emission trend and sources, there is a large space for dioxins reduction in industries such as metal production, waste incineration and disposal. The results indicated that there is at least 30–70% of reduction scope in China based on three scenarios, and this will reduce the world's annual dioxin emissions by 2.7–6.8%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Emission inventory; Global reduction; Monte Carlo simulation; PCDD/Fs; Sources","Developing countries; Emission control; Intelligent systems; Organic pollutants; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; % reductions; Dioxin emissions; Emission inventories; Emission reduction; Global reduction; Monte Carlo's simulation; Open burning; PCDDs/Fs; Source; Toxic Equivalents TEQ; Monte Carlo methods; dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; benzofuran derivative; dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; burning; developing world; dioxin; emission control; emission inventory; incineration; Africa; air pollution control; Article; Asia; carbon footprint; China; climate; combustion; controlled study; developed country; economic development; environmental health; European Union; exhaust gas; geographic distribution; incineration; Japan; landfill; Monte Carlo method; pollution control; reduction (chemistry); United States; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; Africa; Asia; China; Air Pollutants; Benzofurans; Dioxins; Environmental Monitoring; Incineration; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111061365

The Pareto solutions were obtained by differentiation of the initial design and they were derived through optimization. The optimal solutions required an initial investment cost that was 13.5–20.9% less than the initial designs and yielded an RES generation 5.2–24.4% higher than the initial designs.

This study compares the effectiveness of these four NZEB definitions in reducing the operational emissions of a building. As the context of comparison, a simple geometry located in two different cities, i.e. Toronto and Miami, with four different energy behaviours is considered. We find, for both locations, that requiring a net-zero energy cost balance leads to the lowest emissions, 102–145% reduction for Toronto and 99–117% for Miami. Net-zero site-energy building, in the second place, reduces the emission levels in the building by 92–108% in Toronto and 97–110% in Miami and results in negative or close-to-zero emission levels, ranging from −1.26 to 1.35 kgCO2e/m2 in Toronto and −7.05 to 1.95 kgCO2e/m2 in Miami. Net-zero source-energy building definition, in the third place, reduces the emissions by 74–108% in Toronto and by 97–103% in Miami.

However, the relative roles of tectonism and global climate change have been a long-standing debate. To untangle the complex influences of global climate change versus the tectonism on regional climate and ecology in the northern Tibetan Plateau, we studied carbon isotopes (δ13Cwax) of leaf wax long-chain n-alkanes and carbon (δ13C) and oxygen isotopes (δ18O) of carbonates from three stratigraphic successions (ca. 16 Ma to 2 Ma) in the Hexi Corridor (foreland basin) and compare them with paleoclimate records in the Qaidam Basin (intermontane basin). Our isotopic results can be divided into two stages. In Stage 1 (16–12 Ma), a decrease of δ13Cwax values in the Hexi Corridor and Qaidam Basin is synchronous with global cooling after the Mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO). We interpret the 2‰ decrease in δ13Cwax values to be associated with the decline in C4 plants due to the global cooling. In Stage 2 (since 12 Ma), plant carbon isotope discrimination (ƐCO2-wax) and δ18O values in the Hexi Corridor reflect relatively stable hydroclimate condition, which contracts with the enhanced aridity in Qaidam Basin during the same interval. We attribute the difference in paleohydrological conditions to the uplift-induced basin isolation and the enhancement of water deficiency in the Qaidam Basin. The effects of late Miocene uplift also manifest as persistent intra-basinal differences in the Hexi Corridor, indicating changes associated with orographic precipitation and ecology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aridification; Basin isolation; Leaf wax carbon isotopes; Middle-Miocene Climate Optimum; Qilian Shan","carbon isotope; climate change; cooling; isotopic analysis; paleoclimate; paleoecology; uplift; China; Gansu; Hexi Corridor; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111038396

We present the first analysis of long-term (2000–2018) hourly ozone (O3) and ozone precursor gas trends at three Nova Scotia provincial monitoring locations (‘urban’ Halifax, ‘suburban’ Halifax at Lake Major and ‘regional background’ at Aylesford Mountain), together with an examination of provincial ozone precursor emission trends. The precursors considered are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Over the common data period for the three stations (2006–2017) the annual 99th percentile hourly ozone concentrations decreased significantly in Halifax (−0.77 ppb/year; p = 0.02) and at Aylesford (−0.65 ppb/year; p = 0.03), in agreement with regional trends. No statistically significant changes were found in high ozone at suburban Lake Major (−0.02 ppb/year; p = 0.94), but the annual 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile hourly ozone concentrations increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) only at this location (1.09 ppb/year, 1.23 ppb/year, 1.03 ppb/year, respectively). This is consistent with the strong NOx-O3 titration effect in downtown Halifax decreasing over time. After correcting for the titration effect over the full study period, the annual median Halifax total ozone is found to be decreasing (−0.45 ppb/year; p = 0.02). Over the full study period, ambient concentrations of precursors decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) in Halifax by −2.34 ppb/year for NOx and −3.41 μg/m3/year for VOCs, as did the ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs (−9.66 μg/m3/year; p &lt; 0.01). The underlying emissions of precursors also decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) in and near Halifax (provincial NOx: 3982 ppb/year; provincial VOCs: 1680 tonnes/year), also in agreement with regional trends. However, a linear regression during 2012–2018 showed a decelerating reduction of provincial NOx emissions. Provincial total VOC emissions also decreased approximately ten times slower during 2012–2018, albeit this was not statistically significant. Finally, we present an algorithm to identify events of long-range transported pollution in Halifax, based on spatial correlations in ozone across surface monitoring stations in Nova Scotia. Between 2000 and 2018, transported upstream pollution was found to be connected to between 45% and 63% of 1444 days when surface ozone was elevated in Halifax. The frequency with which transported pollution events occur increased by 15% across this time period. © 2021 The Authors","Nova scotia; Ozone; Precursor emissions; Transboundary; Transport; Trends","Air pollution; Lakes; Nitrogen oxides; Titration; Volatile organic compounds; Halifax; NO$-x$; Nova Scotia; Ozone concentration; Ozone precursors; Precursor emission; Surface ozone; Trans-boundary; Transport; Trend; Ozone; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); correlation; emission; long range transport; long-term change; outflow; ozone; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; air pollution; Article; circadian rhythm; correlational study; detection algorithm; North American; Nova Scotia; surface property; titrimetry; trend study; Canada; Halifax; Nova Scotia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111030152

To enable numerical simulations of realistic heating systems, a modeling framework was developed. Challenges like high computational times and the combined multi-physics aspects that occur in quite complex geometries were addressed. The flamelet progress variable (FPV) model was applied, which tabulates detailed reaction kinetics as a function of progress variable and enthalpy. As the larger timescales of CO and NO formation inhibit a direct lookup of local CO and NO mass fractions from the chemistry table, the so called NOMANI model was utilized for NO and a rescaling model was applied for CO. All models were validated against resolved simulation results and experimental measurements. The multi-hole burner was modeled as a porous medium, because it was computationally unfeasible to resolve each burner hole. While local gas acceleration and preheating was considered, the exact flame structure as well as the recirculation zone behind the flame front could not be represented. To still capture the burnt gas temperature, the missing heat losses from the recirculation zone were modeled and coupled to the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) model. The modeling framework was applied to a commercial condensing gas boiler device at nominal load utilizing a lean methane-air mixture. The simulation shows reasonable agreement with experimentally measured emission levels and critical regions with CO and NOx emissions twice as high as in other regions were identified. Temperature variations of 200 K in the flue gas throughout the combustion chamber and 450 K in the solid region of the multi-hole burner were found. Based on these results, design aspects are correlated to CO and NO formation and suggestions on possible design modifications are discussed to further reduce pollutant emissions of such condensing gas boilers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO and NO formation; Condensing gas boilers; Conjugate heat transfer model; Heat loss modeling; Lean premixed combustion","3D modeling; Combustion chambers; Gas emissions; Heat losses; Numerical models; Pollution; Porous materials; Reaction kinetics; Temperature distribution; CO and NO; CO formation; Condensing gas boiler; Conjugate heat transfer model; Gas boilers; Heat loss models; Lean premixed combustion; Modelling framework; NO formation; Pollutant formation; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111022147

Although significant efforts have been made in modeling the carbon cycle dynamics over this area, large uncertainty still exists in the previous simulations in terms of reproducing individual components of the carbon cycle and their responses to environmental variability. Here we evaluated the performance of an advanced agroecosystem model, ecosys, in simulating carbon budgets over the U.S. Midwest, considering both the magnitude of carbon flux/yield and its response to environmental (climate and soil) variability. We conducted model simulations and evaluations at 7 cropland eddy-covariance sites as well as over 293 counties of Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa in the U.S. Midwest. The site-level simulations showed that ecosys captured both the magnitude and seasonal patterns of carbon fluxes (i.e., net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), ecosystem gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco)), leaf area index (LAI), and dynamic plant carbon allocation processes, with R2 equal to 0.92, 0.87, 0.87, and 0.78 for GPP, NEE, Reco, and LAI, respectively across all the sites compared with the observations. For regional scale simulations, ecosys reproduced the spatial distribution and interannual variability of corn and soybean yields with the constraints of observed yields and a new remotely sensed GPP product, with R2 of multi-year averaged simulated and observed yield equal 0.83 and 0.80 for corn and soybean, respectively. The simulated responses of carbon cycle dynamics to environmental variability were consistent with that from the empirical observations at both site and regional scales. Our results demonstrated the applicability of ecosys in simulating the carbon cycle and soil carbon dynamics of the U.S. Midwestern agroecosystems under different climate and soil conditions. © 2021","Agroecosystems; Carbon fluxes; Crop yield; Ecosys; Environmental variabilities; U.S. Midwest","agricultural ecosystem; carbon budget; crop yield; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem response; environmental change; maize; net ecosystem exchange; primary production; quantitative analysis; soybean; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Midwest; United States; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110528132

In this work, several machine learning models to predict solar radiation have been developed and assessed at nine locations (Southern Spain and North Carolina in the USA), representing different geo-climatic conditions (aridity, sea distance, and elevation). As a novelty, due to the ease of providing air temperature measurements, different new input variables from intra-daily temperature datasets were used. According to the results, all the models highly outperformed self-calibrated empirical methods such as Hargreaves-Samani and Bristow-Campbell, with improvements in RMSE ranging from 7.56% in arid climate to 45.65% in humid. Moreover, regarding mean NSE and R2 values, several inland locations obtained values above 0.9. In summer, the highest statistics for all sites (more than a 60% improvement in NSE and R2) were obtained, whereas the worst were given in winter (more than an 18% improvement in NSE and R2). Besides, when assessing the models in different non-used locations with similar climatic characteristics, the reduction in RMSE was from 0.305 W m−2 to 0.252 W m−2 in a semiarid coastal climate and from 0.344 W m−2 to 0.233 W m−2 in dry sub-humid climate, compared to Hargreaves-Samani method. Overall, the MLP obtained the highest performance using the new proposed variables in all locations with medium aridity values, whereas in the aridest and most humid sites, SVM and RF models were preferred. Therefore, the temperature-based models developed in this work can predict solar radiation more accurately than the current ones.

We simulate sowing date and cultivar responses by using 45-year historical meteorological records from the experimental weather station and future climate conditions till 2060 as projected by a set of regional climate models. Both WOFOST and the hybrid approach reveal good performance in simulating average maize yield. However, the hybrid one outperforms WOFOST with respect to its responsiveness to changes in sowing date and cultivar. These findings, besides stressing the importance of crop conditions around flowering in determining maize yield, point to lower yields (14 %–17 %, average reduction) under future climate conditions.

It has been shown that enhanced weathering is principally feasible on a global scale, but there is still uncertainty with respect to the predicted drawdown in a given timeframe. This information is however vital to evaluate, if enhanced weathering should be further considered as a factor to alleviate the impact of the climate crisis. With this in mind, this article reviews of the current state of research and estimates the CO2 drawdown for scenarios using basalt powders of different particle size distribution (&lt;100 μm, &lt;10 μm and &lt;1 μm). Calculated with a modified shrinking core model, the amount of powder dissolved within a timeframe of 10 years is approximately 16% (&lt;100 μm), 55% (&lt;10 μm) and 99.9% (&lt;1 μm). This corresponds to a gross CO2 removal of 0.045 t CO2 t−1 of rock (&lt;100 μm) and 0.153 t CO2 t−1 of rock, (&lt;10 μm). We evaluate our results on regional scale through a case study for Austria, including emissions from mining, comminution, application and transport. Assuming an average distance of 300 km from mine to field, the net CO2 drawdown decreases to approximately 0.027 t CO2 t−1 of rock (&lt;100 μm) or 0.096 t CO2 t−1 (&lt;10 μm), when rail transport is used. For truck transport, the numbers are reduced to −0.030 t CO2 t−1 of rock (&lt;100 μm) or 0.039 t CO2 t−1 (&lt;10 μm), respectively. Accordingly, at the current CO2 intensity, transport related emissions may cancel out any drawdown if grain sizes (&lt;100 μm) are used. Our estimates suggest that enhanced weathering will only significantly contribute to net CO2 drawdown if grain sizes (&lt;10 μm) are used. Under these conditions the large-scale application of particles with a diameter &lt;10 μm may remove about 2% of Austria's annual Greenhouse gas emissions. We discuss challenges towards this goal, including the enormous amounts of rock needed and the energy requirement related to grinding, as well as uncertainties related to actual field weathering rates. Those uncertainties hinder the precise quantification of CO2 drawdown as of now. While enhanced weathering remains a promising path for climate change mitigation, further research at laboratory and field scale is required to put this technology to optimal use. © 2021 The Authors","Basalt weathering rates; Carbon dioxide removal; Enhanced weathering; Negative emissions; Shrinking core model; Soil amendment","Basalt; Gas emissions; Grain size and shape; Greenhouse gases; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Size distribution; Soils; Truck transportation; Weathering; 'current; Austria; Basalt weathering rate; Carbon dioxide removal; Enhanced weathering; Grainsize; Negative emission; Shrinking core model; Soil amendment; Uncertainty; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110170442

As a result, it is critical to quantify a household's carbon footprint in order to reduce it over time. One of the best ways to measure carbon emitted from various sectors of the economy, including household daily activities, is to calculate a country's carbon footprint (CF). This study statistically examined the magnitude of households' carbon footprints and their relationships with household daily activities and certain socio-economic demographic variables in Malaysia. Results revealed that the average household carbon footprint amounted to 11.76 t-CO2. The average also showed that the primary carbon footprint, 7.02 t-CO2 or 59.69% was higher compared to the secondary carbon footprint which was 4.73 t- CO2 or 40.22% and assessment revealed significant differences among household types. The largest carbon footprint was evident in a medium-high cost urban area, estimated at 20.14 t-CO2, while the carbon footprint found in a rural area was 9.58 t-CO2. In the latter, the primary carbon footprint was almost double the figure of 5.84 t-CO2 (61%) than the secondary carbon footprint of 3.73 t-CO2 (39%). The study reveals a higher carbon footprint in urban areas compared to rural ones depicting the effects of urbanisation and urban sprawl on household lifestyles and carbon footprints. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study will help policymakers design and implement stronger policies that enforce low-carbon activities and energy-saving goods and services in order to reduce urban Malaysia's carbon footprint dramatically. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint; Energy; Households; Lifestyle","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Rural areas; Carbon emissions; Daily activity; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Household; Lifestyle; Malaysia; Policy implications; Primary carbon; Urban areas; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110139073

With the decreasing trend of PM2.5 nationwide, the effect of the strict control measures on increasing ozone variation has less been studied due to the challenge of complexity of nonlinear relationship among a number of factors on ozone formation. This paper evaluated the influence of both ozone precursors and meteorology on maximum daily average 8 h (MDA8) ozone at two urban sites and one rural site in Hebei province, China, from 2013 to 2017, by using a combined application of Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter and artificial neural network (ANN) model. Results showed that R2 was 0.80 between the measured and the simulated MDA8 ozone concentration when using meteorological factors and precursors' concentrations as input variables for ANN model. However, ANN model has limitation in estimating O3 concentration peaks. The values of threat score (TS), probability of detection (POD) and false alarm rate (FAR) for MDA8 ozone concentration were 39%, 44% and 21%, respectively, throughout three studied sites in Hebei province. The annual average percentage change of precursor-related ozone was 0.67% from 2014 to 2017. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and boundary layer height were shown to account for 64% of the variability in long-term ozone levels. Ozone variation in Hebei province was reproduced mainly by meteorological parameters, and the contribution from precursors’ concentration was smaller during the years when the APPC was implemented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","ANN; Hebei province; KZ filter; Meteorological factor; Ozone; Ozone precursor","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Atmospheric pressure; Computational complexity; Ozone; Urban growth; Air pollution prevention; Artificial neural network models; Control plans; Hebei Province; Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter; Meteorological factors; Neural-networks; Ozone precursors; Pollution prevention controls; Precursor concentration; Neural networks; ozone; artificial neural network; atmospheric pressure; concentration (composition); meteorology; ozone; ozone depletion; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air temperature; Article; artificial neural network; atmospheric pressure; boundary layer; China; information processing; Kolmogorov-Zurbenko; meteorological phenomena; precipitation; relative humidity; simulation; sunlight; time series analysis; wind speed; China; Hebei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110121560

To deal with pollutant emissions, governments around the world have implemented emission trading schemes (ETS). However, although the effectiveness of ETS policies has been widely acknowledged, it is unclear whether the policy effects depend on regional characteristics. To address this research gap, this study integrated the propensity score matching method and multi-period difference-in-difference model (PSM-DID) to examine the impacts of ETS on industrial output and pollution emissions, and the influence of city heterogeneity on policy effects. The results showed that the ETS positively affected industrial output and negatively affected pollutant emissions in the pilot cities. Furthermore, implementation of the ETS was more conducive to increasing industrial output while reducing emissions in cities with larger populations, higher financial development levels, and worse air quality. Nevertheless, in lower industrialized cities, the ETS implementation was more prominent in promoting industrial output. In this case, the environmental effect was lower than that in cities with higher industrialized. The findings provide a better understanding of city heterogeneity of ETS policy effects. © 2021","Emission trading scheme; Policy effects; PSM-DID method; Regional development heterogeneity","Air quality; Commerce; Regional planning; Ecological degradations; Emissions Trading Scheme; Human society; Industrial outputs; Policy effects; Pollutants emissions; Pollution emissions; PSM-DID method; Regional characteristics; Regional development heterogeneity; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110030365

In previous research, the observed concentration was introduced to reduce the uncertainty of the simulation system; however, no literature existed on how to correctly and reasonably split the observed concentration difference into its contribution from emission changes and its impact from meteorological changes. This study not only derived the splitting process in detail, but further derived the formula for splitting the contribution from emission changes into its contribution from local emission changes and its contribution from overseas emission changes. This was done to assess the importance of changes in Taiwan's own emissions and changes in overseas emissions with regard to the improvement/deterioration of the observed concentration. Based on the derived formula, this study simulated 7 cases and combined the observation data to quantify the emission and meteorological impact on PM2.5 concentrations in Taiwan. Compared to 2013, the results in 2016 show a 5.28 μg/m3 improvement in the observed concentration of PM2.5 in Taiwan, and this was mainly due to the concentration improvement (5.92 μg/m3) brought about by the difference in emissions between those two years; the meteorological difference between those two years may have led to a slight increase in concentration (0.64 μg/m3). Regarding the concentration improvement brought about by the difference in emissions between those two years, 94% resulted from Taiwan's own emission changes, and the remaining 6% resulted from overseas emission changes. These results confirm that the improvement of Taiwan's PM2.5 concentration between those two years should mainly be attributed to Taiwan's own emission reduction. Therefore, the proportion of Taiwan's PM2.5 concentration affected by long-range transport was higher in 2016 (43%) than it was in 2013 (38%). © 2021","Air quality modeling; Emissions impact; Fine particulate matter; Meteorological impact; Observation","Deterioration; Emission control; Particulate emissions; Air quality modelling; Emission change; Emissions' impacts; Fine particulate matter; Meteorological impact; Observation; PM$-2.5$; Simulation systems; Simulation uncertainty; Uncertainty; Air quality; carbon emission; emission control; meteorology; particulate matter; simulation; air quality; article; clinical article; deterioration; human; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; simulation; Taiwan; uncertainty; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109634439

Sustainable finance plays a crucial role in reducing a country's production-generated emissions since limited access to credit hampers firms from investing in pollution abatement technology. Additionally, high collateral requirements may force firms to replace pollution abatement investment with tangible assets, which are often preferred as collateral in debt financing. Using survey data from firms in ten EU member states, this study investigates the impact of a firm's environmental performance on bank lending decisions and collateral requirements. Our empirical findings suggest that, for the sample countries as a whole, eco-friendly firms are more likely to receive a line of credit and less likely to be imposed collateral requirements. For collateralized loans, desirable environmental performance reduces the odds of high collateral value relative to loan size. Sustainable finance may depend on the levels of economic/financial market development. There are seven EU new member states (NMS) in our sample. Although financial institutions in the EU NMSs reward eco-friendly firms when they make lending decisions, they are less likely to consider environmental performance when imposing collateral requirements. These empirical findings hence provide insightful policy implications for improving the practices of sustainable finance. © 2021 The Author(s)","Access to credit; Bank lending; Collateral; Environmental performance; EU","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Europium; Investments; Public policy; Sustainable development; Access to credit; Bank lending; Collateral; Eco-friendly; Empirical findings; Environmental performance; EU; EU countries; European union; Pollution abatement; Environmental management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109524276

Owing to the influence of the stern profile, the wake field at the stern is complex, and the installation of such energy-saving appendages further increases its complexity. To explore the flow mechanism of a ship's wake field and the working principles of energy-saving appendages, this study used a scale model of a bulk carrier as its research object and conducted a wake field experiment with the help of the large underwater stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system at Harbin Engineering University. The wake field data of several sections were obtained, including the axial velocity, tangential velocity, average kinetic energy, vorticity, swirl strength, streamline, pulsating velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and axial velocity at different radii. The wake field data with or without a PSS in the bare hull condition and with or without a PSS in the self-propelled condition were compared. The time-averaged flow field clearly demonstrated a “hook-like” velocity profile, bilge vortex, hub cap vortex, and other flow structures, as well as the flow details around the PSS. The results showed that the PSS could destroy the contour structure of the axial velocity, which mainly affects the range of 0.5–0.8R, making the flow field more uniform. The PSS has a certain influence on the flow field on the side without the stator blade and a great influence on the tangential velocity by producing a pre-swirl flow in a direction opposite to the propeller rotation in front of the propeller plane. This pre-swirl flow can increase the inflow of the propeller disk and improve the working conditions of the propeller. The PSS also has an influence on radial velocity; however, the influence degree and range are smaller than that on the tangential velocity. The PSS changed the water inflow direction, increased the interaction angle between the water flow and propeller blade, improved the wake conditions and propulsion performance, and was conducive to improving the working efficiency of the propeller. Moreover, the existence of a PSS reduced the local pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy, benefiting the structural strength of the propeller. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental technology; Pre-swirl stator; Propeller; Underwater stereoscopic PIV; Wake field","Energy conservation; Flow fields; Flow of water; Flow visualization; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Navier Stokes equations; Ship propulsion; Stators; Velocimeters; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Vortex flow; Wakes; Axial velocity; Condition; Energy savings; Energy-savings; Experimental technology; Pre-swirl; Pre-swirl stator; Tangential velocities; Underwater stereoscopic PIV; Wakefields; Propellers; bulk carrier; experiment; model; particle image velocimetry; vehicle component; wake; Stator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109508465

For that purpose we modeled aboveground C in a series of replicated provenance experiments with both species at the age close to half of the rotation. We used the sets of allometric equations and compared the obtained estimates of accumulated C between experimental series and the commercial reference stands of the same species and age. Significant variation in aboveground C accumulation was found among examined populations, that reached up to 91% for Scots pine and 74% for Norway spruce, depending on testing site. The site-averaged estimates of C accumulation varied between 74.0 (±2.1 s.e.) and 120.0 (±3.7) Mg ha−1 for Scots pine at age 52, and between 37.4 (±3.7) and 184.4 (±5.9) Mg ha−1 for Norway spruce at age 47–53. Those values would be by 23% lower or by 25% higher for pine, and from 9% lower to 11% higher for spruce, depending on the allometric equation used. The accumulated aboveground C was not significantly different at the research sites compared to the nearby reference stands when accounting for differences in stand density. Norway spruce experimental stands had a reduced stand density because of the damage by wind and insects. Those stresses and the observed trends of decreasing stand productivity for spruce populations when transferred to warmer and drier conditions would jeopardize the ability of pure spruce stands to contribute to climate change mitigation in the future. Norway spruce would likely benefit from planting in mixtures with other tree species for increased stand stability and resistance. The results of our study indicate a possibility to increase C sequestration in forest stands through selective breeding, perhaps linking it with protection of natural forests as an option for climate change mitigation. For increased C sequestration in planted forests the use of seed sources which accumulate biomass faster and in a greater amount would need to be combined with silvicultural operations that maintain proper stand density and structure. © 2021 The Author(s)","Allometric equations; Biomass; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Population; Provenance","Carbon; Climate change; Ecology; Genes; Plants (botany); Population statistics; Reforestation; Above ground biomass; Allometric equations; Climate change mitigation; Norway spruce; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Population; Provenance; Scots pine; Stand densities; Biomass; aboveground biomass; allometry; climate change; coniferous tree; genetic variation; silviculture; stand structure; Carbon; Ecology; Genes; Picea Abies; Pinus Sylvestris; Reforestation; Norway; Hexapoda; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109450672

We estimated important environmental footprints of dairy production using process-level simulation and cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment. Dairy farms representing the sizes and management practices found in six regions were simulated with the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). Regional and national environmental footprints were determined as an average of all simulated farms weighted by the portion of milk contributed by each to the total. Nationally, dairy farms were found to emit 99,000 ± 8480 Gg CO2e of greenhouse gas (GHG), equivalent to 1.5% of the estimated U.S. total GHG emission, with a commodity-based intensity of 1.01 ± 0.09 kg CO2e/kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) produced. Fossil energy use was 242,700 ± 38,400 TJ, 0.3% of the U.S. total, or 2.48 ± 0.39 MJ/kg FPCM. Blue (non-precipitation) water use was 11,600 ± 2480 Tg, roughly 3.0% of the estimated U.S. total freshwater withdraw, with an intensity of 119 ± 25 kg/kg FPCM. While these environmental footprints represent a small portion of the respective national inventories, the dairy industry's contribution to reactive nitrogen (N) losses appears to be considerably greater. Losses of reactive N were estimated at 970 ± 133 Gg, with an intensity of 9.92 ± 1.36 g/kg FPCM where 66% of the total was in the form of ammonia (NH3). Although there are no national estimates of total reactive N loss, dairy farms were found to contribute 19–24% of national inventories of NH3 emissions. While strategies are available to reduce NH3 emissions, finding economical and sustainable solutions that do not result in pollution swapping remains a challenge for the dairy industry. © 2021","Ammonia; Dairy production; Footprint; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment","Ammonia; Dairies; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Farms; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Dairy farms; Dairy industry; Dairy production; Environmental assessment; Environmental footprints; Footprint; Greenhouses gas; N loss; National assessment; NH$-3$; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109217457

Obviously, existing studies on laying hens breeding neglect regional and scale differences as well as serious pollution issues. Therefore, based on the directional distance function (DDF) - Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, this paper constructs a three-level Metafrontier-Malmquist-Luenberger (MML) index, considering negative output, to evaluate LHBG from 2004 to 2018. Firstly, in terms of scale, the results show that LHBG is the largest in middle scale, followed by small scale and large scale. Secondly, from a regional point of view, the results indicate that China's LHBG presents a reverse stair-step distribution, that is, LHBG is the lowest in the eastern region, followed by the central region and the highest in the western region. The differences between regions and provinces are affected by the traditional farming habits, non-agricultural employment opportunities, the level of urbanization and resource conditions. Thirdly, this paper obtained that the three decomposition efficiencies of LHBG are manifested as the decrease in management efficiency, and the increase in scale structure efficiency and technical efficiency. Fourthly, climate factors have an impact on the laying hens breeding. According to the empirical results, this paper finally puts forward policy suggestions for improving LHBG and environmental protection policy recommendations for layer breeding. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Green total factor productivity; Laying hens breeding; Multi-level common frontier model; Pollution emission","Agriculture; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Pollution control; Cleaner production; Data envelopment analysis models; Directional distance function; Green total factor productivity; Laying hen breeding; Laying hens; Multi-level common frontier model; Pollution emissions; Three-level; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109215522

We developed an inoperability multiregional input–output model as a quadratic programming model with production and greenhouse gas (GHG) restrictions to develop a low-carbon recovery plan for natural disasters. In a case study of a hypothetical Nankai Trough earthquake in Japan, the model identified critical differences in the supply chains required for meeting the recovery demand with and without GHG emission constraints. The results show that the recovery demand in disaster-affected regions increases direct and indirect GHG emissions (carbon footprint for the recovery) by 32% (344 MtCO2-eq) before the disaster, but the emission increase can be offset by shifting production activities to short-distance transportation and low-carbon electric power regions. By optimizing the design of which regions can be used to secure the materials and energy needed for recovery, we found that a reduction potential of 68 MtCO2-eq and 225 MtCO2-eq can be achieved in the transportation sector and electric power sector. We concluded that low-carbon recovery design can be achieved by preemptively assigning regions to accommodate the increased production associated with disaster recovery, and prioritizing the introduction of low-carbon technologies in regions with low disaster risk. © The Authors","Disaster; Inoperability; Input–output analysis; Nankai Trough earthquake; Quadratic programing (QP)","Carbon footprint; Disasters; Earthquakes; Greenhouse gases; Quadratic programming; Supply chains; Carbon recovery; Embeddings; Greenhouse gas emissions; Inoperability; Input/Output analysis; Low carbon; Nankai trough earthquake; Natural disasters; Quadratic programing; Recovery plans; Recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109212482

Montañana 930, Zaragoza, 50059, Spain","Ammonia is recognized as one of the major atmospheric pollutants affecting air and ecosystem quality. The application of N fertilizers is a major source of NH3 emissions. It is necessary to develop simple, accurate and low cost measurement techniques to obtain representative data for a wide range of regions and agricultural practices. This information would improve national inventories and support decision-making processes regarding strategies for NH3 emission abatement. Measurement techniques can be complex, adjusted to specific conditions, labor-intensive and costly. This work analyses different methods aimed at reaching a balance between the accuracy and precision required for measurements and their complexity. Three techniques were tested under: semiopen passive chambers (SOCs) and an inverse dispersion model (IDM) combined with two different NH3 air concentration measuring techniques: ALPHA® passive samplers and acid bubblers. Different setups were evaluated testing different heights over the emitting surface. These techniques were assessed using micrometeorological mass balance integrated horizontal flux (IHF) with passive flux samplers as a reference method. The SOC results showed a close linear relationship with the IHF results (R2=0.784, p&lt;0.01), although emissions after 16 days were 10.6% higher. The bLS IDM with acid bubblers showed promising results, although they were labor-demanding and required a power supply. The IDM with ALPHA® samplers placed at a 1.25-m height was demonstrated to embrace precision and close agreement with the IHF observations in our experimental conditions (R2=0.768, p&lt;0.01; no difference from line 1:1; mean bias: 0.041 kg N ha−1h−1 and rRMSE: 46.1%). However, these data require special attention for periods of drastically changing weather, when the NH3 fluxes determined with air concentration samplers moved away from the overall emission pattern. Longer sampling intervals and the assumption of neutral atmospheric conditions in IDM may decrease costs, simplify the procedure and provide a cost-efficient alternative to the IHF method. © 2021","Ammonia volatilization; Diffusion passive sampler; Inverse dispersion; Mass balance integrated horizontal flux; Micrometeorological methods; Semi-arid regions","ammonia; carbon emission; detection method; dispersion; emission; measurement method; modeling; precision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109201487

However, great uncertainties exist in terms of the CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) magnitude, and how it is regulated by other global change factors. The lack of experimental evidence from the Alpine Region also limits our cognition on the CFE. By conducting a five-year manipulative field experiment in a semi-arid grassland of the Tibetan Plateau, we are aimed to explore the behavior of ecosystem C exchange in response to eCO2 and N availability under contrasting natural precipitation regimes. The experiment showed that eCO2 stimulated both gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), and resulted in a neutral effect on net ecosystem productivity (NEP). The reduction of leaf N concentration under eCO2 constrained the eCO2 effects on C fluxes, especially on GEP and NEP. As N addition replenishes N availability in soil and leaf, GEP benefited more from the N addition than the ER. The eCO2 strengthened the C sink when exogenous N was added simultaneously. Furthermore, precipitation variability played an importance role in mediating the eCO2 effect among growing seasons. The eCO2 effects on C fluxes tended to decline with increased water availability. The CFE was suppressed with excessive precipitation when the water-use efficiency (WUE) response was weak and eCO2-induced water-saving disappeared. The negative impact of precipitation on the CFE may also be attributed to the short precipitation intervals and insufficient radiation caused by high-frequency precipitation. Our study demonstrates that eCO2 only stimulates net C uptake under conditions of N addition or during drier periods. Given the widespread N limitation, the efficacy of terrestrial ecosystems in mitigating climate change under rising CO2 may be weaker than projected and is closely related to the precipitation variability. © 2021","Ecosystem carbon fluxes; Elevated CO2; Leaf nitrogen concentration; Nitrogen addition; Precipitation variability; Tibetan plateau","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; global change; grassland; growing season; net ecosystem production; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; precipitation (climatology); semiarid region; water availability; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109201013

A system incorporating thermal storage tanks, batteries, micro turbines and photovoltaic generation units is built to assess the performance of different strategies. A multi-objective seagull optimization algorithm (MOSOA) is proposed to optimize the economic, energy and environmental objectives simultaneously, by using constrained non-dominant sorting and external archive mechanism into seagull optimization algorithm. In addition, technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method is used to obtain the optimal compromise solution under the three objective functions to choose MOSOA Pareto solution. A large hotel case is used to evaluate the performance of FST, following the electric load (FEL), and following the thermal load (FTL) strategies in practical application.

In this paper, we developed a spatial agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the adoption of home-based rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater recycling (GWR) by single-family households in Boston, United States. We applied system dynamics modeling (SDM) to evaluate the impacts of decentralized technologies on the UWS. The change in carbon emissions of the UWS was modeled as the environmental benefit for household choice decisions in ABM. We validated our integration by comparing the simulated reservoir elevations with the reference-year values and comparing where early adoptions emerge with the reported installations. In the results, we first examined the sensitivity of the adoption and diffusion to the market promotion, neighbor's influence, environmental benefits, and economic attractiveness. Our simulation highlights the diffusion from central downtown to the suburban. RWH has higher adoptions than GWR, and RWH starts diffusing much earlier. Reservoir water availability is improved through the adoption of RWH and GWR. As the tradeoffs, reservoirs discharge more water for storage security, and hydropower generation becomes less as the need of water transfer decreases. The UWS do not reduce carbon emissions due to the high electricity consumption of GWR. Utilizing the improved water resources and reducing the impact of decentralized technologies are required for sustainable promotion of water decentralization.

However, increasing power generation from variable renewable electricity sources, such as solar photovoltaics and wind turbines, has made balancing electricity supply and demand across the power grid more challenging. In some regions, high penetrations of variable renewables have also created electricity supply systems where electricity is significantly cleaner in hours when renewable energy is abundant, in comparison with peak demand hours when fossil fuel-based generation is often dominant. In the absence of cost-effective, utility-scale batteries, demand response strategies that leverage flexibility in electricity consumption have gained interest as readily available resources to address the temporal mismatch between renewable energy availability and high energy demand periods. The water industry (i.e., water supply and wastewater systems) includes industrial customers that are particularly attractive in terms of demand response potential as they can offer flexibility through large interruptible pumping loads, large water storage capacities, and energy generation potential. This study explores flexibility strategies in the water sector motivated primarily by the goal of reducing emissions, rather than cost. We present an illustrative case study demonstrating that strategically shifting 5% of the total daily average electricity load of a cluster of 97 water-supply electricity consumers in California across the year can reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 2–5%.

Meanwhile, the Solar Power Tower (SPT) is at significantly optimum conditions for integration with conventional fossil power plants due to reaching temperatures of up to 1200 °C and a high-power generation capacity. The present paper demonstrates the optimal layout of the new hybrid-cycle power generation section with SPT. The Heliostat field was optimized as a transient optical model at all hours of the year by considering the city of Seville as a case study using the System Advisor Model (SAM). Subsequently, the cycle's thermo-economic model was developed using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) to minimize the Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE). In the following, four fluids of n-Butane, R245fa, n-Pentane, and R123 were utilized for the final analysis as a downstream fluid. Through this process, the appropriate operating fluid was selected. The study results demonstrate an increase in the efficiency of the novel proposed cycle layout compared to a solar power tower power plant with standard pressurized air-fluid; moreover, it reduced fuel consumption, CO2 emission, and LCOE. The maximum efficiency and the minimum LCOE were53.25% and 61.8 $/MWh, respectively. The n-Pentane fluid was recognized as the most appropriate fluid for the downstream cycle. Due to the optimization of solar parts, the number of heliostat field mirrors were 889, with a total area of 131,525 m2 and a central tower height of 105.87 m. The novel presented cycle layout solves a portion of the pressurized air receiver limitations, enabling access to higher efficiency and lower LCOE with the real payback time (RPBT) of 3.876 years, the annual solar share of 23.1%, and reduction of CO2 production by 33,426 ton/year. Consequently, this study's proposed cycle layout signifies a promising future for using SPT with high efficiency and better environmental and economic conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Combined Cycle; Hybridization; LCOE; Solar Power Tower; Thermodynamic and economic analyses; Working fluid selection","Air; Carbon dioxide; Cost engineering; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Paraffins; Towers; Combined cycle; Economics analysis; Heliostat field; Higher efficiency; Hybridisation; Levelized cost of electricities; Power towers; Solar power tower; Thermo dynamic analysis; Working fluid selections; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109098451

Satellite-based approaches in the operational use of PM estimation models have limitations such as missing values in satellite-based variables due to the impact of cloud cover, relative humidity, and aerosol vertical distribution. Therefore, the spatial-temporal resolution of the estimation models is forced to be improved by using AOD products having different temporal resolutions from different platforms. In this study, ground-based PM10 concentrations were aimed to be estimated using different gap-filled AOD datasets between 2008 and 2016 over a coastal site in the Eastern Mediterranean. For the estimation of PM10 concentrations, daily AOD data were mainly used from MODIS. Then, two different gap-filled MODIS AOD datasets with both AERONET and MERRA-2 AODs were also examined separately on both multi-annual and multi-seasonal basis since the number of MODIS AOD data was temporally limited in the region. A pattern recognition neural network (PRNN) model was used for the estimation of PM10 concentrations. AOD with several meteorological parameters from an on-site meteorological station and aerosol diagnostic products from MERRA-2 were used as inputs to the estimation model. The most significant variables for the model were identified in 23 independent variables using the multiple linear regression (MLR). The results indicated that the best estimation (R = 0.74) was obtained with the gap-filled AODMODIS+MERRA dataset for the period covering all years whereas the AODMODIS dataset alone showed the poorest performance (R = 0.62). However, the performance of the gap-filled datasets varied with the seasons. For example, the AODMODIS dataset alone showed the best estimation performance (R = 0.67) in the summer whereas the gap-filled AODMODIS+AERONET dataset had the best performance (R = 0.59) in the winter. Overall results suggest that for estimating ground-level PM concentrations, an approach of gap-filled AOD dataset usage for estimation models is useful especially in rainy seasons such as the winter and autumn where MODIS AOD retrievals are limited. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth (AOD); Artificial neural network; Gap-filled AOD; PM estimation","Aerosols; Linear regression; Neural networks; Particles (particulate matter); Pattern recognition; Radiometers; Satellites; AERONET; Aerosol optical depth; Aerosol optical depths; Estimation models; Gap-filled aerosol optical depth; Ground level; Neural-networks; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter 10; Particulate matter estimation; Optical properties; AERONET; coastal zone; concentration (composition); data set; estimation method; ground-based measurement; MODIS; optical depth; particulate matter; satellite altimetry; aerosol; article; artificial neural network; autumn; independent variable; information retrieval; meteorology; optical depth; particulate matter; pattern recognition; rainy season; summer; winter; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109071034

This study aims to examine the effects of climate change responses related to salinity intrusion and drought on the economic performance of rice farms using observational data from 352 rice farmers in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. The multinomial endogenous treatment effect model was used in combination with a propensity score analysis for categorical treatment to reduce selection bias from both observed and unobserved heterogeneities and to check the robustness of the estimated results. Although the magnitudes vary significantly across two econometric methods, their qualitative results are similar indicating that performing one to multiple packages of climate change responses significantly improves rice yield, profitability, and income, and reduces chemical fertilizer use. The results from the multinomial endogenous treatment effect model indicate that responding farmers with a package related to crop management has a large impact on all outcomes related to rice farming, such as improving yield by 13%, profitability by 14%, and income by 19%, as well as reducing chemical fertilizer use by 7%. Additionally, a package related to income diversification plays a key role in improving household income by 25%. Notably, a more comprehensive package achieves higher yield and income but may not always result in greater profitability than less comprehensive packages. This study concludes with implications for policies to promote climate change responses and encourage the use of those responses while considering geographical context and its different effects on specific outcomes of rice farming. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change responses; Mekong delta; Multinomial endogenous treatment effect; Propensity score analysis; Rice farming","Agriculture; Chemical analysis; Economic analysis; Fertilizers; Food supply; Profitability; Climate change response; Economic performance; Effect model; Mekong Delta; Multinomial endogenous treatment effect; Multinomials; Propensity score analyse; Rice farming; Treatment effects; Viet Nam; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109044529

Driven by this, Electric vehicles (EV) have been strongly advocated by the government for their zero-emission merit. However, the promotion of EV is not smoothly caused by inconvenient charging issues. For the high construction cost and land scarcity, current public charging stations could not meet the booming charging demands and worry the potential EV users. To address the problem, this paper proposed a peer-to-peer (P2P) private charging pile sharing system supported by blockchain technology. In this system, the charging records of EV users could be packaged and uploaded into the blockchain, which is immutable and tamper-resistant. The detailed blockchain hierarchy is also designed to make this system more practical. Meanwhile, the Multi-Agent-Based (MAB) model is adopted to evaluate the performance of this sharing system. In this model, different participants’ behaviors are fully considered and calculated. Furthermore, several numerical experiments are conducted to unveil the inner business relationships between charing demanders and pile suppliers. Lastly, the proposed private pile sharing system is validated by the realistic data of the Lujiazui business circle in Shanghai, China. © 2021","Blockchain; Electric vehicle charging; Multi-agent simulation; Peer to peer; Sharing economics","Blockchain; Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Peer to peer networks; Piles; Urban transportation; Block-chain; Case-studies; City greens; Electric vehicle charging; Multi-agents simulations; Peer to peer; Sharing economic; Sharing systems; Urban areas; Vehicle users; Multi agent systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109036000

This study evaluates pathways for syngas production from air-captured and tail-gas captured CO2 in terms of net CO2 emissions, energy efficiency and associated costs. We analyzed three direct air capture (DAC) to syngas plants (H2/CO = 2.5, suitable for Fischer Tropsch or methanol synthesis) that perform the CO2-reduction step by either: i) thermocatalytic reverse water gas shift (rWGS); ii) gaseous CO2-electrolysis, and iii) direct (bi)carbonate electrolysis of the carbon capture solution. The gaseous electrolysis plant did not offer any advantage over the thermolytic rWGS because it implied similar net CO2 emissions (equivalent to 50% of the CO2 captured initially), even if renewable electricity is used. The carbon footprint of the gas CO2-electrolysis pathway originates in the calcination step for the CO2 recovery from the air and tail-gas capture solutions. Only a significant improvement in state-of-the-art single pass conversion of CO2 in gas CO2-electrolyzers (10–30%) would decrease the associated CO2 emissions. In contrast, the novel DAC-(bi)carbonate electrolysis offered the best pathway in terms of net CO2 emissions. However, it entailed higher syngas costs (1.90 $ kg −1) compared to gaseous electrolysis (1.30 $ kg−1) or the conventional rWGS (1.1 $ kg−1) pathways. The DAC-carbonate electrolysis plant may become cost-competitive with reasonable improvements in performance, mainly faradaic efficiency to CO and cell voltage, electricity price ≤ 35 $ MWh−1 and membrane price &lt; 450 $ m−2. Even in the best case scenario all the CO2-based alternatives entailed a higher levelized cost of syngas, synfuel or methanol than current retail prices. © 2021","Carbon capture; Carbon utilization; Economic analysis; Electrolysis; Renewable syngas; Technoeconomic analysis","Blending; Carbon capture; Carbonation; Costs; Economic analysis; Electrolysis; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Air captures; Bi-carbonate; Carbon utilization; CO$-2$/ emission; Economics analysis; Renewable syngas; Syn gas; Tail gas; Techno-Economic analysis; Water-gas shifts; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109027697

Mexico City, London and Delhi all share the problem of air quality failing WHO guideline limits, each with unique situations and influencing factors. We determine, discuss and compare the air quality changes across these cities during the COVID-19, to understand how the findings may support future improvements in their air quality and associated health of citizens. We analysed ground-level PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O3 and CO changes in each city for the period 1st January to August 31, 2020 under different phases of lockdown, with respect to daily average concentrations over the same period for 2017 to 2019. We found major reductions in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and CO across the three cities for the lockdown phases and increases in O3 in London and Mexico City but not Delhi. The differences were due to the O3 production criteria across the cities, for Delhi production depends on the VOC-limited photochemical regime. Levels of reductions were commensurate with the degree of lockdown. In Mexico City, the greatest reduction in measured concentration was in CO in the initial lockdown phase (40%), in London the greatest decrease was for NO2 in the later part of the lockdown (49%), and in Delhi the greatest decrease was in PM10, and PM2.5 in the initial lockdown phase (61% and 50%, respectively). Reduction in pollutant concentrations agreed with reductions in vehicle movements. In the initial lockdown phase vehicle movements reduced by up to 59% in Mexico City and 63% in London. The cities demonstrated a range of air quality changes in their differing geographical areas and land use types. Local meteorology and pollution events, such as forest fires, also impacted the results. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; Covid-19 restrictions; Delhi; Lockdown; London; Mexico City; Particulate matter","Deforestation; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Vehicles; % reductions; Covid-19 restriction; Delhi; Lockdown; London; Mexico City; Particulate Matter; PM$-10$; PM$-2.5$; Vehicle movements; Air quality; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; health policy; particulate matter; pollution control; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; Article; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; England; environmental management; environmental monitoring; human; land use; lockdown; Mexico City; pandemic; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; public health; public policy; air pollutant; air pollution; city; communicable disease control; India; Mexico; pandemic; particulate matter; Delhi; England; Federal District [Mexico]; India; London [England]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; United Kingdom; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; London; Mexico; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109013787

These methods which include forestation, enhanced weathering (EW), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar, direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) were accessed with the aim of identifying the conditions and requirements necessary for their optimum performance. The extent of influence of these factors on the performance of the various GGR methods was discussed and quantified on a scale of 0–5. The key conditions necessary for optimum performance were identified with forestation, EW, SCS and biochar found to be best deployed within the tropical and temperate climatic zones. The CCS technologies (BECCS and DACCS) which have been largely projected as major contributors to the attainment of the emission mitigation targets were found to have a larger locational flexibility. However, the need for cost optimal siting of the CCS plant is necessary and dependent on the presence of appropriate storage facilities, preferably geological. The need for global and regional cooperation as well as some current efforts at accelerating the development and deployment of these GGR methods were also highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Carbon capture and storage; Enhanced weathering; Forestation; Soil carbon sequestration","carbon dioxide; soil organic matter; carbon; carbon dioxide; assessment method; bioenergy; carbon sequestration; climate conditions; forestry practice; greenhouse gas; management practice; optimization; performance assessment; temperate environment; vegetation type; absorption; bioenergy; biomass; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate; comparative study; cost; energy conservation; environmental sustainability; geology; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; photosynthesis; plant residue; Review; soil management; taiga; tropical rain forest; vegetation; water management; weathering; soil; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Greenhouse Gases; Soil",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109006531

The key pollutant in the atmosphere leading to poor air quality in Korea is fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Here, we use a 3-D global chemistry model (GEOS-Chem) to conduct source attribution to PM2.5 in Korea from international and domestic emissions. The modeling was done for 2015 and 2016 to account for different meteorological conditions. We ran the GEOS-Chem model for both years, conducted model evaluation using ground and aloft observations, and then conducted sensitivity simulations without domestic anthropogenic emissions and Chinese anthropogenic emissions, respectively. Results show that the Chinese influence on PM2.5 in Korea varies from month to month with the highest contribution during spring when observed concentrations are also the highest. Chinese contributions to PM2.5 concentrations in South Korea reach a maximum of up to ~60% in January and February and gradually decrease until August when they reach a minimum at about 20%. On an annual basis, our analysis estimated that in 2016, Chinese anthropogenic emissions contributed 45% to PM2.5 in South Korea. The 2016 contribution from China was generally 3–5% lower than in 2015 because of emissions reductions in China.

Portugal's strategy for H2 sets public policies promoting an industry focused on the hydrogen value chain. Considering the production of green hydrogen from renewable sources is key, water electrolysis becomes a priority, and with it, the need to assess the suitability of water sources, which is determined by both quantitative and qualitative factors. This work presents a new approach to assess the suitability of water sources for hydrogen production via water electrolysis by applying a Sustainable Value Methodology for decision-making support, combining economic, environmental and social criteria. The approach is applied to two different sites in Portugal: a semi-urban location on the Atlantic coast (site A) and a rural area far from the coast (site B). For both sites, water sources are evaluated regarding water availability, quality, transport options, abstraction costs, treatment needs and regulation (including environmental constraints) and social acceptance. The resulting sustainable value indicator, aggregator of different levels of information, enables a relative quantitative comparison of the performance of different water sources for electrolysis and the involved costs. It is found that the public grid water is the most suited source of water for electrolysis due to lower risk of supply, lower costs and avoids complex permitting processes. Likewise, seawater and wastewater treatment plant effluent (only in site A) showed to be possible water sources where the factors most affecting suitability are transport costs for water and waste disposal from water treatment. © 2021","Energy; Hydrogen production; Sustainability index; Sustainable value; Water; Water electrolysis","Decision making; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Electrolysis; Environmental regulations; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Energy; Growth strategy; Portugal; Sustainability index; Sustainable values; Water availability; Water electrolysis; Water source; Water usage; Water-water; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108952759

Throughout the summer, hourly fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at schools often exceeded 25 μg m−³ (i.e. the national daily average standard for PM2.5) for up to 8 h, with PM2.5 spikes frequently reverberating across Sydney, creating city-wide impacts. However, timing and magnitude varied markedly with location, and a geographic sequence of impacts was evident, reflecting smoke transport by the passage of synoptic features, especially pre-frontal troughs. Temperature, dew point temperature, and air pressure had significant, mainly positive non-linear associations with PM2.5, whereas negative relative humidity‒PM2.5 associations increased in strength at ~70% humidity, and negative wind speed‒PM2.5 associations reversed at higher speeds reflecting increased synoptic-scale advection of PM2.5. This study provides insights into the complex spatiotemporal variations in air pollution during wildfires and the corresponding influential meteorological factors. Together, these insights can inform improvements in air quality forecasting and support planning to reduce exposure to smoke emissions, thus increasing the preparedness requirements of society to mitigate the impacts of severe wildfires. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; Climate change; Health impacts; Meteorology; Natural hazards; PM2.5","Air quality; Fires; Health hazards; Smoke; Wind; Air pollution impact; Air quality impacts; Australia; Fine particulate matter; Geographics; Health impact; Natural hazard; PM$-2.5$; Smoke transport; Spatio-temporal variation; Climate change; air quality; atmospheric pollution; dew point; particulate matter; smoke; spatiotemporal analysis; student; wildfire; advection; air pressure; air quality; article; climate change; dew point temperature; forecasting; human; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; relative humidity; smoke; spike; summer; wildfire; wind speed; Sydney [New South Wales]; Elliptio dilatata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108943601

However, few studies have applied multiple warming treatments in arid ecosystems, which play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and are among the ecosystems most sensitive to future climatic change. To explore the effects of climatic warming on plant community function and stability, moderate warming and acute warming treatments were conducted in desert grassland, Inner Mongolia, China, using free-air temperature increase facilities. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of plant community significantly decreased with climatic warming, particularly in warmer years with drier conditions. The decrease in ANPP was mainly caused by decreased soil moisture induced by climatic warming. Climatic warming reduced the temporal stability of the plant community by weakening plant species asynchrony and shifting key functional groups, such as perennial vs annual grass and C3 vs C4 species. Our findings indicate that climatic warming could hamper plant community productivity via decreased soil moisture and constrain plant community functioning by weakening community stability. This result highlights that shifts in plant community composition and consequent functional changes can play a key role in predicting the responses of arid ecosystems to climatic change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground net primary production; Arid ecosystem; Climatic warming; Grassland; Plant community stability; Plant functional groups",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108840257

While laboratory-scale microwave-assisted heterogeneous catalytic reactors are being developed, hot spots and reactor stability under increased catalyst inventory remain impediments for high throughput processing. Here, we engineer the electromagnetic field-material interactions by introducing a packed monolith configuration, consisting of a microwave absorbing monolith filled with catalytic pellets. Electromagnetic simulations reveal the crucial role of monolith electrical conductivity in diminishing the local power dissipation between the pellets' contact points by absorbing the heat directly. Compared to traditional fixed beds, where hot spots form within minutes of operation, and catalyst-coated monoliths, whose active catalyst loading is limited, the proposed system is stable at all tested temperatures up to 900 °C and has a catalyst packing density near that of fixed beds. We demonstrate its versatility first on the ethane dehydrogenation to produce ethylene over a Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. Repeatable performance over multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration highlights long-term operation. Second, the dry reforming of methane (CH4) is carried out over a commercial Rh/Al2O3 catalyst, achieving a high (~86%) CH4 conversion with an order of magnitude higher H2 throughput (~85 m3/kg/hr) than previous laboratory-scale reactors.

These impacts, such as the European heatwave in 2003, have been well documented for some temperate forests. However, few studies have been conducted on subtropical forests, which play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Here, we analyzed continuous carbon flux measurements of a subtropical forest in South China from 2003 to 2016, during which the forest experienced extreme cold and hot spells and a prolonged drought. We found that the forest was a strong carbon sink, taking up about 400 to 740 g C m−2 yr−1 in most years, and that the forest became a much weaker sink or even a carbon source during two extreme periods. This large interannual variation of net carbon uptake by this forest resulted from the different responses of gross primary production (GPP) and terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) to climate extremes. The observed reduction in GPP during extreme years was well simulated by lowering maximum leaf carboxylation rate (vcmax) in a process-based model. Parameter optimization suggests that the reduced vcmax in the model recovered quickly after hot and cold spells but remained low after the prolonged drought. During the prolonged drought, the observed tree mortality and litter fall significantly increased, which increased TER in the following year. This lagged response in TER significantly contributed to the weakened carbon sinks of the forest during the two extremes. Our study highlights the importance of community dynamics and lagged response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate extremes. © 2021","Carbon cycle; Climate extreme; Drought; Eddy flux; Land carbon sink; Tropical forests","annual variation; carbon cycle; carbon flux; climate effect; climate variation; community dynamics; drought; evergreen forest; extreme event; measurement method; mixed forest; optimization; parameterization; primary production; temperate forest; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108649743

Our analysis is based on cooperation among the 28 countries of the European Union (as of 2018) to achieve a global carbon removal target. Given regional biomass and marginal land availability inputs and a carbon removal target of 0.61 GtCO2/year, the minimum-cost scenario provides negative emissions, with an overall cost of 140 Eur/MWh of bioelectricity generated or 117 Eur/tCO2 removed, without considering revenues from selling the electricity produced.

The oil sector is described as a complex network of transformations carried out by structural and functional elements, exploiting different types of crude oils. Energy carrier requirements and emissions of viable sequential pathways of extraction and refining are assessed and scaled across different levels of organization, using the concept of metabolic processor. Based on the analysis of seventy-one oil fields around the world - about 25% of global production - we provide a diagnostic analysis of the current state and explore possible scenarios simulating the progressive aging of conventional oil sources and an increasing exploitation of unconventional crudes. Results show how future oil exploitation will be more energy intensive, entailing an increase of emissions per barrel in the range of 6–26% over the baseline, depending on the simulation. Under the existing policy frameworks and international pledges, this increase will translate into an amount of extra CO2 comparable to entire European economic sectors. Implications of our findings for future energy policies are discussed and the need to complement Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) with more robust methodologies is emphasized. It is concluded that the declining performance of the oil sector could potentially undermine the plausibility of global low-carbon aspirations. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Fossil transition; Oil depletion; Relational analysis; Unconventional oils","Carbon dioxide; Complex networks; Crude oil; Oil fields; Petroleum refining; Climate change mitigation; CO$-2$/ emission; Fossil transition; Global climate changes; Oil depletion; Oil sectors; Performance; Petroleum sectors; Relational analysis; Unconventional oil; Climate change; climate change; crude oil; emission control; energy policy; global climate; integrated approach; mitigation; oil industry; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108413156

This was accomplished via a regional, geospatial model, accounting for regional loads, transmission losses and generators of Britain's current energy infrastructure. This regional model is also compared to a pure dispatch, nationally aggregated model which considers only costs on the generator side inclusive of the carbon tax, thus allowing the effect of including geospatial conditions to be identified. The effect of this tax (in both the geospatial and nationally aggregated cases) is a transition from coal to combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) generated power to fulfil demand unmet by nuclear or renewable sources. The more sophisticated regional model, however, differs from the nationally aggregated case by having a significantly larger window of carbon tax rates over which this coal to CCGT transition occurs. Due regional differences in demand and installed capacity technology types it is determined that more than 50% of this transition occurs prior to CCGT becoming more economical than coal from a pure dispatch (nationally aggregated) perspective. Primarily due to CCGT generators typically being closer to larger southern loads than northern coal, transmission losses and the economic disincentive of a carbon tax combine in encouraging this transition. The transition window, therefore, is not only broadened by the consideration of geospatial effects, but furthermore, this broadening significantly and disproportionately occurs by decreasing the lower bound of this transition window. These findings validate the significance of utilising a geospatial model, particularly of regional resolution. They further identify the deployment of current energy infrastructure in Britain under differing carbon tax regimes and by extension, the transition window (found to be from coal to CCGT) an increasing carbon tax rate would create. These results bear not only significance in understanding the UK's currently incrementing (top-up) carbon tax rate, but also shed light on future policies due to the UK's leaving of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), with immediate plans to continue with a domestic carbon tax and trading scheme. Thus, these results hold importance in the understanding the effect of carbon taxation on existing infrastructure, energy modelling and national policy in the UK. © 2021","Energy policy; Generation carbon tax; Optimal power flow; Transmission; UK","Carbon; Coal; Combined cycle power plants; Commerce; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Energy policy; Taxation; Transmissions; Wave transmission; A-carbon; Britain; Carbon taxes; Combined cycle gas turbine; Energy; Generation carbon tax; Geo-spatial; Optimal power flows; Tax rates; UK; Emission control; emissions trading; infrastructure; national planning; pollution tax; power generation; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108170408

This study investigated the pollutant emissions from six burning scenarios (heating and cooking with each of the three different fuels: yak dung, sheep dung, and bitumite) in the QTP's pastoral dwellings. Target pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fine particles (PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 μm), carbonaceous aerosols, water-soluble ions, and particle-phase PAHs were investigated. Emission factors (EFs) (mean ± standard deviation) of PM2.5 from the six scenarios were in the range of 1.21 ± 0.47–7.03 ± 1.95 g kg−1, of which over 60% mass fractions were carbonaceous aerosols. The ratio of organic carbon to elemental carbon ranged from 9.6 ± 2.7–33.4 ± 11.5 and 81.7 ± 30.4–91.9 ± 29.0 for dung and bitumite burning, respectively. These values were much larger than those reported in the literature, likely because of the region's high altitudes—where the oxygen level is approximately 65% of that at the sea level—thus providing a deficient air supply to stoves. However, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of PAHs emitted from solid fuel combustion in the QTP are significant, despite a slightly lower benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent carcinogenic potency (Bapeq) in this study than in the literature. The gas-to-particle partitioning coefficient of PAHs and VOC emission profiles in the QTP differed significantly from those reported for other regions in the literature. More attention should be paid to the emissions of PAH derivatives (oxygenated PAHs and nitro-PAHs), considering their enhanced light-absorbing ability and high BaPeq from solid fuel combustion in the QTP. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dung cake combustion; Emission factor; PAHs; Pollutants source profiles; VOCs","Aerosols; Air pollution; Bituminous coal; Coal combustion; Housing; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbonaceous aerosol; Chemical sources; Dung cake combustion; Emission factors; Pollutant source profile; Polycyclic aromatics; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Solid fuels combustion; Source profiles; Volatile organics; Volatile organic compounds; combustion; PAH; particulate matter; pollutant source; toxicity; volatile organic compound; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air pollutant; animal; cooking; gas; heating; particulate matter; sheep; Tibet; Air Pollutants; Animals; Cooking; Gases; Heating; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Sheep; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108119883

In doing so, green technology innovations (GTIs) and clean energy are the essential factors that can help to achieve the carbon neutrality goal. Therefore, this paper examines the linkages between green technology innovation and renewable energy and carbon dioxide emissions based on the STIRPAT model in Turkey during the time of 1990–2018. The study used testing like “unit-root” to verify the variables' integrative properties containing the information for structural breaks. Also, the bootstrapping ARDL-bound testing technique is used to analyze the relationship between the variables. The causal relationship between green technology innovation, energy consumption, renewable energy, population, income per capita, and carbon dioxide emissions is tested through a Granger causality test. The empirical findings show that green technology innovation, renewable energy, energy consumption, population, income per capita, and carbon dioxide emissions are co-integrated for the long-term association. Additionally, green technology innovation and renewable energy decline carbon dioxide emissions, whereas energy consumption, population, and per capita enhance carbon emissions.

In SNPR process, denitrifying glycogen-accumulating organisms (DGAOs) and denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (DPAOs) utilized NOx--N(NO3--N or NO2--N) as electron acceptor and poly-beta-hydroxy-alkanoates (PHAs) as carbon sources for endogenous denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal processes. Results from 217 days of operation showed that a high-level of nitrogen removal efficiency of 83.73% was achieved with influent COD/N of 4. The success was attributed to the fact that most of influent carbon sources could be transformed into PHAs before nitrification via enriching DGAOs and DPAOs in CW, which simultaneously improved nitrification and denitrification due to reducing oxygen and carbon sources consumption by aerobic heterotrophs. Phosphorus was mainly removed via denitrifying phosphorus removal, and PO43--P removal efficiency reached up to 87.84% with even common gravel used as substrate. Stoichiometry analysis revealed that DGAOs were the main organisms providing nitrite to DPAOs, suggesting that the effective PO43--P removal under high DGAO abundance condition might be attributed to the coordination of DGAOs and DPAOs in SNRP processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Constructed wetlands; Denitrifying phosphorus removal; Endogenous denitrification; Simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal","nitrite; nitrogen; oxygen; phosphorus; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; bioaccumulation; carbon; constructed wetland; denitrification; electron; gravel; nitrite; oxygen; phosphorus; pollutant removal; stoichiometry; Article; carbon source; constructed wetland; denitrification; feasibility study; glycogen accumulating organism; heavy metal removal; heterotroph; microbial community; nitrification; nonhuman; polyphosphate accumulating organism; stoichiometry; wastewater; bioreactor; denitrification; sewage; wetland; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108083558

The building industry is taking various actions to achieve sustainable development, implement energy conservation strategies, and provide climate change mitigation. In addition to mitigation, it is crucial to adapt to climate change, and to investigate the possible risks and limitations of mitigation strategies. Although the importance of climate change adaptation is well-understood, there are still challenges in understanding and modeling the impacts of climate change, and the consequent risks and extremes. This work provides a comprehensive study of the impacts of climate change on the energy performances and thermal comfort of European residential building stocks. To perform an unbiased assessment and account for climate uncertainties and extreme events, a large set of future climate data was used for a 90-year period (2010–2099). Climate data for 38 European cities in five different climate zones, downscaled by the “RCA4” regional climate model, were synthesized and applied to simulate the respective energy performances of the residential building stocks in the cities. The results suggest that there will be larger needs for cooling buildings in the future and less heating demand; however, there are differences in the variation rates between zones and cities. Discomfort hours will increase notably in cities within cooling-dominated zones, but will not be affected considerably in cities within heating-dominated zones. In addition to long-term changes, climate-induced extremes can considerably affect future energy demands, especially the cooling demand; this may become challenging for both buildings and energy systems. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate big data; Climate change; Energy performance of buildings; European climate zones; Extreme events; Thermal comfort","Big data; Climate change; Climate models; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Historic preservation; Housing; Climate big data; Climate data; Energy performance; Energy performance of buildings; European climate zone; Extreme events; Impact assessments; Regional climate; Residential building stocks; Thermal; Thermal comfort; building; climate change; performance assessment; residential location; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108075219

To that end, GIS was used to establish the spatial data for the rooftop PV installation, and an RL model was developed to maximize the economic profit of the rooftop PV installation in various locations and future scenarios. The developed model was applied to residential buildings in Nonhyeon district, South Korea to evaluate their economic profitability and to compare the model with the existing planning methods. With the use of the developed GIS-based RL model, the rooftop PV system became economically feasible, achieving average economic profit of 539,197 USD over all scenarios for all target buildings which was higher than that of the existing models by 4.4% and 4.3%. Furthermore, the developed model outperformed the existing models especially in volatile scenarios with lower solar radiation. Therefore, the use of the proposed GIS-based RL model can optimize the economic feasibility of rooftop PV systems for buildings, which will benefit building owners and community-level energy business owners. In conclusion, the developed model can promote the adoption of rooftop PV systems, which have 91.8% lower global warming potential than the Korean mixed grid, without additional subsidies to achieve Korea's national CO2 emission reduction plan. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic profitability; Geographic information system; PV planning; Reinforcement learning; Rooftop PV","Buildings; Emission control; Global warming; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Planning; Profitability; Reinforcement learning; Developed model; Economic profitability; Geographic information; Optimal planning; PV installations; PV planning; PV system; Reinforcement learning models; Reinforcement learnings; Rooftop PV; Geographic information systems; GIS; global warming; learning; photovoltaic system; planning method; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107885682

Flows were adjusted to realize the same overall production of syngas. Detailed electrochemical characterization was performed before, during and after the aging test and microstructural changes after aging were investigated.

This study evaluated the vulnerability of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to climate change for 2050 to 2079 in Maine, U.S.A., and the potential of changing variety and planting date as climate adaptation strategies. The DSSAT model v4.7 was calibrated and evaluated for contrasting varieties of potato (Atlantic, a mid-season variety, and Russet Burbank, a late-season variety) and barley (Robust, a 6-row feed variety, and Newdale, a 2-row malting variety) using 99 field experiments conducted in Maine. The model accurately simulated observed final yield for each variety with modeling efficiencies (EF) ranging from 0.60 to 0.84 and coefficients of determination (r2) above 0.98. Climate change simulations compared crop yield across multiple planting dates for one baseline period (1989-2018) and four future climate scenarios (two emissions scenarios, RCP 6.0 and 8.5, with and without elevated CO2). In the absence of elevated CO2, yield of the potato variety Atlantic, and both barley varieties declined by 6 to 27% under elevated temperature and precipitation, but increased by 5% for the potato variety Russet Burbank. However, under future climate conditions and elevated CO2, yield of all potato and barley varieties increased or were unchanged. Optimal planting date for each variety was consistent across climate scenarios. These results suggest that climate change may favor longer-season varieties such as Russet Burbank, but adjusting planting date may not be an effective climate change adaptation strategy in this region. Elevated CO2 boosted crop growth and development across all varieties for a humid continental climate and for the time period studied.

However, because China has one of the largest economies in the world, to achieve its targeted carbon neutrality, the roles of foreign direct investment (FDI), technological innovation (TI), and trade are crucial. Therefore, this study aims to introduce the level of trade, renewable energy consumption (REC), and FDI from the years 1995–2017 as new determinants in promoting a sustainable environment in China. The study employs advanced panel methods based on slope homogeneity and a cross-sectional dependence test. The results confirm a cointegration relationship for all models in this study, suggesting that gross domestic product and FDI positively affect carbon emissions. By contrast, foreign trade, REC, and TI are inversely associated with carbon emissions. Moreover, according to Chinese provincial data, the joint term for FDI with REC and TI is negatively associated with carbon emissions. The policy implications of this study suggest that to achieve sustainable FDI, TI should be encouraged to mitigate the pollution caused by FDI.

However, there are still many impact assessment studies in different regions that consider only CO2 emissions. We hypothesise that excluding non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, which are also liable in climate change policies, may lead to misleading results and impacts. We employ a global climate change policy model (GTAP-E-PowerS) to examine how the impact of a uniform carbon tax at US$15 applying to the world regions are different when only CO2 emissions are liable compared to the case that non-CO2 emissions are additionally subject to the tax. That is, the impacts of the carbon tax applying to CO2 emissions only (against no carbon tax) will be compared to the impacts of such a tax applying to both CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions (against no carbon tax). Results show the deviations in the impacts between with and without inclusion of non-CO2 emissions are more obvious in developing countries particularly by comparison to developed nations. Iran, for instance, experiences a higher reduction in real GDP of 1.52 percentage points when non-CO2 emissions are overlooked. These impact deviations also rise with increased costs to economies (e.g., more sectors involved or higher tax rates). We find developing countries experience higher contraction rates in their economies than developed nations. Iran, Kazakhstan, South Africa, China, India, Russia, Mexico, and Indonesia all experience 2–5.1% reductions in real GDP relative to business-as-usual (no carbon tax), while such reductions are below 0.8% in Australia, the United States and other developed nations because emission costs compared to economy size are relatively high in developing nations. Major polluting countries like China, the United States, India, and Russia were also found to have low marginal abatement costs compared to other nations due to high emission levels and input substitution possibilities. To provide more accurate and insightful impacts of climate change policies, we recommend future studies include both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions in models. © 2021","Carbon tax; Climate change policy; Computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling; Emissions trading scheme (ETS); Greenhouse gas emissions; GTAP-E-PowerS","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Taxation; % reductions; Carbon taxes; Climate change policies; CO$-2$/ emission; Comparative analysis; Computable general equilibrium model; Emission trading scheme; Greenhouse gas emissions; GTAP-E-power; Impact assessments; Emission control; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; comparative study; emission control; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; pollution tax; Australia; China; India; Indonesia; Iran; Kazakhstan; Mexico [North America]; South Africa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107724393

We utilized the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) ResStock tool to develop geographically representative housing stock models and the physics-based EnergyPlus modeling software to create an aggregate building stock energy model that represents the residential sector in the ERCOT operating region. In this aggregate building energy model, we replace all natural gas and other fossil-fuel furnaces with reversible electric heat pumps of varying efficiencies that can provide heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. We integrate spatially-resolved actual meteorological weather data with the building stock energy model to simulate a specific year (2016) of hourly-resolved energy usage in the ERCOT region. We find the annual electricity consumption, peak hourly power demand for each day, and load duration curves for each of 17 regions within ERCOT. From the base case, the absolute winter peak electrical power demand in the residential sector could increase by as much as 36%, or 12 GW. These results indicate that grid capacity would need to increase by 10 GW (a 25% increase for the residential sector) to accommodate a winter peaking residential sector. Though winter electricity consumption would increase for home heating, the annual amount of electricity consumption would stay roughly the same or decrease because the higher efficiency heat pumps provide more efficient cooling than the conventional air conditioners they also replace. Using average 2018 emissions rates, we estimate a change to standard efficiency heat pumps would lead to a 4.1% reduction of CO2 emissions and a 5.8% reduction of NOx emissions from the residential sector. There is no significant change in SOx emissions in our standard efficiency scenario, but in the high and ultra-high aggregate efficiency scenarios, SOx emissions are reduced by 8.3% and 15.0% respectively. © 2021","Building energy modeling; Electrification; ERCOT; Heat pumps; Peak demand; Spatial analysis","Aggregates; Air conditioning; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Fossil fuels; Heat pump systems; Heating; Pumps; Reliability analysis; Building energy model; Building stocks; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity-consumption; Energy modelling; Heat pumps; Peak demand; Power demands; Residential sectors; Spatial analysis; Housing; air conditioning; building; cooling; demand analysis; electrical power; electrification; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; heating; natural gas; nitrate; reduction; smart grid; software; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107721066

Continuous research has been conducted with the aim to further reduce the production cost by simplifying the production scheme, as well as enhancing the performance of mixed culture in PHA production. Selection of the carbon feedstock and enrichment strategies needs to be essentially considered to obtain a culture enriched with PHA accumulators for a stable PHA production. Most of the studies implementing mixed culture process applied the feast-famine regime with periodical supply of carbon for culture enrichment. Results have revealed that the enriched culture showed a comparable performance with pure culture, in terms of PHA content (30–80%) and yield (0.4–0.8 g PHA/g S). However, a low productivity is the hindering factor to produce PHA at industrial scale by using mixed culture, which could be overcome by improvising the enrichment strategies. This review zooms into the evaluation of two step and three step processes in PHA production by utilising different feedstocks. Critical parameters to be considered for PHA production such as the suitable feedstocks, enrichment conditions, stability of the enriched culture and nutrient supplementation are being highlighted.

Although there are many controversies about climate change, the temperature rise has become more and more obvious in the world since the 1990s. It is worthwhile to understand whether the public supports the government's policy on climate change and how public support affects climate change. A case study of the first-tier cities in China is done to explore these questions through questionnaire surveys. 3468 valid questionnaires from four first-tier cities in China were screened out are used for individual behavior analysis. The results show that the respondents' perceptions towards climate change in China are laxer than those in other countries, meanwhile, they hope that the government would respond to climate change actively. The influencing factors mainly include the demographic characteristics and their perception of climate change. Demographic characteristics are about gender, income, marital status, age, and whether they have children. Moreover, respondents' perception of climate change has a significant impact on their attitudes towards the government's policies for mitigating climate change. The conclusions are drawn based on the comparative analysis of the survey results and suggestions are put forward for making climate change policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Climate change; Government's policy; Public perception; Survey","climate change; environmental issue; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis; article; behavioral science; child; China; city; climate change; demography; female; gender; government; human; human experiment; male; marriage; perception; questionnaire; China; policy; China; Child; China; Cities; Climate Change; Government; Humans; Policy; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107696355

However, their climate regulating function is at risk by land-use conversion for agricultural purposes. In sub-Saharan Africa, studies investigating the effect of land-use change in wetlands and associated soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain limited. Moreover, the influence of season in GHG emissions with land-use change has hardly been studied. Therefore, we investigated methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a Kenyan wetland and adjacent areas converted to farmland during the dry and rainy seasons. Moreover, we assessed which soil parameters drive the variations in GHG emissions. The GHG samples were collected by the static chamber method and analyzed by gas chromatography. For data analysis, we employed an explorative-statistical approach to explain the emission rates' variation and determine which parameters influence the GHG emissions, both as main and interaction effects. The results showed that regardless of the season, there were CH4 emissions (&gt;0.50 mg m−2 h−1) from the wetland when soil organic carbon content was high and uptake (&lt;0.001 mg m−2 h−1) when both soil organic carbon content and soil moisture were low. In the farmland, there was CH4 uptake when soil nitrate‑nitrogen content was high. CO2 emissions did not vary significantly between the land-use types. Instead, emission rates were primarily governed by season. The highest emissions (&gt;175 mg m−2 h−1) during the dry season were attributed to high soil organic carbon content. During the rainy season, emissions hardly exceeded 175 mg m−2 h−1. Regarding N2O, we detected the highest emissions (&gt;5 μg m−2 h−1) from the farmland during the dry season. Overall, this study shows that wetland conversion to farmland encourages CH4 uptake regardless of the season and increases N2O emissions during the dry season. Based on the respective GHG global warming potential, these patterns may pose an increased environmental threat. © 2021 The Authors","Afrotropical region; Classification and regression tree (CRT); Configuration frequency analysis; East Africa; Heuristic methods; Papyrus","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Drought; Farms; Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Heuristic methods; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Wetlands; Afrotropical region; CH$-4$; Classification and regression tree; Configuration frequency analyse; Dry seasons; East Africa; Greenhouse gas emissions; Landuse change; N$-2$/O; Papyrus; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; unclassified drug; Afrotropical Region; carbon dioxide; classification; frequency analysis; greenhouse gas; land use change; methane; nitrous oxide; regression analysis; soil emission; tropical environment; wetland; agricultural land; Article; bootstrapping; carbon footprint; climate change; decision tree; gas chromatography; greenhouse effect; Kenyan; land use; seasonal variation; soil moisture; wetland; East Africa; Cyperus papyrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107689733

Achieving this goal will require actions across all economic sectors, especially the building sector, which currently accounts for 40% of energy use. Residential energy use is a significant contributor, much of it due to an aging, poorly insulated building stock, much of which is concentrated in urban neighbourhoods. This research focusses on the application of an Urban Building Energy Model (UBEM) to support the Green Deal and the planned ‘renovation wave’. An archetype approach is used to efficiently derive the building data needed to run the Urban Modelling Interface (UMI) to test the efficacy of energy retrofitting policies for neighbourhoods, using a case-study area of 9,000 residential buildings in a European city. Initially, UMI simulations of energy use intensity are evaluated against reported energy performance certificate data in the study area. The UBEM is then used to quantify the most cost-effective mix of envelope retrofit and onsite energy production to achieve a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The methodology shown here is based on residential building archetypes that are available for many EU countries and the method outlined can be replicated in other urban settings. © 2021 The Authors","Building archetypes; European green deal; Renovation wave; Urban building energy model (UBEM)","Cost effectiveness; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Building archetype; Building energy model; Case-studies; Energy use; European green deal; European union; Renovation wave; Urban building energy model; Urban buildings; Urban model; Retrofitting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107683131

This study evaluates the environmental and financial viability of producing ethanol from autoclaved MSW via fermentation. Experimental screening of four different microorganisms (i.e., S. cerevisiae, Z. mobilis, E. coli, and S. pombe) and process modelling indicate that MSW-derived ethanol can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline (84% reduction following EU Renewable Energy Directive accounting methodology, and by 156–231% reduction following the US Energy Independence and Security Act methodology). Utilisation of wastes for biofuel production in the UK benefits from policy support and financial support for renewable fuels (Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates). Financial analysis highlights that microorganisms achieving higher ethanol yield and productivity (S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis) can achieve financial viability with higher cumulative net present value than E. coli, S. pombe. However, the positive net present value can be achieved primarily due to the benefit of gate fees received by diverting wastes to autoclave and ethanol production (64% of total revenues), rather than from revenues from ethanol sales (7% of total revenues). Key process improvements must be achieved to improve the financial viability of ethanol production from MSW and deliver a clear advantage over waste incineration, specifically improving hydrolysis yield, reducing enzyme loading rate and, to a lesser extent, increasing solid loading rate. The results provide significant insights into the role of policy and technology development to achieve viable waste-to-biofuel systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ethanol; Fermentation; Incineration; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Techno-economic analysis; Waste autoclaving","Bioethanol; Economic analysis; Escherichia coli; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Supply chains; Waste incineration; % reductions; Bio-ethanols; E. coli; Ethanol production; Financial viability; S.cerevisiae; Techno-Economic analysis; The net present value (NPV); Total revenue; Waste autoclaving; Ethanol; enzyme activity; ethanol; fermentation; financial market; greenhouse gas; hydrolysis; municipal solid waste; Escherichia coli; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Schizosaccharomyces pombe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107648771

In this study, an effective green technology to reduce methane emissions was proposed by introducing Mn-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (Mn-AOM) and microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology into constructed wetland (CW). The results indicate that the combination of biological methods and bioelectrochemical methods can more effectively control the methane emission from CW than the reported methods. The role of dissimilated metal reduction in methane control in CW and the biochemical process associated with Mn-AOM were also investigated. The results demonstrated that using Mn ore as the matrix and operating MFC effectively reduced methane emissions from CW, and higher COD removal rate was obtained in CW-MFC (Mn) during the 200 days of operation. Methane emission from CW-MFC (Mn) (53.76 mg/m2/h) was 55.61% lower than that of CW (121.12 mg/m2/h). The highest COD removal rate (99.85%) in CW-MFC (Mn) was obtained. As the dissimilative metal-reducing microorganisms, Geobacter (5.10%) was found enriched in CW-MFC (Mn). The results also showed that the presence of Mn ore was beneficial to the biodiversity of CW-MFCs and the growth of electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) including Proteobacteria (35.32%), Actinobacteria (2.38%) and Acidobacteria (2.06%), while the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanobacterium was effectively inhibited.

This study evaluated road freight emissions from supply chain perspective using China's 2007, 2010 and 2012 multiregional input-output table. For the first time, we quantified road freight emission based on sectors in China. Heavy industries, mining, agriculture and light industry contributed 71%,14%, 12% and 3% of total NOx emissions in 2012 from production perspective. Construction was the largest consumption sector (43%) responsible for road freight emission from consumption perspective. Upstream transport and final product transport emitted 3.04 Tg (80%) and 0.77 Tg (20%) NOx in 2012. Huge disparities of road freight emissions flows and allocation patterns were found across provinces in China in terms of resource endowments, geographical position and economic development. The road freight emission increased rapidly from 2007 to 2012, and economic growth effect outpaced emission control effect caused by emission standard upgrade and thus dominated the emission growth. The production structure and consumption pattern changes also promoted the emission growth. It is thus important to mitigate freight emissions with different strategies based on a certain sector's freight emissions features from the whole supply chain. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Driving force; Input-output analysis; Road freight emission; Supply chain","Economic and social effects; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Deepwater; Driving forces; Emission growth; Emissions management; Heavy industries; Input-output table; Input/Output analysis; Road freight emission; Road freights; Water zone; Supply chains; freight transport; input-output analysis; nitrogen oxides; quantitative analysis; supply chain management; traffic emission; agriculture; air pollution control; article; China; economic development; mining; China; economic development; industry; China; China; Economic Development; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107602126

The Blue Sky Protection Campaign (BSPC) has been implemented in 2018 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) area to control air pollution. This study assesses PM2.5-related health and economic benefits of the BSPC in the BTH region. Results show that by 2020, PM2.5 reduction can avoid 3561 thousand morbidity cases (equivalent to a 24% reduction in the 2020 baseline scenario) and 24 thousand premature deaths (12%) in the BTH region, with the majority benefit in Hebei. By 2030, the avoided morbidity and mortality cases will be 2943 (18%) thousand and 20 (9%) thousand, respectively. PM2.5 reductions are highly effective in reducing work time loss, which will decrease the total annual work time by 1.7 × 108 h (24%) in the BTH region by 2020. From the economic aspect, the reduced PM2.5 concentration will save 30 million USD (25%) health expenditures and avoid 60 billion USD (13%) economic loss by using the value of statistical life (VSL) by 2020. In 2030, the health expenditures and economic loss will also decrease significantly, with 17 million USD (18%) and 63 billion USD (10%), respectively, in the BTH region. Besides, the economic benefits far exceed the policy costs of the BSPC, and the Δ benefit/Δ cost ratios of Beijing are significantly higher than those of Hebei.

To realize maximum benefits and minimize environmental pollution, the eco-efficiency of cultivated land utilization (ECLU) is becoming a vital indicator in weighing the rationality of regional land use. However, conceptualization of the ECLU remains lacking, while assessments of this indicator are still incomplete. This lack of information may inhibit planning guideline for the sustainable development of cultivated land resources. Thus, this study attempts to fill this gap by customizing a new conceptual index system for the ECLU and measuring it using the slack-based measure with undesirable output (SBM-Undesirable) model in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) during the period 2001–2018. Spatial econometric models were used to further analyze the influencing factors of the ECLU. The average ECLU value in the YREB declined from 2001 to 2004, and then rapidly trended upward in 2005–2018. The lower reaches had the highest efficiency, followed by the middle and upper reaches, with respective values of 0.494, 0.628, and 0.683. The spatial–temporal pattern of the ECLU reveals that the number of areas with low and medium-low efficiency decreased gradually, while the number of areas with medium-high and high efficiency increased continuously. The magnitude and direction of influencing factors indicates that socioeconomic development level, agricultural science and technology investments, carbon emission reducing, and agricultural pollution control could effectively improve the ECLU. These findings have important implications for promoting high-efficient, low-carbon utilization of cultivated land resources and sustainable regional development in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-efficiency of cultivated land utilization; Low-carbon development; SBM-Undesirable model; Sustainable land use; Yangtze River Economic Belt","carbon; carbon emission; conceptual framework; cultivation; econometrics; food security; guideline; land use; socioeconomic conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; sustainable development; urbanization; Article; carbon utilization; China; cultivated land; investment; land use; pollution control; river; socioeconomics; sustainable development; economic development; urbanization; China; Yangtze River; Indicator indicator; China; Economic Development; Rivers; Sustainable Development; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107548265

The local district heating operator is producing a major share of Espoo's heat demand with combined heat and power units, but a large share of that thermal capacity will be closed by 2025. The plan is to replace the closed down capacity with renewable fuels, heat pumps and waste heat utilisation. The goal of this paper is to simulate the impacts of these emission reductive acts on the production costs and CO2 emissions of the system. The possibility of utilising waste heat from data centres in the district heating system is evaluated. The results show that abandoning coal in the city's heating system leads to a significant reduction of CO2 emissions with a small increase of annual production costs. Waste heat enables emission reductions even further, and the increase of production costs can be prevented. © 2021 The Author(s)","Combined heat and power; District heating; Emission reduction; Energy cost; Heat pump; Renewable fuels","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Cost reduction; Emission control; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Temperature; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; CO$-2$/ emission; Combined-Heat and Power; District heating system; Emission reduction; Energy cost; Heat demands; Heat pumps; Low-temperature waste heats; Production cost; Renewable fuels; District heating; abandoned land; abandoned mine; coal mine; combined heat and power; cost analysis; emission control; heating; low temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; Espoo; Finland; Uusimaa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107393404

In order to further test the effectiveness of the daily penalty policy in pollution control and emission reduction, this study evaluates the policy through the time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) method using data from Chinese industrial firms from 2003 to 2012. The results show that the daily penalty policy significantly reduced industrial SO2 emissions, which is supported by a series of robustness tests. Further mechanistic tests found that the daily penalty policy can reduce emissions by promoting the use of clean energy at the front-end prevention and increasing pollution control equipment and product innovation at end-governance. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the daily penalty policy has a significant emission reduction effect on low energy consumption firms, large-scale firms and firms in clean industry. The SO2 emission of foreign-funded firms is more reduced than that of state-owned and private firms. In addition, the level of emission reduction by exporting firms and firms in a mature recession are more affected by this policy. This study validates the effect of the daily penalty policy on emission reduction of firms. We found that the stringent command-and-control environmental regulations can also effectively encourage firms to control pollution and promote the transformation of firms toward long-term green development strategies and energy-saving and emission-reducing production patterns, and achieve a reasonable combination with market-based incentive environmental regulations. It provides new ideas and inspiration for implementation and improvement of the daily penalty policy and the strategic deployment of environmental governance in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Daily penalty policy; Emission reduction effect; Environmental regulation; Time-varying DID","emission control; environmental protection; firm size; pollution control; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; state owned enterprise; article; China; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; energy conservation; energy consumption; incentive; pollution control; punishment; environmental policy; environmental protection; industry; policy; China; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Industry; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107271354

In this study, we characterize the impact of the lockdown associated with the pandemic on air quality in six major cities across the state of Florida, namely: Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami. Hourly measurements of PM2.5, ozone, NO2, SO2, and CO were provided by the US EPA at thirty sites operated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection during mid-February to mid-April from 2015 through 2020. To analyze the effect of the pandemic, atmospheric pollutant concentrations in 2020 were compared to historic data at these cities during the same period from 2015 to 2019. Reductions in NO2 and CO levels were observed across the state in most cities and were attributed to restrictions in mobility and the decrease in vehicle usage amid the lockdown. Likewise, decreases in O3 concentrations were observed and were related to the prevailing NOx-limited regime during this time period. Changes in concentrations of SO2 exhibited spatial variations, concentrations decreased in northern cities, however an increase was observed in central and southern cities, likely due to increased power generation at facilities primarily in the central and southern regions of the state. PM2.5 levels varied temporally during the study and were positively correlated with SO2 concentrations during the lockdown. In March, reductions in PM2.5 levels were observed, however elevations in PM2.5 concentrations in April were attributed to long-range transport of pollutants rather than local emissions. This study provides further insight into the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on anthropogenic sources from vehicular emissions and power generation in Florida.

Reflectance-based techniques have been widely used for decades, but detection of fluorescence emission by chlorophyll has emerged as a promising alternative in recent years. Although passive sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) monitoring has shown interesting results, the information it provides is limited to few wavelengths (Fraunhofer and telluric lines). On the other hand, active measurements of steady-state fluorescence and its spectral distribution cover the full-emission spectrum but have not been fully explored due to obvious experimental limitations. In this work we develop a novel active fluorescence measurement procedure, based on lamps and sensors mounted on a field tractor. This technique allowed the detection of the full spectrum of fluorescence emission of a plant crop for the first time in the literature. The main objective of this work was to analyze how the information based on reflectance and fluorescence, recorded by the new proposed methodology, tracks the differences caused by different irrigation treatments in the ANPP of three soybean varieties. We observed that reflectance-based vegetation indices showed limited sensitivity to these cumulative differences, as only EVI2, NDWI and SRWI were able to distinguish between rainfed and irrigation treatments in some few cases. Passive, irradiance-normalised SIF showed this same trend, but active fluorescence peak ratio (FRed/FFar-red) revealed statistically significant differences for the three cultivars studied. In addition, the latter showed a significant correlation with ANPP for two soybean varieties after correction for light re-absorption and scattering (p &lt; 0.05, R2 &gt; 0.5), which was observed for only EVI and foliar water status VIs among passive indicators. Active fluorescence measurements at leaf level by PAM fluorometry did not show differences between treatments in the upper part of the canopy but revealed a biomass-dependent decrease in PSII yield along the vertical axis. Our study demonstrated that fluorescence emission spectrum holds highly valuable information that might allow monitoring ANPP changes upon irrigation from remote sensing applications, and therefore should be carefully studied. Lastly, it highlights the potential of SIF retrieval at both O2-A and O2-B lines. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Canopy active fluorescence; Fluorescence modeling; Irrigation; Plant monitoring; Remote sensing","artificial neural network; canopy; environmental monitoring; fluorescence; irrigation; net primary production; precision agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; soybean; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107151112

Coal seams are promising CO2 geological storage sites due to their high surface area and wide geographical spread. In this study, a fast and reliable methodology is proposed to assess the CO2 storage capacity of coal seams. The methodology provides a model considering gas flow within multiple radial hydraulic fractures (MRHF) connected to depleted well, gas transport in natural fractures, diffusion in coal seam matrix, and adsorption onto matrix surface. Using Stehfest numerical inversion technology and Gauss elimination method, the semi-analytical solution for bottom-hole pressure (BHP) is obtained based on the derived continuous line-source function in coal seams. Following that, a case study regarding the CO2 storage capacity of a coal seam in Wyoming is conducted, which shows that CO2 storage capacity in the coal seam reaches 4.8 × 108 m3. In addition, the sensitive analyses of the reservoir and engineering parameters on CO2 storage capacity are also investigated. The findings confirm that, on the one hand, higher constrained injection pressure (CIP) results in larger CO2 storage capacity. On the other hand, among these key parameters, hydraulic fracture length exhibits the most apparent effects on CO2 storage capacity whereas the impacts of skin factor and stress sensitivity are insignificant. To be more specific, CO2 storage capacity increases almost 7.5 times when the hydraulic fracture length increases 3 times when CIP = 3.5 MPa whereas CO2 storage capacity slightly increases by approximately 4.5% from permeability modulus = 0.0125 to 0.05 for the identical CIP. The methodology provided in this study lays the foundation of highly efficient CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 storage capacity; Coal seams; Multiple transport mechanisms; Transient pressure response","Coal; Coal deposits; Coal storage; Flow of gases; Fracture; Geology; Numerical methods; Case-studies; CO2 storage capacity; Coal seams; Fracture length; Geological storage; Injection pressures; matrix; Multiple transport mechanism; Storage capacity; Transient pressure response; Carbon dioxide; adsorption; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; coal seam; diffusion; fluid injection; gas flow; gas transport; hydraulic fracturing; inverse analysis; permeability; radiocarbon dating; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107149020

A CGE-based multi-dimensional carbon policy (CMDCP) model is developed to i) explore the inter-provincial interdependences by interfering with the economic policies of a single province, and ii) quantify interactive relationships among various components including climate, energy, carbon economy and tax. Integrated approach of computable general equilibrium model and input-output analysis is applied to a series of segmented carbon tax schemes for Guangdong IC modeling and China IE modeling. It is found that when the carbon tax rate is 100 yuan/ton, the GDP of Guangdong will fall by less than 0.5% under three scenario types. At the same time, they could bring 1.3, 1.2 and 1.6 million tons of emission reductions. Levying the carbon tax based on the difference in carbon emission volume is most beneficial for emission intensity reduction. For China, the impact of the segmented carbon tax in specific province has a slight impact on the entire supply chain emissions. It is suggested that a carbon tax of 10–40 yuan/ton could be adopted by Guangdong. Moreover, Guangdong could consider implementing the stepped carbon tax for it can effectively avoid the lack of flexibility of traditional carbon tax policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; China; Computable general equilibrium model; Input-output analysis; Structural path analysis","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Economic analysis; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; China; Computable general equilibrium model; Guangdong Province; Input/Output analysis; National economy; Regional economy; Structural path analyse; Tax policies; Emission control; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; environmental economics; national economy; policy implementation; pollution policy; pollution tax; regional economy; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107137203

We model multiple future scenarios and assess the impacts on energy security, flexibility provision, economic performance, and emissions. In the case of Helsinki, heat only boiler is a robust solution from economic and climate perspective, but reduces local electricity self-sufficiency. Combined heat and power solution is more valuable investment for the system than for the city indicating a conflict of interest and biased results in system level models. Bringing a biorefinery near the city to utilize excess heat would reduce emissions and increase investment's profitability, but biomass availability might be a bigger limiting factor.

Novel option to boost biorefinery's production with hydrogen from excess electricity is beneficial with increasing shares of wind power. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bioenergy; District heating; Energy system; Energy system modelling; Impact assessment","Cooling systems; District heating; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen production; Investments; Refining; Wind power; Bio-energy; Biorefineries; District heating and cooling systems; Energy system modelling; Energy systems; Impact assessments; Power; System levels; System supply; Technology options; Biomass; bioenergy; combined heat and power; energy market; fossil fuel; heating; hydrogen; investment; limiting factor; profitability; Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107134584

It covers nineteen (January 2002-December 2020) years of NO radiative emission data in the altitude region of 100–155 km. The NO volume emission rate (VER) shows a strong local-time variation with maximum and minimum, respectively, during local-noon and local-midnight. The peak altitude of NO VER decreases by about 18 km from the midnight to the lowest altitude of 117 km at noon. The mean NO VER also undergoes a significant change between the day and night. The mean daytime NO VER is more than double the night-time counterpart. The seasonal variation of peak NO VER shows a maximum during the month of December and a minimum during March. The peak altitude is maximum during September and minimum during June unlike the peak NO VER. The lowest peak altitude, maximum VER and maximum intensity are observed during winter. The relative change in NO VER between the winter and the summer seasons, peaks around 116 km, increases with altitude above 108 km. The long-term trend of NO VER/intensity shows a clear solar cycle variation with higher values during the higher solar activity periods. The NO intensity exhibits a strong correlation with sunspot number (SSN), F10.7 solar index and Lyman-α during both 23rd and 24th solar cycles, although the peak VER does not coincide with the peak SSN. © 2021 COSPAR","Indian longitude; Nitric Oxide Radiative Emission; TIMED-SABER satellite observation","NASA; Nitric oxide; Solar energy; Emissions rates; Indian longitude; Local time; Nitric oxide radiative emission; Radiative emissions; Seasonal cycle; Solar cycle variations; Sunspot number; Thermosphere ionosphere mesosphere energetic dynamic-sounding of the atmosphere using broadband emission radiometry satellite observation; Time cycles; Ionosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107131697

Although AWE has been developed over recent decades, both the capital and operational costs of AWE are still so high that hydrogen produced from AWE is economically less competitive compared with other hydrogen production technologies such as methane steam reforming. To reduce the operational cost of AWE hydrogen production, the AWE operations need to be optimized. In this study, to capture the temperature effect on the AWE system performance, AWE system model developed in our previous work has been simulated by varying the operating temperature. The simulation results present that higher operating temperature increases the system efficiency only in the relatively high current density region. The electrolyte flow rate required to maintain the temperature gradient throughout the AWE stack has been modeled as a polynomial equation based on the temperature and current density. When the temperature gradient throughout the AWE stack is reduced, the system efficiency is substantially increased. The model developed in this study can be used to find the optimal configuration and operating condition of the AWE system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alkaline water electrolysis system; Green hydrogen production; Numerical modeling; System optimization; Temperature effect","Costs; Efficiency; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Hydrogen production; Polynomials; Thermal effects; Thermal gradients; Alkaline water electrolyse system; Alkaline water electrolysis; Electrolysis systems; Green hydrogen production; Numerical modeling and analysis; Performance; System efficiency; System optimizations; Temperature effect; Water electrolysis; Numerical models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107128089

Amending the soil with biochar can potentially reduce N2O emissions and alleviate soil acidification. To assess the multi-year effects of wheat straw-derived biochar on N2O emissions and tea yield in tea fields, a three-year (2014–2016) field trial following the wheat straw-derived biochar addition was conducted in a tea plantation in southern China under three treatments, namely, conventional treatment (CON, application of conventional organic-chemical fertilizer without biochar), and treatments with conventional organic-chemical fertilizer + straw-derived biochar addition at 10 t ha−1 (BC10) and 40 t ha−1 (BC40) applied once at the beginning of the experiment. Compared to BC10 treatment, the annual total N2O emissions of BC40 were increased by 32.0–46.2% in 2015 and 2016 (p ＜ 0.05) while no significant difference was found between BC10 and CON (p = 0.32–0.97), and N2O emissions of BC10 showed a declined trend during the three years. An increase in tea yield of 24.2–26.0% (p ＜ 0.05) was also observed in BC10 treatment in 2015 and 2016 relative to CON. Differences between treatments in NH4+-N were mostly significant (p ＜ 0.05) but not in NO3--N and DOC (p = 0.16–0.81). The BC40 treatment significantly raised soil pH relative to the CON (p &lt; 0.05). Our collective data indicated that N2O fluxes were positively correlated with the abundance of nirK-denitrification gene during the tea-growing season (p ＜0.05). Long-term impact of straw-derived biochar amendment on N2O was inconsistent with previous short-term biochar studies in tea field soil. Our results indicated that wheat straw-derived biochar amendment at a low rate (BC10) into tea field soil is more feasible for reducing yield-scale N2O emissions in the studied tea field system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar amendment; N2O emissions; Tea field","acidification; agricultural land; agricultural soil; biochar; experimental study; fertilizer application; nitrous oxide; plantation; soil amendment; soil emission; straw; subtropical region; tea; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107079001

However, no studies have investigated soil greenhouse gas (GHGs: CO2, N2O and CH4) fluxes from these plantations and how they relate to other land cover types. We examined GHG fluxes (Fs) in a sisal chronosequence at Teita Sisal Estate in southern Kenya. The effects of stand age on Fs were examined using static GHG chambers and gas chromatography for a period of one year in seven stands: young stands aged 1–3 years, mature stands aged 7–8 years, and old stands aged 13–14 years. Adjacent bushland served as a control site representing the surrounding land use type. Mean CO₂ fluxes were highest in the oldest stand (56 ± 3 mg C m-2 h-1) and lowest in the 8-year old stand (38 ± 3 mg C m-2 h-1), which we attribute to difference in root respiration between the stand. All stands had 13–28% higher CO₂ fluxes than bushland (32 ± 3 mg C m-2 h-1). CO2 fluxes in the wet season were about 70% higher than dry season across all sites. They were influenced by soil water content (WS) and vegetation phenology. Mean N2O fluxes were very low (&lt;5 µg N m-2 h-1) in all sites due to low soil nitrogen (N) content. About 89% of CH4 fluxes were below the detection limit (LOD ± 0.02 mg C m-2 h-1). Our results imply that sisal plantations have higher soil CO2 emissions than the surrounding land use type, and the seasonal emissions were largely driven by WS and the vegetation status. Methane and nitrous oxide are of minor importance. Thus, soil GHG fluxes from sisal plantations are a minor contributor to agricultural GHG emissions in Kenya. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon dioxide (CO2); Land-use change, Static chamber; Methane (CH4); Nitrous oxide (N2O); Soil moisture; Sub-Saharan Africa","carbon flux; chronosequence; greenhouse gas; land cover; plantation; semiarid region; soil emission; Kenya; Agave sisalana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107037009

Identifying environmental drivers of albedo in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) helps to understand the role of the “third pole” in responding to environmental change and regulating regional climate. Based on remotely sensed data of albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), snow cover, and soil moisture, this study investigated the effects of land cover (i.e., vegetation, snow) and soil on albedo from the perspectives of spatial, temporal, and spectral (visible, near-infrared, and shortwave) changes of albedo. Generally, changes in shortwave (SW) albedo were primarily driven by changes in snow cover during the growing season (from May to September), predominantly in May and June. The NDVI had larger contributions to visible (VIS) albedo change and was identified as the foremost important driver for VIS albedo in July and August. The correlations between the near-infrared (NIR) albedo and NDVI were positive in the mid- and late growing season in eastern TP. Soil moisture was negatively correlated with albedo throughout the growing season and was identified as the foremost important driver in August. The NIR albedo was more susceptible than the VIS albedo to changes in soil moisture. The correlations between NDVI and albedo varied across different categories of aridity caused by changing correlations between NIR albedo and NDVI along the aridity gradients, and consequently the VIS and NIR albedo counterbalance can further limit the contributions of vegetation greenness on SW albedo in sub-humid and humid region. Our findings are expected to improve understandings of energy budget simulations over TP region in land surface models. © 2021","Albedo; Aridity; Climate change; Grassland; NDVI; Snow cover; Soil moisture","energy budget; environmental change; growing season; land cover; land surface; NDVI; snow cover; surface energy; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106895857

Although reservoirs buffer natural hydrologic variability, severe droughts can deplete storage below critical thresholds, or to levels at which the effluent water temperature exceeds the environmental compliance requirement for cooling. This study explores the effects of projected climate change and drought on water storage at 30 major reservoirs in Texas. These reservoirs collectively provide cooling water for about two thirds of thermoelectric power capacity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power grid. Multi-ensemble runoff projections generated from eleven downscaled hydroclimate simulations are mapped to key watersheds to create spatially correlated multi-reservoir inflow sequences. These data are used to drive reservoir storage simulations, which are linked to a metric of “capacity-at-risk” using critical reservoir thresholds. We find that projected impacts of climate change are mixed, with results indicating an increase in the occurrence of thermal disruption under only half of climate models. A critical threshold of 30% storage volume—applied to all reservoirs—results in disruption to about one fifth of ERCOT thermal generation during the most severe projected droughts. The study highlights an important role for detailed reservoir behavior simulations for capturing the effects of drought and climate change on thermoelectric plant performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Drought; ERCOT; Power grid; Reservoir; Thermoelectric; Water","Climate change; Climate models; Cooling water; Drought; Effluents; Critical threshold; Effluent waters; Electric reliability council of texas; Multi reservoir; Multipurpose reservoirs; Power; Power grids; Reservoir models; Thermoelectric; Water temperatures; Reservoirs (water); climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; cooling water; drought; hydraulic property; numerical model; power plant; simulation; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106621383

Since other factors, such as weather conditions, local combustion sources and/or land surface characteristics may contribute to the variation of pollutant concentrations, we proposed two model formulations that allowed the differentiation between the variations in pollutant concentrations due to seasonality from the variations associated to the lockdown policies. The first model compares the changes in 2020, with the ones during the same period in the previous five years, by introducing an offset term, which controls for the long-term average concentrations of each pollutant during 2014–2019. The second approach models only the 2020 data, but adjusts for confounding factors. The results indicated that the latter can better capture the lockdown effect. The measures taken to tackle the virus in Europe reduced the average surface concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 by 29.5% (95% Bayesian credible interval: 28.1%, 30.9%) and 25.9% (23.6%, 28.1%), respectively. To our knowledge, this research is the first to account for the spatio-temporal correlation present in the monitoring data during the pandemic and to assess how it affects estimation of the lockdown effect while accounting for confounding. The proposed methodology improves our understanding of the effect of COVID-19 lockdown policies on the air pollution burden across the continent. © 2021","Air quality policy evaluation; Bayesian inference; Copernicus; Gaussian processes; NO2; PM2.5","Air quality; Economics; Inference engines; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Viruses; Air pollution exposures; Air quality policy evaluation; Bayesian; Bayesian inference; Copernicu; Gaussian Processes; NO $-2$; PM$-2.5$; Pollutant concentration; Spatio-temporal modelling; Bayesian networks; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; COVID-19; Gaussian method; nitrogen dioxide; numerical model; particulate matter; policy analysis; pollution exposure; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; air quality; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; Europe; lockdown; pandemic; particulate matter 2.5; pollution monitoring; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; Europe; Indicator indicator; SARS coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106348962

Particularly few data exist from the southern hemisphere and for Australia in particular, which contains ~24% of globally recognised tidal marsh extent. Here we estimate SAR and CAR over the last 70 years using 210Pb-based geochronologies in temperate estuarine tidal marsh ecosystems in southern Western Australia (WA). Specifically, we assessed tidal marsh ecosystems situated in two geomorphic settings (marine vs. fluvial deltas) within 10 wave-dominated, barrier estuaries. Overall, average SAR (1.1 ± 0.3 mm yr−1) and CAR (32 ± 9 g m−2 yr−1) estimates were 5-fold lower than global mean estimates. Furthermore, we showed that hotspots of soil organic carbon stocks are not indicative of current hotspots for CAR. The lack of significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in SAR, CAR, and excess 210Pb inventories between marine and fluvial settings can be explained by the high heterogeneity among and within estuaries throughout the region. The relative stability of recent and Holocene relative sea-levels in WA likely explains the limited CAR potential in tidal marshes under relatively stable sea-level conditions. However, further research exploring interactions among biotic and abiotic factors within estuaries is required to shed more light on the small spatial-scale variability in SAR and CAR across tidal marsh ecosystems in WA and elsewhere. This study provides baseline estimates for the inclusion of tidal marshes in national carbon inventories, identifies hotspots for the development of blue carbon projects, and supports the use of site-specific assessments opposed to regional means for estimating blue carbon resources. © 2021","Blue carbon; Climate change; Radioisotope; Saltmarsh; Sediment accumulation rate; Western Australia","Ecosystems; Estuaries; Geochronology; Organic carbon; Sea level; Soils; Wetlands; Accumulation rates; Blue carbon; Carbon accumulation; Hot spot; Marsh soils; Salt marshes; Sediment accumulation rate; Soil accumulations; Tidal marshes; Western Australia; Climate change; blue carbon; lead 210; organic carbon; unclassified drug; accumulation rate; carbon; climate change; estuarine environment; geoaccumulation; heterogeneity; intertidal environment; radionuclide; saltmarsh; sediment transport; soil organic matter; Article; Australia; carbon metabolism; comparative study; environmental temperature; freshwater environment; geomorphology; Holocene; marine environment; marsh; mathematical model; priority journal; sea level; soil analysis; tidal marsh; Australia; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106205999

Understanding their emission mechanisms and the current progress in emission measurements and estimations are essential for the accurate determination of emission characteristics, as well as for evaluating their roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate change. This review summarizes the mechanisms of terpenoid synthesis and release, biotic and abiotic factors affecting their emissions, development of emission observation techniques, and emission estimations from hundreds of published papers. We provide a review of the main observations and estimations in China, which contributes a significant proportion to the total global BVOC emissions. The review suggests the need for further research on the comprehensive effects of environmental factors on terpenoid emissions, especially soil moisture and nitrogen content, which should be quantified in emission models to improve the accuracy of estimation. In China, it is necessary to conduct more accurate measurements for local plants in different regions using the dynamic enclosure technique to establish an accurate local emission rate database for dominant tree species. This will help improve the accuracy of both national and global emission inventories.

A range extender is a generator that increases the mileage of EVs. The engine for a range extender operates in a steady state. Steady conditions are suitable for catalyst-based on-board fuel reforming operations. Hydrogen has unique properties that improve combustion performance, such as fast burning, short quenching distance, and increased flammability. We carried out experiments and analyses to improve the thermal efficiency of a range extender that uses catalyst-based on-board fuel reforming with steam addition. For this study, steam was generated from exhaust-waste heat. Based on a previous study, the power requirement for the range extender of a medium-sized city bus was calculated. Accordingly, the range extender was operated at a brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) of 10 bar and speed of 2000 rpm. The results indicate that reformed H2 has positive effects on the combustion performance and thermal efficiency of the range extender. Steam addition to the reformer improves the reforming performance and greatly influences the reduction in NOx emissions. Moreover, steam addition to the reformer leads to an increase in thermal efficiency. However, steam addition cannot affect the thermal efficiency as much as it affects the reforming performance. © 2021","On-board reformer; Range extender; Reformed hydrogen; SI engine; Steam addition; Thermal efficiency","Automotive industry; Catalysts; Efficiency; Engines; Fuels; Steam reforming; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Combustion performance; Fuel reforming; On-board fuels; On-board reformer; Range extenders; Reformed hydrogen; SI Engines; Steam addition; Thermal-efficiency; ]+ catalyst; Steam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105301954

Here we report the stimulation of methane emission in the cockroach Periplaneta americana and termite Coptotermes chaohuensis, insects with abundant methanogens, by neonicotinoids, insecticides widely used to control insect pests. Cycloxaprid (CYC) and imidacloprid (IMI) caused foregut expansion in P. americana, and increased the methane emission. Antibiotics mostly eliminated the effects. In P. americana guts, hydrogen levels increased and pH values decreased, which could be significantly explained by the gut bacterium community change. The proportion of several bacterium genera increased in guts following CYC treatment, and two genera from four could generate hydrogen. Hydrogen is a central intermediate in methanogenesis. All increased methanogens in both foregut and hindgut used hydrogen as electron donor to produce methane. Besides, the up-regulation of mcrA, encoding the enzyme for the final step of methanogenesis suggested the enhanced methane production ability in present methanogens. In the termite, hydrogen levels in gut and methane emission also significantly increased after neonicotinoid treatment, which was similar to the results in P. americana. In summary, neonicotinoids changed bacterium community in P. americana gut to generate more hydrogen, which then stimulated gut methanogens to produce and emit more methane. The finding raised a new concern over neonicotinoid applications, and might be a potential environmental risk associated with atmospheric methane. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Gut bacterium; Methane emission; Neonicotinoids; Periplaneta americana","Atmospheric chemistry; Hydrogen; Insecticides; Methane; Methanogens; Atmospheric methanes; Bacteria community; Gut bacteria; Hydrogen level; Insects pests; Methane emissions; Methanogenesis; Neonicotinoid insecticides; Neonicotinoids; Periplaneta americana; Bacteria; imidacloprid; methane; neonicotinoid; methane; neonicotinoid; cockroach; environmental risk; hydrogen; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; neonicotinoid pesticide; pollution effect; termite; anaerobic digestion; Article; atmospheric pressure; bioassay; chemical analysis; controlled study; environmental management; environmental monitoring; hydrogenation; insecticidal activity; intestine flora; intestine pressure; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; Periplaneta americana; pest control; pest resistance; population abundance; species diversity; animal; cockroach; Periplaneta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Blattaria; Coptotermes; Hexapoda; Isoptera; Periplaneta americana; Animals; Cockroaches; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Methane; Neonicotinoids; Periplaneta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105087026

Exposure data are particularly vital but may cause great uncertainty in health burden assessments. This study, for the first time, used six methods to generate the concentration data of PM2.5 and O3 in China between 2014 and 2018, and then quantified the changes in premature mortality due to PM2.5 and O3 using the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) model. The results show that PM2.5-related premature mortality in China decreases by 263 (95% confidence interval (CI95): 142–159) to 308 (CI95: 213–241) thousands from 2014 to 2018 by using different concentration data, while O3-related premature mortality increases by 67 (CI95: 26–104) to 103 (CI95: 40–163) thousands. The estimated mean changes are up to 40% different for the PM2.5-related mortality, and up to 30% for the O3-related mortality if different exposure data are chosen.

Yet, how plants respond physiologically and morphologically to these two combined stressors remains unknown. Here, we assessed particle retention dynamics and plant morphology and physiology of Euonymus japonicus Thunb. var. aurea-marginatus Hort. under continuous drought with severe exhaust exposure. Our results showed that continuous drought insignificantly lowered particle retention in each of three size fractions by 1.02 μg·cm−2 on average in the first 28 days, but significantly lowered total particle retention by 35.75 μg·cm−2 on the 35th day. We observed evident changes in morphology, leaf mass per area (LMA), pigments, gas exchange in all stressed plants. Compared with single stress, combined drought and pollution caused earlier yellowing and shedding of old leaves, significantly lowered LMA by 1.21 mg·cm−2, caused a greater decline in pigments and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). Large particles may mainly explain pigment reduction, lower weekly LMA increases, and stomatal restriction, while coarse particles may be the main drivers of the decline in Pn. Continuous drought mediated the influence of all three particle sizes on some parameters, such as weakening the impact of total particles on LMA, strengthening the impact of fine particles on photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that drought accelerates the physiological responses of plants to exhaust pollution. Under controlled severe exhaust pollution conditions, the optimal time to maintain high particle retention during continuous drought without decline in physiological conditions for E. japonicus var. aurea-marginatus was 14 days. Some additional interventions after 14 days (it could be postponed appropriately under field conditions) may help ensure healthy growth of plants and retention of particulate matter. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Colored-leaf plant; Combined stressors; Morphological response; Open-top chamber; Physiological response; Tolerance","Forestry; Gas plants; Morphology; Particles (particulate matter); Physiological models; Physiology; Plants (botany); Urban growth; Value engineering; Colored-leaf plant; Combined stressor; Ecological services; Leaf mass per area; Morphological response; Open top chambers; Particle retention; Particulate matter pollution; Physiological response; Plant growth; Drought; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; water; color; drought; exhaust emission; morphology; open-top chamber; particulate matter; physiological response; pollution exposure; air temperature; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; drought stress; environmental exposure; Euonymus; Euonymus japonicus; exhaust gas; gas exchange; nonhuman; particle size; particulate matter; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant leaf; plant physiology; plant structures; pollution; retention time; water holding capacity; water vapor; chemistry; drought; exhaust gas; toxicity; Euonymus japonicus; Droughts; Euonymus; Particulate Matter; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Vehicle Emissions; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104921324

However, phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) and denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms (DOHOs) outcompeting glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs) for carbon sources decreases total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal efficiency. This study proposed a novel side-stream sludge treatment strategy, i.e., through phosphorus famine, to selectively strengthen GAOs. Two sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were used, with one served as an anaerobic/aerobic/anoxic SBR (AOA-SBR) and the other as a side SBR. Side-stream phosphorus famine treatment was conducted three times during 140 days’ experiment, of which 20–30% of the sludge collected from the AOA-SBR was imposed to phosphorus famine condition in the side SBR for 4 days (24 cycles). Results showed that the average TIN and phosphorus removal efficiencies were 88.76% and 95.31%, and the average TIN and phosphorus in the effluent were 8.01 and 0.30 mg/L, respectively, treating low C/N (~3.25) municipal wastewater in the AOA-SBR. The relative abundance of PAOs decreased from 3.23% to 2.15% and that of DOHOs reduced by 62.78%. In contrast, the abundance of GAOs increased from 3.09% to18.25%, which should be the key reason for the improvement of the ED efficiency. Moreover, the enrichment of GAOs promoted ED simultaneously using glycogen and poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA) as carbon sources. The strategy of side-stream treatment proved the potential of rapid proliferation of GAOs while achieving improved nitrogen removal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Endogenous denitrification (ED); Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs); Low C/N sewage; Phosphorous accumulating organisms (PAOs); Phosphorous famine sludge treatment","Activated sludge process; Anoxic water; Batch reactors; Biology; Carbon; Efficiency; Effluents; Nitrogen removal; Phosphorus; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Carbon source; Endogenous denitrification; Glycogen accumulating organism; Glycogen accumulating organisms; Low COD/N sewage; Phosphorous accumulating organism; Phosphorous famine sludge treatment; Sequencing batch reactors; Side streams; Denitrification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104079728

The Badri field represents one of the most prolific oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Suez basin with a large cumulative production from the Miocene Belayim and Kareem Reservoirs. However, Middle Miocene Baba sandstones is still relatively underexplored when compared to other prolific producing reservoir intervals. Recent drilling data from the Badri field has renewed interest in this Member as a reservoir unit due to the lateral facies variations from shale to sandstones recognized in some wells. This study aims to investigate the structural and stratigraphic characterization and hydrocarbon potentiality of Serravalian Baba sandstones. An integrated mineralogical, sedimentological, petrophysical, and reservoir characterization analysis was conducted to obtain and evaluate information about the main reservoir characteristics of Baba sandstones using thin sections, wireline logs (i.e. Resistivity, Density-Neutron, Gamma-ray, and Sonic), and subsurface geologic mapping. Results support that Baba sandstones interval has good reservoir properties and high potentiality to produce hydrocarbon increasing the reserves in the studied area. Moreover, the entrapment style of Baba sandstones interval is due to the combined effect of stratigraphic and structural components.

The Qinling Mountain range is located in the transition zone between the temperate and subtropical ecosystems of central–east China and thus the vegetation of the area is diverse. Understanding the long-term interactions between plant diversity and climate change can potentially provide a reference for future landscape management and biodiversity conservation strategies in the Qinling Mountains region. Here, we use a pollen record from the Holocene sediments of Daye Lake, on Mount Taibai in the Qingling Mountains, to study regional vegetation changes based on biomes reconstruction and diversity analysis. Temperature and precipitation records from sites close to Daye Lake are used to provide environmental background to help determine the vegetation response to climate change. The results indicate that climate change was the main factor influencing vegetation and palynological diversity in the Qinling Mountains during the Holocene. The cold and dry climate at the beginning of the early Holocene (11,700–10,700 cal yr BP) resulted in a low abundance and uneven distribution of regional vegetation types, with the dominance of coniferous forest. During the early Holocene (10,700–7,000 cal yr BP), temperate deciduous broadleaf forest expanded, palynological diversity and evenness increased, indicating that the warm and humid climate promoted vegetation growth. In the middle Holocene (7,000–3,000 cal yr BP), the climate became slightly drier but a relatively warm environment supported the continued increase in palynological diversity. After ∼3,000 cal yr BP, palynological diversity and the evenness index commenced a decreasing trend, in agreement with the decreased temperature and precipitation in the Qinling Mountains. It’s noteworthy that human activity at this time had a potential influence on the vegetation. During the past few centuries, however, palynological diversity has increased along with the global temperature, and therefore it is possible that in the short-term ongoing climatic warming will promote vegetation development and palynological diversity in the area without human interference. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Cui, Huang, Wu and Zhou.","biomes; climate; palynological diversity; pollen; Qinling Mountain range",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115967557

Most NDCs include targets to mitigate national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which need quantifications to assess i.a. whether the current NDCs collectively put us on track to reach the PA temperature goals or the gap in ambition to do so. We implemented the new open-source tool ""NDCmitiQ""to quantify GHG mitigation targets defined in the NDCs for all countries with quantifiable targets on a disaggregated level and to create corresponding national and global emissions pathways. In light of the 5-year update cycle of NDCs and the global stocktake, the quantification of NDCs is an ongoing task for which NDCmitiQ can be used, as calculations can easily be updated upon submission of new NDCs. In this paper, we describe the methodologies behind NDCmitiQ and quantification challenges we encountered by addressing a wide range of aspects, including target types and the input data from within NDCs; external time series of national emissions, population, and GDP; uniform approach vs. country specifics; share of national emissions covered by NDCs; how to deal with the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) component and the conditionality of pledges; and establishing pathways from single-year targets. For use in NDCmitiQ, we furthermore construct an emissions data set from the baseline emissions provided in the NDCs. Example use cases show how the tool can help to analyse targets on a national, regional, or global scale and to quantify uncertainties caused by a lack of clarity in the NDCs. Results confirm that the conditionality of targets and assumptions about economic growth dominate uncertainty in mitigated emissions on a global scale, which are estimated as 48.9-56.1GtCO2eq.

A huge amount of NMVOC emissions from solvent use are complicated by a wide spectrum of sources and species. This work presents a long-term NMVOC emission inventory of solvent use during 2000-2017 in China. Based on a mass (material) balance method, NMVOC emissions were estimated for six categories, including coatings, adhesives, inks, pesticides, cleaners, and personal care products. The results show that NMVOC emissions from solvent use in China increased rapidly from 2000 to 2014 then kept stable after 2014. The total emission increased from 1.6 Tg (1.2-2.2 Tg at 95 % confidence interval) in 2000 to 10.6 Tg (7.7-14.9 Tg) in 2017. The substantial growth is driven by the large demand for solvent products in both industrial and residential activities. However, increasing treatment facilities in the solvent-related factories in China restrained the continued growth of solvent NMVOC emissions in recent years. Rapidly developing and heavily industrialized provinces such as Jiangsu, Shandong, and Guangdong contributed significantly to the solvent use emissions. Oxygenated VOCs, alkanes, and aromatics were the main components, accounting for 42 %, 28 %, and 21 % of total NMVOC emissions in 2017, respectively. Our results and previous inventories are generally comparable within the estimation uncertainties (-27 %-52 %). However, there exist significant differences in the estimates of sub-categories. Personal care products were a significant and quickly rising source of NMVOCs, which were probably underestimated in previous inventories. Emissions from solvent use were growing faster compared with transportation and combustion emissions, which were relatively better controlled in China. Environmentally friendly products can reduce the NMVOC emissions from solvent use. Supposing all solvent-based products were substituted with water-based products, it would result in 37 %, 41 %, and 38 % reduction of emissions, ozone formation potential (OFP), and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP), respectively. These results indicate there is still large potential for NMVOC reduction by reducing the utilization of solvent-based products and implementation of end-of-pipe controls across industrial sectors. © 2021 Ziwei Mo et al.",,"atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; estimation method; industrial district; mass balance; solvent; uncertainty analysis; volatile organic compound; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115084157

This paper investigates the variation of near-surface air temperatures within Beijing at a neighbourhood-scale resolution (∼100 m) during winter 2016 and summer 2017. We perform simulations using the urban climate component of the ADMS-Urban model with land surface parameters derived from both local climate zone classifications and OpenStreetMap land use information. Through sensitivity simulations, the relative impacts of surface properties and anthropogenic heat emissions on the temporal variation of Beijing's UHI are quantified. Measured UHI intensities between central Beijing (Institute of Atmospheric Physics) and a rural site (Pinggu) during the Atmospheric Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese Megacity (APHH-China) campaigns, peak during the evening at ∼4.5 C in both seasons. In winter, the nocturnal UHI is dominated by anthropogenic heat emissions but is underestimated by the model. Higher-resolution anthropogenic heat emissions may capture the effects of local sources (e.g. residential buildings and adjacent major roads). In summer, evening UHI intensities are underestimated, especially during heatwaves. The inability to fully replicate the prolonged release of heat stored in the urban fabric may explain this. Observed negative daytime UHI intensities in summer are more successfully captured when surface moisture levels in central Beijing are increased. However, the spatial correlation between simulated air temperatures and satellite-derived land surface temperatures is stronger with a lower urban moisture scenario. This result suggests that near-surface air temperatures at the urban meteorological site are likely influenced by fine-scale green spaces that are unresolved by the available land cover data and demonstrates the expected differences between surface and air temperatures related to canopy layer advection. This study lays the foundations for future studies of heat-related health risks and UHI mitigation strategies across Beijing and other megacities. © 2021 Michael Biggart et al.",,"air temperature; database; GIS; heat island; neighborhood; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; surface temperature; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114995729

To rationally control molecular photoluminescence and photochromic properties, triarylethylene derivatives combining ethynyl and ethynyltrimethylsilane groups, namely TrPEF2H and TrPEF2TMS, were designed and synthesized in this work. By simply attaching and removing the TMS protecting group, these two molecules can be mutually converted. Detailed photophysical and photochromic investigations revealed that molecules TrPEF2H and TrPEF2TMS exhibit distinct emissive and photochromic behaviors in the crystalline state: TrPEF2H features a pronounced photochromic property and a low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 1.5%, whereas a weak photochromic response and a high PLQY of 14.2% were obtained in crystalline TrPEF2TMS. The distinguished difference is proposed as due to the introduction of the bulky trimethylsilane moiety in TrPEF2TMS, which effectively suppressed the molecular vibrations and photocyclization reactions. Single crystal analyses and theoretical calculations were further carried out to interpret the distinction of the photophysical and photochromic properties in molecules TrPEF2H and TrPEF2TMS. Furthermore, TrPEF2H and TrPEF2TMS were applied in a photo-controlled pattern showing reversible on-off switching emission. This design strategy gives the two molecules incomparable advantages in dual-mode signal and surface-involved photoresponsive applications, such as data encryption and information storage.

In industrial chemical processes, particularly in petrochemical operations, separation and product refining steps are responsible for up to 30% of energy use and 30% of the capital cost. Membranes and adsorption technologies are being actively studied as alternative and partial replacement opportunities for the state-of-the-art cryogenic distillation systems. This paper provides an industrial perspective on the application of membranes in industrial petrochemical cracker operations.

We use a bottom-up model of current and future building and pavement stocks and construction in the United States to contextualize the role of concrete in greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions strategies under projected and ambitious scenarios, including embodied and use phases of the structures' life cycle. We show that projected improvements in the building sector result in a reduction of 49% of GHG emissions in 2050 relative to 2016 levels, whereas ambitious improvements result in a 57% reduction in 2050, which is 22.5 Gt cumulative saving. The pavements sector shows a larger difference between the two scenarios with a 14% reduction of GHG emissions for projected improvements and a 65% reduction under the ambitious scenario, which is ~1.35 Gt. This reduction occurs despite the fact that concrete usage in 2050 in the ambitious scenario is over three times that of the projected scenario because of the ways in which concrete lowers use phase emissions. Over 70% of future emissions from new construction are from the use phase. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG, both essential controllers of pluripotency, stemness and early embryo development. Molecular mechanisms controlling OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG during embryogenesis remain unidentified. We show that AhR regulates pluripotency factors and maintains the metabolic activity required for proper embryo differentiation. AhR-lacking embryos (AhR−/−) showed a pluripotent phenotype characterized by a delayed expression of trophectoderm differentiation markers. Accordingly, central pluripotency factors OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG were overexpressed in AhR−/− embryos at initial developmental stages. An altered intracellular localization of these factors was observed in the absence of AhR and, importantly, Oct4 had an opposite expression pattern with respect to AhR from the two-cell stage to blastocyst, suggesting a negative regulation of OCT4/POU5F by AhR. We propose that AhR is a regulator of pluripotency and differentiation in early mouse embryogenesis. © 2021 The Authors","aryl hydrocarbon receptor; embryo differentiation; Hippo; pluripotency; preimplantation","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; chorionic gonadotropin; octamer transcription factor 4; seric gonadotropin; transcription factor NANOG; aerobic metabolism; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; blastocyst; cell differentiation; cellular distribution; controlled study; embryo; embryo development; embryonic stem cell; female; gene overexpression; glycolysis; hippo signaling; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; pluripotent stem cell; preimplantation embryo; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; trophectoderm; upregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114402943

However, the high-throughput preparation and instant screening of excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) carbon materials have not yet been effectively performed. Inspired by machine learning, a series of nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) co-doped porous carbon materials (NF-PCs) with tunable total N and F contents and N/F doping ratios are synthesized by employing nearly 30 kinds of environmentally friendly biomass as precursors. A regular mapping describing the relationship between the ORR activity, heteroatom content and doping ratio is explored, and demonstrates the distribution pattern of the optimal catalytically active regions (∼4.8% total N and F content and N/F atomic ratio of ∼3) of biomass-derived carbon materials. Moreover, the Zn-air battery assembled from the as-prepared catalyst continuously drives 210 LEDs for at least 24 hours.

The trend after 2010, however, remains under debate. An improved understanding of major sources and their trends, informed by timely and accurate data, is required to monitor efforts toward climate mitigation goals. Here we update a detailed bottom-up inventory to evaluate recent changes in China’s anthropogenic CH4emissions. Combining our and other bottom-up inventories and seven global CH4inversions, we show a slowdown of emission increase after 2010 [0.2 (−0.3 to 0.7) Tg of CH4year-2] compared to the 2000s [1.2 (0.6-1.8) Tg of CH4year-2], with a downward trend detected after 2014. Although there are considerable uncertainties, this slowdown is statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001). The slowdown is mainly attributed to stabilized coal production in the 2010s, along with a regional shift of production toward mining areas with low emission factors and increased utilization of coal mine methane. Our results suggest that China’s recent energy policies have helped control coal mine emissions, and further work is needed to narrow down the uncertainty in both bottom-up inventories and top-down inversions. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal mines; Methane; Anthropogenic emissions; Bottom up; Climate mitigations; Coal production; Further works; Low emission; Methane emissions; Mining areas; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113893592

A transition of local policy occurred in 2018, with a window of approximately 3 months issued for agricultural fires. Here, we investigated the responses of brown carbon (BrC) to the new policy. Persistently high levels of BrC mass (estimated as methanol-soluble organic carbon) and absorption coefficient were observed during the “legitimate burning” period. Agricultural fires, the major driver responsible for the elevated BrC levels, were found to be distinctive with relatively low combustion efficiencies and resulted in BrC with less light absorptivity, compared to residential burning of crop residues. The agricultural fire emissions also led to overestimation of elemental carbon (EC) mass, by a factor of up to 1.6. This in turn resulted in substantial underestimation offBrC/EC, the fraction of solar energy absorbed by BrC relative to EC. This study indicates that the new open burning policy could not be considered successful with respect to either air quality improvement or climate change mitigation. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Climate change; Crops; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Solar energy; Absorption co-efficient; Agricultural fires; Agricultural sector; Air quality improvement; Climate change mitigation; Combustion efficiencies; Elemental carbon; Northeast China; Bromine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108566918

The study was based on mathematical modeling of the forest stand growth combined with the conversion-volumetric method for determining the amount of phytomass converted to sequestered carbon. Tables were proposed that reflect the quantitative characteristics of the age dynamics in phytomass and the carbon contained in it. The range of changes in the phytomass in modal Siberian pine stands throughout all age classes in the Bilberry-dominated forest type was from 40.2 to 297.7 t m-3, in the Bergenia-dominated forest type - from 52.6 to 292.1 t m-3. In Siberian pine forests of the IV bonitet class, carbon pools were concentrated in the Bilberry-dominated type from 37.5 to 147.6 t⋅C⋅ha-1, in the Bergenia-dominated type - from 48.1 to 147.2 t⋅C⋅ha-1.

While ambient NO2 and particulate matter (PM) concentrations have received considerable attention in the city, high ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations are an often overlooked component of pollution. O3 can lead to significant ecosystem damage and agricultural crop losses, and adversely affect human health. During October 2018, concentrations of speciated non-methane hydrocarbon volatile organic compounds (C2-C13), oxygenated volatile organic compounds (o-VOCs), NO, NO2, HONO, CO, SO2, O3, and photolysis rates, were continuously measured at an urban site in Old Delhi. These observations were used to constrain a detailed chemical box model utilising the Master Chemical Mechanism v3.3.1. VOCs and NOx (NO + NO2) were varied in the model to test their impact on local O3 production rates, P(O3), which revealed a VOC-limited chemical regime. When only NOx concentrations were reduced, a significant increase in P(O3) was observed; thus, VOC co-reduction approaches must also be considered in pollution abatement strategies. Of the VOCs examined in this work, mean morning P(O3) rates were most sensitive to monoaromatic compounds, followed by monoterpenes and alkenes, where halving their concentrations in the model led to a 15.6 %, 13.1 %, and 12.9 % reduction in P(O3), respectively. P(O3) was not sensitive to direct changes in aerosol surface area but was very sensitive to changes in photolysis rates, which may be influenced by future changes in PM concentrations. VOC and NOx concentrations were divided into emission source sectors, as described by the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) v5.0 Global Air Pollutant Emissions and EDGAR v4.3.2_VOC_spec inventories, allowing for the impact of individual emission sources on P(O3) to be investigated. Reducing road transport emissions only, a common strategy in air pollution abatement strategies worldwide, was found to increase P(O3), even when the source was removed in its entirety. Effective reduction in P(O3) was achieved by reducing road transport along with emissions from combustion for manufacturing and process emissions. Modelled P(O3) reduced by ∼1/4 20 ppb h-1 when these combined sources were halved. This study highlights the importance of reducing VOCs in parallel with NOx and PM in future pollution abatement strategies in Delhi. © 2021 Beth S.

Emissions are higher in animal-friendly husbandry offering cattle more space2 — a trade-off we call the ‘climate killer conundrum’. Voiding in a specific location (latrine) would help resolve this dilemma by allowing ready capture and treatment of excreta under more spacious farming conditions. For urination, toileting requires self-control and coordination of a complex chain of behaviors including awareness of bladder fullness, overriding of excretory reflexes, selection of a latrine and intentional relaxation of the external urethral sphincter3. Attempts to train toileting in cattle have so far been only partly successful4–6, even though their excretion and associated neurophysiological control are similar to those in species capable of toileting3. Similarly, very young infants have been considered incapable of self-initiated voiding, but they can be taught with extensive training7. Using a backward chaining, reward-based training procedure, we here show that cattle can control their micturition reflex and use a latrine for urination. Such self-control provides evidence that animals can learn to respond to and reveal internal experiences via appropriately trained operant behaviors, thereby providing another way to explore their subjective states. © 2021 The Author(s)",,"article; awareness; bladder sphincter; bovine; carbon footprint; controlled study; excretion; female; human; human experiment; infant; leisure; male; micturition reflex; nonhuman; operant conditioning; reward; self control; toileting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114408849

A contemporary example is the organic substance, oxymethylenether (OMEn), which consists of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. It is reported in the literature that OMEn suppresses the formation of harmful NOx and soot and reduces CO2 emissions during the combustion process in internal combustion engines due to its high oxygen content. For the investigation presented in this paper, the use of OMEn was transferred to the autothermal reforming (ATR) process, which is normally conducted using pure diesel fuel or kerosene in order to produce a hydrogen-rich reformate gas to operate fuel cell systems. Different mixtures of OMEn and Ultimate diesel fuel were fed into Jülich's ATR 14 at a steady state. Thereby, approved reaction conditions from former ATR diesel fuel experiments with respect to O2/C and H2O/C molar ratios (0.47 and 1.9, respectively) and temperatures of the educts were applied. It was observed that the addition of OMEn to Ultimate diesel fuel resulted in stable temperatures at characteristic positions within ATR 14 and had a positive effect on the quality of the ATR product gas (reformate). For instance, the concentration of the undesired byproducts ethene and benzene decreased from 800 ppmv to the range of roughly 230 ppmv and from some 130 ppmv to less than 40 ppmv, respectively, when the mass fraction of OMEn in the OMEn/Ultimate diesel mixture was increased from 0% to 30%. © 2021 The Author(s)","Autothermal reforming; Diesel; Fuel cell systems; Greenhouse gas emissions; Oxymethylenether OMEn; Power-to-fuel process","Biodiesel; Combustion; Crude oil; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Ethylene; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Hydrogen fuels; Mixtures; Molar ratio; Oxygen; Autothermal reforming; Energy carriers; Fuel cell system; Greenhouse gas emissions; NO$-x$; Organic substances; Oxymethylenether OMEn; Power; Power-to-fuel process; Sources of energy; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111296260

This is most important when carbon assimilation is limited by drought, and as such, it entails a trade-off between carbon assimilation vs stress avoidance. The ecological adaptation of plants to local water availability can lead to different photoprotective strategies. To test this, we used different provenances of Caesalpinia spinosa (Mol.) Kuntze (commonly known as 'tara') along a precipitation gradient. Tara is a Neotropical legume tree with high ecological and commercial value, found in dry tropical forests, which are increasingly threatened by climate change. Morphological and physiological responses of tara provenances were analysed under three different treatments of drought and leaflet immobilization, i.e., light stress, in a common garden greenhouse experiment. Tara quickly responded to drought by reducing stomatal conductance, evapotranspiration, photochemical efficiency, carbon assimilation and growth, while increasing structural and chemical photoprotection (leaflet angle and pigments for thermal dissipation). Leaflet closure was an efficient photoprotection strategy with overall physiological benefits for seedlings as it diminished the evaporative demand and avoided photodamage, but also entailed costs by reducing net carbon assimilation opportunities. These responses depended on seed origin, with seedlings from the most xeric locations showing the highest dehydration tolerance, suggesting local adaptation and highlighting the value of different strategies under distinct environments. This plasticity in its response to environmental stress allows tara to thrive in locations with contrasting water availability. Our findings increase the understanding of the factors controlling the functional ecology of tara in response to drought, which can be leveraged to improve forecasts of changes in its distribution range, and for planning restoration projects with this keystone tree species. © The Author(s) 2021.

Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the response of soil microbial to N fertilizer inputs in sugarcane soil. A field experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of optimum (N375, 375 kg N/ha) and excessive (N563, 563 kg N/ha) amounts of N fertilizer on soil bacterial diversity and community structure in a sugarcane cropping system by MiSeq high-throughput sequencing; 50,007 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Results showed that the most abundant phyla in the sugarcane rhizosphere soil were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes, whose ensemble mean accounted for 74.29%. Different amounts of N application indeed change the bacterial diversity and community structures. Excessive application of N fertilizers significantly decreased the pH and increased the available N in soils and unexpectedly obtained a lower yield. Excessive N resulted in a relatively lower bacterial species richness and significantly increased the relative abundance of phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes and the genera Sphingomonas and Gemmatimonas, while optimum N treatment significantly increased the phylum Actinobacteria and the genera Bacillus and Nitrospira (P < 0.05). N application shifted the N cycle in nitrification, mainly on the Nitrospira, but showed no significant effect on the genera related to nitrogen fixation, methane oxidation, sulfate reduction, and sulfur oxidation (P > 0.05). Overall, the optimum amount of N application might be conducive to beneficial microorganisms, such as Actinobacteria, Nitrospira, and Bacillus and, thus, result in a healthier ecosystem and higher sustainable crop production. © Copyright © 2021 Gu, Wang, Cai, Li, Mei and Yang.","16S rRNA; bacterial community; nitrogen fertilizer; rhizosphere microbe; sugarcane","calcium phosphate; methane; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; organic matter; phosphorus; potassium; potassium chloride; RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Article; Bacillus; Bacteroidetes; bioinformatics; crop production; cyanobacterium; DNA extraction; DNA sequencing; ecosystem; Firmicutes; Gemmatimonadetes (phylum); high throughput sequencing; microbial community; microbial diversity; nitrogen cycle; Nitrospira; nonhuman; physical chemistry; Planctomycetes; polymerase chain reaction; Proteobacteria; rhizosphere bacterium; Sphingomonas; sugarcane; sulfur oxidizing bacterium; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116501443

From 2004 January 1 to 2017 September 12, NB emissions were selected automatically by a computer program and rechecked manually. The spatial distribution shows a preference for high latitude and intensity peaks in the region within 6 Saturn radii (Rs) for both 5 and 20 kHz NB emissions. 5 kHz NB emissions also show a local time preference roughly in the 18:00-22:00 sector. The Enceladus plasma torus makes it difficult for NB emissions to propagate to the low latitude regions outside the plasma torus. The extent of the low latitude regions where 5 and 20 kHz NB emissions were never observed is consistent with the corresponding plasma torus density contour in the meridional plane. 20 kHz NB emissions show a high circular polarization while 5 kHz NB emissions are less circularly polarized with V ∣ &lt; 0.6 for majority of the cases. And cases of 5 kHz NB emissions with high circular polarization are more frequently observed at high latitude especially at the northern and southern edges of the Enceladus plasma torus. © 2021.

However, the molecular mechanism affecting nitrogen metabolism by sucrose transport remains poorly defined. Previously, we noted that Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11) mediated sucrose transport by binding to the promoter regions of Sucrose Transporter 1 (SUT1), Oryza sativa Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters 11 (OsSWEET11), and OsSWEET14. Here, we note that OsDOF11 promotes nitrogen uptake and then maintains the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight in seedling plants and the effective leaf blade at flowering stages. Mutants of the sucrose transporter gene OsSWEET14 displayed a phenotype similar to that of OsDOF11. By microarray analysis and qRT-PCR in OsDOF11 mutant plants, OsDOF11 affected the transcription level of amino acid metabolism-related genes. We further found that mainly amino acid contents were reduced in flag leaves but increased in seeds. Both sugar and organic nitrogen changes caused the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight to decrease in OsDOF11 mutant seedling plants and mature leaves, which might result in vigorous reduced metabolic activity and become less susceptible to stress. These results demonstrated that OsDOF11 affected nitrogen metabolism by sugar distribution in rice, which provided new insight that OsDOF11 coordinated with C and N balance to maintain plant growth activity. © Copyright © 2021 Huang, Zhang, Wang, Dong, Hu, Jiang, Chen, An, Xiong and Wu.","nitrogen; OsDOF11; rice; stress; water content",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115704025

The advantages of using stainless steel as structural members are corrosion resistance and durability, compared with carbon steel. Current guidance by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) and the Australian and New Zealand (AS/NZS) standards for built-up carbon steel sections describes a modified slenderness approach, to consider the spacing of the intermediate fasteners. The AISI and AS/NZS do not include the design of stainless-steel built-up channels and very few experimental tests or finite element (FE) analyses have been reported in the literature for such back-to-back cold-formed stainless steel unlipped channel section columns. This paper presents a numerical investigation on the behavior of back-to-back built-up cold-formed stainless steel unlipped channel section columns. Three different grades of stainless steel i.e., duplex EN1.4462, ferritic EN1.4003 and austenitic EN1.4404, were considered. The effects of screw spacing on the axial strength of such built-up unlipped channels were investigated. As expected, most of the short and intermediate columns failed by either local-global or local-distortional buckling interactions, whereas the long columns failed by global buckling. All three grades of stainless-steel stub columns failed by local buckling. A comprehensive parametric study was then carried out covering a wide range of slenderness and different cross-sectional geometries to assess the performance of the current design guidelines of carbon steel built-up sections in accordance with the AISI and AS/NZS. In total, 647 FE models were analyzed. From the results of the parametric study, it was found that the AISI and AS/NZS are conservative by around 14 to 20% for all three grades of stainless steel built-up unlipped channel section columns failed through global buckling. However, the AISI and AS/NZS carbon steel design rules can be un-conservative by around 8 to 13%, when they are used to calculate the axial capacity of those stainless steel built-up unlipped channels which are failed in local buckling.

However, seagrass meadows are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Determining the magnitude of the carbon stocks in seagrass meadows at the regional scale allows for the estimation of their global magnitude and identification of their importance in regional environmental mitigation strategies. The objective of the present study was to determine the structure of seagrass meadows in the Los Petenes Biosfera Reserve (LPBR) and evaluate their contributions to sinks of carbon in this system, located in Yucatan, which is considered the region with the largest seagrass extension in Mexico. Analyses of the seagrass meadows were executed following standardized protocols (spectral analysis, and isotope and carbon stock analyses). The LPBR stores an average of 2.2 ± 1.7 Mg C ha-1 in living biomass and 318 ± 215 Mg C ha-1 in sediment (top 1 m), and this carbon stock decreases with water depth. The seagrass community extends 149,613 ha, which represents the largest organic carbon stock (47 Tg C) documented in seagrass meadows in Mexico. Macroalgae and seagrass represent 76% of the organic carbon stored in sediment. If LPBR seagrass meadows are lost due to natural or anthropogenic impacts, 173 Tg CO2eqemissions could be released, which corresponds to the emissions generated by fossil fuel combustion of 27% of the current Mexican population. This information emphasizes the importance of seagrass meadows as a carbon sink in the region and their contribution to climate change mitigation, thus allowing for the implementation of necessary conservation strategies. © 2021 Cota Lucero and Herrera- Silveira.","Autochthonous; Blue carbon; Mangroves; Seagrasses","ammonia; carbon; carbonic acid; chlorophyll; dissolved oxygen; fertilizer; fossil fuel; hemicellulose; isotope; limestone; magnesium; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; silicon dioxide; Article; biodiversity; biomass; bulk density; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; carbon source; climate change; coastal waters; combustion; community; density; dry weight; ecosystem; epiphyte; genetic heterogeneity; glycemic index; Gulf of Mexico; habitat; haplotype; herbivore; human impact (environment); leaf area; macroalga; mangrove; marine environment; masking; molecular weight; nonhuman; nutrient; photosynthesis; phylogeography; physical chemistry; phytoplankton; plant leaf; radiometry; sea surface temperature; seagrass; seashore; seasonal variation; sediment; soil analysis; species distribution; spectroscopy; water depth; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114852985

In addition, the acidity of atmospheric aqueous phases, e.g., deliquesced aerosol particles, cloud, and fog droplets, is also dictated by aqueous-phase chemistry. These feedbacks between acidity and chemistry have crucial implications for the tropospheric lifetime of air pollutants, atmospheric composition, deposition to terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems, visibility, climate, and human health. Atmospheric research has made substantial progress in understanding feedbacks between acidity and multiphase chemistry during recent decades. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on these feedbacks with a focus on aerosol and cloud systems, which involve both inorganic and organic aqueous-phase chemistry. Here, we describe the impacts of acidity on the phase partitioning of acidic and basic gases and buffering phenomena. Next, we review feedbacks of different acidity regimes on key chemical reaction mechanisms and kinetics, as well as uncertainties and chemical subsystems with incomplete information. Finally, we discuss atmospheric implications and highlight the need for future investigations, particularly with respect to reducing emissions of key acid precursors in a changing world, and the need for advancements in field and laboratory measurements and model tools. © Copyright:",,"acidity; aerosol; aqueous solution; atmospheric chemistry; cloud; emission control; particulate matter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114823187

However, a reliable estimation of resulting uncertainties with an ensemble of forecasts is impaired by the high dimensionality of the system. This study presents a novel approach, which substitutes the problem into a low-dimensional subspace spanned by the leading uncertainties. It is based on the idea that the forecast model acts as a dynamical system inducing multivariate correlations of model uncertainties. This enables an efficient perturbation of high-dimensional model parameters according to their leading coupled uncertainties. The specific algorithm presented in this study is designed for parameters that depend on local environmental conditions and consists of three major steps: (1) an efficient assessment of various sources of model uncertainties spanned by independent sensitivities, (2) an efficient extraction of leading coupled uncertainties using eigenmode decomposition, and (3) an efficient generation of perturbations for high-dimensional parameter fields by the Karhunen-Loéve expansion. Due to their perceived simulation challenge, the method has been applied to biogenic emissions of five trace gases, considering state-dependent sensitivities to local atmospheric and terrestrial conditions. Rapidly decreasing eigenvalues state that highly correlated uncertainties of regional biogenic emissions can be represented by a low number of dominant components. Depending on the required level of detail, leading parameter uncertainties with dimensions of O(106) can be represented by a low number of about 10 ensemble members. This demonstrates the suitability of the algorithm for efficient ensemble generation for high-dimensional atmospheric chemical parameters. © Copyright:",,"atmospheric modeling; biogenic emission; correlation; parameter estimation; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114766854

China plans to achieve the following two major goals by 2030: to experience the peak of carbon dioxide emissions, and to be at the forefront of innovative countries in the world. The realization of these goals not only depends on the environmental regulation policy regarding carbon emissions, but also on the development imbalance among Chinese provinces. The Porter hypothesis theory holds that environmental regulation can produce the Porter effect and promote enterprise innovation; but few studies focused on the causal relationship between environmental regulation and the regional Porter effect. Under this framework, this paper uses propensity score matching - difference in difference (PSM-DID) to construct a quasi-experiment on China's carbon emissions trading pilot policy. Dynamic panel data models are used to double test whether environmental regulation can stimulate the regional Porter effect. The empirical results show that: (1) Under the premise of multiple robustness tests (whether quasi-experimental or dynamic panel data models), no evidence was found in support that environmental regulation can stimulate the regional Porter effect. (2) The reason why the regional Porter effect does not been stimulated is that the pollution heaven effect, induced by the carbon emissions trading pilot policy, counteracts the Porter effect to a certain extent. (3) There is no non-linear relationship between environmental regulation and the regional Porter effect. (4) The analysis of spatial heterogeneity shows that environmental regulation cannot stimulate the Porter effect in the eastern, central, and western regions of China. This suggests that it is very important to establish appropriate provincial environmental regulation objectives and to conduct appropriate environmental regulation in combination with local resource endowments. This study provides quantitative evidence toward an in-depth understanding of the relationship between environmental regulation and the regional Porter effect as represented by the pilot policy of carbon emissions trading. A certain degree of reference is provided for the practice of environmental regulation in other developing countries. © 2021","Carbon emissions; Environmental regulation; Pollution heaven effect; Porter hypothesis; Regional Porter effect","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Developing countries; Emission control; Global warming; Sustainable development; % reductions; Carbon emission trading; Carbon emissions; Dynamic panel data; Panel data models; Pollution heaven effect; Porter hypothesis; Quasi-dynamics; Quasi-experiments; Regional porter effect; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111048781

Sustainable building standards and efficiency standards are two measures to reduce such emissions and energy consumption in buildings. While better standards improve the sustainability of new buildings, the impact of these actions depends on the ability to improve the existing building stock. Understanding the dynamics of adopting efficiency and sustainable building measures is essential for setting policy targets and mechanisms. This paper proposes a system dynamics model for assessing the energy savings potential from adopting sustainable building and energy efficiency measurements in buildings in systems with incomplete and uncertain information, using prospective scenarios. The model combines a dynamic diffusion model with an aggregate model for the building stock. The model is calibrated for estimating energy savings in the residential and commercial building stock of the four main metropolitan areas of Colombia: Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, and Barranquilla. Simulation results show that the maximum energy savings potential is approximately 12% but could be below 8% if rebound effects are considered. Results show that energy savings are limited if there are no policies for existing old buildings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Scenarios; Simulation; Sustainable construction","Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; System theory; Building stocks; Colombia; Energy; Energy-consumption; In-buildings; Scenario; Simulation; Sustainable building; Sustainable construction; Sustainable energy; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111023070

Well spacing and the arrangement of the production well are the two most pivotal factors for the thermal reservoir which can ensure long-term production at economically acceptable levels. The Xiong'an geothermal area, located in the western margin of the Bohai Bay Basin, is the most developed region of the carbonate stratum and also is one of the areas that have the greatest hydrothermal geothermal resources in China. In this study, based on the temperature data of the carbonate formation and thermosphysical data from the core samples measurement, a three dimensional thermo-hydraulic coupled numerical model was established to assess the geothermal potential of the carbonate reservoir and the effect of different exploitation schemes (mainly involved the injection fluid temperature, injection mass flow rate and lateral well distance) on the thermal reservoir performance was analyzed over a period of 40 years. The effect of permeability heterogeneity on the thermal reservoir performance was also discussed as a case study. The calculation results were then analyzed on the basis of the output temperature decline curves and the cumulative energy production over the entire period from the production well. Among the three important influence factors on the carbonate reservoir performance, the injection temperature has the most significant effect on the energy production rate, followed by the injection mass flow rate and the lateral well spacing. © 2021","Carbonate reservoir; Energy production rate; Operational optimization; Output temperature; Xiong'an new area","Carbonation; Geothermal fields; Geothermal wells; Mass transfer; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Well spacing; Carbonate reservoir; Case-studies; Energy production rate; Mass-flow rate; Operational optimization; Output temperature; Production wells; Reservoir performance; Thermal reservoir; Xiong'an new area; Petroleum reservoirs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109396102

Thus, this study explores the factors that influence the willingness to pay (WTP) on behalf of the citizens to reduce air pollution generated by road transport.

Two potential improvements to this highly polluting public transportation system are the implementation of electric or compressed natural gas buses. This paper analyzes the life-cycle environmental impacts using the ReCiPe life cycle impact assessment method (in Global warming, kg CO2-eq, Stratospheric ozone depletion, kg CFC-11-eq, etc.), technical feasibility of implementation, and financial cost of implementing each bus type in Bangkok by calculating these metrics for a single bus and then scaling them to a fleet of that bus type. The entire life cycle of the buses as well as electric bus charging infrastructure is considered. It was found that shifting from diesel to electric or compressed natural gas buses would present a 54–55% or 37–41% decrease in overall damage to human and ecosystem health, an 88% or 80% decrease in resource depletion, and a 48% or 60% decrease in lifetime costs. If the entire diesel bus fleet in Bangkok of 14,127 buses is converted to electric or compressed natural gas buses, the reduction of fine particle (PM2.5) transportation emissions would be approximately 21% and 18%. Of compressed natural gas and electric buses, compressed natural gas buses are the less expensive alternative, while electric buses cause less damage to the ecosystem, human health, and resource depletion.

Few studies have tested the mechanisms underlying centralization and decentralization. The establishment of the Ministry of Environmental Protection in China in 2008 has led to various changes in the degree of environmental centralization. Based on this reform, we use standard and continuous difference-in-difference designs to estimate the effect of environmental centralization on pollution in developing countries and to test the underlying mechanisms. We find that the establishment of the Ministry of Environmental Protection has effectively led to reduced pollution in provinces with higher degrees of environmental decentralization. Furthermore, centralization has restricted local governments' free riding and reduced emissions at the borders. It has also strengthened local governments’ incentives for environmental governance. The implication is that environmental centralization is conducive to reducing the free-riding behavior and race-to-the-bottom problems of developing economies, thus contributing to environmental well-being. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Environmental centralization; Environmental decentralization; Ministry of environmental protection","Environmental protection; Pollution; Administrative reform; Centralisation; Centralization and decentralizations; China; Environmental centralization; Environmental decentralization; Environmental regimes; Free-riding; Local government; Ministry of environmental protection; Developing countries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108600533

Converting CW plant biomass to biofuel as an alternative to fossil fuels can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and plant diversity influences this mitigation effect. However, the impact of plant diversity on net global warming potential combining carbon dioxide and non-carbon dioxide emissions in CWs is less studied, especially in floating CWs where the substrate is absent and both above- and below-ground biomass can be harvested easily for biofuel production. In this paper, four species richness levels were assembled in 90 hydroponic microcosms that simulated floating CWs to explore the effect of plant diversity on global warming potential. The results showed that: (1) increasing species richness increased the aboveground and total biomass but had no effect on belowground biomass, and carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by converting both above- and belowground biomass to biofuel to replace fossil fuels; (2) increasing species richness increased non-carbon dioxide emissions but decreased the overall global warming potential of combined carbon dioxide and non-carbon dioxide emissions; (3) communities containing Oenanthe javanica had lower overall global warming potential; and (4) some species (Oenanthe javanica) had a stronger mitigating effect on global warming potential than species richness. Our observations suggest that it is economically feasible to produce biofuel from hydroponically grown plants in floating CWs, and net energy gain can be achieved. Assembling high species richness and carefully selecting species in floating CWs alongside converting plant biomass to biofuel offers a greener form of wastewater treatment that can contribute to cleaner production strategies. © 2021","Biofuel production; Biomass; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Species identity; Species richness","Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Pollution control; Reclamation; Substrates; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Above ground biomass; Belowground biomass; Biofuel production; Carbon dioxide emissions; Global warming potential; Greenhouses gas; Plant biomass; Plant diversity; Species identity; Species richness; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108287922

Also, the present sustainable system is investigated thermodynamically by considering energy and exergy criteria and evaluated through energy and exergy efficiencies. As a case study, the Saugeen First Nation indigenous community in the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario, Canada, is selected for meeting the demands of useful commodities where an integration of a newly developed multigenerational system with an existing nuclear reactor is achieved in order to provide food security, supply the freshwater for drinking purposes, and meet the community's electricity and heat demands. Moreover, to exploit the existing thermophysical properties of fluids in the nuclear system, a hydrogen generation unit is proposed. The novel integration is enhanced the current nuclear system and increased the variety of useful outputs. The overall system is analyzed according to the first and second laws of thermodynamics. A transient (time-dependent) analysis is carried out via hourly simulations with software packages and hourly sensitive meteorological data. The overall system performance results are obtained as 65.8% for energy efficiency and 40.1% exergy efficiency at average ambient conditions for a 126.04 mol/s hydrogen production rate. © 2021","Clean energy; Clean food; Clean fuel; Clean water; Cleaner production; Environment; Hydrogen; Nuclear energy; Renewables; Sustainability","Energy efficiency; Food supply; Hydrogen production; Meteorology; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear reactors; Pollution control; Potable water; Sustainable development; Clean energy; Clean food; Clean fuel; Clean waters; Cleaner production; Energy; Environment; Indigenous community; Renewables; Sustainable communities; Exergy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108264026

In this study, we analyzed the effects of legume intercropping and nitrogen (N) fertilizer level on net greenhouse gas balances (NGHGB), yield-based greenhouse gas emissions intensity (GHGI), carbon footprint (CF) and crop productivity in sweet maize cropland in South China based on a long-term field experiment during 2013–2018. Results demonstrated that the sweet maize/soybean intercropping pattern could improve crop productivity on the unit of arable land, but the yield advantage of the intercropping system was totally derived from the soybean. Accordingly, the intercropping pattern reduced the GHGI with significant difference compared to the sweet maize mono-cropping system. Therein, the difference between the sweet maize/soybean intercropping with crop line ratios of 2:3 (S2B3) and 2:4 (S2B4) were not significant. Furthermore, suitable N input during the sweet maize cultivation in the region were necessary for improving the crop productivity and decreasing the GHGs emission in farmland. Also, the difference of N levels was significant to the GHGs emissions, soil organic carbon sequestration, GHGI and NGHGB. The 300 kg N ha−1 showed the better effect for lowering the NGHGB and CF in sweet maize farmland when keeping crop productivity. The interaction effect of the N level and crop pattern just showed on the crop yields and GHGI. The S2B4 with 300 kg N ha−1 showed significant benefits with respect to maintaining the yields and reducing the net GHGs emissions compared to conventional sweet maize farming system in the Pearl River Delta in China. These advanced agricultural practices contributed to the development of clean agricultural production in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Greenhouse gas emission; Intercropping; Nitrogen; Soybean; Sweet maize","Carbon footprint; Crops; Cultivation; Emission control; Farms; Gas emissions; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Organic carbon; Productivity; China; Crop productivity; Emissions intensity; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Greenhouse gas balance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Intercropping; Soybean; Sweet maize; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108250255

In order to establish reliable global GHG budgets, field measurements of soil GHG fluxes from different land uses and management practices in tropical regions are urgently needed. In this study, soil fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured over a period of one year, from a forest and an urban parkland in Singapore. At the parkland site, two additional management practices were investigated, namely compost application to urban lawn and the replacement of lawn by legumes. The average CO2 efflux from the forest soil was 0.17 ± 0.01 g C m−2 h−1 and was 30% lower than that of the parkland soil. The forest soil was a CH4 sink (−36.03 ± 8.80 μg C m−2 h−1), while the parkland soil was a source of CH4 (43.79 ± 9.66 μg C m−2 h−1). Both soils were net emitters of N2O, with the forest soil releasing four times more N2O (23.23 ± 5.10 μg N m−2 h−1) than the parkland soil (6.47 ± 2.52 μg N m−2 h−1). During the entire observation period, compost application increased CO2eq by 30% compared with the untreated parkland soil. Shortly after compost addition, CO2 fluxes significantly increased and remained elevated until the end of the experiment. Soil CH4 emissions also increased, but the effect was small compared to CO2 (&lt;1% CO2eq). Compost amendment caused an immediate short-term peak of N2O emissions. However, after the first day, which was characterized by a heavy rain event, the compost effect on N2O production was negligible. Compared to grass cultivation, legume planting resulted in a 20% reduction of CO2eq. This study shows that conserving mature secondary forests and the cultivation of herbaceous legumes on tropical urban soils, where open lawn spaces are not required, can reduce soil GHG emissions. © 2021","Compost; Legumes; Mature secondary forest; Soil GHG budget; Tropical soils; Urban parkland","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Composting; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Soil conservation; Soils; Urban growth; CH$-4$; Forest soils; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Legume; Mature secondary forest; N$-2$/O; Singapore; Soil greenhouse gas budget; Tropical soils; Urban parkland; Tropics; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; compost; greenhouse gas; greenspace; legume; park management; soil emission; urban area; ambient air; Article; compost; forest soil; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; land use; legume; recreational park; seasonal variation; Singapore; soil analysis; soil property; soil temperature; soil texture; tropical rain forest; urban area; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Fabaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105555974

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of urban greening initiatives of cities worldwide aimed at mitigating these issues. However, ET estimation methods in urban areas have so far been limited. An expanding number of flux towers in urban environments provide the opportunity to directly measure ET by the eddy covariance method. In this study, we present a novel approach to model urban ET by combining flux footprint modeling, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning and machine learning techniques. This approach facilitates spatio-temporal extrapolation of ET at a half-hourly resolution; we tested this approach with a two-year dataset from two flux towers in Berlin, Germany. The benefit of integrating remote sensing and GIS data into models was investigated by testing four predictor scenarios. Two algorithms (1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest (RF)) were compared. The best-performing models were then used to model ET values for the year 2019. The inclusion of GIS data extracted using flux footprints enhanced the predictive accuracy of models, particularly when meteorological data was more limited. The best-performing scenario (meteorological and GIS data) showed an RMSE of 0.0239 mm/h and R2 of 0.840 with RF and an RMSE of 0.0250 mm/h and a R2 of 0.824 with 1D CNN for the more vegetated site. The 2019 ET sum was substantially higher at the site surrounded by more urban greenery (366 mm) than at the inner-city site (223 mm), demonstrating the substantial influence of vegetation on the urban water cycle. The proposed method is highly promising for modeling ET in a heterogeneous urban environment and can support climate change mitigation initiatives of urban areas worldwide. © 2021 The Authors","1D convolutional neural networks (CNN); Deep learning; Eddy covariance; Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2; Latent heat flux; Urban water","Climate change; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Evapotranspiration; Geographic information systems; Remote sensing; Urban growth; 1d convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Eddy covariance; Flux footprint; Flux towers; Geographic information; Harmonized landsat and sentinel-2; Latent heat flux; Urban areas; Urban waters; Heat flux; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; eddy covariance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; GIS; hydrological cycle; Landsat; latent heat flux; machine learning; remote sensing; Sentinel; urban area; Article; artificial intelligence; carbon footprint; climate change; computer model; convolutional neural network; deep learning; evapotranspiration; geographic information system; Germany; machine learning; meteorological phenomena; random forest; remote sensing; urban area; vegetation; water cycle; water insecurity; Berlin; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105425733

Mineralization was investigated in two different experimental systems in terms of leaf and microorganism environment. Additionally, the influence on pyrene partitioning and mineralization when particulate matter (PM) was present on the leaf surface or removed was studied. Mineralization of 14C-labeled pyrene by autochthonous microorganisms was lower than 1% after approximately two weeks, while M. gilvum mineralized 5% to 17% of pyrene. These extents corresponded to mineralization half-lives that ranged between ~30 to ~200 days. We proposed that PM present at the leaf surface reduced the accumulation of pyrene by inner compartments (cuticle) distantly located from microbial cells and enhanced the bioaccessibility of pyrene, speeding up microbial activity and therefore mineralization.

Strategies to tackle this dual challenge should assess where reducing N losses is most needed while accounting for variation in agricultural systems and ecosystems' vulnerability to N loading. We used a spatially explicit N balance model (INTEGRATOR) to assess whether crop production targets and thresholds for N impacts on biodiversity and water quality in the EU can be reconciled by (i) redistributing N inputs from excess regions to regions where environmental thresholds are not exceeded and (ii) improving N management to reduce ammonia (NH3) emissions from manure and enhance field-level N use efficiency (NUE). At current NUE, reducing N inputs to comply with three environmental thresholds (critical N deposition on terrestrial ecosystems and critical N concentrations in surface water and groundwater) would reduce European crop production by 50%. The widespread exceedance of thresholds does not provide much room for redistribution: increasing inputs to close yield gaps on land where N thresholds are not exceeded can only increase crop production by 3%. To achieve surface water quality targets without crop production losses, average NUE needs to increase from 0.64 to 0.78, whereas achieving groundwater targets only requires a modest increase from 0.64 to 0.67. In hotspot areas, however, crop production and N thresholds can only be reconciled at NUEs of &gt;0.90, which is not feasible. Reducing manure NH3 emission fractions to 0.10 by adopting best-management practices reconciles current crop production and thresholds for agricultural NH3 emission (in view of critical deposition) on only half of the agricultural area. In some regions, technologically feasible improvements in N management are thus insufficient to both maintain current crop production and respect environmental boundaries. Overall, the evaluated measures could reconcile ~80% of current EU crop production with N thresholds. © 2021 The Authors","Critical limits; Eutrophication; NH3 emission fractions; Nitrogen use efficiency; Spatial variation; Yield gaps","Ammonia; Biodiversity; Crops; Cultivation; Deposition; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Groundwater; Manures; Nitrogen; River pollution; Surface waters; Water quality; 'current; Critical limit; Crop production; Environmental boundaries; N use efficiency; NH$-3$; NH3 emission fraction; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Spatial variations; Yield gap; Efficiency; ammonia; drinking water; nitrogen; surface water; agricultural ecosystem; ammonia; biodiversity; environmental impact; environmental management; European Union; eutrophication; food production; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; pollution policy; spatial variation; water quality; Article; biodiversity; crop production; environmental factor; European Union; eutrophication; food industry; manure; pollution monitoring; rural area; water pollution; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105313231

For optimizing emission reduction policies, it is important to clarify the CO2 linkage structure and transfer characteristics. Previous research mainly focused on the calculation and comparison of CO2 linkage at the national level or the regional level and lacked inter-provincial sector-sector transfer analysis. This study uses hypothetical extraction method (HEM) to calculate the inter-provincial sectoral linkages of embodied CO2 in 2012 and 2015, providing a new perspective for sectoral CO2 linkage studies in China. We use net transfer to reveal the impact of provincial trade on the embodied CO2 emissions, and identify key CO2 emitter sectors. Combined with complex networks, we describe the clustering feature visualized and identify the transfer media sectors. The results are as follows: (1) the key sectors with large linkage are mainly the heavy industries located in North China. The electricity industry has the largest net CO2 outflow as the energy supplier, whereas the construction industry has the largest net inflow as the driving sector. (2) The CO2 transfer networks present closely connected and spatial clustering features, reflecting the embodied CO2 linkage between geographically adjacent sectors closer. (3) The important media sectors are mostly located in northwest China with small industrial scale and linkage degrees, such as the transport equipment industry in Shanxi. Emission reduction policies should be overall planned and tailored to local conditions. Consequently, possible policy implications of the results are discussed, which could provide additional insights for CO2 mitigation. © 2021","Complex network; Embodied CO2 linkage; Embodied CO2 net transfer; Hypothetical extraction method","Complex networks; Construction industry; Emission control; Extraction; Public policy; Clustering feature; CO$-2$/ emission; Complex network analysis; Embodied CO; Embodied CO2 linkage; Embodied CO2 net transfer; Emission reduction policies; Extraction complex; Extraction method; Hypothetical extraction method; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity industry; emission control; extraction method; network analysis; pollution policy; Article; carbon footprint; China; complex network; construction work; electricity; hypothetical extraction method; mathematical phenomena; measurement; priority journal; China; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105272080

The microwave-driven method performed efficiently at this temperature producing hydrogen with yields of 70% or more, as a result of the microscopic local microwave heating of the AC particulates. To the extent that the activated carbon is produced from plant biomass-related raw materials, the carbon dioxide produced is carbon neutral. Conditions for hydrogen generation were optimized with regard to the size of the AC particles, the water flow rate, and the size of the reactor. For practical applications of this microwave-based method, hydrogen was also generated efficiently with yields of 75-80% when using spent activated carbons (large size distribution) and model contaminated wastewaters and artificial seawater; significant energy was saved under the conditions used. The re-use of spent ACs eliminates the need for their disposal after being used in water and sewage treatments. In addition, the presence of any organic matter in wastewaters is also a likely effective source of hydrogen (yields, 75-85%). And not least, although generation of hydrogen from seawater is a difficult electrolytic process, the microwave method proved to be an attractive and efficient technology toward hydrogen generation from seawater with yields of 85 to 90%. Addition of Pt deposits on the activated carbon support, however, provided no advantages over pristine AC particulates. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activated carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical shift; Flow of water; Steam reforming; Temperature; Water gas shift; Carbon particulates; Condition; Hydrogen generations; Lows-temperatures; Microwave-driven; Microwave-heating; Plant biomass; Reforming gas; Spent activated carbon; Water-gas shifts; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120074333

This study examined the processes and factors controlling the hydrogeochemistry and acidic property of the groundwaters and SGD waters of two isolated coral islands, Liuqiu Island (13 km off southwestern Taiwan) and Dongsha Island (located in the northern South China Sea, 420 km away from Liuqiu Island). Our results showed that the total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the fresh SGD waters were controlled mainly by the chemical weathering of carbonate minerals. Part of the DIC came from the organic matter decomposition or soil CO2, reducing the pH and CO32− concentration. Distributions of the carbonate chemistry and nutrients of the SGD waters were controlled mainly by physical mixing between the groundwater and the ambient seawater under the seabed, the so-called subterranean estuary. The Ca2+ released through weathering significantly increased the saturation state of aragonite or calcite, reducing the corrosiveness of the SGD waters on the carbonate rocks. This study is likely the first to examine the effects of the acidic property of SGD waters on the biogenic carbonate spine of a sea urchin and a pteropod shell. The spring water with similar carbonate chemistry to that of the freshwater SGD endmember from Liuqiu Island with a saturation state of aragonite of 0.96 caused observable dissolution on the spine of a sea urchin and a pteropod shell, but the spine dissolved more readily. This was because the spine is made of high-Mg calcite, which has higher solubility than that of aragonite or calcite. Such a result implies that some marine organisms with carbonate skeletons or shells containing high Mg:Ca ratios may suffer the impact of ocean acidification earlier. Although the SGD may contribute less than 10% of freshwater discharge by rivers to the coastal area, its impact on coastal biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems due to its acidic property and continual effect on the coast all year round deserves further investigation. © Copyright © 2021 Lui, Liu, Lin, Tseng, Liu, Wang, Hou, Chang and Chen.","chemical weathering; Dongsha, Liuqiu; geochemistry; ocean acidifcation; pH; saturation state of CaCO; SGD","Alkalinity; Calcite; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Coastal zones; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Groundwater; Mammals; Molluscs; pH; Submarines; Acidic properties; Acidifcation; Coral islands; Discharge water; Dongshum, liuqiu; Hydro geochemistries; Ocean acidifcation; Saturation state; Saturation state of CaCO; Submarine groundwater discharge; Nutrients; acidification; acidity; alkalinity; chemical weathering; dissolved inorganic carbon; groundwater; hydrogeochemistry; pH; saturation; solubility; Sustainable Development Goal; underwater environment; China; Dongshan; Fujian; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115609322

A longstanding challenge for environmental monitoring is the low spatial and temporal resolution of available data for many regions. Also, new approaches for the design of sustainable technologies is urgently needed to reduce current problems related to energy costs and e-waste produced. With this in mind, the EU-funded FET Proactive Environmental Intelligence project ""I-Seed""(Grant Agreement n. 101017940, https://www.iseedproject. eu/) targets towards the development of a radically simplified and environmentally friendly approach for analysing and monitoring topsoil and air. Specifically, I-Seed aims at developing a new generation of self-deployable and biodegradable soft miniaturized robots, inspired by the morphology and dispersion abilities of plant seeds, able to perform a low-cost, environmentally responsible, and in-situ detection. The natural functional mechanisms of seeds dispersal offer a rich source of robust, highly adaptive, mass and energy efficient mechanisms, and behavioural and morphological intelligence, which can be selected and implemented for advanced, but simple, technological inventions. I-Seed robots are conceived as unique in their movement abilities because inspired by passive mechanisms and materials of natural seeds, and unique in their environmentally friendly design because made of all biodegradable components. Sensing is based on a chemical transduction mechanism in a stimulus-responsive sensor material with fluorescence-based optical readout, which can be read via one or more drones equipped with fluorescent LiDAR technology and a software able to perform a real time georeferencing of data. The I-Seed robotic ecosystem is envisioned to be used for collecting environmental data in-situ with high spatial and temporal resolution across large remote areas where no monitoring data are available, and thus for extending current environmental sensor frameworks and data analysis systems. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Aerial robotics; Biodegradable technologies; Bioinspired robotics; Chemical transduction sensing; Environmental intelligence; LiDAR; Multi-functional materials; Plant biology; Soft robotics; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Bacteriophages; Costs; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Harvesters; Harvesting; Monitoring; Optical radar; Plants (botany); Seed; Sustainable development; Aerial robotics; Bio-inspired robotics; Biodegradable technology; Chemical transduction; Chemical transduction sensing; Environmental intelligence; LiDAR; Multi-functional materials; Plant biology; Soft robotics; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Biodiversity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115435307

Environmental Intelligence brings together multiple data streams (facts) from ground-based, satellite and citizen sources with cutting-edge hardware, software and analytical technology employing human reasoning and machine learning to better understand and manage the environment. The EC H2020 ReSET project (Restarting Economy in Support of Environment through Technology) funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 FET Proactive Programme under grant agreement No 101017857, brings together environmental scientists, social scientists, informatics specialists and stakeholders from five European countries to develop state of the art investment policy support systems. These combine the best available earth observation, crowdsourced and field-monitored data with sophisticated spatial policy support systems for biophysical and social processes. Harnessing combined machine and human intelligence, we seek to to understand best-bet options for 'build back better' investments that maximise environmental, economic and employment benefits. We are working at a series of demonstration sites in Europe where 'build back better' investments are active: Thames Gateway, OxCam Arc and Strand Aldwych in UK; Carasuhat Wetlands in Romania; Castilla Leon and Rivas VaciaMadrid in Spain and Bologna in Italy. Proposed investments include urban greening and traffic management to reduce air pollution and thermal extremes (Strand Aldwych, Bologna, Rivas Vaciamadrid); Natural Flood Management (Thames Gateway, OxCam Arc, Castilla-Leon), land use zoning for low impact tourism (Carasuhat) and green-grey approaches to flood and drought management (Castilla Leon). We bring together new hardware technologies enabling low-cost, distributed, IoT environmental monitoring using the FreeStation.org platform with further developments of our widely used policy support systems CotingNature and Eco:Actuary and enhanced activity and agent-based modelling in the Metronamica modelling framework. This is to better understand current environmental conditions in the areas proposed for investment and to simulate the impact of investment alternatives (business as usual grey, blended grey-green and fully green) on environment, economy and employment in the ReSET investment policy support system. Through this work, we tackle some key challenges of operationalizing environmental intelligence discussed here: • technology as an enabler of research and innovation rather than the key focus of research • live integration of complex data streams • ensuring usability and ease of use through co-design • scalability and relevance to a range of investment types and settings • reducing costs, enabling local maintenance and ensuring accessibility and legacy © 2021 ACM.","Green infrastructure; Investment; Nature based solutions; Policy support","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental technology; Flood control; Investments; Land use; Machine learning; Simulation platform; Sustainable development; Environmental intelligence; Flood management; Green infrastructure; Hardware technology; Infrastructure investment; Investment policies; Nature based solution; Policy support; Support systems; Sustainable infrastructure; Floods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115364671

If, like soil moisture, bedrock water storage serves as an important source of plant-available water, then conceptual paradigms regarding water and carbon cycling may need to be revised to incorporate bedrock properties and processes4–6. Here we present a lower-bound estimate of the contribution of bedrock water storage to transpiration across the continental United States using distributed, publicly available datasets. Temporal and spatial patterns of bedrock water use across the continental United States indicate that woody plants extensively access bedrock water for transpiration. Plants across diverse climates and biomes access bedrock water routinely and not just during extreme drought conditions. On an annual basis in California, the volumes of bedrock water transpiration exceed the volumes of water stored in human-made reservoirs, and woody vegetation that accesses bedrock water accounts for over 50% of the aboveground carbon stocks in the state. Our findings indicate that plants commonly access rock moisture, as opposed to groundwater, from bedrock and that, like soil moisture, rock moisture is a critical component of terrestrial water and carbon cycling. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"bedrock; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; transpiration; water storage; water use; woody plant; Article; bedrock; biome; California; carbon cycling; carbon storage; climate change; evapotranspiration; nonhuman; plant water use; precipitation; rock; soil moisture; soil water holding capacity; water deficit; woody plant; carbon cycle; chemistry; drought; evapotranspiration; geographic mapping; metabolism; plant; plant root; sediment; spatiotemporal analysis; Texas; United States; water supply; wood; California; United States; Matthiola; ground water; California; Carbon Cycle; Droughts; Geographic Mapping; Geologic Sediments; Groundwater; Plant Roots; Plant Transpiration; Plants; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Texas; United States; Water Resources; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114627596

Designing a high-performance electrocatalyst with a low limit potential and tunable reaction path is a critical challenge for CO2reduction. Two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured materials are considered as competitive catalysts for electrochemical reduction due to their large specific surface area and rich active sites. The current work theoretically evaluates four 2D MBene nanosheets as potential catalysts for CO2reduction. It is found that Mo2B2and Cr2B2show good catalytic selectivity due to their poor hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and low limit potential for CO2reduction. We found that the Gibbs energy increase for CHO formation is the highest on all MBenes. Among them, Mo2B2and Cr2B2maintain a lower limit potential with values of −0.45 and −0.5 eV, respectively. The electronic structure analysis demonstrates that the electron migration from MBene substrates to the antibonding states of adsorbates can lower the Gibbs free energy of hydrogenation reactions of intermediate products. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic structure; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Hydrogenation; Nanocatalysts; Reaction intermediates; Substrates; Critical challenges; Electrochemical reductions; Hydrogenation reactions; Intermediate product; Large specific surface areas; Theoretical evaluation; Two Dimensional (2 D); Value added products; Chromium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114593235

The industrial and urban symbiosis are patterns implementing Circular Economy that is to maximise the recycling and reuse of resources within a collaborative environment. However, the circularity rate of the system cannot reach 100 %. This is not a sufficient criterion for designing and operating symbiosis in an optimal way. The current work shows that it is crucial to consider the cost, resource, exergy and footprint implications explicitly, in a combined way, for finding the optimal circularity rate. The proposed model is applied to evaluate the trends of the total cost, exergy footprint, water and Greenhouse gas footprints. The case study on the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste is used as a demonstration for evaluating the trade-offs between the cost, Exergy Footprint and environmental footprints against the circularity rate. The results show an approximate 10 % difference between the optimal circularity rates for Water Footprint minimisation and cost/exergy input minimisation. The discrepancies between the footprint and cost optima point to the need for an integrated eco-cost model to account for the monetary penalties from pollution. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.","Industrial-Urban Symbiosis; Network Optimisation; Resource Integration; Resource Recovery","Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy resources; Exergy; Municipal solid waste; Waste treatment; Circular economy; Environmental footprints; Industrial symbiosis; Industrial-urban symbiosis; Minimisation; Network optimization; Resource demands; Resource recovery; Resources integrations; Urban symbiosis; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118470657

It relies on mobile near-ground atmospheric CH4 and CO2 mole fraction measurements across the corresponding atmospheric plumes downwind of these sources, on high-frequency meteorological measurements, and on a Gaussian plume dispersion model. The framework exploits the scatter of the positions of the individual plume cross sections, the integrals of the gas mole fractions above the background within these plume cross sections, and the variations of these integrals from one cross section to the other to infer the position and rate of the releases. It has been developed and applied to provide estimates of brief controlled CH4 and CO2 point source releases during a 1-week campaign in October 2018 at the TOTAL experimental platform TADI in Lacq, France. These releases typically lasted 4 to 8g€¯min and covered a wide range of rates (0.3 to 200g€¯gg€¯CH4/s and 0.2 to 150g€¯gg€¯CO2/s) to test the capability of atmospheric monitoring systems to react fast to emergency situations in industrial facilities. It also allowed testing of their capability to provide precise emission estimates for the application of climate change mitigation strategies. However, the low and highly varying wind conditions during the releases added difficulties to the challenge of characterizing the atmospheric transport over the very short duration of the releases. We present our series of CH4 and CO2 mole fraction measurements using instruments on board a car that drove along roads g1/450 to 150g€¯m downwind of the 40g€¯mg€¯×g€¯60g€¯m area for controlled releases along with the estimates of the release locations and rates. The comparisons of these results to the actual position and rate of the controlled releases indicate g1/410g€¯%-40g€¯% average errors (depending on the inversion configuration or on the series of tests) in the estimates of the release rates and g1/430-40g€¯m errors in the estimates of the release locations. These results are shown to be promising, especially since better results could be expected for longer releases and under meteorological conditions more favorable to local-scale dispersion modeling. However, the analysis also highlights the need for methodological improvements to increase the skill for estimating the source locations. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"atmospheric transport; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; methane; point source pollution; France; Lacq; Nouvelle-Aquitaine; Pyrenees Atlantiques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114877798

The provision of charging infrastructure in public spaces for electromobility - along with the substitution of conventional power generation by renewable energies - can contribute to the energy transition in the transport sector. Scenarios for the spatial distribution of this charging infrastructure can help to exemplify the need for charging points and their impact, for example on power grids. We model two kinds of demand for public charging infrastructure. First, we model the demand for public charging points to compensate for the lack of home charging points, which is derived from a previously developed and published model addressing electric-vehicle ownership (with and without home charging options) in households. Second, and in the focus of the work presented here, is the demand for public charging infrastructure at points of interest (POIs). Their locations are derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and weighted based on an evaluation of movement profiles from the Mobilität in Deutschland survey (MiD, German for ""Mobility in Germany""). We combine those two demands with the available parking spaces and generate distributions for possible future charging points. We use a raster-based approach in which all vector data are rasterized and computations are performed on a municipality's full grid. The presented application area is Wiesbaden, and the methodology is generally applicable to municipalities in Germany. The model is compared with three other models or model variants in a correlation comparison in order to determine the influence of certain model assumptions and input data. The identification of potential charging points in public spaces plays an important role in modeling the future energy system - especially the power grid - as the rapid adoption of electric vehicles will shift locations of electrical demand. With our investigation, we would like to present a new method to simulate future public charging point locations and show the influences of different modeling methods. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 technology which can convert CO2 into combustible compounds by using solar energy can solve both of the problems mentioned above. However, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 exhibits too low efficiency, especially under visible light. So, in order to improve the photocatalytic efficiency, the composite photocatalysts of TiO2 nanotube array (TNTA) sensitized by CdS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were successfully prepared by anodization method and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method in this work. And the composite photocatalysts exhibited a high performance for photocatalytic conversion of gas-phase CO2 to methanol under visible light. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the ingredients and morphologies of the synthesized photocatalysts. And, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS) revealed that CdS/ZnS QDs enhanced the photo-absorption of composite photocatalyst in the visible light region. The main product methanol yield of CdS/ZnS-TNTA under visible light was 2.73 times that of bare TNTA when TNTA was treated by 10 SILAR cycles. Meanwhile, the product yield first increased before decreasing with the increase of the CO2 flow rate. And the greatest product yield reached up to 255.49 nmol/(cm2-cat·h) with the increase of light intensity. The reaction mechanism was discussed in this paper. This high performance for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was primarily attributed to the CdS/ZnS QDs sensitization, which widens the response wavelength range of the catalyst to include visible light and partly inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","CO2 reduction; Photocatalysis; Quantum dots sensitization; TiO2 nanotube array; Visible light","Cadmium sulfide; Carbon dioxide; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Gases; II-VI semiconductors; Image enhancement; Light; Methanol; Nanocrystals; Photocatalytic activity; Photoelectricity; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconductor quantum dots; Solar energy; Titanium dioxide; CdS; CO$-2$/ reduction; Composite photocatalysts; Nanotube arrays; Photo-catalytic; Quantum dot sensitization; TiO$-2$/ nanotube; TiO2 nanotube array; Visible light; ZnS quantum dots; Nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111985718

In this paper, we aim at capturing fluctuations in momentary wellbeing and behaviour in response to changes in the ambient environment. This is achieved using a multisensor fusion approach that simultaneously collected urban environmental factors (e.g. including PM10, PM2.5, PM1.0, Noise, Reducing gases, NH3), body reactions (physiological reactions including EDA, HR and HRV) and users perceived responses (e.g. self-reported geo-tagged valence). Our approach leverages an exploratory data visualisation along with geometrical and spatial data analysis algorithms, allowing spatial and temporal comparisons of data clusters in relation to people's wellbeing. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a positive correlation between environmental factors and physiology reactions. By implementing spatial visualisation with our real-world data shows the potential opportunities to understand how the environment can effect mental wellbeing. © 2021 IEEE.","Environment; Urban; Visualisation; Voronoi; Wellbeing","Ammonia; Data visualization; Environmental technology; Physiological models; Pollution; Sensor data fusion; Visualization; Environment; Environmental factors; Environmental sensing; Miniaturized electronics; Sensing technology; Sensor fusion; Urban; Voronoi; Weather monitoring; Wellbeing; Physiology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118128051

One of the requirements in establishing independence is ensuring ""good governance,"" an important facet of which is establishing a stable and adequate food supply. This is framed globally as achieving Sustainable Development Goal Two (SDG #2) to end hunger and malnutrition. This article seeks to assess the measures that government and major donors have taken to implement SDG #2 in Bougainville using a pressure-state-response framework and desktop-based risk assessment to identify areas for further work. The investigation aims to identify effective policy focus areas in order to better implement SDG #2, namely, prioritising civil conflict avoidance, facilitating adaptation planning for climate regime shifts, and ensuring sustainable agricultural intensity and fisheries extraction. Based on these, recommendations for good governance include sustainable and equitable long-term interventions that reduce the risk of political disturbance and environmental degradation. As a result of engaging in this case, readers will be able to apply similar methodologies to inform development decisions in postconflict contexts. Bougainville faces similar challenges to many Pacific islands, including the impacts from climate change, food insecurity, conflict, population growth, and changing land tenure.

Based on unique observational data sets from six supersites in eastern China during 2019-2021, we found that the lockdown caused considerable decreases (32-61%) in different secondary aerosol components in the study region because of similar-degree precursor reductions. However, due to insufficient combustion-related volatile organic compound (VOC) reduction, odd oxygen (Ox= O3+ NO2) concentration, an indicator of the extent of photochemical processing, showed little change and did not promote more decreases in secondary aerosols. We also found that the Chinese provinces and international cities that experienced reduced Oxduring the lockdown usually gained a greater simultaneous PM2.5decrease than other provinces and cities with an increased Ox. Therefore, we argue that strict VOC control in winter, which has been largely ignored so far, is critical in future policies to mitigate winter haze more efficiently by reducing Oxsimultaneously. © 2021 American Chemical Society","atmospheric odd oxygen; COVID-19; ozone; secondary aerosol; VOCs","Emission control; Oxygen; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric oxidation; Emission reduction; Gaseous precursors; Non-linear response; Observational data; Photochemical processing; Simultaneous reduction; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Aerosols; ammonium nitrate; ammonium sulfate; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; volatile organic compound; oxygen; COVID-19; haze; oxygen; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; winter; aerosol; air monitoring; air quality; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric transport; China; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; flame ionization detection; haze; lockdown; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; photochemistry; photolysis; quadrupole mass spectrometry; reduction (chemistry); relative humidity; urban area; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; prevention and control; China; Indicator indicator; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Oxygen; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114616472

Despite the previous achievements, mechanistic insights of doping regulation in TMCs for electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, we provide a systematic overview of doping regulation in TMCs in terms of background, preparation, impacts on physicochemical properties, and typical applications including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and N2 reduction reaction. Notably, we bridge the understanding between the doping regulation of catalysts and their catalytic activities via focusing on the physicochemical properties of catalysts from the aspects of vacancy concentrations, phase transformation, surface wettability, electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, local charge distribution, tunable adsorption strength, and multiple adsorption configurations.

This study, focusing on rural China, one of the fastest growing economies with a massive population, explored the carbon footprint and inequality of household consumption using the latest micro household survey data of 2018 linked to environmental extended input-output analysis. The results show that in 2018 in rural China, the average household carbon footprint is 2.46 tons CO2-eq per capita, which is around one-third of China’s average footprint, indicating the large potential for further growth. Housing (45.32%), transportation (20.45%), and food (19.62%) are the dominant contributors to the carbon footprint. Meanwhile, great inequality, with a Gini coefficient of 0.488, among rural households is observed, which is largely due to differences in type of house built or purchased (explaining 24.44% of the variation), heating (18.10%), car purchase (12.44%), and petrol consumption (12.44%). Provinces, average education, and nonfarm income are among the important factors influencing the inequality. In the process of urbanization and rural revitalization, there is a high possibility that the household carbon footprint continues to increase, maintaining high levels of inequality. The current energy transition toward less carbon-intensive fuels in rural China is likely to dampen the growth rates of carbon footprints and potentially decrease inequality. Carbon intensity decrease could significantly reduce carbon footprints, but increase inequality. More comprehensive measures to reduce carbon footprint and inequality are needed, including transitioning to clean energy, poverty alleviation, reduction of income inequality, and better health care coverage. © 2021 American Chemical Society","carbon footprint; EEIOA; household consumption; inequality; microlevel data","Economic analysis; Emission control; Heating; Population statistics; Rural areas; Surveys; Sustainable development; Gini coefficients; Household Consumption; Household surveys; Income inequality; Input output analysis; Petrol consumption; Poverty alleviation; Sustainable society; Carbon footprint; carbon dioxide; coal; gasoline; liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; carbon emission; carbon footprint; emission control; environmental economics; household survey; input-output analysis; rural area; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; economic inequality; energy consumption; Gini coefficient; heating; household; household income; housing; human; normal human; Review; rural area; urbanization; family size; income; rural population; urbanization; China; Carbon Footprint; China; Family Characteristics; Humans; Income; Rural Population; Urbanization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114050785

However, the luminescence tuning of Bi3+ is a huge challenge, restricting its application. In this work, we regulate the emission of Bi3+ through the topochemical design of the ligand configuration and means of excitation-driven. When the ratio of Nb5+/Ta5+ in the host is changed, the dissymmetry in the lattice configuration of the two cations (Nb5+/Ta5+) makes the crystal electron cloud expand, and the nephelauxetic effect increases the bond length between the activator (Bi3+) and ligand (O2-) in the host, thereby reducing the field splitting energy of Bi3+, and the blue shift of Bi3+ emission is realized. When Bi3+ replaces Y3+, Bi3+ and O2- form an irregular twisted octahedron, and each Bi3+ with a different lattice configuration is a luminescent site. The emission peak of Bi3+ can be red-shifted from 419 nm to 473 nm and is excitation-driven. On the basis of the tunable luminescence characteristics of the phosphor, a white-emitting single-phase phosphor (YNb0.2Ta0.8O4:Bi3+,Eu3+) with adjustable corrected color temperature (CCT) was prepared by building Bi3+-Eu3+energy transfer. Even more surprising is that Eu3+ appears at zero thermal-quenching, and the emission intensity increases with increasing temperature. The emission intensity of Bi3+ can reach 62.3% at 423 K, and the phosphor can still emit warm-white light at a high temperature of 443 K. Furthermore, on the basis of the unique zero thermal quenching characteristics of Eu3+, a non-contact optical temperature sensing phosphor (YNb0.8Ta0.2O4:Bi3+,Eu3+) was prepared. The material shows good temperature measurement performance in the temperature range of 303-523 K, and the relative sensitivity Sr reaches 1.80% K-1. This topochemical design of ligand configuration provides a new perspective for the development of high-performance phosphors with tunable emission. © the Partner Organisations.",,"Bismuth; Blue shift; Bond length; Energy transfer; Ligands; Lighting; Luminescence; Phosphors; Quenching; Red Shift; Temperature measurement; Increasing temperatures; Lattice configuration; Luminescence properties; Luminescent material; Nephelauxetic effect; Optical temperature sensing; Relative sensitivity; Tunable luminescences; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113742009

High-sensitivity and wide-temperature-range dual-mode optical thermometry was exploited taking advantage of the diverse thermal quenching between Mn4+ and Dy3+ and the decay lifetime of Mn4+. The thermometric properties in the range of 298-673 K were investigated by utilizing the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of Dy3+ (4F9/2 → 6H13/2)/Mn4+ (2Eg → 4A2g) and the Mn4+ (2Eg → 4A2g) lifetime under 351 nm and 453 nm excitation, respectively. The maximum relative sensitivities (SR) of the resultant SLLT:1.2%Mn4+,7%Dy3+ phosphor under 351 nm and 453 nm excitation employing the FIR technology were determined to be 1.60% K-1 at 673 K and 1.44% K-1 at 673 K, respectively. Additionally, the maximum SR values based on the lifetime-mode were 1.59% K-1 at 673 K and 2.18% K-1 at 673 K, respectively. It is noteworthy that the SR values can be manipulated by different excitation wavelengths and multi-modal optical thermometry.

Since their size is negligible versus the size of the whole system, they are encouraged to group into energy communities such as microgrids (MG). They operate parallel to the rest of the system and their operation is driven by market signals with the goal of minimizing energy costs for MG stakeholders by utilizing available resources in their portfolio. The complexity of optimizing MG operation increases with the introduction of additional energy vectors and their interaction with the electricity sector, but also with the possibility to provide services on multiple markets and on different time horizons. In the paper we consider different decarbonization strategies of several MGs, modelling 3 main cases: full electrification, gas-heat-electricity and electricity-hydrogen coupling. While each of these options can separately achieve savings, cooperation between different MGs can bring additional benefits for all involved parties. To evaluate these benefits we propose a stochastic two-stage mixed integer linear model for multi MG cooperation and bring the conclusions on the value of their joint market participation through several exchange scenarios. This is expressed through operational costs savings on annual and daily basis as well as through other metrics such as self sufficiency and CO2 savings. © 2021 IEEE.","Cooperation; Microgrid; Multi-energy; Stochastic optimization","Heating; Microgrids; Power markets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Cooperation; Cooperative scheduling; End-users; Energy; Household level; Microgrid; Multi energy; Power; Stochastic optimizations; Uncertainty; Electric industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116717839

The stable isotopic composition of methane (I13C and I2H) allows us to distinguish between the different CH4 origins. A significant part of the European CH4 emissions, 3.6ĝ€¯% in 2018, comes from coal extraction in Poland, the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) being the main hotspot. Measurements of CH4 mole fraction (χ(CH4)), I13C, and I2H in CH4 in ambient air were performed continuously during 6 months in 2018 and 2019 at Krakow, Poland, in the east of the USCB. In addition, air samples were collected during parallel mobile campaigns, from multiple CH4 sources in the footprint area of the continuous measurements. The resulting isotopic signatures from sampled plumes allowed us to distinguish between natural gas leaks, coal mine fugitive emissions, landfill and sewage, and ruminants. The use of I2H in CH4 is crucial to distinguish the fossil fuel emissions in the case of Krakow because their relatively depleted I13C values overlap with the ones of microbial sources. The observed χ(CH4) time series showed regular daily night-Time accumulations, sometimes combined with irregular pollution events during the day. The isotopic signatures of each peak were obtained using the Keeling plot method and generally fall in the range of thermogenic CH4 formation-with I13C between-59.3g and-37.4g Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB) and I2H between-291g and-137g Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (V-SMOW). They compare well with the signatures measured for gas leaks in Krakow and USCB mines. The CHIMERE transport model was used to compute the CH4 and isotopic composition time series in Krakow, based on two emission inventories. The magnitude of the pollution events is generally underestimated in the model, which suggests that emission rates in the inventories are too low. The simulated isotopic source signatures, obtained with Keeling plots on each simulated peak, indicate that a higher contribution from fuel combustion sources in the EDGAR v5.0 inventory would lead to a better agreement than when using CAMS-REG-GHG v4.2 (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service REGional inventory for Air Pollutants and GreenHouse Gases). The isotopic mismatches between model and observations are mainly caused by uncertainties in the assigned isotopic signatures for each source category and the way they are classified in the inventory. These uncertainties are larger for emissions close to the study site, which are more heterogenous than the ones advected from the USCB coal mines. Our isotope approach proves to be very sensitive in this region, thus helping to evaluate emission estimates. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"coal mine; emission inventory; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; measurement method; methane; point source; pollution incidence; pollution monitoring; uncertainty analysis; Cracow; Malopolskie; Poland [Central Europe]; Belemnoidea; Ruminantia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114611945

Glaciers have undergone dynamic processes in response to a warming climate that impacts the surface geometry and mass distribution of glacial ice. Until recently no single technique could consistently measure the evolution of surface flow for an entire glaciated region in three dimensions with high temporal and spatial resolution. We have improved upon earlier methods by developing a technique for mapping, in unprecedented detail, the temporal evolution of glaciers. Our software computes north, east, and vertical flow velocity and/or displacement time series from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ascending and descending range and azimuth speckle offsets. The software can handle large volumes of satellite data and is designed to work on high-performance computers (HPCs) as well as workstations by utilizing multiple parallelization methods. We then compute flow velocity-displacement time series for glaciers in southeastern Alaska during 2016-2021 and observe seasonal and interannual variations in flow velocities at Seward and Malaspina glaciers as well as culminating phases of surging at Klutlan, Walsh, and Kluane glaciers. On a broader scale, this technique can be used for reconstructing the response of worldwide glaciers to the warming climate using archived SAR data and for near-real-time monitoring of these glaciers using rapid revisit SAR data from satellites, such as Sentinel-1 (6 or 12ĝ€¯d revisit period) and the forthcoming NISAR mission (12ĝ€¯d revisit period). © 2021 The Author(s).",,"flow velocity; runoff; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; synthetic aperture radar; temporal evolution; three-dimensional modeling; Canada; Kluane; Yukon Territory; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114611722

The two complexes share the same molecular skeleton, complex 2 being derived from complex 1 through the addition of fluoro and tert-butyl substituents, but present notable differences in their photophysical properties. The remarkable difference in their emission quantum yields (0.196 for complex 1 in dichloromethane and 0.71 for complex 2 in acetonitrile) has been evaluated by characterizing both radiative and nonradiative decay paths. It has emerged that the probability of decaying through the nonradiative triplet metal-centered state, normally associated with the loss of the emission quantum yield, does not appear to be the reason behind the reported substantially different emission efficiency. A more critical factor appears to be the ability of complex 2 to emit from both the usual metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state and from two additional ligand-centered states, as supported by the fact that the respective minima belong to the potential energy surface of the lowest triplet T1 state and that their phosphorescence lifetimes are in the same order of magnitude. In contrast, the emission of complex 1 can be originated only from the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state, being the only emissive T1 minimum. The results constitute a significant case in which the emission from ligand-centered states is the key for determining the high emission quantum yield of a complex. © 2021 The Authors.

Electrocatalytic generation of CO by cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalysts modulates signaling pathways mediated by a CO receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase. Furthermore, by tuning the applied voltage during electrocatalysis, we explore the effect of the CO release kinetics on CO-dependent neuronal signaling.

For this reason, engine manufacturers have been developing a method to effectively assess engine performances and emissions under a wide range of transient conditions. Transient engine performances can be evaluated efficiently by applying time-series data created by chirp signals. However, when the time-series data produced by the chirp signal are used directly, the engine hardware may damage, and emission performances deteriorate drastically. It is therefore essential to develop a method to avoid these undesirable operating conditions. This work aims to develop an algorithm to avoid such unrealistic operation conditions for engine performance evaluation. A virtual diesel engine (VDE) model is developed based on a four-cylinder engine using GT-POWER software. The manipulated variables are fuel injection parameters, throttle valve angle, EGR valve angle, and variable nozzle turbocharger (VNT) positions. The engine speed is used as an external input. Excess-air ratio, intake and exhaust pressure and temperature, and maximum pressure rise rate are state variables. Manipulated variables and external inputs are set for each state variable and varied sequentially. Therefore, various unrealistic operating conditions can be determined. The threshold values are changed by observing the state variables and the frequency of manipulated variables using chirp signals. The chirp signal is changed sequentially to avoid unrealistic operations when a state variable exceeds the threshold during the simulation. The results using the developed algorithm show that the unrealistic operating conditions of the diesel engine can be avoided, and the engine operations under transient conditions can be efficiently obtained. © 2021 SAE International.

On the one hand legislation tightening is asking for simultaneous emission reduction and efficiency increase, on the other hand the complexity of the powertrain is increasing due to the spreading of electrification. Those factors are pushing for strong design parallelization and frontloading, thus requiring engine calibration to be moved much earlier in the V-Cycle. In this context, this paper shows how, coupling well known physical 1D engine models featuring predictive combustion and emission models with a fully physical aftertreatment system model and longitudinal vehicle model, a powerful virtual test rig can be built. This virtual test rig can be used for powertrain virtual calibration activities with reduced requirement in terms of experimental data. This work moved from an already developed and validated powertrain and vehicle model featuring a 1.6-liter diesel engine Fast Running Model (FRM) with DIPulse predictive combustion and emissions model. On one hand, the engine model was calibrated on 29 steady state operating points and validated on a full engine map, showing a maximum error below 5% on Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and an average error around 20% for NOx emissions. On the other hand, the vehicle and aftertreatment model, composed by Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and Selective Catalyst Reduction on Filter (SCRoF), was validated on the Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) in terms of fuel consumption, engine-out and tailpipe NOx emissions. This virtual test rig was then used to optimize the engine calibration in a fully automated way, exploiting NSGA-III (Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) and strong parallelization capabilities. The optimization considered different design constraints, including also the combustion noise and was performed over a set of Key Points (KPs) representative of the engine operating conditions along WLTC, RTS95, US06 and FTP75. 10 independent variables were considered including both fuel injection and air management control variables. Output of the optimization was the Pareto front BSFC-Noise-NOx per each operating point. This intermediate result could directly be used by calibration engineers to select the most appropriate calibration set. Moreover, the Pareto fronts were used in an additional optimization loop to develop various calibration sets, each of which with a different weight for NOx emissions and engine fuel consumption. Finally, the optimized engine calibrations were assessed over the WLTC. The fully virtual approach was so demonstrated to be capable to achieve comparable results with respect to traditional experimental engine calibration methods at a fraction of time and cost and before any vehicle experimental activity. © 2021 SAE International.

In particular, oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and particulate matter (PM) have been controlled using two separate systems, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and the catalyze diesel particulate filter (CDPF), or the functionality has been combined into a single device producing the SCR on filter (SCRoF). The SCRoF forgoes beneficial NO2 production present in the CDPF to avoid NH3 oxidation which occurs when using platinum group metals (PGM) for oxidation. In this study, mixed-metal oxides are shown to oxidize NO to NO2 without appreciable NH3 oxidation. This selectivity leads to enhanced performance when combined with a typical Cu-zeolite catalyst. Ce was co-precipitated with Zr, La, Sn and Pr at different ratios and doped with Cu or Fe. 0.5% Fe on Ce0.8Zr0.2OX and Ce0.75Pr0.25OX oxidized 30% of incoming NO at 350 °C while oxidizing < 5% of the NH3 in a synthetic exhaust environment, demonstrating possible formulations that allow enhanced NO2 derived soot oxidation compatible with an SCRoF. The selected formulations were washcoated onto state-of-the-art filter substrates and soot loaded using a realistic burner-based method to achieve representative soot-catalyst contacting within the filter. When combined with a typical Cu-zeolite catalyst, the mixed metal oxides increased both soot oxidation and NOX conversion relative to a standard SCRoF.

This technology uses ammonia as a reducing agent, which is obtained injecting an ammonia carrier into the exhaust gas stream. The dosing of the ammonia carrier, usually AdBlue, is the major concern during the design and engine calibration phases, since the interaction between the injected liquid and the components of the exhaust system can lead to the undesired formation of solid deposits. To avoid this, the thermal and kinematic interaction between the spray and the components of the after treatment system (ATS) must be modeled accurately. In this work, the authors developed a Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) framework to model the kinetic and thermal interaction among the spray, the eventual liquid layer and the pipe walls. The Nukiyama curve has been embedded in the calculation of the heat flux between the droplet and the walls to limit the heat transfer in the proximity of the Leidenfrost point and in the transition region. To validate this model, an experimental data set was provided by EMPA (CH) and used for comparison with calculated values. The measurement of the thermal footprint of the spray have been performed on the back of a thin plate where the spray impinges. Several injections have been considered with the intent of showing the transition to the different interaction regimes. The simulations performed show that after the initial cooling of the wall, due to impingement, a liquid film is formed, which is then dragged along the plate. As the number of injection progresses, the effect of the transition between the different evaporation regimes translates into high temperature gradients on the back of the plate. The comparison with the experimental data both in terms of temperature and temperature gradient shows a good agreement with the experiments, showing the capabilities of the model developed to predict the temperature drop. © 2021 SAE International.

Diluting the in-cylinder mixture can improve the efficiency of the engines. To prove the validity of lean burn in hydrogen IC engines, three different combustion modes are investigated in this study. The engine experiments are conducted in a spray-guided direct-injection (DI) spark-ignition engine with 10 MPa of hydrogen DI. When lean burn is applied to a hydrogen IC engine, the characteristics of pumping and heat transfer loss improve. The improvement in heat transfer loss is more significant than the reduction in negative pumping work for the indicated thermal efficiency. Among the three combustion modes, stratified charge combustion (SCC) develops the maximum indicated mean effective pressure. However, this mode deteriorates the combustion stability slightly. The nitrogen oxide emission is reduced when the excess air ratio is increased. However, a certain amount of NOx is emitted because of the locally rich mixture in SCC.

It is now possible to design powertrains using not only the highly efficient internal combustion engines (ICE) but also the newly developed electrical motors (eMotor) and batteries. This variety of technologies allows the design of sophisticated powertrain to better fulfill the requests not only regarding CO2 regulations but also of different markets, customer expectations and emission legislations.

It is assumed that a significant proportion of these cars will be hybrid vehicles in the future. As a result, in order to implement future requirements for improved air pollution control (Post EU6/Zero Impact) and CO2 reduction, consideration of these aspects must be an integral part of the application and of development activities in general. At TU Darmstadt, a consistent method for the development of powertrains with regard to their relevant real-world driving emissions - the Most Relevant Testing Procedure (MRTP), was established. This paper demonstrates how the described method can be used for the integrated application of an operating strategy for hybrid vehicles. For this purpose, the MRTP is first run through and explained with a C-segment P2-hybrid vehicle serving as a use-case. Subsequently, it is shown how the knowledge generated during the course of this process can be utilized to incorporate it into the operating strategy. This is achieved using an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), in which emission-critical states, which are derived through machine-learning principles, are included into the ECMS-defining cost function. The special feature of this approach is that the derived, basic operating strategy is not generated specifically for the individual use-case, but as part of general powertrain characterization process without additional application effort. In this way, an emission-minimizing basic operating strategy is created automatically, so to speak, under relevant operating conditions. The emission reduction potential of the method are demonstrated for the selected use case. © 2021 Technical University of Darmstadt.",,"Carbon dioxide; Competition; Emission control; Hybrid vehicles; Powertrains; CO2 reduction; Impact reduction; Integrated emissions; Market share; Novel testing; Operating strategy; Strategy development; Testing methodology; Testing procedure; Transport sectors; Cost functions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116045477

While the engine performance and exhaust emissions of isobaric combustion are well known, the overall flame development, in particular, the flow-field details within the flames are unclear. In this study, the performance analysis of CDC and two isobaric combustion cases was conducted, followed by high-speed imaging of Mie-scattering and soot luminosity in an optically accessible, single-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine. From the soot luminosity imaging, qualitative flow-fields were obtained using flame image velocimetry (FIV). The peak motoring pressure (PMP) and peak cylinder pressure (PCP) of CDC are kept fixed at 50 and 70 bar, respectively. The two isobaric combustion cases, achieved using multiple injections, are maintained at the CDC PMP level of 50 bar for the low-pressure case (IsoL) and CDC PCP level of 70 bar for the high-pressure case (IsoH). For each operating condition, soot luminosity signals are captured at a frame rate of 20 kHz, and a semi-quantitative velocity flow-field is obtained from FIV post-processing. Consistent with previous metal engine experiments, isobaric combustion - in particular IsoH, resulted in similar gross indicated efficiency, lower heat losses but higher exhaust losses, compared to CDC. The soot luminosity images of CDC show initial signals originated close to the bowl-wall for certain jets while for the isobaric combustion, the flames corresponding to each jet are clearly distinguished during the earlier flame development process. The vector field distribution within the flames shows the transition of flame-wall impingement to flame-flame interaction regions between the neighboring jets for each combustion mode.

Under steady state ? sweep, the methane conversion efficiency is high at exact stoichiometric, and decreases steeply under both slightly rich and slightly lean conditions. Transient lean to rich transitions can improve methane conversion at the rich side. Previous experimental work has attributed the enhanced methane conversion to activation of methane steam reforming. The steam reforming rate, however, attenuates over time and the methane conversion rate gradually converges to the low steady state values. In this work, a reactor model is established to predict steady state and transient transition characteristics of a three-way catalyst (TWC) mounted in the exhaust of a natural gas heavy-duty engine. In total 17 global reactions are selected and implemented in the reactor model, including oxidation reactions, NOx related reactions, water gas shift and steam reforming, and ceria oxygen storage related reactions. Inhibition factors are introduced to model the competition of different species for active sites. To model the transient enhancement of methane conversion, an activation and deactivation mechanism of methane steam reforming based on active ceria sites is proposed and developed. Both lean to rich and rich to lean ? transitions are simulated and compared with engine experiment results. The proposed model captures key characteristic behaviors of the TWC in both steady state ? sweep and transient ? transitions.

Moreover, since vehicle connectivity has spread more and more in the last years, a vehicle-to-network (V2N) communication system has been taken into account to retrieve real-time navigation data from a map service provider and thus reconstructing the so-called electronic horizon, which is a reconstruction of the future conditions of the vehicle on the road ahead. The speed profile and the road slope are used as input for an on-board predictive control strategy of a plug-in HEV (PHEV). In particular, a dedicated algorithm predicts the amount of necessary energy to complete the city event in full-electric mode, giving a state of charge (SoC) target value. With this aim, an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS) has been modified to use navigation data for approaching the ZEZ with the target SoC.

And the microscopic characteristics of the impinging spray have a close relation with the fuel film formation, which has a direct effect on the engine performance and emissions. Therefore, figuring out the droplet behaviors of the impinging spray is significantly important for improving the engine performance and reducing emissions. However, the microscopic characteristics of the impinging spray have not been deeply understood and the differences between the impinging and free spray are seldom mentioned in previous study. Therefore, particle image analysis (PIA) technique was applied to detect the microscopic characteristics at the capture location in order to track the droplet behaviors of the spray tip during the propagation process. Toluene as the test fuel is injected by a mini-sac injector with a single hole in this work. Firstly, the difference of the impinging and free spray is compared at three spray tip locations. Secondly, the droplet behaviors of the impinging spray were further acquired at five locations. Results showed that compared to the free spray, the impinging spray had smaller velocities at all penetration locations, which was caused by the interaction between spray and impingement wall. And the droplet diameter and Weber number (We) of the impinging and free spray were also analyzed. Moreover, droplet spatial distribution of the impinging spray was investigated.

Mechanically the engine employs a self-pressurizing air-cooled rotor system (SPARCS) configured to provide improved cooling versus a simple air-cooled rotor arrangement. The novelty of the SPARCS system is that it uses the fact that blowby past the sealing grid is inevitable in a Wankel engine as a means of increasing the density of the medium used for cooling the rotor. Unfortunately, the design also means that when the engine is shutdown, due to the overpressure within the engine core and the fact that fuel vapour and lubricating oil are to be found within it, unburned hydrocarbons can leak into the combustion chambers, and thence to the atmosphere via either or both of the intake and exhaust ports. As well as shutdown it also affects the startup process, where higher hydrocarbon emissions are caused due to the forced transfer of the unburned gases to the intake and exhaust ducts as the core depressurizes across the sealing grid when it is stationary. These emissions then sit in those volumes, possibly then escaping to the outside world; clearly this is also very important with respect to the SHED testing of any vehicle the engine might be fitted to. The SPARCS concept is discussed with respect to how it functions versus a conventional wet sump arrangement (as employed by oil cooled rotor Wankel engines). Measurements are taken and steady-state emissions and fuel consumption results with and without pressurization of the core are presented; such a comparison has not been made before. In general, power output, brake specific fuel consumption, hydrocarbon emissions, and combustion efficiency are all better with a depressurized core, with only small improvements in cooling (defined by rotor air inlet temperature) being apparent when it is pressurized. A hypothesis for why this should be so is developed, the knowledge of which can help to guide further development. The reasons for the engine on/off hydrocarbon issue are apparent. Using a solenoid valve as a means of venting the rotor core pressure directly to the engine intake just before shutdown is proposed as a means of alleviating this problem. This approach would feed the hydrocarbon-rich gases from the core through the combustion process and out through the catalytic converter just before the engine is switched off. In automotive applications this engine is to be used as a range extender and hence there is a great degree of control regarding all modes of its operation, including startup and shutdown, which is the approach investigated for mitigation here. The results show that depressurizing the core in this manner results in a maximum reduction in total hydrocarbon emissions during warm shutdown and restart of 80% and 60%, respectively. However, it must be remembered that with the pressure relieved in the core, the cooling capability there is slightly reduced, and so the approach has to be calibrated correctly to achieve the best result for the whole system. Further investigation into the optimum level of pressurization is recommended. © 2021 SAE International.

In this context, the strict control of pollutant emissions at the cold start will become a crucial point to comply with the new regulation standards. This will necessarily require the implementation of novel strategies to speed-up the light-off of the reactions occurring in the after-treatment system, since the cold start conditions are the most critical one for cumulative emissions. Among the different possible technological solutions, this paper focuses on the evaluation of the potential of a burner system, which is activated before the engine start. The hypothetical burner exploits the lean combustion of an air-gasoline mixture to generate a high temperature gas stream which is directed to the catalyst section promoting a fast heating of the substrate. In this work, an experimental test bench has been adopted to characterize the thermal transient of the after-treatment system when the burner-like system is activated, monitoring the temperature of the gas flow and the temperature of the metallic walls at different locations. Moreover, a CFD model has been developed to investigate the light-off of the reactions during the initial operation of the burner and the subsequent start of the engine. The model, developed on the basis of the OpenFOAM code, resorts to a multi-region approach, where different meshes are employed to describe the fluid domain and the solid regions, namely the catalytic porous substrates and the metallic walls constituting pipes and canning. Specific submodels are implemented to consider flow resistance, heat transfer, mass transfer and catalytic reactions occurring in the catalyst region. The CFD framework has been initially validated on the experimental data acquired on the test bench. The methodology has been then applied to the preliminary analysis of the catalyst light-off at engine cold start, considering a full exhaust line equipped with burner-like system. © 2021 SAE International.

In particular, the cold start and catalyst heating conditions are crucial for modern cars because is when most of the emissions are produced. One interesting strategy to reduce the time required for catalyst heating is post-oxidation. It consists in operating the engine with a rich in-cylinder mixture and completing the oxidation of fuel inside the exhaust manifold. The result is an increase in temperature and enthalpy of the gases in the exhaust, therefore heating the three-way-catalyst. The following investigation focuses on the implementation of post-oxidation by means of scavenging in a four-cylinder, turbocharged, direct injection spark ignition engine. The investigation is based on detailed measurements that are carried out at the test-bench. Due to the complexity of the investigated phenomenon, the analysis at the test-bench has been sustained by 3D-CFD simulations. At first a 3D-CFD full-engine model has been implemented to reproduce the complete engine from the air-box up to the turbine inlet. This model is able to simulate all the relevant full-engine effects like scavenging, cylinder-to-cylinder interaction and local inhomogeneity inside the cylinder. The second implemented model focuses on the exhaust manifold, from the exhaust valve up to the turbine volute, and it is characterized by a fine computational grid and by the implementation of a chemical reaction mechanism. Both models have been validated using the detailed measurements of the test-bench. The simulation matched precisely the measurements and enabled a better interpretation of experimental data. The simulation methodology has been applied also to other engine operating points enabling a mapping of post-oxidation, the development of a post-oxidation model for 1D engine simulation and the implementation of a simplified model for the full-engine simulation. © 2021 SAE International.

This is due to the use of large auxiliary power systems on ships operating during port stays, as well as to the employment of a number of fossil fuel powered road vehicles required for port operations. The environmental impact related to the use of these vehicles is twofold: on one hand, they contribute directly to port emissions by fuel consumption; on the other hand, they require some of the ship auxiliary systems to operate intensively, such as the ventilation system, which must operate to remove the pollutants produced by the vehicle engines inside the ship. The pathway to achieve decarbonization and mitigation of energy use in ports involves therefore the adoption of alternative and cleaner technology solutions for the propulsion systems of such port vehicles. This paper presents the performance analysis of a hydrogen powered cargo-handling vehicle for roll-on and roll-off port operations in a real case scenario. The fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain of the vehicle has been previously designed by the authors. On the base of real data acquired during an on-field measurement campaign, and by means of a validated numerical model of the vehicle dynamics, different mission profiles are defined, in terms of driving and duty cycles, in order to represent typical port operations. A rule-based energy management strategy is then used to estimate the energy and hydrogen consumptions required by the vehicle and to assess its suitability to accomplish the defined target port operations. Outputs from this study show the potential of the proposed solution to take the place, in a foreseeable future, of conventional Diesel-engine vehicles, today commonly used in port logistics, towards a zero-emission scenario. © 2021 SAE International.

New ignition systems are being developed to extend the engine stable operating range towards increasing lean conditions. Among these, the Radio-Frequency corona igniters represent an interesting solution for the capability to promote the combustion in a much wider region than the one involved by the traditional spark channel. Moreover, the flame kernel development is enhanced by means of the production of non-thermal plasma, where low-temperature active radicals are ignition promoters. However, at low pressure and at high voltage the low temperature plasma benefits can be lost due to occurrences of spark-like events. Recently, RF barrier discharge igniters (BDI) have been investigated for the ability to prevent the arc formation thanks to a strong-breakdown resistance. In this way, the plasma benefits are maintained over an extended range of operation compared to other LTP corona igniters, like RF corona-streamer igniters (CSI). The aim of the present work is to compare the combustion development of a conventional spark and a barrier discharge igniter through computational fluid dynamics simulations in an optical access SI engine, using RANS approach for the turbulence. Computational results are able to reproduce the faster burn rate generated by the BDI in the initial stage of the combustion compared to the traditional spark. © 2021 SAE International.

The global emissions of gas in the past 10 years have increased tremendously due to lack of disposal routes. This was brought to 190 nations’ attention in the Kyoto Protocol for the need of emission control measures to reduce its impacts of climate change and global warming. Various novel techniques have surfaced to tackle this issue, such as non-thermal plasma (NTP) which includes radio frequency plasma, microwave plasma, dielectric barrier discharge, and electron beam. The main by-products resulting from the decomposition of SF6 by these techniques are sulfur oxyfluorides, sulfur dioxide, hydrofluoric acid, and fluorine gas. This environmental and health effects as well as global emission of SF6 gas are considered a threat to humans and the climate, where modern disposal methods of contaminated SF6 gas and its by-products should replace the conventional approaches.

The Raman spectra illustrated that appropriate Co2+ substitution was beneficial to the ordered structure. Additionally, the relative permittivity of the sample was mainly affected by the porosity and ionic polarizability, and the quality factor is determined by the microstructure, bond energy and packing fraction, and the τf value is correlated with bond valence of W-O. This study showed how the Co2+ substitution not only reduces the dielectric loss and the signal delay time, but also improves the temperature stability.

Targeted regulation of excitons dissociation into free charges is an effective measure to improve the utilization of carriers and enhance photocatalytic activity. Here we designed the ultra-thin g-C3N4 nanosheets modified with rich N vacancies (Nv-rich-CN) through molecular self-assembly and molecular intercalation strategies. N vacancies can effectively dissociate excitons into free charges. The electron concentration of the Nv-rich-CN is 3.24 times that of bulk g-C3N4 (CN). Benefiting from the enhanced carrier utilization, Nv-rich-CN showed superior activity for CO2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a photophysical model of exciton dissociation. Theoretical calculation results explained that the essential reason for the vacancy to promote exciton dissociation may be that the lack of local order provided a driving force for exciton dissociation. Besides, N vacancies acted as active sites in the process of CO2 reduction, promoting the adsorption and activation of CO2 by the photocatalyst. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy revealed the change of intermediate products during the reduction of CO2. This work focuses on the contribution of excitons in the photocatalytic process and provides a novel idea for enhancing the carrier utilization of photocatalysts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Active sites; Exciton dissociation; g-C3N4 with N vacancies; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction","Absorption spectroscopy; Carbon nitride; Dissociation; Excitons; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Photocatalytic activity; Active site; CO$-2$/ reduction; Exciton dissociation; Free charge; G-C3N4 with N vacancy; Graphitic carbon nitrides; N vacancy; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction; Photocatalytic process; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103729410

The reaction pathway is reasonably proposed based on a series of in-situ characterization results: the in-situ DRIFTS determined key reaction intermediates, electronic property of Au under excitation state and the critical role of VO.

Sensor networking advancement with quality and quantity of environmental data has given rise to increasing techniques and methodologies supporting spatiotemporal data interactive visualisation analyses. Moreover, Visualisation (Vis) and Visual Analytics (VA) of spatiotemporal data have become essential for research, policymakers, and industries to improve energy efficiency, environmental management, and cities' air pollution planning. A platform covering Vis and VA of spatiotemporal data collected from a city helps to portray such techniques' potential in exploring crucial environmental inside, which is still required. Therefore, this work presents Vis and VA interface for the spatiotemporal data represented in terms of location, including time, and several measured attributes like Particular Matter (PM) PM2.5 and PM10, along with humidity, and wind (speed and direction) to assess the detailed temporal patterns of these parameters in Stuttgart, Germany. The time series are analysed using the unsupervised HDBSCAN clustering on a series of (above mentioned) parameters. Furthermore, with the in-depth sensors nature understanding and trends, Machine Learning (ML) approach called Transformers Network predictor model is integrated, that takes successive time values of parameters as input with sensors' locations and predict the future dominant (highly measured) values with location in time as the output. The selected parameters variations are compared and analysed in the spatiotemporal frame to provide detailed estimations on how average conditions would change in a region over the time. This work would help to get a better insight into the urban system and enable the sustainable development of cities by improving human interaction with the spatiotemporal data. Hence, the increasing environmental problems for big industrial cities could be alarmed and reduced for the future with proposed work. © 2021 S.

Nevertheless, reductions of the air pollutants particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3), in particular, are essential to ensure the quality of life and a healthy life in cities. To forecast these air pollutants for the next 48 hours, a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder model with a recurrent neural network (RNN) was implemented. The model was trained with historic in situ air pollutant measurements, traffic and meteorological data.

We aimed to measure the carbon footprint of cataract surgery in Wellington. METHODS: We used Eyefficiency, an application using established footprinting methods, to estimate the emissions produced by phacoemulsification surgery in two public and two private hospitals. We measured (1) power consumption, (2) procurement of disposable items and pharmaceuticals, (3) waste disposal emissions and (4) travel (other potential sources were excluded). Where possible we used New Zealand emissions coefficients. RESULTS: We recorded data from 142 cataract surgeries. The average emissions produced by cataract surgery in the region was estimated to be 152kg of carbon dioxide equivalent. This is equivalent to 62L of petrol and would take 45m2 of forest one year to absorb. The great majority of emissions were from procurement, mostly disposable materials, and the second greatest contribution was from travel (driving). CONCLUSION: Estimating the carbon footprint of cataract surgery is becoming easier, but improved methods for measuring the footprint of procured supplies are needed. There are significant opportunities for emissions reduction in the most common surgical procedure in New Zealand.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116342982

The community structure of the methanotrophs in rice fields worldwide has been studied mainly using culture-independent methods. Very few studies have focused on culturing methanotrophs from rice fields. We developed a unique method for the cultivation of methanotrophs from rice field samples. Here, we used a modified dilute nitrate mineral salts (dNMS) medium, with two cycles of dilution till extinction series cultivation with prolonged incubation time, and used agarose in the solid medium. The cultivation approach resulted in the isolation of methanotrophs from seven genera from the three major groups: Type Ia (Methylomonas, Methylomicrobium, and Methylocucumis), Type Ib (Methylocaldum and Methylomagnum), and Type II (Methylocystis and Methylosinus). Growth was obtained till 10–6–10–8 dilutions in the first dilution series, indicating the culturing of dominant methanotrophs. Our study was supported by 16S rRNA gene-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) of three of the rice samples. Our analyses and comparison with the global scenario suggested that the cultured members represented the major detected taxa. Strain RS1, representing a putative novel species of Methylomicrobium, was cultured; and the draft genome sequence was obtained. Genome analysis indicated that RS1 represented a new putative Methylomicrobium species. Methylomicrobium has been detected globally in rice fields as a dominant genus, although no Methylomicrobium strains have been isolated from rice fields worldwide. Ours is one of the first extensive studies on cultured methanotrophs from Indian rice fields focusing on the tropical region, and a unique method was developed. A total of 29 strains were obtained, which could be used as models for studying methane mitigation from rice fields and for environmental and biotechnological applications. © Copyright © 2021 Rahalkar, Khatri, Pandit, Bahulikar and Mohite.","cultivation; India; metagenomics; methane; methanotrophs; novel; rice fields; serial dilution","methane; mineral; nitrate; phytohormone; RNA 16S; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; biodegradation; bioremediation; denitrification; dilution; DNA extraction; greenhouse gas; high throughput sequencing; incubation time; Indian rice; metagenomics; methanogenesis; methanotroph; Methylocaldum; Methylocucumis; Methylomagnum; Methylomicrobium; microbial community; microbial diversity; microscopy; nonhuman; phylogeny; rhizosphere; soil microflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115382447

This is particularly the case in ice-rich regions such as the Yedoma domain. Excess ground ice degradation exposes deep sediments and their OC stocks, but also mineral elements, to biogeochemical processes. Interactions of mineral elements and OC play a crucial role for OC stabilization and the fate of OC upon thaw, and thus regulate carbon dioxide and methane emissions. In addition, some mineral elements are limiting nutrients for plant growth or microbial metabolic activity. A large ongoing effort is to quantify OC stocks and their lability in permafrost regions, but the influence of mineral elements on the fate of OC or on biogeochemical nutrient cycles has received less attention and there is an overall lack of mineral element content analyses for permafrost sediments. Here, we combine portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) with a bootstrapping technique to provide i) the first large-scale Yedoma domain Mineral Concentrations Assessment (YMCA) dataset, and ii) estimates of mineral element stocks in never thawed (since deposition) ice-rich Yedoma permafrost and previously thawed and partly refrozen Alas deposits. The pXRF method for mineral element quantification is non-destructive and offers a complement to the classical dissolution and measurement by optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) in solution. Using this method, mineral element concentrations (Si, Al, Fe, Ca, K, Ti, Mn, Zn, Sr and Zr) were assessed on 1,292 sediment samples from the Yedoma domain with lower analytical effort and lower costs relative to the ICP-OES method. The pXRF measured concentrations were calibrated using alkaline fusion and ICP-OES measurements on a subset of 144 samples (R2 from 0.725 to 0.996). The results highlight that i) the mineral element stock in sediments of the Yedoma domain (1,387,000 km2) is higher for Si, followed by Al, Fe, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Zr, Sr, and Zn, and that ii) the stock in Al and Fe (598 ± 213 and 288 ± 104 Gt) is in the same order of magnitude as the OC stock (327–466 Gt). © Copyright © 2021 Monhonval, Mauclet, Pereira, Vandeuren, Strauss, Grosse, Schirrmeister, Fuchs, Kuhry and Opfergelt.","alas; arctic; bootstrapping technique; late pleistocene – holocene; mineralogy; thaw; thermokarst; X-ray fluorescence","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Deposits; Ice; Large dataset; Nutrients; Optical emission spectroscopy; Organic carbon; Permafrost; Sediments; Silicon; Statistical methods; Thawing; X ray spectrometers; Analytical efforts; Biogeochemical process; Ice-rich permafrost; Metabolic activity; Microbial mineralization; Optical emission spectrometry; Permafrost region; Portable x-ray fluorescence; Minerals; bootstrapping; ice; mineralogy; organic carbon; permafrost; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; thawing; thermokarst; X-ray fluorescence; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115218415

Here, we present the advantages of a continuous-flow setup to study photocatalytic CO2to CO reduction systems, which also benefits from aspects of automation (using programmed in-line gas quantification of multiple samples in parallel). The capabilities of the methodology are demonstrated using a state-of-the-art light absorber platform based on ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) in combination with a series of molecular co-catalysts based on Ni and Co for visible-light-driven CO2reduction in aqueous ascorbate solution. A newly synthesized Co-tetraphenylporphyrin featuring three sulfonate groups and one amine group (Co(tppS3N1)) is identified to exhibit a benchmark photocatalytic activity (18.6 μmol of CO, 79.7 mmol of CO gZnSe-1, TONCo(CO) of 619, external quantum efficiency (EQE) &gt;5%). The utility of our methodology is further shown by applying the setup to study the photocatalyst systems under lower light intensities, low CO2concentration, and aerobic conditions, which impact the photocatalytic activity and selectivity. Overall, this work reports an improved methodology for studying photocatalytic CO2reduction alongside advancing the understanding of QD molecular co-catalyst hybrids using ZnSe QDs as a versatile light absorber based on earth-abundant components that operate under fully aqueous conditions. © 2021 American Chemical Society","artificial photosynthesis; automation; CO2 reduction; photocatalysis; quantum dots","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Complexation; Hybrid systems; II-VI semiconductors; Light; Metal complexes; Photocatalytic activity; Semiconductor quantum dots; Wide band gap semiconductors; Zinc Selenide; Aerobic condition; Analytical procedure; Aqueous condition; External quantum efficiency; Semiconductor metals; Tetraphenyl porphyrins; Visible-light-driven; Znse quantum dots; Selenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114705110

This approach allows us not only to fabricate technologically relevant and reusable devices but also to improve photophysical properties of carbon nitride, such as the singlet-triplet energy gap and lifetime of triplet excited states, when the material is assembled in thin films. These morphological changes are employed to maximize the performance of the materials in photocatalytic reactions, in which the carbon nitride thin films show at least 1 order of magnitude higher activity per area unit compared to photocatalysis using suspended particles. © 2021 The Authors.

New vehicle emissions regulations in India require the use of a non road transient cycle (NRTC) to confirm vehicles meet specified emission limits. Previous emission norms were comfortably meeting with the mechanical injection system. But the current stringent emission norms require a common rail direct injection (CRDI) system to meet the lower particulate matter (PM) limits. This article discusses on improving the engine fuel efficiency and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission prediction on a transient cycle using a one-dimensional (1-D) software by coupling Ricardo WAVE and Ricardo Vectis. Engine fuel consumption and emission maps are predicted using Ricardo WAVE. These maps are input into Ricardo IGNITE for predicting cumulative fuel consumption and NOx emission. In general, total simulated fuel use and NOx emissions were within 10% of the observed values for the base engine, which is with a mechanical injection system. The same approach is applied for predicting cumulative fuel consumption and overall emission for modified configuration with CRDI. A good correlation is observed between the predicted and simulated values that gives great confidence for going ahead with more parametric study and avoiding unnecessary engine test bed operating costs. It is observed that engine fuel efficiency can be improved by 5% over a transient cycle if the conventional mechanical injection system is replaced with a CRDI system. © 2022 SAE International.","CRDI; HP-EGR; LP-EGR; NRTC; Ricardo IGNITE; Ricardo WAVE","Efficiency; Forecasting; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Operating costs; Pollution; Common rail; Common rail direct injection; HP-EGR; Injection systems; LP-EGR; Non road transient cycles; Ricardo; Ricardo IGNITE; Ricardo WAVE; Direct injection",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117346287

Since the weather is unpredictable, a collection of data from past weather is collected. Therefore, even in the worst-case scenario, this weather forecast from the past will help farmers to make less profit than losses.

Experts have identified clear climate change adaptation principles that MPA practitioners can incorporate into MPA management; however, adoption of these principles in MPA management remains largely unquantified. We conducted a text analysis of 647 English-language MPA management plans to assess the frequency with which they included climate change-related terms and terms pertaining to ecological, physical, and sociological components of an MPA system that may be impacted by climate change. Next, we manually searched 223 management plans to quantify the plans’ climate change robustness, which we defined as the degree of incorporation of common climate change adaptation principles. We found that climate change is inadequately considered in MPA management plans. Of all plans published since 2010, only 57% contained at least one of the climate change-related terms, “climate change,” “global warming,” “extreme events,” “natural variability,” or “climate variability.” The mean climate change robustness index of climate-considering management plans was 10.9 or 39% of a total possible score of 28. The United States was the only region that had plans with climate robustness indices of 20 or greater. By contrast, Canada lags behind other temperate jurisdictions in incorporating climate change adaptation analysis, planning, and monitoring into MPA management, with a mean climate change robustness index of 6.8. Climate change robustness scores have generally improved over time within the most common MPA designations in Oceania, the United Kingdom, and the United States, though the opposite is true in Canada. Our results highlight the urgent need for practitioners to incorporate climate change adaptation into MPA management in accordance with well-researched frameworks. © Copyright © 2021 O’Regan, Archer, Friesen and Hunter.","adaptive management; biodiversity conservation; climate change robustness; monitoring; sea level rise; text analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115015425

However, the application of this approach depends on assessing hydrological similarity between basins. This study used data for runoff, climate, and the underlying surface of the Hulan River Basin and Poyang Lake Basin to construct a novel physical hydrological similarity index (HSI). The index was used to compare the efficiency of transfer of the parameters of commonly used regionalization methods and to finally apply parameters to ungauged basins. The results showed that: (1) Precipitation is the main climatic factor regulating magnitude of runoff in the Poyang Lake Basin. Spring runoff in Hulan River Basin was regulated by precipitation and temperature. (2) The GR4J and CemaNeigeGR4J models achieved reasonable simulations of runoff of Poyang Lake Basin and Hulan River Basin. Although CemaNeigeGR4J considers snowmelt, the model simulations of spring runoff in the Hulan River Basin were not accurate. (3) There was a significant correlation between climate, the underlying surface, and hydrological model parameters. There were fewer significant correlations between environmental factors and between environmental factors and hydrological model parameters in the Hulan River Basin compared to those in the Poyang Lake Basin, possibly due to less sub-basins in the Hulan River Basin. (4) The HSI based on a combination of principal component analysis and the entropy method efficiently identified the most similar gauged basin for an ungauged basin. A significant positive correlation existed between the HSI and parameter transfer efficiency. The relationship between the HSI and transfer efficiency could be represented by logistic regression and linear regression in the Poyang Lake Basin and Hulan River Basin, respectively.

A National Hydrogen Strategy has already been set by the Portuguese Government, focusing on decarbonizing the national industry, while substantially reducing natural gas and fossil fuel-based ammonia imports. This study delivers a techno-economic assessment of a small-scale green ammonia production facility using biomass gasification in mainland Portugal. An improved economic model combining the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), modified internal rate of return (MIRR), payback period (PBP), and discounted payback period (DPBP) is set to determine the project feasibility. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis is implemented to gauge the risks associated with the venture. Several environmental considerations are also addressed concerning the carbon footprint of deploying a biomass-to-ammonia system compared to conventional fossil fuel-based ammonia. Under current market conditions, the power plant is predictably economically feasible with an NPV of 3714 k€, IRR of 24.32%, MIRR of 14.99%, PBP of 4.6 years, and DPBP of 5.8 years. The sensitivity analysis foresees affordable risks for investors, although investment loss is more likely to occur due to NPV failure, being remarkably sensitive to ammonia production and ammonia sales price fluctuations. Finally, the geographic location set for the biomass-to-ammonia power plant has the potential to enable a bioeconomy and circular economy framework for increased renewability and improved productivity, while promoting sustainable agricultural practices in the region. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Agricultural robots; Bioeconomy; Biomass; Carbon footprint; Earnings; Economic analysis; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Gasification; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Investments; Natural gasoline plants; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Biomass Gasification; Environmental considerations; Internal rate of return; Renewable energy source; Sustainable agricultural; Techno-economic assessment; Techno-economic studies; The net present value (NPV); Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114608667

We report an experimental determination of the barrier to CO2 functionalization to form bidentate formate on a hydrogenated Pt surface and the corresponding reaction energy. This determination was possible using velocity resolved kinetics, which simultaneously provides information about both the dynamics and rates of surface chemical reactions. In these experiments, a pulse of isotopically labeled formic acid (DCOOH) doses the Pt surface rapidly forming bidentate formate (DCO*O*). We then record the (much slower) rate of decomposition of DCO*O∗ to form adsorbed D∗ and gas phase CO2. We establish the reaction mechanism by dosing with O2 to form adsorbed O*, which efficiently converts H∗ or D∗ to gas phase water. H2O is formed immediately reflecting rapid loss of the acidic proton associated with formation of formate, while D2O formation proceeds more slowly and on the same time scale as the CO2 production. The temperature dependence of the reaction rate yields an activation energy that reflects the energy of the transition state with respect to DCO*O*. The derived heat of formation for DCO*O∗ on Pt(111) agrees well with results of microcalorimetry. The maximum release of translational energy of the formed CO2 provides a measure of the energy of the transition state with respect to the products and the barrier to the reverse process, functionalization of CO2. The comparison between the results on Pt(111) and Pt(332) shows that the barrier for CO2 functionalization is reduced by the presence of steps. The approach taken here could provide a method to optimize catalysts for CO2 functionalization. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation energy; Catalysis; Gases; Hydrogenation; Surface reactions; Temperature distribution; Energetic barriers; Energetic stability; Experimental determination; Isotopically labeled; Reaction mechanism; Surface chemical reactions; Temperature dependence; Translational energy; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114486831

Herein, mechanical properties of amorphous methane hydrates are explored for the first time to bridge the gap between mechanical responses of monocrystalline and polycrystalline methane hydrates. Our results demonstrate that mechanical properties of amorphous methane hydrates are strongly governed by our original proposed order parameter, namely, normalized hydrogen-bond directional order parameter. Followed by this important achievement, a multistep deformation mechanism core is proposed to explain mechanical properties of amorphous methane hydrates.

The scheme is based on a reconstruction of the temperature inversion as a physical constraint for the cloud top. On the refined grid, the boundary layer and the free troposphere are separated and the cloud's layer is made thinner. The cloud cover is recalculated either by conserving the cloud volume (SC-VOLUME) or by using the Sundqvist cloud cover routine on the new grid representation (SC-SUND). In global climate simulations, we find that the SC-VOLUME approach is inadequate, as there is a mismatch, in most cases, between the layer of the inversion and the layer of the stratocumulus cloud, which prevents its application and is itself likely caused by an overly low vertical resolution. Additionally, we find that the occurrence frequency of stratocumulus clouds is underestimated in ECHAM-HAM, limiting a priori the potential benefits of a scheme like SC-VOLUME targeting only cloud amount when present. With the SC-SUND approach, the possibility for new clouds to be formed on the refined grid results in a large increase in mean total cloud cover in stratocumulus regions. In both cases, however, the changes exerted in the radiation routine are too weak to produce a significant improvement in the simulated stratocumulus cloud cover. We investigate and discuss the reasons behind this. The grid refinement scheme could be used more effectively for this purpose if implemented directly in the model's cloud microphysics and cloud cover routines, but other possible ways forward are also discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"boundary layer; climate modeling; cloud cover; cloud microphysics; global climate; stratocumulus; temperature inversion; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114399811

Setting A single acute NHS Trust with four satellite sites which serve more than 2 million patients annually in Central England. Participants Interviews with a purposive sample of 10 stakeholders, including those who conceptualised the intervention and those who were responsible for its implementation. Intervention The NHS is a major carbon emitter and therefore developed the NHS carbon reduction strategy (NHSCRS)' in 2009. NHS organisations are contractually obliged to develop a local carbon reduction strategy known as a Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP) which details carbon reduction measures (CRM), as described in the NHSCRS. However, the organisational context within which the SDMP is implemented is likely to determine the extent of its success. We undertook an adapted realist evaluation cycle to develop refined initial programme theories. Documents were analysed using thematic content analysis. Interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results CRM were most likely to be implemented if the Trust Board were sufficiently pressured by staff and reputational fears, and the potential impacts of CRM were perceived to align with wider organisational aims. Differences in implementation of CRM across hospital sites were related to logistical factors, accessibility to regional partners and contractual relationships. There were expected carbon, energy and long-term financial savings, with variability in the effectiveness of some CRM post implementation. Conclusions Organisational factors, particularly Board leadership and internal implementation pathways, have a significant bearing on whether CRM are implemented or not. However, greater national support and guidance is needed for NHS organisations to effectively reduce their carbon emissions. Further cycles of this evaluation are necessary in multiple case study sites to illuminate the path to a net-zero NHS carbon footprint by 2045. ©","health policy; health services administration & management; organisational development","carbon; air pollution control; Article; content analysis; controlled study; England; health care management; human; interview; national health service; purposive sample; semi structured interview; social environment; sustainable development; thematic analysis; United Kingdom; hospital; leadership; Carbon; Hospitals; Humans; Leadership; State Medicine; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114394999

To conduct computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the combustion in such engines, there is a need for dual-fuel combustion models that achieve a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. This study investigates a semiglobal approach for modeling ignition ofn-heptane/methane mixtures. In the semiglobal approach, the heptane oxidation is modeled by using a four-step global scheme from Müller, Peters, and Liñán (MPL) (1992), while the methane chemistry is described by a skeletal mechanism with 22 species, derived from a detailed reaction mechanism. The resulting semiglobal model includes 25 species and 138 reactions. Both the global heptane mechanism and the merged semiglobal dual-fuel model are validated against a wide range of ignition delay data from shock tubes as well as through comparison with predictions of the detailed heptane mechanism by Zhang et al. (2016). The MPL model cannot fully capture the ignition delay across the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region for ann-heptane/air mixture. Despite this shortcoming, the ignition delay at high pressure (38-55 atm) is predicted typically within a factor of 2 compared to experiments. Under dual-fuel conditions with methane as the main fuel, the NTC behavior is less pronounced. Methane ignition is promoted by heat release from then-heptane oxidation rather than by any direct chemical interaction. Predictions of ignition delays using the combined global/skeletal model are in good agreement with then-heptane/methane measurements reported by Schuh et al. (2019; 60 atm, 785-1284 K), while at the higher temperatures and lower pressures of the experiments of Liang et al. (2019; 10 atm, 1257-1763 K), predictions are accurate within a factor of 2 for methane contents of 90% and higher. The present results indicate that it is possible with a small combined model to predict the ignition delay for methane/n-heptane mixtures with sufficient accuracy for practical use. The semiglobal model approach can thus be employed in CFD simulations, facilitating development of sustainable dual-fuel engines as well as identification of optimal fuel compositions and conditions. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Computational efficiency; Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Forecasting; Fuels; Ignition; Methane; Mixtures; Shock tubes; Temperature; Autoignition temperature; Chemical interactions; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Detailed reaction mechanisms; Dual fuel combustion; Fuel compositions; Lower pressures; Skeletal mechanism; Heptane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114187183

Recent interest in this topic has been driven by observations that the reaction selectivity and rates of electrocatalytic processes for energy storage and renewable fuel synthesis can profoundly change with electrolyte pH. Further, a subset of these reactions, such as CO and CO2 reduction, are often carried out under near-neutral bulk pH conditions. Such conditions, in combination with insufficient mass transport and limited pH buffer capacity, can lead to substantial deviations of the near-electrode pH from the bulk pH of the electrolyte. Such pH gradients, together with electrodes whose surface chemistry is highly dependent on pH, can give rise to complex feedback between the reactions that are catalyzed on the surface and the local pH conditions and surface speciation. In this Perspective, we discuss representative studies that characterize and quantify the effects of (local) pH on electrocatalysis with innovative experimental and theoretical methods. We further highlight possible future directions of investigation. ©",,"Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Fuel storage; Reaction rates; Surface chemistry; Aqueous electrolyte; Electrocatalytic process; Possible futures; Reaction selectivity; Renewable fuels; Surface speciation; Theoretical methods; Transfer reaction; pH effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114098552

Because ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a key environmental exposure for all three traits, we investigated the mechanisms by which this locus contributes to melanoma risk, focusing on cellular response to UVR. Fine-mapping of melanoma GWASs identified four independent sets of candidate causal variants. A GWAS region-focused Capture-C study of primary melanocytes identified physical interactions between two causal sets and the promoter of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Subsequent chromatin state annotation, eQTL, and luciferase assays identified rs117132860 as a functional variant and reinforced AHR as a likely causal gene. Because AHR plays critical roles in cellular response to dioxin and UVR, we explored links between this SNP and AHR expression after both 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure. Allele-specific AHR binding to rs117132860-G was enhanced following both, consistent with predicted weakened AHR binding to the risk/poor-tanning rs117132860-A allele, and allele-preferential AHR expression driven from the protective rs117132860-G allele was observed following UVB exposure. Small deletions surrounding rs117132860 introduced via CRISPR abrogates AHR binding, reduces melanocyte cell growth, and prolongs growth arrest following UVB exposure. These data suggest AHR is a melanoma susceptibility gene at the 7p21.1 risk locus and rs117132860 is a functional variant within a UVB-responsive element, leading to allelic AHR expression and altering melanocyte growth phenotypes upon exposure. © 2021","AHR; aryl hydrocarbon receptor; eQTL; expression quantitative trait locus; fine-mapping; genome-wide association study; GWAS; melanocyte; melanoma; tanning; ultraviolet radiation; UVR","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; AHR protein, human; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; AHR gene; allele; Article; cancer risk; cell growth; chromatin; chromosome band; chromosome band 7p21.1; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; controlled study; cutaneous melanoma; expression quantitative trait locus; gene deletion; gene expression; genetic risk; genome-wide association study; growth inhibition; human; human cell; luciferase assay; melanocyte; promoter region; receptor binding; single nucleotide polymorphism; skin pigmentation; skin tanning; ultraviolet B radiation; adverse event; carcinogenesis; chemistry; chromosome 7; drug effect; gene expression regulation; gene locus; genetic predisposition; genetics; human genome; melanoma; metabolism; pathology; primary cell culture; radiation response; skin tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; sunbathing; ultraviolet radiation; Alleles; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chromatin; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome, Human; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Primary Cell Culture; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Skin Neoplasms; Sunbathing; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114012728

The goal of this study was to adjust growth models to quantify biomass increments (B) and estimate the carbon uptake (C) in Pinus teocote and Pinus oocarpa forests in the mountain region of the state of Guerrero. Twenty-four trees per species were felled, tree trunk analyses were performed, and five growth models were adjusted in order to estimate the increments in biomass and the inflection points of the current annual increase (CAI), mean annual increase (MAI), and the technical shift where CAI and MAI intersect. Weibull's model exhibited the best adjustments for determining biomass growths; the equation for estimating biomass in P. teocote was: Y = 1722.1(1-e-3.933E-6∗X2.7928), R2adj 0.73, REMC = 184.2 kg and e = 125 kg; the generated model for P. oocarpa was Y = 3186.79(1-e-0.000033∗X2.2103), adjR2 = 0.88 RMSE = 155.9 and e = 108.2 kg. The analysis of the projected growth until the technical shift (107 and 126 years) yielded increments of 2.81 t of B ha-1 year-1 in P. teocote and 3.64 t ha-1 year-1 in P. oocarpa. The growth models are reliable and efficient for estimating biomass and inferring carbon uptake based on the application of the ring analysis technique in mature P. oocarpa and P. teocote forests in the studied region. © 2021 Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Forestales.

This has clearly highlighted the need for knowledge-based strategies to help plan adequate mitigation and adaptation measures for the country. One of the basic requirements to ensure such strategies is the development of a database of national CC research. This will aid in the assessment of past and present scientific publications from which directions for future study can be mapped. The present study used standard, systematic, and bibliographic literature reviews to analyse the trend, focus, spatial variability, and effectiveness of published research on CC impacts in Nigeria. Four thematic areas of CC impact research were defined: Agriculture, Environment, Human and Multi-disciplinary study. A total of 701 articles were found to be relevant and the review shows that CC impacts and adaptations in the literature vary across research categories and locations. The period between 2011 (68 studies) and 2015 (80 studies) showed a tremendous rise in CC impact research with a peak in 2014 (84 studies). Studies in the agriculture category had the highest publications in 23 States of Nigeria. The review revealed three research gaps: (1) lack of research that investigated the magnitude of present and potential future impacts in the aquatic environment (2) little attention on CC impacts and adaptation in the Northern regions of Nigeria (3) absence of study investigating the effects of multiple variables of CC at the same time. The findings suggest that it would be useful to advance CC research in Nigeria beyond perceptive approaches to more quantitative ones. This is particularly important for highly vulnerable animals, crops, locations, and for better planning of adaptation strategies. © 2021","Adaptive capacity; Climate actions; Coping strategy; Mitigation; Resilience; Socio-ecological systems",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121212863

Better understanding of adaptation strategies and implications of the adaptations in crop yield are required to close the yield gap. In this study, the effectiveness of agronomic adaptation options on the rainfed rice yield gap was evaluated for the baseline period (1981–2005) and two future periods (2016–2040 and 2026–2050) for India by using bias-corrected RegCM4 output and the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model. Results suggested that a combined adjustment of transplanting time (advancing by fortnight), crop spacing ((10 ~ 10) cm) and N-fertilizer application (140 kg/ha) was the best strategy as compared to the single adaptation option to close the yield gap under the climate change scenario. The strategy improved rice yield by 37.5–168.0% and reduced the average attainable yield gap among the cultivars from 0.74 to 0.16 t/ha under future climate projection. This study provides agronomic indications to rice growers and lays the basis for an economic analysis to support policy-makers in charge of promoting the sustainability of the rainfed rice-growing systems. © 2021 The Authors.","Agronomic adaptation; Climate change; DSSAT; India; Yield gap","Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Economic analysis; Adaptation strategies; Agronomic adaptation; Agrotechnology transfer; Crop yield; Decision support system for agrotechnology transfer; India; Model-based OPC; Rainfed; Rice yield; Yield gap; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121051820

Studies on the reliability of these hydropower plants due to climate and land-use/land cover changes on the hydrology of these rivers are scanty. Therefore, this study aimed to model the impact of the changing climate and land-use/cover on hydropower reliability to aid proper planning and management. The hydropower reliability of Muzizi River catchment was determined from its past (1998–2010) and midcentury (2041–2060) discharge at 30 and 95% exceedance probability under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The past and projected hydropower were compared to determine how future climate and land-use changes will impact the discharge and hydropower reliability of Muzizi River catchment. Six LULC scenarios (deforestation, 31–20%; grassland, 19–3%; cropland, 50–77%; water bodies, 0.02–0.01%; settlement, 0.23–0.37%, and Barren land 0.055–0.046% between 2014 and 2060) and three downscaled Regional Climate Model (REMO and RCA4 for precipitation and RACMO22T for temperature from a pool of four CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) Africa RCMs) were examined. A calibrated SWAT simulation model was applied for the midcentury (2041–2060) period, and a potential change in hydropower energy in reference to mean daily flow (designflow > 30% exceedance probability), firm flow (flow > 95% exceedance probability), and mean annual flow was evaluated under the condition of altered runoff under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios for an average of REMO and RCA4 RCM. The future land use (2060) was projected using the MOLUSCE (Module for Land Use Change Evaluation) plugin in QGIS using CA-ANN. Three scenarios have been described in this study, including LULC change, climate change, and combined (climate and LULC change). The results suggest that there will be a significant increase in annual hydropower generation capacity (from 386.27 and 488.1 GWh to 867.82 and 862.53 GWh under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) for the combined future effect of climate and land-use/cover changes. Energy utilities need to put in place mechanisms to effectively manage, operate, and maintain the hydropower plant amidst climate and land-use change impacts, to ensure reliability at all times. © 2021 The Authors.","Flow duration curves; Hydropower potential; Land-use change; RCP; SWAT model; SWAT-Cup Sufi-2","Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Deforestation; Hydroelectric power plants; Land use; Probability; Reliability; Rivers; Runoff; Exceedance probability; Flow duration curve; Hydropower plants; Hydropower potential; Landuse change; Potential impacts; Representative concentration pathway; River catchment; SWAT model; SWAT-cup sufi-2; Hydroelectric power; catchment; climate change; downscaling; environmental impact; fluid flow; future prospect; hydroelectric power plant; land cover; land use change; power generation; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120949658

GCM simulations require downscaling to get a coarser scale output for local climate impact studies. In this study, an improvised principal component regression (PCR) downscaling technique is adapted to downscale 26 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCM historical outputs. A massive river basin named Cauvery with 35 observation stations is categorized into three subbasins to study the regional climate impacts. In this case, the PCR model performed remarkably well compared to other conventional machine learning models with half the computational time than usual. The test statistics state that the validation of the proposed model illustrates a variance in calibration results of the PCR model, which ranges between 2 and 5%, and a variance in validation, which is less than 7% throughout the study area.

Samples were characterized by a multi-analytical approach: field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was employed to investigate the morphological changes of both pristine and reacted fibres, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to measure the concentration of the released cations; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was exploited for highlighting possible modifications of surface chemistry; X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were applied aiming to get information on the structural state of the fibres following the incubation. ICP results integrated with those obtained by both bulk-and surface-chemical characterization highlighted that erionite binds Na especially in the first 24 h of sample incubation in the MGS, following ion exchange with the extra framework cations, in particular Ca. Moreover, our new results show that the Na binding process caused structural modifications with the migration of Na toward the Ca2 site and redistribution of the cations within the erionite cage. TEM investigation pointed out that the interaction between erionite and MGS results in the formation of a new surface amorphous layer with an irregular lobate pattern on an earlier surface weathered layer. However, the silicate framework is not weakened by incubation in the MGS at acidic pH. In addition, on the basis of the Si release normalized to the mineral surface area, fibrous erionite resulted significantly more biodurable than amphibole asbestos. Notably, considering the primary role played by biodurability in inducing pathogenicity, this result certainly supports in vivo observations showing that erionite is much more tumorigenic than asbestos. Moreover, the ions released by erionite when immersed in MGS may trigger biological effects, such as those on lipid packing and membrane permeability. On this basis, we expect a regulatory definition that would provide protection from this carcinogenic fibre. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, distinct Cu, Cu2O, and CuO nanoparticles with similar particle size on active carbon are synthesized via carbonthermal reduction. Although all CuOx nanoparticles are reduced to metallic Cu during CO2ERR, their different initial valence states result in particle-size variations and different CO2ERR performances. Cu nanoparticles in Cu/C evolve into smaller particles, while those derived from Cu2O/C and CuO/C agglomerate into larger ones. The optimal CO production potential of CO drops with decreasing particle size and is as low as −0.7 V (vs. the eversible hydrogen electrode) on Cu/C. Furthermore, Cu nanoparticles in Cu/C expose much more active sites with higher electrochemical active area and stronger CO adsorption, which further promote C−C coupling to produce C2+ products while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","CO2 electroreduction; Cu nanoparticles; electrocatalysis; initial valence states; particle size","Carbon dioxide; Copper; Copper oxides; Electrocatalysis; Electrolytic reduction; Nanoparticles; Synthesis (chemical); Active carbon; CO2 electroreduction; Copper-based catalysts; Cu nano-particles; CuO nanoparticles; Electro reduction; Initial valence state; Particles sizes; Synthesised; Valence state; Particle size",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120805443

Environmental education is one way to prepare children to cope and enable them to educate their families and friends about the need to act now to minimise the danger climate change poses. This article reports on findings from a participatory action research project aimed at integrating education for sustainable development into the Grade 7 curriculum, with a specific focus on climate change. Critical participatory action research has a transformative intent, engaging participants in learning to cultivate a sense of purpose and increase their capacity to solve local problems. Learner responses to qualitative questionnaires and recorded discussions related to the Do One Thing (DOT) strategy were used to determine learning about climate change and enable both learners and community members to identify action for change. Thematic coding was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the DOT strategy in increasing awareness of agency and resultant learning. The findings indicate that not only did the learners gain knowledge about the causes and consequences of climate change but the potential of the learners and community members to identify possible actions for change was increased as well. We provide suggestions as to how teachers can use the DOT strategy as part of an action research approach to integrating environmental education for sustainable development in order to raise awareness of local environmental threats and encourage learners and their families to behave in a more environmentally friendly way. The explanation of the research process offered in this article also highlights how participatory learning activities can help engage learners as active agents in their own learning. © 2021 Muller and Wood.","Climate change; Collaboration; Experiential learning; Participatory action research; Project-based learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119901096

Machine learning (ML) allows for high resolution modeling of the water table depth beyond the capabilities of conventional numerical physically-based hydrological models with respect to spatial resolution and overall accuracy. For this, in-situ well and proxy observations are used as training data in combination with high resolution covariates. The objective of this study is to model the depth of the uppermost water table for a typical summer and winter condition at 10 m spatial resolution over entire Denmark (43,000 km2). CatBoost, a state of the art implementation of gradient boosting decision trees, is employed in this study to model the water table depth and the associated uncertainties. The groundwater domain has not been the most prominent field of applications of recent hydrological ML advances due to the lack of big data. This study brings forward a novel knowledge-guided ML framework to overcome this limitation by integrating simulation results from a physically-based groundwater flow model. The simulation data are utilized to (1) identify wells that represent the uppermost water table, (2) augment missing training data by accounting for simulated water level seasonality, and (3) expand the list of covariates. The curated training dataset contains around 13,000 wells, 19,000 groundwater proxy observations at lakes, streams and coastline as well as 15 covariates. Cross validation attests that the ML model generalizes well with a mean absolute error of around 115 cm considering solely well observations and a MAE of &lt;50 cm taking also the proxy observations into consideration. Quantile regression is applied to estimate confidence intervals and the estimated uncertainty is largest for moraine clay soils that are characterized with a distinct geological heterogeneity. This study highlights a novel research avenue of knowledge-guided ML for the groundwater domain by efficiently supporting a ML model with a physically-based hydrological model to predict the depth of the water table at unprecedented spatial detail and accuracy.

Because of this self-evident fact, an attempt is made to bring together antagonistic systems of understanding of ‘development’ from an evolutionary perspective in a discursive manner, ultimately to gain greater acceptance for the resulting basic strategies in different camps. Attitudes that are either optimistic or critical regarding the chances of ‘development’ (so-called ‘pre-analytic visions’) are described on the basis of (i) literature (Sec-tion 2) and (ii) data (Section 3) and the resulting recommendations for action are compared with each other. As an attempt at mediation between both paradigms, an original conception inspired by evolutionary thinking is proposed here: based on the data structures of the author's ‘Global Change Data Base’ (GCDB), a long-term dynamic of global techno-socio-economic development can be assumed which is characterised by a succession of initially growing and then saturating structural parameters. Particularly in the energy industry and land use, such a sequence of initially budding, then blossoming and finally maturing development phases (= ‘blossoming evolution’) seems to be present if the data sets of all states are analysed in the long term (Section 4). A thinking in transitions (Section 5, 6) thus appears justified, appropriate and helpful. In this sense, any strategic climate or development policy measure is based on an already ongoing (rolling) global structural change. In the light of the concept of ‘blossoming evolution,’ it therefore seems helpful (as well as easier to implement) to reinforce or mitigate such alreadyoccurring evolutionary dynamics in a suitable way in order to come as close as possible to the goals of sustainable global development. Summing up, this text suggests that any developmental measures should be placed in a suitable context of evolutionary autopoietic dynamics, which is in any case driving history. © 2021 ‘Uchitel’ Publishing House.","Blossoming evolution; Development theory; Evolutionary view; Global change; Global Change Data Base GCDB; Socio-economic evolution; Transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119821727

In this study, the synoptic and local meteorological conditions during the period with reduced PM2.5 concentrations were analyzed. The synoptic meteorological conditions during March 2020 show a common characteristic of strong zonal flow and winds. Therefore, air circulation was active and meteorological conditions were unfavorable to long-range transboundary transport. Local meteorological conditions such as wind and turbulent motion at the surface were sensitive to PM2.5 concentrations. Our analyses indicate that the greatly reduced PM2.5 concentrations were mainly influenced by synoptic rather than local conditions. Decreased demand for heating of buildings due to warmer temperatures in March 2020, the economic slowdown following the outbreak of COVID-19, and the implementation of guidelines aimed at controlling particulate matter (PM) were other important causes of reduced PM2.5 emissions.

The most favorable process variables attained were substrate concentration = 9.88 g, temperature = 35.73°C, incubation time = 120.05 hours, initial moisture content = 71.30%, and initial pH = 4.98. From analysis of variance, an R2-value of 0.9848 signifies a good agreement between the experimental and predicted values for sugarcane bagasse. Also, the fitness of the model is confirmed by a high R2-value. The RSM shows that xylanase activity of 417.521 IU/gds was achieved for the optimized process environment. In addition to xylanase activity, a poor quantity of carboxy methyl cellulase activity was also recorded. This study is carried out for cost-effective xylanase production by using agro-industrial waste as cheaper carbon source. It can reduce environment pollution and also minimizes the cost for disposal of industrial waste. © 2021 Kanagasabai and Maruthai.

A prediction model of heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption is established by using back propagation neural network (BPNN) and adapted boosting (Adaboost) algorithm. Then, the HVAC system is optimized by building information modeling (BIM). Finally, the effectiveness of the urban intelligent HVAC optimization prediction model based on BIM and artificial intelligence (AI) is further verified by simulation experiments. The research shows that the error of the prediction model is reduced, the accuracy is higher after the Adaboost algorithm is added to BPNN, and the average prediction accuracy is 86%. When the BIM is combined with the prediction model, the HVAC programme of hybrid cooling beam + variable air volume reheating is taken as the optimal programme of HVAC system. The power consumption and gas consumption of the programme are the least, and the CO2 emission is also the lowest. Programme 1 is compared with programme 3, and the cost is saved by 37% and 15%, respectively. Through the combination of BIM technology and AI technology, the energy consumption of HVAC is effectively reduced, and the resource utilization rate is significantly improved, which can provide theoretical basis for the research of energy-saving equipment. © 2021, ComSIS Consortium.

The study exam-ines a school boat used for the transportation of children to schools in riverine communities of the Brazilian Amazon. The optimization was focused on reducing the hydrodynamic hull resistance by modifying the hull lines, using the NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II) algorithm in the CAD (computer aided design) CAESES environment. The objective of the study was to reduce the resistance coefficients: Cwp (wave profile) and Cwp trans (transverse wave pro-file), thus reducing the total resistance coefficient (Ct) and the generated wave amplitude. Pressure distributions and flow lines were then evaluated to obtain an optimal modified hull with reduced wave emission (lower wave resistance) and, consequently, lower forward resistance. The proposed methodology resulted in a maximum reduction of 5% in the total resistance coefficient Ct and in the identification of a trend of geometric variation of the hull for investigation in fur-ther studies. © 2021, Marine Technology Society Inc..

Carbon deposition caused a reduction in heat flux at axial positions furthest from the fuel-film injector, where deposits were later measured as thickest. Heat flux was reduced by a smaller amount in low-thermal-conductivity chamber liners when compared with high-thermal-conductivity copper liners.

Approach: Calcium carbonate grains (1/4200 μm) were suspended in 1% agar solution to emulate microcalcifications (μCalcs) within a fibroglandular tissue background. Ground-truth imaging was performed on a commercial μCT scanner and was used for assessing calcium-grain size and shape, and for generating μCalc signal profiles. Calcium grains were placed within a realistic breast-shaped phantom and imaged on a prototype bCT system at 3- and 6-mGy mean glandular dose (MGD) levels, and the non-prewhitening detectability was assessed. Additionally, the μCT-derived signal profiles were used in conjunction with the bCT system characterization (MTF and NPS) to obtain predictions of bCT detectability. Results: Estimated detectability of the calcium grains on the bCT system ranged from 2.5 to 10.6 for 3 mGy and from 3.8 to 15.3 for 6 mGy with large fractions of the grains meeting the Rose criterion for visibility. Segmentation of μCT images based on morphological operations produced accurate results in terms of segmentation boundaries and segmented region size. A regression model linking bCT detectability to μCalc parameters indicated significant effects of μCalc size and vertical position within the breast phantom. Detectability using μCT-derived detection templates and bCT statistical properties (MTF and NPS) were in good correspondence with those measured directly from bCT (R2 > 0.88). Conclusions: Parameters derived from μCT ground-truth data were shown to produce useful characterizations of detectability when compared to estimates derived directly from bCT. Signal profiles derived from μCT imaging can be used in conjunction with measured or hypothesized statistical properties to evaluate the performance of a system, or system component, that may not currently be available. © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","breast cancer; breast computed tomography; detectability; micro-computed tomography; microcalcification","Biomineralization; Calcification (biochemistry); Calcium carbonate; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Medical imaging; Phantoms; Regression analysis; Breast Cancer; Breast computed tomography; Breast CT; CT system; Detectability; Detection performance; Ground truth; High resolution; Micro-calcification[MC]; Statistical properties; Computerized tomography; agar; calcium carbonate; Article; breast calcification; breast tissue; chemical composition; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; echomammography; edge detection; female; filtered back projection; grain; high resolution computer tomography; human; human tissue; image segmentation; micro-computed tomography; particle size; prediction; radiation dose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118725656

We obtained gridded meteorological data for the study area from the Kenya Meteorological Department and analyzed it using Mann Kendell’s test to identify significant trends in temperature and rainfall. Focus Group Discussions were also carried out to establish the people's perceptions of local climate change and its impacts on ecosystem services. The results of the study indicate no significant trend, p>0.05, in annual rainfall over time. On the other hand, the results show a significant trend, p=3.696e-06, in average annual temperature with approximately 2C increase from 1984 to 2020. The local climate change has seen a decline in ecosystem services, mainly water levels and agricultural produce. To cope with and mitigate the effects of climate change, there is need to emphasize establishment of agroforestry woodlots and practice of climate-smart agriculture among the forest adjacent communities. © 2021 WITPress.

On the other hand, reducing the emission of hazardous gases and greenhouse gases in human societies is necessary, which has increased the use of hybrid vehicles in recent years. These include battery-powered electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles. Therefore, appropriate policies to expand this type of technology in all countries are important and require careful planning and investment. One of the first essential steps in carrying out these plans is the proper introduction of this type of vehicle in the community. Education in schools, universities, and the mass media can play a crucial role in organizing and introducing hybrid vehicles based on renewable energy sources. This paper aims to present and introduce an attractive plan to introduce an example of technology and products from renewable energy sources. The plan is based on a story with attractive photos of hybrid vehicle products and their introduction as family members. Since the type and method of education are essential in transfer concepts to learners, this plan is proposed after studying different teaching methods and learning methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the project was presented to a group of undergraduate and two groups of graduate students.

There was PM2.5 concentration reduction of roadside (18.6%) and ambient (9.2%) in COVID-19 lockdown period than the same months of previous consecutive year. Moreover, this study showed a clear decline of PM2.5 during lockdown in both rush and non-rush hours except one roadside area which has a non-significant rising PM2.5 because of trucks activities in some area. Additionally, the probable high concentration during the lockdowns period occurred at calm wind speed, mostly from the south direction, particularly in roadside area indicating the traffic source of PM2.5 in the Conditional Bivariate Probability Function (CBPF) plot which estimate probable direction and source of air pollutant. Although PM2.5 is significantly reduced in the lockdown period, it is still above 66% (33 microgram per cubic meter) of the Thailand standard in CBPF analysis.

Whereas attempts are being undertaken to understand their characteristics as a first step to guide targeted mitigation measures, these are focused on dryness and not wetness, which is also a challenge in sub-humid areas. This study investigates dryness and wetness characteristics using the standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) at timescales of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months for a period of 1901–2018 across Uganda's drainage basins. Trends in the dryness and wetness evolutions were conducted using the Mann-Kendall (MK) statistic to establish the effects of global warming on the study area. A step change analysis reveals 1961 as a change point year from cool to warm periods. Results also reveal that warming mainly occurred in the recent period (1962–2018), with a temperature rise of over 2οC being recorded in 2009. Severe dryness events occurred in the recent period as opposed to wetness events that dominated the earlier period (1901–1961). Dryness and wetness varied among drainage basins, with the Aswa basin being more susceptible to severe dryness while the Lake Kyoga basin to severe wetness. Lira and Kitgum were identified as drought hotspots at timescales of 3, 6 and 12 months. SPEI was able to reveal 60% of historical dryness events and 75% of wetness events on record, making it an adequate tool for monitoring humid events as opposed to droughts in sub-humid climates. It is hoped that this evidence can guide targeted mitigation measures towards climatic shocks within the region. © 2021 The Authors.

However, little is known about the microbial community and metabolic activity directly associated with POC remineralization in this chronically understudied realm. Here, we characterized the microbial community proteomes of POC samples collected from the twilight zone of three contrasting sites in the Northwest Pacific Ocean using a metaproteomic approach. The particle-attached bacteria from Alteromonadales, Rhodobacterales, and Enterobacterales were the primary POC remineralizers. Hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases and hydrolases, that degrade proteinaceous components and polysaccharides, the main constituents of POC, were abundant and taxonomically associated with these bacterial groups. Furthermore, identification of diverse speciesspecific transporters and metabolic enzymes implied niche specialization for nutrient acquisition among these bacterial groups. Temperature was the main environmental factor driving the active bacterial groups and metabolic processes, and Enterobacterales replaced Alteromonadales as the predominant group under low temperature. This study provides insight into the key bacteria and metabolic processes involved in POC remineralization, and niche complementarity and species substitution among bacterial groups are critical for efficient POC remineralization in the twilight zone. IMPORTANCE The ocean's twilight zone is a critical zone where more than 70% of the sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) is remineralized. Therefore, the twilight zone determines the size of biological carbon storage in the ocean and regulates the global climate. Prokaryotes are major players that govern remineralization of POC in this region. However, knowledge of microbial community structure and metabolic activity is still lacking. This study unveiled microbial communities and metabolic activities of POC samples collected from the twilight zone of three contrasting environments in the Northwest Pacific Ocean using a metaproteomic approach. Alteromonadales, Rhodobacterales, and Enterobacterales were the major remineralizers of POC. They excreted diverse species-specific hydrolytic enzymes to split POC into solubilized POC or dissolved organic carbon. Temperature played a crucial role in regulating the community composition and metabolism. Furthermore, niche complementarity or species substitution among bacterial groups guaranteed the efficient remineralization of POC in the twilight zone. © 2021. American Society for Microbiology.

The developed system consists of 14 different wireless network embedded sensors, wireless communication protocol, multi-dimensional data warehouse, graphical user interfaces and energy optimization software with artificial intelligence-backed control algorithms. The R&D activity is accomplished in the 'Intelligent Building Energy Management System' research project, which is funded by the State of Lower Saxony-Germany in the frame of Innovation Support Program between the years 2014 and 2018. The system is tested in two appropriately selected test buildings in Germany. It has been recorded that the system provides energy efficiency levels between 29.34% and 38.18% under different seasonal and occupancy conditions in office and residential building types. The analysis is accomplished within the framework of four main indicators. These are economic indicators including calculations of lifetime cost and payback rate methods, resource use indicators including the calculation of reduced energy use as a result of the energy efficiency provided by the system, social indicator including additional expendable income calculations and environmental indicators including calculations depicting the benefits of reducing harmful emissions. Analysis results illustrate that building energy optimization systems provide a cost-effective method for promoting energy efficiency goals. Results of the indicators prove monetary benefits for the building occupants in terms of resource use, return on investment and social impact, as well as quantifiable benefits for easing the harmful effects of climate change phenomenon. © 2021 The Author(s).

It is a strategic decision made after deliberate consideration by the Central Government. Such goals reflect China's responsibility as a major country in responding to global climate change, its vision of the future world development, and its commitment to green transformation. After the 18th CPC National Congress, China has undergone a fundamental change in its development philosophy. Protecting the environment is no longer regarded as a burden upon economic growth, but as a driving force for high-quality development. Emissions reduction has also changed from a task inflicted upon local governments to a goal people identify with. More than 120 countries have proposed carbon neutrality targets in different ways by now. The global consensus on carbon neutrality marks the end of the traditional industrial era and the start of a new development era. The concept of carbon neutrality redefines and reshapes the entire development paradigm. It is a self-revolution of the mode of production and life. It not only poses an unprecedented challenge but also provides a strategic opportunity for China.

Since cities play a central role in reducing carbon emissions, the issues such as whether and when their carbon dioxide emissions can be decoupled from economic growth have become the focus of attention. Based on the carbon dioxide emissions of 264 prefecture-level cities in China from 2000 to 2017, this paper uses the Tapio decoupling index to measure the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth of cities, analyzes the space-time evolution characteristics of carbon emissions and decoupling indexes by stages, and explores the relationship between carbon emissions and socio-economic development characteristics such as per capita GDP and industrial structure. The main conclusions drawn therefrom are as follows: (i) From 2000 to 2017, the city-wide carbon emissions rose from 2.484 billion tons in 2000 to 7.462 billion tons in 2017, registering a total increase of 200.40%. But the growth rate of carbon emissions within cities has been significantly reduced. (ii) As years passed by, the number of cities that achieved strong decoupling saw a significant increase, from zero in the 10th-11th Five-Year Plan period to 14 in the 12th Five-Year Plan period and the first two years of the 13th Five-Year Plan period, accounting for 5.3% of the total number of cities. (iii) There is an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between per capita carbon emissions and per capita GDP, which is consistent with the EKC curve hypothesis, but Chinese cities are still in the growth stage of the quadratic curve currently. The correlation between per capita CO2 emission and the proportion of the secondary industry was positive. The results of this study are expected to provide experience for the low-carbon development of cities in China and other developing countries, and provide references for the formulation and evaluation of policies and measures related to low-carbon economic development based on the decoupling model. © 2021 Social Sciences Academic Press (China).","Carbon emissions; cities; decoupling index; space-time evolution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117233941

Further, small island states are developing population, economic and adaptation policies to plan the future. Policies, such as raising of islands or land reclamation, require a long-term vision on populations and migration. However, population and migration systems in small island settings are poorly understood. To address this deficiency requires an approach that considers changing environmental and socio-economic factors and individual migration decision-making. This article introduces the conceptual model of migration and explores migration within one small island nation, the Maldives, as an example. Agent-based simulations of internal migration from 1985–2014 are used as a basis to explore a range of potential demographic futures up to 2050. The simulations consider a set of consistent demographic, environmental, policy and international migration narratives, which describe a range of key uncertainties. The capital island Malé has experienced significant population growth over the last decades, growing from around 67,000 to 153,000 inhabitants from 2000 to 2014, and comprising about 38 percent of the national population in 2014. In all future narratives, which consider possible demographic, governance, environmental and globalization changes, the growth of Malé continues while many other islands are effectively abandoned. The analysis suggests that migration in the Maldives has a strong inertia, and radical change to the environmental and/or socio-economic drivers would be needed for existing trends to change. Findings from this study may have implications for national development and planning for climate change more widely in island nations. © Scalabrini Migration Center 2021.","climate change; migration; small island states; theory of planned behavior","climate change; decision making; demography; environmental factor; future prospect; internal migration; small island state; socioeconomic impact; Maldives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117100383

One third of 9 million Veterans Health Administration enrolled Veterans live in rural areas. Although digital solutions can expand capacity, enhance care access, and reduce financial burden, they may also exacerbate rural-urban health disparities. Careful evaluation of patients' perceptions and policy tradeoffs are necessary to optimize teleoncology postpandemic. METHODS: Patients with ≥ 1 teleoncology visit with medical, surgical, or radiation oncology between March 2020 and June 2020 were identified retrospectively. Validated, Likert-type survey assessing patient satisfaction was developed. Follow-up survey was conducted on patients with ≥ 1 teleoncology visit from August 2020 to January 2021. Travel distance, time, cost, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on zip codes. RESULTS: A hundred surveys were completed (response rate, 62%). Patients overall were satisfied with teleoncology (83% Agree or Strongly Agree) but felt less satisfied than in-person visits (47% Agree or Strongly Agree). Audiovisual component improved patient perception of involvement in care, ability to self-manage health or medical needs, and comparability to in-person visits. Follow-up survey demonstrated similar satisfaction. Total travel-related savings are as follows: 86,470 miles, 84,374 minutes, $49,720 US dollars, and 35.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide. CONCLUSION: Veterans are broadly satisfied with teleoncology. Audiovisual capabilities are critical to satisfaction. This is challenging for rural populations with lack of technology access. Patients experienced financial and time savings, and society benefitted from reduced carbon emissions. Continued optimization is needed to enhance patient experience and address secondary effects.",,"environment; human; pandemic; patient satisfaction; retrospective study; telemedicine; travel; travel related disease; veteran; COVID-19; Environment; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Satisfaction; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine; Travel; Travel-Related Illness; Veterans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116955049

Recent advances in this approach also allow for statistical assessment of spatio-temporal patterning in demographic trends. In this paper we reconstruct population change for the whole Italian peninsula from the Late Mesolithic to the Early Iron Age (10,000–2800 cal yr BP). How did population patterns vary across time and space? Were fluctuations in human population related to climate change? In order to answer these questions, we have collated a large list of published radiocarbon dates (n = 4010) and use this list firstly to infer the demographic trends for the Italian peninsula as a whole, before addressing each of five sub-regions in turn (northern, central, and southern Italy, Sicily, Sardinia). We also compare population fluctuations with local paleoclimate proxies (cave, lake, marine records). At a pan-regional scale, the results show a general rapid and substantial increase in population in the Early Neolithic with the introduction of farming at around 8000 cal yr BP and further dramatic increases during the Bronze and Iron Age (~ 3800–2800 cal yr BP). However, different regional demographic trajectories exist across different regions of Italy, suggesting a variety of localised human responses to climate shifts. Population and climate appear to have been more closely correlated during the early–mid Holocene (Mesolithic–Neolithic), while later in the Holocene (Bronze–Iron Ages) they decouple. Overall, across the Holocene the population dynamics varied by region and depended on the long-term socio-ecological dynamics prevailing in a given area. Finally, we include a brief response to the paper ‘Radiocarbon dated trends and central Mediterranean prehistory’ by Parkinson et al. (J Word Prehist 34(3), 2021)—synchronously published by Journal of World Prehistory but wholly independently developed—indicating how our conclusions accord with or differ from one another. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate; Demography; Italy; Landscape ecology; Prehistory; Radiocarbon summed probability distribution","climate effect; demographic trend; Iron Age; landscape ecology; Mesolithic; population dynamics; prehistoric; probability; radiocarbon dating; Italy; Sardinia; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116798767

The evidence for this has been constituted in a database of 4608 radiocarbon dates (of which 4515 were retained for analysis following initial screening) from 1195 archaeological sites in southern France, Italy and Malta, spanning the Mesolithic to Early Iron Age periods, c. 8000 to 500 BC. We provide an overview of the settlement record for central Mediterranean prehistory and add to this an assessment of the available archaeological radiocarbon evidence in order to review the traditional narratives on the prehistory of the region. This new chronology has enabled us to identify the most significant points in time where activity levels, population dynamics and cultural change have together caused strong temporal patterning in the archaeological record. Some of these episodes were localized to one region, whereas others were part of pan-regional trends and cultural trajectories that took many centuries to play out fully, revealing prehistoric societies subject to collapse, recovery, and continuing instability over the long-term. Using the radiocarbon evidence, we model growth rates in the various regions so that the tempo of change at certain points in space and time can be identified, compared, and discussed in the context of demographic change. Using other published databases of radiocarbon data, we have drawn comparisons across the central Mediterranean to wider prehistoric Europe, and northern Africa. Finally, we include a brief response to the synchronously published but independently developed paper (Palmisano et al. in J World Prehist 34(3), 2021). While there are differences in our respective approaches, we share the general conclusions that large-scale trends can been identified through meta-analyses of the archaeological record, and these offer new perspectives on how society functioned. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bronze age; Copper age; France; Italy; Malta; Mediterranean; Mesolithic; Neolithic; Palaeodemography; Radiocarbon dating","Bronze Age; cultural history; Holocene; human activity; Mesolithic; radiocarbon dating; settlement history; France; Italy; Malta [Southern Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116792674

Relative to their internal combustion vehicle counterparts, EVs consume less energy per unit distance, and add the benefit of not emitting any carbon dioxide in operation and instead shift their emissions to the existing local fleet of power generation. However, the true success of EVs depends on their successful integration with the supporting infrastructure systems. Building upon the recently published methodology for the same purpose, this paper presents a “systems-of-systems” case study assessing the impacts of EVs on these three systems in the context of Abu Dhabi. For the physical transportation system, a microscopic discrete-time traffic operations simulator is used to predict the kinematic state of the EV fleet over the duration of one day. For the impact on the intelligent transportation system (ITS), the integration of EVs into Abu Dhabi is studied using a multi-domain matrix (MDM) of the Abu Dhabi Department of Transportation ITS. Finally, for the impact on the electric power system, the EV traffic flow patterns from the CMS are used to calculate the timing and magnitude of charging loads. The paper concludes with the need for an intelligent transportation-energy system (ITES) which would coordinate traffic and energy management functionality. © 2021 by the authors.

The special issue consists of a diverse set of papers that complement one another while each contributes in unique ways that will stimulate reflexive practices among the science education community as they ponder how they can contribute to the resolution of global challenges that define our lifetimes. In this Editorial we address priorities for improved science literacy for a worldwide community so that moment-to-moment practices can reduce the world's carbon footprint and reverse global warming and related challenges such as species extinction. We posit that to meet particulars of global challenges facing humanity, science educators need to expand their roles and definitions of science education. Accordingly, in an era of COVID-19, there is an imperative to expand and deepen functional literacy in science and in particular wellness for everyone as part of a necessary education on the birth through death continuum. Our advocacy for the use of authentic inquiry affords learning from research and ensuring that all research participants have opportunities to learn from ongoing research and one another. We expect that all participants will benefit equitably from being involved in research. Participants are educated about what is learned from research in which they are involved, and how that improves their practices. We anticipate that much of what is learned from such research will be enacted in everyday life, thereby affording those with whom they interact to learn by being-with them. Because of the complex, chaotic and dynamic nature of today's world and its associated lifestyles, we address contemplative activities we regard as highly appropriate for doing science in a manner that is restorative and nurturing for ourselves and for the world. Specifically, we examine breathing meditation, meditating to increase blood oxygenation, walking meditation, loving kindness meditation, soft touch energy work and mindfulness. Each of these contemplative activities relates to knowing thyself better and promoting and sustaining wellness and wellbeing. We address self-help in relation to wellness because so many people follow one or two pathways when they become sick, i.e., they rest until their health improves and/or they go to the doctor who may diagnose/prescribe pharmaceuticals or changes in aspects of lifestyle (e.g., diet, more sleep). We provide examples of self-help practices that allow individuals to be autonomous and proactive in avoiding sickness, and directly addressing symptoms if and when necessary. Finally, we examine the potential of using a dialectical approach to teaching, learning and future rethinking of science education and science educators. Grand challenges of the moment demand no less than ongoing research with transformations that catalyze improvements now. We do not have a luxury of waiting for the right time, and the right time to enact sustainable lifestyles is now. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Authentic inquiry; Contemplative activities; COVID-19; Crisis of representation; Difference as a resource; Know thyself; Self-help; Sustainability",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116464195

Nevertheless, monitoring schemes aimed at detecting their population trends were only recently established. In this study, we gathered all occurrence records of the 81 species of butterflies recorded for the Alta Murgia National Park (Italy, Apulia), a prime conservation area for butterflies. By using literature, citizen science, and unpublished sample data, we traced potential extinctions since 1966. We also provided a dedicated index to evaluate the potential extinction at the whole community level. We found that among the 29 species recorded before 2009, three were not recovered from 2009 to 2021. Another group of nine species was not recorded in the last five years. However, given the not standardized sampling methodology and the possibility that apparently disappeared species were due to inaccurate identification, we conclude that the butterfly community of the Park is showing a strong resilience. We hypothesize that such resilience may be attributed to the existence of the protected area and the presence of heterogeneous environments, which allow to buffer climatic changes and any other negative anthropic effects. The objective recognition of rare species in the surrounding region of 200 km ray also allowed identifying which species should be considered as prime targets for the conservation of local and regional diversity.

We investigated the microbial community of the ground heated to 72°C in the release area of hot gases resulting from underground combustion of coal mining waste at the Bungurskiy-Severny coal deposit in the Kemerovo region of Russia. Analysis of the composition of the microbial community by 16S rRNA gene profiling revealed predominance of thermophilic bacteria of the phyla Deinococcus-Thermus, Aquificae, and Firmicutes. As a result of metagenomic analysis, 18 genomes of the main members of the microbial community were assembled, including the complete genomes of Hydrogenobacter thermophiles, a member of the candidate genus UBA11096 of the phylum Aquificae (RBS10-58), Thermoflexus hugenholtzii, and Thermus antranikianii. Analysis of the RBS10-58 genome indicates that this bacterium can autotrophically fix carbon in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle and obtain energy via oxidation of hydrogen and sulfur compounds with oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptors. Genome analysis of the two dominant Firmicutes species, Hydrogenibacillus schlegelii and an uncultured member of the class Thermaerobacteria, showed that these bacteria could grow aerobically by oxidizing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Overall, the community was dominated by aerobic bacteria capable of growing autotrophically and obtaining energy via oxidation of the main components of coal gases, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Thermus antranikianii, which makes up about a half of the microbial community, probably uses organic matter produced by autotrophic members of Firmicutes and Aquificae. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Aquificae; coal gases; hydrogenotrophs; microbial community; thermophiles; Thermus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116360536

Methods: Both linoleic and linolenic acids were supplemented at 0 (control), 1, 3, 5 and 7 % of dry matter (DM) in a ration with a high roughage to concentrate ratio (70: 30). Total gas and CH4 were measured at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h of fermentation while pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations were measured at 24 h using buffalo rumen fluid in an in vitro batch culture system. Microbial populations were determined using 16S-rDNA gene primers by RT-PCR. Results: The results revealed that linoleic acid at 3, 5 and 7 % decreased the concentration of NH3-N (p < 0.05) but linolenic acid at 5 and 7 % increased NH3-N (p < 0.05). A linear decrease (p <0.001) in acetate and butyrate, coupled with linear increase (p <0.001) in propionate was observed in response to treatment. Furthermore, supplementation of 3, 5 and 7 % of both fatty acids linearly (p < 0.001) decreased total gas and CH4 production when compared to the control. The addition of linoleic acid linearly (p < 0.001) decreased the number of protozoa without affecting methanogens, while linolenic acid linearly and quadratically (p < 0.001) reduced the population of both protozoa and methanogens (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Linolenic acid is more effective at a 3 % level in reducing methane production (up to 63 %) in high roughage diets. © 2021 The authors.

Within this zone, tree growth limitation is expected to intensify due to ongoing climate changes, reducing forest productivity, affecting tree physiological processes and increasing tree mortality, with potential implications for the regional and global carbon cycle. We explored Pinus sylvestris L. tree ring growth and structure response to climate in southern Siberia. We measured tree-ring width (RW) and xylem parenchyma represented as the percentage of ring surface occupied by parenchyma rays (PERPAR) and the total amount of ray parenchyma per sample width (TOTRAY) within the growth rings for the 1967–2018 period. The results showed an influence of environmental conditions before and during the formation of ray parenchyma, with an independent climate response from the observed in the RW. Therefore, pine xylem parenchyma-based chronologies have potential as a proxy to evaluate climate sensitivity in P. sylvestris. However, the dependence on climate conditions might affect ray parenchyma’s critical role in conifers as P. sylvestris under the current temperature-induced drought trend in the forest-steppe. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","climate; conifers; quantitative wood anatomy; ray parenchyma; tree growth","anatomy; climate change; climate conditions; coniferous tree; ecotone; forest-steppe; mortality; physiological response; transition zone; Siberia; Coniferophyta; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116211951

A considerable part of recent publications on climatogenic transformation of plant communities deal with the dynamics of the upper treeline, while similar studies on shrub vegetation are scarce. Our study on the age structure of Siberian juniper (Juniperus sibirica Burgsd.) thickets in the Northern Urals (the Chuvalsky Kamen Range) has shown that the upper shrubline has shifted up the altitudinal gradient. The establishment of J. sibirica in windblown areas with little snow at the summits of slopes began as late as the second half of the 20th century and has gained momentum after the 1970s. An analysis of climatic data has revealed a linear trend toward increase in the magnitude of anomalies in average air temperature over the cold season (November–March) by 1.69°С/100 years (R2 = 0.57), with precipitation increasing by 67.3 mm/100 years (R2 = 0.43). The results of correlation analysis between the establishment of J. sibirica and average precipitation by 5-year periods show that the strongest correlations occur in areas with little snow at the early cold season (November–January; R = 0.96). Changes in the pattern of snow accumulation in winter could facilitate the current expansion of J. sibirica to the mountain tundras of the Northern Urals. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","climate change; Juniperus sibirica Burgsd; Northern Urals; snow depth; upper shrubline","air temperature; climate conditions; correlation; ecosystem; plant community; snow accumulation; treeline; vegetation; Urals; Juniperus; Juniperus nana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116189088

However, how the low-carbon transition and air quality targets could be simultaneously achieved at the sub-national levels remains unclear. The questions arise whether province-level climate change mitigation strategies could help ease the air pollution and close the air quality gap, and how these co-benefits can be compared with the cost of the green transition. Here, using an integrated modeling framework, we combined with local air pollutant emission inventories and issued policy documents to quantitatively evaluated the current situation and targets of the air quality and health co-benefits of deep carbon mitigation in Sichuan, a fast-developing inland province in China. We found that by 2035, without system-wide energy transformation induced by carbon mitigation policies, the improvement in air quality in Sichuan Province might be limited, even under stringent end-of-pipe emission control measures. On the contrary, the co-benefits of low-carbon policies would be significant. On top of stringent end-of-pipe controls, the implementation of carbon mitigation policy in line with China's enhanced climate target could further reduce the average PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan by as much as 2.8 µg m-3, or the population-weighted PM2.5 concentration by 5.9 µg m-3 in 2035. The monetized health co-benefits in Sichuan Province would amount to 23 billion USD under the stringent carbon mitigation scenario, exceeding 1.7 billion USD of the mitigation cost by 2035. The results indicate that significant air quality and health benefits could both be achieved from carbon mitigation at the provincial level. Both air-pollution or carbon-reduction oriented policies would be important for improving environmental quality and public health. © 2021 The Author(s).

There are 534 bamboo species in China, and 371 endemic species account for about 70% of all bamboo species. However, little is known about the differences in the rhizome evolution rate between endemic and non-endemic bamboos. Here, we collected morphological traits (height and leaf length) and environmental variables (including climate, space, and soil) of all 534 Chinese bamboo species to determine the relative contribution of environmental factors and traits of bamboo rhizome evolution with different endemism by structural equation modeling. We found that endemic bamboo had a higher speciation rate than non-endemic bamboo. The distribution centers of sympodial bamboos are mainly located in the mountain range of southwest China, while amphipodial and monopodial bamboos are distributed with higher latitude farther east in China. The height of non-endemic sympodial and monopodial bamboos was significantly higher than endemic sympodial and monopodial bamboos. The leaf length of nonendemic sympodial bamboos was significantly higher than endemic sympodial bamboo, while the leaf length of non-endemic amphipodial bamboo was significantly lower than endemic amphipodial bamboo. Environmental factors and traits explain 47% of the evolutionary variation of non-endemic bamboo species, while they explain 17% of that of endemic bamboo species. Longitude, latitude, and leaf length were the critical factors in the rhizome evolution of non-endemic bamboo, while longitude and height were the critical factors in the rhizome evolution of endemic bamboo. Our results imply that for higher species formation rates, endemic bamboo should be more concerned than non-endemic bamboo in the process of bamboo rhizome evolution. It will likely appear that new non-endemic bamboo species have a short leaf length in higher latitude and farther east in China (the lower Yangtze plain), as well as new endemic bamboo species with a low height farther east in China (the Wuyi Mountains). Meanwhile, ancient non-endemic bamboo with a long leaf length in Yunnan Province and ancient endemic bamboo with a high height in the Hengduan Mountains may be more likely to become extinct. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the difference in the rhizome evolution of endemic and non-endemic bamboos, which provides new insights into the conservation of Chinese bamboo biodiversity. © 2021 by the authors.

Global gridded cropping system data products offer useful information for these applications. However, not only the main sources of information (satellites, censuses, surveys and models) but also the spatial and temporal resolutions of these data products are quite distant from each other because of different user requirements. This is a barrier to strengthening collaborations among the research communities working to increase the capacity of societies to manage climate risks for global food systems, from extreme weather disasters to climate change. A first step is to improve cropping system data products so they can be used more seamlessly across various applications than they are currently. Toward this goal, this article reviews global gridded data products of crop variables (area, yield, cropping intensity, etc) using systematic literature survey, identifies their current limitations, and suggests directions for future research. We found that cropland or crop type mapping and yield or production estimation/prediction together accounted for half of the research objectives of the reviewed studies. Satellite-based data products are dominant at the finer resolution in space and time (<10 km and daily to annual), while model-based data products are found at the coarser resolutions (>55 km and decadal). Census-based data products are seen at intermediate resolutions (10-55 km and annual to decadal). The suggested directions for future research include the hybridization of multiple sources of information, improvements to temporal coverage and resolution, the enrichment of management variables, the exploration of new sources of information, and comprehensiveness within a single data product. © 2021 The Author(s).

An important social factor influencing outcomes is communication or the way information spreads through groups of people who need adaptation support. A community’s unique information-sharing potential can be understood through social network analysis. A social network perspective views humans as actors in a system of interconnected relationships. This approach is useful for mapping information flows or how adaptation strategies can spread within a community. Through a study with coffee farmers in Risaralda, Colombia, we demonstrate how a community’s network strengths can be identified in order to develop tailored climate change adaptation communication strategies. To do this, we measure ego networks, which are social relations stemming from one “unit of interest,” or coffee farmers, around climate change. From there, we identify the information attributes or the preferred ways farmers receive and send information on climate change. Lastly, we analyze this data against the broader stakeholder system to provide a macro level context. Together, this provides a clear vision of how climate change adaptation strategies may be spread through a community’s information network. For coffee farmers in Risaralda, Colombia, key institutions and their agents do not currently acknowledge long-term climate change. The farmers interact the most on this subject with their self-organizing associations. Therefore, targeting information campaigns to local associations offers the most potential for effective climate change adaptation information-sharing, and these same associations also offer the in-person communication these farmers indicate they prefer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change adaptation; Climate change communication; Colombian coffee farmers; Ego networks; Information attributes; Social network analysis","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Information services; Climate change adaptation; Climate change communication; Colombia; Colombian coffee farmer; Colombians; Ego networks; Information attribute; Information sharing; Network strength; Social Network Analysis; Agriculture; adaptive management; climate change; social network; stakeholder; Colombia; Risaralda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116083373

Even though the mass of the heavy quarks plays a subdominant role during the high virtuality portion of the jet evolution, it does affect longitudinal drag and diffusion, stimulating additional radiation from heavy quarks [6]. These emissions partially compensate the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. In the lower virtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the transverse momenta of the partons, scattering and radiation processes off heavy quarks differ from those off light quarks. All these factors result in a different nuclear modification factor for heavy versus light flavors and thus for heavy-flavor tagged jets. In this study, the heavy quark shower evolution and the fluid dynamical medium are modeled on an event by event basis using the JETSCAPE Framework [2]. We present a multi-stage calculation that explores the differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanisms within a realistically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Inside the QGP, the highly virtual and energetic portion of the shower is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBT generator models the showers induced by energetic and close-to-on-shell heavy quarks. Energy-momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet modification, proceeds using a weak coupling recoil approach. The JETSCAPE framework allows for transitions, on the level of individual partons, from one energy-loss prescription to the other depending on the parton's energy and virtuality and the local density. This allows us to explore the effect and interplay between the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation and radiation from hard heavy quarks in a dense medium. © owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).",,"Elementary particles; % reductions; Cone effects; Dead cone; Dynamical interactions; Heavy-quark; Multi-scales; Parton scattering; Quark mass; Quark-gluon plasma; Transverse momenta; Energy dissipation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116073055

This paper draws upon complex adaptive systems thinking to develop an approach for capturing, understanding, and monitoring climate vulnerability in a case study from northern Canada, focusing on Inuit food systems. In the community of Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, we followed 10 hunters over a 2-year period, asking them to document their harvesting activities and discuss their lived experience of harvesting under changing environmental and societal conditions. GPS monitoring and participatory mapping sessions were used to document 23,996km of trails (n = 409), with conversational bi-weekly semi-structured interviews and secondary instrumental weather data used to contextualise climate change within a nexus of other socioeconomic, cultural, and political stressors that also affect harvesting. Our results demonstrate that climate change has considerable potential to affect harvesting activities, particularly when its impacts manifest as anomalous/ extreme events. However, climate change impacts are not necessarily the most salient issues affecting harvesting on a day-to-day basis. Instead, factors relating to economics (particularly financial capital and the wage-based economy), social networks, and institutions are found to have a greater influence, either as standalone factors with cascading effects or when acting synchronously to augment the impacts of environmental change. © 2021 Naylor et al.

According to IPCC, if the CO2 emissions continue to increase at the current rate, global warming is likely to increase by 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial levels, between the years 2030 and 2052. Efficient and sustainable geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) offers one plausible solution for reducing CO2 levels. The impermeable shale formations have traditionally served as good seals for reservoirs in which CO2 has been injected for GCS. The rapid development of subsurface organic-rich shales for hydrocarbon recovery has opened up the possibility of utilizing these hydraulically fractured shale reservoirs as potential target reservoirs for GCS. However, to evaluate the GCS potential of different types of shales, we need to better understand the geochemical reactions at CO2-fluid-shale interfaces and how they affect the flow and CO2 storage permanence. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge on the interactions of CO2 with shale fluids, minerals, and organic matter, and the impact of parameters such as pressure, temperature, and moisture content on these interactions. We also discuss the potential of using CO2 as an alternate fracturing fluid, its role in enhanced shale gas recovery, and different geochemical tracers to identify whether CO2 or brine migration occurred along a particular fluid transport pathway. Additionally, this review highlights the need for future studies to focus on determining (1) the contribution of CO2 solubility and the impact of formation water chemistry on GCS, (2) the rates of dissolution/precipitation and sorption reactions, (3) the role of mineralogical and structural heterogeneities in shale, (4) differences in reaction mechanisms/rates between gaseous CO2vs. brine mixed CO2vs. supercritical CO2, (5) the use of CO2 as a fracturing fluid and its proppant carrying capacity and (6) the role of CO2 in enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Fracturing fluids; Geochemistry; Global warming; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrocarbons; Industrial emissions; Reaction rates; Recovery; Shale; Transport properties; CO2 emissions; CO2 sequestration; Current rate; Exponential increase; Geochemical control; Geologic carbon sequestrations; Hydrocarbon recovery; Organic-rich shales; Pre-industrial levels; Shale formation; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; hydrocarbon; mineral; organic carbon; organic matter; tracer; water; carbon dioxide; natural gas; adsorption; carbon sequestration; chemical interaction; dissolution; experimental study; fluid transport; fracking; geochemical analysis; geology; mineralogy; moisture; oil and gas field; oil shale; precipitation; pressure; reaction analysis; Review; simulation; solubility; temperature; geology; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Geology; Minerals; Natural Gas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116053798

Although plasmonic modes in the tunnelling gap are responsible for the emission response in both cases, the luminescence cross-section shows a characteristic dependence on bias voltage for the two oxide phases. On the Cu3O2 surface oxide, the emission yield peaks at the 1st field emission resonance of the STM junction, when particularly high inelastic tunnelling rates are realized between tip and sample. On Cu2O(111) patches, on the other hand, direct and defect-mediated electron recombination from the oxide conduction to the valence band is responsible for plasmon excitations in the STM cavity. Given the different excitation mechanisms, Cu2O and Cu3O2 oxide regions become distinguishable in bias-dependent STM luminescence maps with nanometre precision.

For example, poverty alleviation may exacerbate air pollution by increasing production and associated emissions. This paper investigates the potential impacts of achieving different poverty eradication goals on typical air pollutants in China by capturing household consumption patterns for different income groups and locations, and linking it to China’s multi-regional input-output table and various scenarios. We find that ending extreme poverty, i.e. lifting people above the poverty line of USD 1.90 a day in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP), increases China’s household emissions by only less than 0.6%. The contribution increases to 2.4%–4.4% when adopting the USD 3.20 PPP poverty line for lower-middle-income countries. Technical improvements in economic sectors can easily offset poverty-alleviation-induced emissions in both scenarios. Nevertheless, when moving all impoverished residents below the USD 5.50 PPP poverty line for upper-middle-income countries, household emissions in China would increase significantly by 18.5%–22.3%. Counteracting these additional emissions would require national emission intensity in production to decrease by 23.7% for SO2, 13.6% for NOx, 82.1% for PM2.5, and 58.0% for PM10.

This work reports the ignition of plane-to-plane dielectric barrier discharges at atmospheric pressure operated in nominally high-purity helium with microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) foams derived from woody biomass taking up the entirety of the gas gap. Over the whole range of experimental conditions examined, discharge ignition and propagation mostly occurs through the foam from one electrode to the other (volume discharge). For outgassed foams, current-voltage characteristics suggest a glow-like discharge regime at 60 kHz and a filamentary behaviour at 10 kHz. However, optical imaging reveals localized emission patterns in both cases. Significantly less plasma-induced damage is observed through the MFC foams at 10 kHz than at 60 kHz. From these findings, the apparent homogeneous regime at 60 kHz seems to result from multiple discharges sustained in localized damaged zones. For non-outgassed samples exposed to the helium gas flow, gaseous species trapped in the MFC foams yielded to a significant increase of the discharge power and thus caused more significant damage to the cellulosic material. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","cellulosic materials; dielectric barrier discharges; optical and electrical diagnostics; plasmacellulose interactions","Atmospheric pressure; Current voltage characteristics; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Flow of gases; Cellulosic material; Dielectric barrier discharges; Electrical diagnostics; High purity; Localised; Nonthermal; Optical diagnostics; Plasmacellulose interaction; Renewable resource; Sustainable polymers; Helium; Barometric Pressure; Damage; Dielectrics; Discharge; Gas Flow; Helium; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115981543

Yet, it remains undersampled in the observational satellite record. Due to recent advances in interferometer and infrared detection technologies, imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) technology has been identified as a feasible remote sensing approach to obtain the required precision and spatial resolution of atmospheric trace gas composition in the UTLS. Building on the success of instruments such as the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding and gimbaled limb observer for radiance imaging of the atmosphere, the limb imaging Fourier transform spectrometer experiment (LIFE) instrument, of which this paper details the design and performance, is a balloon-borne infrared imaging FTS developed as an early prototype of a low earth orbit satellite instrument. LIFE is constructed primarily with commercially available off-the-shelf components, with a design emphasis on greatly reducing the complexity of the instrument, particularly the cooling requirements, with a minimal reduction in information gain on the target atmospheric greenhouse gases of water vapor, methane, ozone, and nitrous oxide. The developed instrument was characterized through a series of thermal and vacuum tests and validated through a successful demonstration balloon flight during the 2019 Strato-Science campaign in Canada. In the calibration of the data from the balloon flight, an issue was identified regarding a lack of knowledge in the emissivity of the on-board blackbody calibration sources. These systematic effects were minimized through the application of an emissivity ratio determined from the characterization tests where a wider range of known blackbody temperatures were available. Despite this identified calibration issue, the results demonstrate that the instrument is capable of meeting primary performance requirements for trace gas retrievals of the target atmospheric species. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Bolometers; Electromagnetic wave emission; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Orbits; Remote sensing; Spacecraft instruments; Spectrometers; Thermography (imaging); Atmospheric trace gas; Balloon flights; Detection technology; Imaging Fourier transform spectrometer; Infrared detection; Lower stratosphere; Remote sensing approaches; Under sampled; Upper troposphere; Variable regions; Calibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115973117

They are also under considerable threat due to fragmentation degradation and urbanization. However, a complete understanding of how anthropogenic actions can affect microbial biodiversity and functional adaptations is still lacking. In this study, we carried out 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis using sediment samples from two distinct mangrove areas located within the Serinhaém Estuary, Brazil. The first sampling area was located around the urban area of Ituberá, impacted by domestic sewage and urban runoff, while the second was an environmentally conserved site. Our results show significant changes in the structure of the communities between impacted and conserved sites. Biodiversity, along with functional potentials for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, were significantly increased in the urban area. We found that the environmental factors of organic matter, temperature and copper were significantly correlated with the observed shifts in the communities. Contributions of specific taxa to the functional potentials were negatively correlated with biodiversity, such that fewer numbers of taxa in the conserved area contributed to the majority of the metabolic potential. The results suggest that the contamination by urban runoff may have generated a different environment that led to the extinction of some taxa observed at the conserved site. In their place we found that the impacted site is enriched in prokaryotic families that are known human and animal pathogens, a clear negative effect of the urbanization process.

We specifically select for track events, which results in better directional reconstruction due to the long signature the muon leaves in the detector than for cascade events. Due to the improved signal-background ratio and good pointing resolution, we will discuss how this event selection will improve the IceCube sensitivity to southern neutrino sources.

We estimated the global burden of low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) and impacts on reduced birth weight and gestational age (GA), attributable to ambient and household PM2.5 pollution in 2019. Methods and findings We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles in English. Study quality was assessed using 2 tools: (1) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist; and (2) National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) risk of bias questions. We conducted a meta-regression (MR) to quantify the risk of PM2.5 on birth weight and GA. The MR, based on a systematic review (SR) of articles published through April 4, 2021, and resulting uncertainty intervals (UIs) accounted for unexplained between-study heterogeneity. Separate nonlinear relationships relating exposure to risk were generated for each outcome and applied in the burden estimation. The MR included 44, 40, and 40 birth weight, LBW, and PTB studies, respectively. Majority of the studies were of retrospective cohort design and primarily from North America, Europe, and Australia. A few recent studies were from China, India, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Pooled estimates indicated 22 grams (95% UI: 12, 32) lower birth weight, 11% greater risk of LBW (1.11, 95% UI: 1.07, 1.16), and 12% greater risk of PTB (1.12, 95% UI: 1.06, 1.19), per 10 μg/m3 increment in ambient PM2.5. We estimated a global population–weighted mean lowering of 89 grams (95% UI: 88, 89) of birth weight and 3.4 weeks (95% UI: 3.4, 3.4) of GA in 2019, attributable to total PM2.5. Globally, an estimated 15.6% (95% UI: 15.6, 15.7) of all LBW and 35.7% (95% UI: 35.6, 35.9) of all PTB infants were attributable to total PM2.5, equivalent to 2,761,720 (95% UI: 2,746,713 to 2,776,722) and 5,870,103 (95% UI: 5,848,046 to 5,892,166) infants in 2019, respectively. About one-third of the total PM2.5 burden for LBW and PTB could be attributable to ambient exposure, with household air pollution (HAP) dominating in low-income countries. The findings should be viewed in light of some limitations such as heterogeneity between studies including size, exposure levels, exposure assessment method, and adjustment for confounding. Furthermore, studies did not separate the direct effect of PM2.5 on birth weight from that mediated through GA. As a consequence, the pooled risk estimates in the MR and likewise the global burden may have been underestimated. Conclusions Ambient and household PM2.5 were associated with reduced birth weight and GA, which are, in turn, associated with neonatal and infant mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. © 2021 Ghosh et al.

This assessment considers the provincial differences in electricity prices, shares of renewables in power grids, and solar radiations in China. We find that in 2019, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH2) in 31 provinces varies from 31.5 ¥ per kg to 46.8 ¥ per kg in the single electricity price scenario, and reduces by up to 5.5 ¥ per kg when implementing a time-of-use price. In terms of CO2 emissions, we demonstrate that electrolytic hydrogen has greater CO2 emissions than the widespread coal-based hydrogen in 21 out of 31 provinces of China. The results suggest that implementing time-of-use electricity prices and subsidizing photovoltaics, instead of electricity prices and electrolyzers, can improve the performance of electric hydrogen production in terms of cost and CO2 emissions. Further provincial analysis considering hydrogen demand potentials shows that, under stricter CO2 emission constraints, substituting fossil fuel with electrolytic hydrogen can reduce CO2 emissions. However, its popularization is impeded by fossil fuels with low costs. Due to the regional differentiation in the cost competitiveness of electrolytic hydrogen, different types and levels of subsidies should be carefully adopted depending on the provincial characteristics in electricity prices, solar radiations, renewable integrations, fossil fuel prices, and hydrogen demand potentials. In the end, when comparing seven pathways towards electrolytic hydrogen development from 2020 to 2050, we find that the production cost of the electrolytic hydrogen is unbundled from the restriction of CO2 emission requirements after 2030, and a high carbon price may accelerate the cost competitiveness of electrolytic hydrogen by decades. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Competition; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Hydrogen production; Solar power generation; CO2 emissions; Cost competitiveness; Electricity prices; Electrolytic hydrogen; Grid-based; Hydrogen system; Levelized costs; Low carbon; Photovoltaics; Renewables; Fossil fuels; carbon; competitiveness; cost analysis; demand analysis; electricity; electricity supply; electrolyte; emission control; energy market; hydrogen; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115885820

In this work, we have prepared a quasi-double star catalyst composed of nearby Ni and Fe active sites via a simple pyrolysis of Ni and Fe co-doped Zn-based MOFs in order to achieve a high selectivity at a low overpotential during the CO2 RR. Specifically, the optimized Ni/Fe-N-C catalyst shows an exclusive selectivity (a maximum FE(CO) of 98%) at a low overpotential of 390 mV vs. RHE, which is superior to both the single metal counterparts (Ni-N-C and Fe-N-C catalysts) and other state-of-the-art M-N-C catalysts. The DFT results further reveal that regulating the catalytic CO2 RR performance via nearby Ni and Fe active sites can potentially break the activity benchmark of the single metal counterparts because the neighboring Ni and Fe active sites not only function in synergy to decrease the reaction barrier for the formation of COOH∗ and desorption of CO∗ in comparison to their single metal counterparts, but also prevent the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work presents a quasi-double-star catalyst composed of two metal sites for high-efficiency CO2 reduction, which paves the way for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with separated active sites for other reactions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Benchmarking; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Design for testability; Electrolytic reduction; Energy utilization; Iron; Nickel; Stars; Active site; Double stars; Electro reduction; Electrochemical transfer; Faraday efficiency; High energy consumption; Higher efficiency; Overpotential; Single-atoms; ]+ catalyst; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; catalyst; energy efficiency; iron; nickel; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115881327

However, empical assessments on the latter are still limited. Using monthly data collected from 461 coal-fired power plants in China during the period from 2012 to 2014, this paper explores the influences of a suite of climatic factors and non-climatic factors on power generation efficiency. Furthermore, we project future consequences of efficiency with various climate change scenarios. We find significant heterogeneities in the impacts of temperatures across different types of power plants. On average, a 1 °C increase in monthly temperature is associated with an efficiency reduction of 0.09% and 0.32%, respectively, for electricity-only plants and electricity plus heat plants; this means that China's northern region - which has more electricity plus heat plants - is more vulnerable to climate change. Future projections suggest that efficiency reductions induced by climate change could lead to substantial power supply declines. Under the RCP8.5 scenarios, the power losses would reach 15.77 billion kW h per year in the 2050s, accounting for 13.5% of Beijing's electricity consumption in 2019. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that the improvement in generation efficiency induced by the shut down of small and old units cannot fully offset the supply reduction by shut down itself. Factoring in the rapidly increasing power demands imposes more alarming challenges for stable and sustainable power supplies. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Efficiency; Electric power utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Mining; Plant shutdowns; % reductions; Climate change scenarios; Climatic factors; Demand supplies; Impact of temperatures; Northern regions; Power demands; Power generation efficiency; Power supply; Types of power; Climate change; climate effect; coal-fired power plant; demand analysis; electricity; energy efficiency; power generation; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115878931

We introduce an integrated research catchment site (Pallas) for atmosphere, ecosystems, and ecohydrology studies in subarctic conditions in Finland that can be used for a new set of comparative catchment investigations. The Pallas site provides unique observational data and high-intensity field measurement datasets over long periods. The infrastructure for atmosphere- to landscape-scale research in ecosystem processes in a subarctic landscape has recently been complemented with detailed ecohydrological measurements. We identify three dominant processes in subarctic ecohydrology: (a) strong seasonality drives ecohydrological regimes, (b) limited dynamic storage causes rapid stream response to water inputs (snowmelt and intensive storms), and (c) hydrological state of the system regulates catchment-scale dissolved carbon dynamics and greenhouse (GHG) fluxes. Surface water and groundwater interactions play an important role in regulating catchment-scale carbon balances and ecosystem respiration within subarctic peatlands, particularly their spatial variability in the landscape. Based on our observations from Pallas, we highlight key research gaps in subarctic ecohydrology and propose several ways forward. We also demonstrate that the Pallas catchment meets the need for sustaining and pushing the boundaries of critical long-term integrated ecohydrological research in high-latitude environments. © 2021 The Authors.

Many environmental problems that occur in Indonesia and the world are the result of activities carried out by companies and by households. These cause a development system that is needed not only to pay attention to economic and social aspects but also to environmental aspects. To know about the success of development in the environmental field, a disparity analysis is needed to be done by measuring the gap in environmental conditions between provinces in Indonesia using the Environmental Disparity Index. This analysis was constructed using six dimensions based on the Framework for Development of Environment Statistics (FDES) 2013 which include environmental conditions and quality; natural resources and their use; residuals; extreme events and disasters, human settlements and environmentalhealth; environmental protection, management, and engagement. The method used in this analysis was through the taxonomic method approach and factor analysis. The results of the analysis showed that there were significant disparities between provinces in Indonesia in the five dimensions of the environment. This was because each province had different= component strengths depending on the character and potential of each region. West Papua was the province with the best environmental conditions, while the province with the worst environmental conditions was Jakarta. The impact of uneven development between Western Indonesia and Eastern Indonesia also affected the environmental conditions in the two regions. The environment of Eastern Indonesia was still better than Western Indonesia.

Because isoprene is predominantly sourced terrestrially, there is limited knowledge on the role it might play in marine systems. Here, we report for the first time isoprene concentrations and tidal fluxes from two subtropical mangrove creeks in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia: Jacob's Creek and Turkey Boat Creek in 2017 and 2019. Isoprene concentrations tracked the tide height with higher concentrations at high tide and lower concentrations at low tide in both creek systems, showing that isoprene was imported into the creeks on the flood tide. Mangrove creeks in Moreton Bay were a sink (−9.53 ± 9.10 nmol m−2 h−1) for isoprene. Isoprene was most likely produced in the open water by either phytoplankton or nearby seagrass beds and then consumed by bacterial communities as a carbon source within the mangrove creek sediments. Mangrove creeks in Moreton Bay are estimated to uptake isoprene at a rate of −6 mg m−2 y−1, leading to a total global isoprene sink of −0.69 Gg C y−1.

However, natural aerosols have strong geographic gradients and this suggests that spatially invariant air quality guidelines may handicap regions close to natural sources. We use climate models to construct a view of pre-industrial “pristine” air quality, including fine particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 µm ((Formula presented.)). Under pristine conditions, (Formula presented.) levels over regions in geographic proximity to dust sources, including parts of Africa and Asia, exceed World Health Organization air quality guidelines. We estimate that this pristine air pollution, which is unassociated with human activities, impacts up to about one billion people globally.

Actions to reduce fire may offer considerable, yet largely unrecognized, options for rapid improvements in air quality. In this study, we used a combination of regional and global air quality models and observations to examine the impact of forest and vegetation fires on air quality degradation and public health in Southeast Asia (including Mainland Southeast Asia and south-eastern China). We found that eliminating fire could substantially improve regional air quality across Southeast Asia by reducing the population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations by 7% and surface ozone concentrations by 5%. These reductions in PM2.5 exposures would yield a considerable public health benefit across the region; averting 59,000 (95% uncertainty interval (95UI): 55,200–62,900) premature deaths annually. Analysis of subnational infant mortality rate data and PM2.5 exposure suggested that PM2.5 from fires disproportionately impacts poorer populations across Southeast Asia. We identified two key regions in northern Laos and western Myanmar where particularly high levels of poverty coincide with exposure to relatively high levels of PM2.5 from fires. Our results show that reducing forest and vegetation fires should be a public health priority for the Southeast Asia region. © 2021. The Authors.

We analyze how the risk of extreme soil moisture droughts in SWNA, analogous to the most severe 21-year (≥ in magnitude to 2000–2020) and single-year (≥ in magnitude to 2002) events of the last several decades, changes in projections from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. By the end of the 21st century, SWNA experiences robust (R ≥ 0.80) soil moisture drying and substantial increases in extreme single-year drought risk that scale strongly with warming, spanning an 8%–26% probability of occurrence across +2–4 K. Notably, our results show that 21-year droughts analogous to 2000–2020 are up to 5 times more likely than extreme single-year droughts under all levels of warming (≈50%). These high levels of 21-year drought risk are largely invariant across scenarios because of large spring precipitation declines in half the models, shifting SWNA into a drier mean state. Despite projections of this sweeping and ostensibly inevitable increase in 21-year drought risk, climate mitigation reduces their severity by reducing the magnitude of extreme single-year droughts during these events. Our results emphasize both the importance of preparing SWNA for imminent increases in persistent drought events and constraining projected precipitation uncertainty to better resolve future long-term drought risk. © 2021.

It is thus crucial to assess future changes in precipitation extremes and exposure under future warming scenarios to improve the mitigation of climate change. On the basis of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 simulations, we find that occurring probabilities of precipitation extremes that exceed the 99th percentile threshold are projected to increase over global lands in the coming century, especially under the no-mitigation scenario of SSP5-8.5. Under this scenario, by the end of this century, occurrences of aggregations of precipitation extremes over global lands are expected to increase by approximately 1.8 times. Increases are also expected even if early mitigation is conducted via SSP1-2.6. Accordingly, global aggregate exposure would increase by at least 50% in the future under SSP5-8.5. Changes in precipitation extremes will exert a substantial influence on population exposure, of which contribution will be up to 46% under SSP5-8.5 by the end of this century. The future maximum centers of exposure are concentrated over East Asia, South Asia, the Mediterranean basin, and eastern North America, as in the current state. However, the rapid increase in population over some parts of Africa plays a larger role than climate change and significantly increases the exposure in these regions. As a result, regions of Africa will become other high-exposure global centers in the future. Climate change mitigation should be thus the key policy response to reduce population exposure in the future over most global regions. © 2021 The Authors.

In the short term, the impact of the trade conflict on China’s import and export trade will cause the carbon emissions contained in traded commodities to change accordingly. To assess the impact of the trade conflict on China’s climate policy, this paper combines a model from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) and the input-output analysis method and calculates the carbon emissions in international trade before and after the conflict. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The trade war has led to a sharp decline in China-US trade, but for China as a whole, imports and exports have not changed much; (2) China’s export emissions have changed little, its import emissions have dropped slightly, and its net emissions have increased; and (3) China’s exports are still concentrated in energy-intensive industries. Changes in trade will bring challenges to China’s balancing of climate and trade exigencies. China-US cooperation based on energy and technology will help China cope with climate change after the trade conflict. © 2021 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Cooperative emission reduction; Import and export trade; Trade conflict","carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; input-output analysis; international trade; spatiotemporal analysis; trade-environment relations; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115789028

(b) And to which degree? To answer these questions, we projected the trend in four indices, recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), through the 21st century. Observational (HadEX3) and reanalyses (ERA5, JRA-55, NCEP-R-1, and NCEP-R-2) datasets were used to validate and correct the bias in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models. CMIP6 models were then used to evaluate the changes globally and in 44 reference regions under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs): SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. Globally, the analysis showed that, under SSP5-8.5, TXx and TNx would increase by 0.07°C/year, and TXn (TNn) would increase by 0.09 (0.08)°C/year, during the middle of the 21st century (2021–2050), compared with the reference period (1981–2010). These trends are larger during the end of the 21st century (2071–2100). The analysis also showed that all land reference regions are projected to indices growth up to 3.5°C in TXx; 2.8°C in TNx; 4.5°C in TXn; and 4°C in TNn, during the mid-21st century under SSP5-8.5. The latter growth in indices increased by 211% for TXx, 237% for TNx, 242% for TXn, and 300% for TNn during the end-21st century. The global hotspots affected by absolute temperature extremes are in the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Iceland, Central Asia, Tibetan Plateau, Russian Arctic, Siberia, Mediterranean, Sahara, and Arabian Peninsula. The study's findings help understand the evolution of climate extremes, which is essential for climate change mitigation and adaptation plans. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite interesting use-cases receiving worldwide media attention, drones are expected to have their most significant impact on supply chain and logistics systems in highly populated urban cities once the regulations for commercial purposes are lifted. This article proposes two models of drone-delivery technology that can serve as a potential replacement in the Indian truck-delivery system. First, a drone–truck hybrid delivery model is proposed with trucks carrying multiple drones. Second, a stand-alone drone-delivery model is proposed with separate charging infrastructural facilities at specific points. The two proposed models' findings present the advantages of significantly reducing carbon emissions, delivery costs, and time compared to truck-based delivery. The hybrid drone–truck model eliminates the need for separate charging facilities saving initial infrastructural costs. In contrast, the stand-alone drone model utilizes the current warehouse location facilities with charging stations on specific points for ease of adoption. This research presents initial viability suggesting that the drone technology can solve the current operational challenges in India's urban cities. Furthermore, vital factors are discussed to enable stakeholders to select a model for drone logistics systems planning and experimentations. © 2021 The Authors.

To investigate HAB-microbe interactions, we isolated bacteria with close associations to bloom-forming cyanobacteria, Microcystis spp., during a 2017 bloom in the western basin of Lake Erie. The genomes of five isolates (Exiguobacterium sp. JMULE1, Enterobacter sp. JMULE2, Deinococcus sp. JMULE3, Paenibacillus sp. JMULE4, and Acidovorax sp. JMULE5.) were sequenced on a PacBio Sequel system. These genomes ranged in size from 3.1 Mbp (Exiguobacterium sp. JMULE1) to 5.7 Mbp (Enterobacter sp. JMULE2). The genomes were analyzed for genes relating to critical metabolic functions, including nitrogen reduction and carbon utilization. All five of the sequenced genomes contained genes that could be used in potential signaling and nutrient exchange between the bacteria and cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Gene expression signatures of algal-derived carbon utilization for two isolates were identified in Microcystis blooms in Lake Erie and Lake Tai (Taihu) at low levels, suggesting these organisms are active and may have a functional role during Microcystis blooms in aggregates, but were largely missing from whole water samples. These findings build on the growing evidence that the bacterial microbiome associated with bloom-forming algae have the functional potential to contribute to nutrient exchange within bloom communities and interact with important bloom formers like Microcystis. © 2021 Hoke et al.

However, this critical issue has not been explored comprehensively in the literature. Using China Family Panel Studies data and the distribution dynamics approach, this article is the first study to examine the relationship between quality of life (QOL) (proxied by consumption upgrading) and relative household energy consumption (RHEC). The results show that convergence clubs exist in all QOL groups for the RHEC, but they are more evident in the groups with lower middle and low QOL. This is encouraging because they suggest that an improvement in QOL does not necessarily lead to a higher level of energy consumption. The dataset was then divided into rural-urban and regional subgroups to further explore the impacts of these different characteristics on energy consumption. Significant disparities are found among the same QOL groups between urban and rural households and among different regions. The results derived from this study lead to pragmatic policy suggestions in areas including energy saving, emissions reduction, and particularly alleviation of inequality. © 2021 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","consumption upgrading; distribution dynamics; energy consumption; regional disparity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115783545

Landscape fires are a large source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which has known negative impacts on human health. The seasonal and spatial distribution, particle composition, and co-emitted species in landscape-fire emissions are different from anthropogenic sources of PM2.5. The implications of landscape-fire emissions on the sub-national temporal and spatial distribution of health events and the relative health importance of specific pollutants within smoke are not well understood. We use a health impact assessment with observation-based smoke PM2.5 to determine the sub-national distribution of mortality and the sub-national and sub-annual distribution of asthma morbidity attributable to US smoke PM2.5 from 2006 to 2018. We estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for PM2.5 and 18 gas-phase hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) in smoke. Although the majority of large landscape fires occur in the western US, we find the majority of mortality (74%) and asthma morbidity (on average 75% across 2006–2018) attributable to smoke PM2.5 occurs outside the West, due to higher population density in the East. Across the US, smoke-attributable asthma morbidity predominantly occurs in spring and summer. The number of DALYs associated with smoke PM2.5 is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than DALYs associated with gas-phase smoke HAPs. Our results indicate awareness and mitigation of landscape-fire smoke exposure is important across the US. © 2021. The Authors.

Whilst current ambitions in many signatories are insufficient to achieve this goal, optimism prevailed in the second half of 2020. Not only did several major emitters announce net-zero mitigation targets around mid-century, but the new Biden Administration immediately announced the U.S.’s re-entry into Paris and a net-zero goal for 2050. U.S. federal re-engagement in climate action could have a considerable impact on its national greenhouse gas emissions pathway, by significantly augmenting existing state-level actions. Combined with U.S. re-entry in the Paris Agreement, this could also serve as a stimulus to enhance ambitions in other countries. A critical question then becomes what such U.S. re-engagement, through both national and international channels, would have on the global picture. This commentary explores precisely this question, by using an integrated assessment model to assess U.S. national emissions, global emissions, and end-of-century temperatures in five scenarios combining different climate ambition levels in both the U.S. and the rest of the world. Our analyses finds that ambitious climate leadership by the Biden Administration on top of enhanced climate commitments by other the major economies could potentially be the trigger for the world to fulfill the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. © 2021.

Biological methane oxidation can significantly mitigate such CH4 emissions, but despite favorable CH4 and O2 concentrations, CH4 oxidation appears constrained in some lakes for unknown reasons. Here we experimentally test the hypothesis that phosphorus (P) availability is limiting CH4 oxidation, resulting in differences in ice-out emissions among lakes. We observed a positive relationship between potential CH4 oxidation and P concentration across 12 studied lakes and found an increase in CH4 oxidation in response to P amendment, without any parallel change in the methanotrophic community composition. Hence, while an increase in sedimentary CH4 production and ebullitive emissions may happen with eutrophication, our study indicates that the increase in P associated with eutrophication may also enhance CH4 oxidation. The increase in CH4 oxidation may hence play an important role in nutrient-rich ice-covered lakes where bubbles trapped under the ice may to a greater extent be oxidized, reducing the ice-out emissions of CH4.

Climate change-sensitive urban governance requires proactive, integrated, and contextualized approaches, making room for the complex, multilayered, multiscalar, and dynamic processes constituting a city. The notion of “resilience” has been acquiring growing recognition as a flexible and powerful concept to respond to these challenges. Resilience itself, however, is also a polysemic notion, often treated as little more than a catchword or a wishful aim or superimposed with other climate-related terms, such as risk, vulnerability, or adaptation. To promote a stronger integration among different problem-settings and epistemic communities, this paper advances six analytical distinctions aiming to provide structure and articulation to existing definitions of the concept of “resilience.” Likewise, it offers an integrated analytical framework and methodological pipeline to streamline resilience analysis in the context of urban climate risk assessment. The framework is specially defined to link up with the definition of climate risk provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) latest Assessment Reports and is illustrated through examples derived from the recent experience of the Chilean Climate Risk Atlas. © 2021.

These gases are efficiently mitigated by addition of a tannic acid-sodium fluoride combination inhibitor (TA-NaF), and to some extent by acidification. In this paper, TA-NaF treatment was performed on swine manure to study the treatment influence on methanogenic pathways and sulfur transformation pathways in various laboratory experiments. Stable carbon isotope labeling revealed that both untreated and TA-NaF treated swine manures were dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. However, in supplementary experiments in wastewater sludge, TA-NaF clearly inhibited acetoclastic methanogenesis, whereas acidification inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. In swine manure, TA-NaF inhibited s-amino acid catabolism to a larger extent than sulfate reduction. Conversely, acidification reduced sulfate reduction activity more than s-amino acid degradation. TA-NaF treatment had no significant effect on methanogenic community structure, which was surprising considering clear effects on isotope ratios of methane and carbon dioxide. Halophile sulfate reducers adapted well to TA-NaF treatment, but the community change also depended on temperature. The combined experimental work resulted in a proposed inhibition scheme for sulfur transformations and methanogenic pathways as affected by TA-NaF and acidification in swine manure and in other inocula. © 2021 Dalby et al.

The results indicate that the household sector is the key driving force behind Japan's emissions, and it accounts for approximately 80% of the country's total emissions when indirect emissions are included. Moreover, significant regional differences exist in terms of the carbon footprint, which is in part caused by household and fuel-type differences found across the country. Finally, this paper suggests that the impact of regional household and fuel-type differences on Japan's overall carbon footprint should be a primary focus when practitioners design customized strategies to decarbonize Japan at the subnational scale. © 2021.

Here, we develop a modeling framework to quantify the potential health benefits of wearing a face covering or respirator to mitigate exposure to particulate air pollution. This framework accounts for the wide range of available face coverings and respirators, fit factors and efficacy, air pollution characteristics, and exposure-response data. Our modeling shows that N95 respirators offer robust protection against different sources of particulate matter, reducing exposure by more than a factor of 14 when worn with a leak rate of 5%. Synthetic-fiber masks offer less protection with a strong dependence on aerosol size distribution (protection factors ranging from 4.4 to 2.2), while natural-fiber and surgical masks offer reductions in the exposure of 1.9 and 1.7, respectively. To assess the ability of face coverings to provide population-level health benefits to wildfire smoke, we perform a case study for the 2012 Washington state fire season. Our models suggest that although natural-fiber masks offer minor reductions in respiratory hospitalizations attributable to smoke (2%–11%) due to limited filtration efficiency, N95 respirators and to a lesser extent surgical and synthetic-fiber masks may lead to notable reductions in smoke-attributable hospitalizations (22%–39%, 9%–24%, and 7%–18%, respectively). The filtration efficiency, bypass rate, and compliance rate (fraction of time and population wearing the device) are the key factors governing exposure reduction potential and health benefits during severe wildfire smoke events. © 2021 The Authors.

Globally, arid and semi-arid regions are considered an important carbon sink. However, they have received limited attention and, therefore, it should be a priority to develop tools to quantify biomass at the local and regional scales. Individual plant variables, such as stem diameter and crown area, were reported to be good predictors of individual plant weight. Stand-level variables, such as plant cover and mean height, are also easy-to-measure estimators of above-ground biomass (AGB) in dry regions. In this study, we estimated the AGB in semi-arid woody vegetation in Northeast Patagonia, Argentina. We evaluated whether the AGB at the stand level can be estimated based on plant cover and to what extent the estimation accuracy can be improved by the inclusion of other field-measured structure variables. We also evaluated whether remote sensing technologies can be used to reliably estimate and map the regional mean biomass. For this purpose, we analyzed the relationships between field-measured woody vegetation structure variables and AGB as well as LANDSAT TM-derived variables. We obtained a model-based ratio estimate of regional mean AGB and its standard error. Total plant cover allowed us to obtain a reliable estimation of local AGB, and no better fit was attained by the inclusion of other structure variables. The stand-level plant cover ranged between 18.7% and 95.2% and AGB between about 2.0 and 70.8 Mg/hm2. AGB based on total plant cover was well estimated from LANDSAT TM bands 2 and 3, which facilitated a model-based ratio estimate of the regional mean AGB (approximately 12.0 Mg/hm2) and its sampling error (about 30.0%). The mean AGB of woody vegetation can greatly contribute to carbon storage in semi-arid lands. Thus, plant cover estimation by remote sensing images could be used to obtain regional estimates and map biomass, as well as to assess and monitor the impact of land-use change on the carbon balance, for arid and semi-arid regions. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","above-ground biomass; carbon storage; Patagonia; ratio estimation; remote sensing; shrublands","aboveground biomass; carbon sink; carbon storage; land use change; remote sensing; shrubland; vegetation dynamics; Argentina; Patagonia; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115697415

Less well-understood, however, is the importance of stomatal control to the exchange of other trace gases between terrestrial vegetation and the atmosphere. Yet these gases determine atmospheric composition, and hence air quality and climate, on scales ranging from local to global, and seconds to decades. Vegetation is a major sink for ground-level ozone via the process of dry deposition and the primary source of many biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). The rate of dry deposition is largely controlled by the rate of diffusion of a gas through the stomata, and this also governs the emission rate of some key BVOCs. It is critical therefore that canopy-atmosphere exchange models capture the physiological processes controlling stomatal conductance and the transfer of trace gases other than carbon dioxide and water vapor. We incorporate three of the most widely used coupled stomatal conductance-photosynthesis models into the one-dimensional multi-layer FORest Canopy-Atmosphere Transfer (FORCAsT1.0) model to assess the importance of choice of parameterization on simulated ozone deposition rates. Modeled GPP and stomatal conductance across a broad range of ecosystems differ by up to a factor of two between the best and worst performing model configurations. This leads to divergences in seasonal and diel profiles of ozone deposition velocity of up to 30% and deposition rate of up to 13%, demonstrating that the choice of stomatal conductance parameterization is critical in accurate quantification of ozone deposition. © 2021.

However, there is still a lack of fine print on how subregional effort can contribute to national or full supply chain mitigation plans, especially downscaling to the city level. To bridge this knowledge gap, we selected Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration, one of the economic centers but also featured by intensive emission for decades, to analyze the emission variance and driving forces from 2012 to 2015 as a case study. Based on the consumption accounting framework, the carbon emissions of Jing-Jin-Ji have decreased by 11.7 Mt CO2 in total over the study period, and most cities showed the similar descending trend. The driving forces show that the emission intensity and production structure have largely reduced Jing-Jin-Ji's total due to measurements of economic transition. For instance, Beijing has decreased by 28.7 Mt of emission reduction which led by declined emission intensity. By contrast, per capita demands and growth of its population were the primary forces to increase emissions. To conclude, although the mitigation achievement is undeniable, we should also note that the economic transition has not changed the uneven pattern of selected urban agglomeration so far. © 2021.

Iceland is situated close to the overturning regions of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) that warms the North Atlantic area. Hence, this may be one region where reduced irradiance by SAI may not be successful in reducing impacts from greenhouse gas warming. We examine this proposition by estimating how the Icelandic Vatnajökull ice cap (VIC) surface mass balance (SMB) and surface runoff changes in response to greenhouse gas and solar geoengineering scenarios over the period 1982–2089. We use the surface energy and mass balance model SEMIC driven by Earth System Model output under the GeoMIP G4, and CMIP RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas scenarios. Geoengineering significantly reduces VIC near-surface air temperature by 0.4°C, downward longwave radiation by 2.4 Wm−2 and increases snowfall by 4.9 mm yr−1 relative to RCP4.5. During the SAI period 2020–2069, modeled annual mean SMB under G4, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are −0.34 ± 0.18 m yr−1, −0.56 ± 0.06 m yr−1 and −0.66 ± 0.04 m yr−1, respectively; surface runoff reduction under G4 is 6 ± 6% and 7 ± 6% (95% confidence interval uncertainties) compared with that under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, which is far smaller than the 20 ± 2% and 32 ± 2% reductions for the Greenland ice sheet.

An important pillar of this vision is energy. Egyptian Vision 2030 presented renewable energy as the best solution to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the energy sector. Egypt’s electricity comes from various power plants; conventional thermal plants generate over 90% in which gas-fired generation accounts for 75% of the total output. Following the increase in natural gas (NG) projects in Egypt, NG is the dominant electricity source. Based on the pillars of the sustainable development strategy of Egypt, the county can increase dependence on renewable energies, and reduce CO2 emissions and bound electricity production from natural gas. We aim to determine future energy generation strategies from various power plant technologies depending on these three principles. To make the picture more clear and complete, we compared the environmental impacts and external costs of fossil, hydro, and nuclear power plants in Egypt. We used two computer codes: the model for energy supply strategy alternatives and their general environmental impacts (MESSAGE) and the simplified approach for estimating environmental impacts of electricity generation (SIMPACTS). The MESSAGE code modeled the energy-supply systems to determine the best energy-supply technology to meet future energy demands. SIMPACTS estimated the environmental impact and damage costs associated with electricity generation. The results indicated that nuclear power plants and gas power plants are long-term electricity supply sources. Nuclear power plants entail low total external-damage costs, in addition to low environmental impact during normal operation. We conclude that nuclear power plants are the best alternative long-term electricity-generation choice for Egypt to meet future electricity demands. © 2021 by the authors.

Field-or LiDAR-based approaches enable reliable measurements of the structure and above-ground biomass (AGB) of tropical forests. Data derived from digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform offer several advantages over field-and LiDAR-based approaches in terms of scale and efficiency, and DAP has been presented as a viable and economical alternative in boreal or deciduous forests. However, detecting with DAP the ground in dense tropical forests, which is required for the estimation of canopy height, is currently considered highly challenging. To address this issue, we present a generally applicable method that is based on machine learning methods to identify the forest floor in DAP-derived point clouds of dense tropical forests. We capitalize on the DAP-derived high-resolution vertical forest structure to inform ground detection. We conducted UAV-DAP surveys combined with field inventories in the tropical forest of the Congo Basin. Using airborne LiDAR (ALS) for ground truthing, we present a canopy height model (CHM) generation workflow that constitutes the detection, classification and interpolation of ground points using a combination of local minima filters, supervised machine learning algorithms and TIN densification for classifying ground points using spectral and geometrical features from the UAV-based 3D data. We demonstrate that our DAP-based method provides estimates of tree heights that are identical to LiDAR-based approaches (conservatively estimated NSE = 0.88, RMSE = 1.6 m). An external validation shows that our method is capable of providing accurate and precise estimates of tree heights and AGB in dense tropical forests (DAP vs. field inventories of old forest: r2 = 0.913, RMSE = 31.93 Mg ha−1). Overall, this study demonstrates that the application of cheap and easily deployable UAV-DAP platforms can be deployed without expert knowledge to generate biophysical information and advance the study and monitoring of dense tropical forests. © 2021 by the authors.

These changes directly impact electrical distribution systems (EDSs), introducing new challenges in their planning and operation. One way to assist in the desired integration of this technology is to allocate EV charging stations (EVCSs). Efforts have been made towards the development of EVCSs, with the ability to recharge the vehicle at a similar time than conventional vehicle filling stations. Besides, EVs can bring environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, depending on the energy matrix of the country in which the EVs fleet circulates, there may be indirect emissions of polluting gases. Therefore, the development of this technology must be combined with the growth of renewable generation. Thus, this proposal aims to develop a mathematical model that includes EVs integration in the distribution system. To this end, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to solve the allocation problem of EVCSs including renewable energy sources. The model addresses the environmental impact and uncertainties associated with demand (conventional and EVs) and renewable generation. Moreover, an EV charging forecast method is proposed, subject to the uncertainties related to the driver's behavior, the energy required by these vehicles, and the state of charge of the EVs. The proposed model was implemented in the AMPL modelling language and solved via the commercial solver CPLEX. Tests with a 24-node system allow evaluating the proposed method application. © 2021, The Author(s).","Allocation of electric vehicle charging stations; Electric vehicle charging stations; EV charging forecast method; Renewable energy sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115639995

Objectives: To assess effects of donanemab on brain amyloid plaque load after single and multiple intravenous doses, as well as pharmacokinetics, safety/tolerability, and immunogenicity. Design: Phase 1b, investigator- and patient-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Patients recruited at clinical research sites in the United States and Japan. Participants: 61 amyloid plaque-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Intervention: Six cohorts were dosed with donanemab: single dose 10-, 20- or 40- mg/kg (N = 18), multiple doses of 10-mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks (N = 10), and 10- or 20-mg/kg every 4 weeks for 72 weeks (N=18) or placebo (N = 15). Measurements: Brain amyloid plaque load, using florbetapir positron emission tomography, was assessed up to 72 weeks. Safety was evaluated by occurrence of adverse events, magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram, vital signs, laboratory testing, neurological monitoring, and immunogenicity. Results: Treatment with donanemab resulted in rapid reduction of amyloid, even after a single dose. By 24 weeks, amyloid positron emission tomography mean changes from baseline for single donanemab doses in Centiloids were: −16.5 (standard error 11.22) 10-mg/kg intravenous; 40.0 (standard error 11.23) 20 mg/kg intravenous; and −49.6 (standard error 15.10) 40-mg/kg intravenous. Mean reduction of amyloid plaque in multiple dose cohorts by 24 weeks in Centiloids were: 55.8 (standard error 9.51) 10-mg/kg every 2 weeks; −50.2 (standard error 10.54) 10-mg/kg every 4 weeks; and −58.4 (standard error 9.66) 20-mg/kg every 4 weeks. Amyloid on average remained below baseline levels up to 72 weeks after a single dose of donanemab. Repeated dosing resulted in continued florbetapir positron emission tomography reductions over time compared to single dosing with 6 out of 28 patients attaining complete amyloid clearance within 24 weeks. Within these, 5 out of 10 patients in the 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks cohort attained complete amyloid clearance within 36 weeks. When dosing with donanemab was stopped after 24 weeks of repeat dosing in the 10 mg every 2 weeks cohort, florbetapir positron emission tomography reductions were sustained up to 72 weeks. For the single dose cohorts on day 1, dose proportional increases in donanemab pharmacokinetics were observed from 10 to 40 mg/kg. Dose proportional increases in pharmacokinetics were also observed at steady state with the multiple dose cohorts. Donanemab clearance was comparable across the dose levels. Mean donanemab elimination-halflife following 20 mg/kg single dose was 9.3 days with range of 5.6 to 16.2 days. Greater than 90% of patients had positive treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies with donanemab. However, overall, the treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies did not have a significant impact on pharmacokinetics. Donanemab was generally well tolerated. Amongst the 46 participants treated with donanemab, the following amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, common to the drug class, were observed: 12 vasogenic cerebral edema events (12 [19.7%] patients), 10 cerebral microhemorrhage events (6 [13.0%] patients), and 2 superficial siderosis events (2 [4.3%] patients). Conclusions: Single and multiple doses of donanemab demonstrated a rapid, robust, and sustained reduction up to 72 weeks in brain amyloid plaque despite treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies detected in most patients. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities were the most common treatment-emergent event. © 2021, The Author(s).","Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid plaque; donanemab; florbetapir PET; immunogenicity","amyloid protein; donanemab; drug antibody; florbetapir f 18; neutralizing antibody; placebo; amyloid; aniline derivative; ethylene glycol derivative; florbetapir; monoclonal antibody; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; antibody titer; Article; brain edema; brain hemorrhage; brain level; cohort analysis; confusion; controlled study; drug clearance; drug effect; drug safety; drug withdrawal; electrocardiogram; elimination half-life; female; headache; heart infarction; human; hypertension; imaging; immunogenicity; Japan; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; multicenter study; nausea; neuromonitoring; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient satisfaction; phase 1 clinical trial; positron emission tomography; randomized controlled trial; repeated drug dose; siderosis; single drug dose; somnolence; standardized uptake value ratio; treatment duration; United States; vital sign; adverse drug reaction; Alzheimer disease; clinical trial; cognitive defect; drug effect; middle aged; patient safety; positron emission tomography; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Aniline Compounds; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cognitive Dysfunction; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Ethylene Glycols; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Safety; Positron-Emission Tomography; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115636405

We investigate the emission convergence in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) countries using a modified dynamic β-convergence model. From 2000 to 2017, the per capita emissions of the RCEP countries and its subgroups show a statistically significant diverging pattern. Nonetheless, upon accounting for multiple inputs and outputs using data envelopment analysis, we find that two out of the three emission performance indicators show statistically significant absolute convergence. The carbon emission efficiency (CEE) of the 15 RCEP countries grew from 0.5719 in 2000 to 0.6725 in 2017 and will converge at a value of 0.8187, while the carbon–population performance (CPP) increases from 0.4534 to 0.5690 and will converge at 0.7831. Furthermore, using a conditional β-convergence model, we find that trade volume has no significant effect on the growth rates of CEE and CPP, but can accelerate their speed of convergence, which indicates that the establishment of the RCEP may facilitate the convergence of its 15 member countries on CEE and CPP. Our findings suggest that emission mitigation agreement in the RCEP countries is feasible. CEE-or CPP-based indicators can be used for emission budget allocation. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the characteristics of measured pressure oscillations and the associated results of phase space reconstruction, recurrence plots, and synchrosqueezing-transform-based time-frequency analysis, the multi-bifurcation behaviors of this thermoacoustic system with four different stability regimes have been identified. With incremental increase in from 0.55 to 0.79, these four stability regimes follow the sequence of a quiet mode (Regime I), the first limit cycle with moderate oscillations (Regime II), an intermediate state with intermittent bursts of multi-modes (Regime III), and the second limit cycle with much stronger oscillations (Regime IV). The flame dynamics in Regimes II and IV undergoing limit cycle oscillations are compared. The flame structure in Regime II displays an attached twin-flame structure, the same as that observed in Regime I. However, a large-scale periodic convective motion is found in Regime IV, which is identified to be the main thermoacoustic driving factor in the local Rayleigh index maps.

The silver-rich ± base metal deposit occurs dominantly as vein- and hydrothermal breccia-hosted orebodies at the interface between the lower Ediacaran turbidites of the Saghro Group and the unconformably overlying, dominantly felsic volcanic, and volcaniclastic rocks of the late Ediacaran Ouarzazate Group. Higher-grade ores are lithologically hosted by the uppermost organic-rich black shale unit and structurally controlled by the intersection of subvertical NW- and NE-trending fault systems. Ore-related hydrothermal alteration includes, in order of decreasing abundance, carbonatization, silicification, sericitization, and chloritization. Three primary paragenetic stages of veining and associated silver ± base metal mineralization have been recognized: (1) early pyrite + quartz + Ag-bearing sulfides and sulfosalts; (2) main Ag-bearing sulfides and sulfosalts + calcite ± fluorite ± dolomite; and (3) late quartz + calcite + base-metal sulfides (galena, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite). Irrespective of the ore stage, the dominant Ag-bearing ore minerals are Ag-Hg amalgam, argentite, freibergite, acanthite, polybasite, pyrargyrite, and proustite. Fluid inclusion data show a trend of decreasing temperatures with time, from the main silver stage (Th = 180 ± 12 °C) to late base-metal stage (Th = 146 ± 7 °C), consistent with fluid mixing, cooling, and/or dilution. The coexistence of aqueous-rich and vapor-rich fluid inclusions together with variations in bulk salinity (NaCl + CaCl2) of the mineralizing fluids during the main silver stage, at similar temperatures, indicate that boiling and subsequent degassing occurred during the main ore-forming event due to a pressure decrease. Calculated δ18Ofluid values along with REE+Y and Sr isotope constraints suggest that the ore-forming fluids originated from a predominantly magmatic source, although incursion of meteoric waters during collapse of the hydrothermal system could have contributed to deposition. The post-ore, base-metal quartz-carbonate-dominated mineralization was deposited from dilute Ca-Na-Cl-bearing fluids at temperature below 150 °C. Overall, fluid-rock interaction with the black shales along major faults and thin permeable horizons, boiling-degassing-with subsequent fluid mixing, cooling, and/or dilution-were the main mechanisms of silver deposition. © 2021 by the authors.","Anti-atlas (morocco); Boilingcooling- fluid mixing; C-O-Sr isotope geochemistry; Fluid inclusion; Igoudrane silver-rich deposit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115623197

Our objective was to document establishment and determine optimal seeding timings for mixed stand of fine fescue in multiple cool-season climate zones in the United States. From 2019 to 2020, an experiment was replicated across four locations in the northern United States to investigate nine monthly fine fescue mixture seeding timings from March through November. Fine fescue seedling emergence typically hastened as temperatures increased during the growing season, and emergence required 6.1–9.4 d when soil temperatures were within a range of 15–25 °C. Final grid count data across multiple sites indicated that seeding fine fescues in August, September, and at times, July, will likely produce the best establishment with the lowest weed infestation pressure, and there may be more flexibility in seeding timings in a Mediterranean climate, such as Oregon. Seeding fine fescues in the early-spring or late-autumn can be more unreliable because of greater likelihood of weed infestation, suboptimal growing conditions, and potential of a late-autumn seeding to act as an unintended dormant seeding. Results indicate the weed invasion pressure of specific weeds will vary depending life cycle of weed and seeding time of year. Overall, seeding a fine fescue mixture in August or September will increase likelihood of success in cool-season climate zones in the United States with a wider seeding window when planting in Mediterranean climates. © 2021 The Authors.

The detrimental impact of climate change on food systems and mental health is further exacerbated by a lack of food sovereignty. We urgently require innovative solutions to enable food sovereignty, minimize food insecurity, and address climate change-related mental distress (ie, solastalgia). Indigenous communities have a wealth of Traditional Knowledge for climate change adaptation and preparedness to strengthen food systems. Traditional Knowledge combined with Western methods can revolutionize ethical data collection, engagement, and knowledge mobilization. Objective: The Food Equity and Environmental Data Sovereignty (FEEDS) Project takes a participatory action, citizen science approach for early detection and warning of climate change impacts on food sovereignty, food security, and solastalgia. The aim of this project is to develop and implement a sustainable digital platform that enables real-time decision-making to mitigate climate change-related impacts on food systems and mental well-being. Methods: Citizen science enables citizens to actively contribute to all aspects of the research process. The FEEDS Project is being implemented in five phases: participatory project planning, digital climate change platform customization, community-led evaluation, digital platform and project refinement, and integrated knowledge translation. The project is governed by a Citizen Scientist Advisory Council comprising Elders, Traditional Knowledge Keepers, key community decision makers, youth, and FEEDS Project researchers. The Council governs all phases of the project, including coconceptualizing a climate change platform, which consists of a smartphone app and a digital decision-making dashboard. Apart from capturing environmental and health-related big data (eg, weather, permafrost degradation, fire hazards, and human movement), the custom-built app uses artificial intelligence to engage and enable citizens to report on environmental hazards, changes in biodiversity or wildlife, and related food and mental health issues in their communities. The app provides citizens with valuable information to mitigate health-related risks and relays big data in real time to a digital dashboard. Results: This project is currently in phase 1, with the subarctic Métis jurisdiction of Île-à-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan, Canada. Conclusions: The FEEDS Project facilitates Indigenous Peoples' self-determination, governance, and data sovereignty. All citizen data are anonymous and encrypted, and communities have ownership, access, control, and possession of their data. The digital dashboard system provides decision makers with real-time data, thereby increasing the capacity to self-govern. The participatory action research approach, combined with digital citizen science, advances the cocreation of knowledge and multidisciplinary collaboration in the digital age. Given the urgency of climate change, leveraging technology provides communities with tools to respond to existing and emerging crises in a timely manner, as well as scientific evidence regarding the urgency of current health and environmental issues. © Jasmin Bhawra, Kelly Skinner, Duane Favel, Brenda Green, Ken Coates, Tarun Reddy Katapally.","Climate change impacts; Climate change preparedness; Digital dashboards; Digital health; Food equity; Food security; Food sovereignty; Indigenous health; Mental health; Mobile phone; Solastalgia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115610347

Based on the panel data of 282 prefecture-level cities in China from 2003 to 2016, this study evaluates the effects of LCCP implementation on pilot cities’ carbon emission performance using difference-in-differences method, and then the mechanism has also been examined with a mediating effect model. The results show that: first, the LCCP implementation has increased the carbon emission performance of the pilot cities significantly, indicating that it is an effective way to promote the low-carbon transformation of Chinese cities. Second, the positive effects in CO2 performance resulting from LCCP demonstrate significant heterogeneity: in general, the cities in east China, with higher economic development level and in a larger size, achieve more significant CO2 emission reduction than their respective counterparts. The results on the mechanism test imply that the LCCP helps improve pilot cities’ carbon emission performance in three ways, including reducing energy consumption, updating the industrial structure, and promoting technological progress. Finally, some useful policy recommendations are put forward to promote China’s low-carbon city construction. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon emission performance; Difference-in-differences method; Low-carbon city; Mechanism analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115603136

It is predicted that the energy sector will reduce carbon dioxide by produc-ing electricity mainly from photovoltaic (PV) power. Although dynamic development of the implementation of photovoltaic panels has been observed, their choice considering customer specificity is still a problem. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose the model of choice photovoltaic panels considering customers’ expectations. It can support the choice of a photovoltaic panel of a certain quality (satisfaction of concrete customer) in combination with the cost of its purchase. The proposed model includes acquiring and then processing customers’ expectations into technical cri-teria, while simultaneously considering the weighting of these criteria. It is realized in a standard-ized way, i.e., the zero‐unitarization method (MUZ), after which normalized values of the quality of the photovoltaic panels’ criteria are obtained. In turn, the quality of these products is estimated by the weighted sum model (WSM) and then integrated with purchase cost in qualitative cost analysis (AKJ). As a result, using the scale of relative states, it is possible to categorize customer satisfaction from indicating qualitative cost and selecting the photovoltaic panel expected by customers (the most satisfactory). The effectiveness of the model was demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis, after which the key PV criteria were indicated. The proposed model is intended for any entity who selects a photovoltaic panel for customers. The computerization of calculations may contribute to its utilitarian dissemination. © 2021 by the authors.

The development of cost-effective microgrids with the added functionality of energy storage and backup generation plans has resulted from the combined impact of high energy demands from consumers and environmental concerns, which push for minimizing the energy imbalance, reducing energy losses and CO2 emissions, and improving the overall security and reliability of a power system. It is now possible to tackle the problem of growing consumer load by utilizing the recent developments in modern types of renewable energy resources (RES) and current technology. These energy alternatives do not emit greenhouse gases (GHG) like fossil fuels do, and so help to mitigate climate change. They also have in socioeconomic advantages due to long-term sustainability. Variability and intermittency are the main drawbacks of renewable energy resources (RES), which affect the consistency of electric supply. Thus, utilizing multiple optimization approaches, the energy management system determines the optimum solution for renewable energy resources (RES) and transfers it to the microgrid. Microgrids maintain the continuity of power delivery, according to the energy management system settings. In a microgrid, an energy management system (EMS) is used to decrease the system’s expenses and adverse consequences. As a result, a variety of strategies and approaches are employed in the development of an efficient energy management system. This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of a range of technologies and techniques, and their solutions, for managing the drawbacks of renewable energy supplies, such as variability and load fluctuations, while still matching energy demands for their integration in the microgrids of smart cities. © 2021 by the authors.

The design of such communities requires identification of opportunities early on and their re-evaluation through-out the planning process. There is a need for energy modeling tools that connect 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) platforms to simulation engines, enabling detailed energy analysis of districts within the workflows and tools used by practitioners. This paper introduces the Dragonfly and URBANopt™ combined toolset that supports the creation of urban models from a range of geometry formats typically used by designers and planners, and provides an integrated pathway to simulate district-scale energy systems. The toolset is piloted by a global architecture and master planning firm to evaluate several key urban-scale technical questions for the design of a district in Chicago. The findings indicate that, while energy savings can be achieved through traditional architectural studies and enhancements to individual building efficiency, the modeling toolset helps identify additional savings and insights that can be achieved when considering district-scale energy systems.

Based on the estab-lishment of the connection between environmental parameters and policy context using a quantifiable methodology, in this study, we formulated a rapid and simplified pattern for the evaluation of the effects of policies concerning the atmospheric environment, and applied it to the evaluation and improvement of policies for Carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and air quality enhancement in the sample city of Shenzhen. The Response Surface Model-Visualization and Analysis Tool (RSM-VAT) in the Air Benefit and Cost and Attainment Assessment System (ABaCAS) was applied as the core tool. The required reductions in Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions for 2014–2019 are expected to be achieved; however, the expected reductions in Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions (mainly from road mobile sources) and Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions (mainly from secondary industry and road mobile sources) are less certain. According to the simulated concentration of PM2.5 in 2019, it is necessary to reduce the concentrations of air pollutants, both within and outside Shenzhen. The background weather conditions may be the main reason for the increased concentrations of Ozone (O3) in October compared to those in July. Reductions in NOx and VOCs tend to be the main factors driving changes in O3 concentrations. Policies have been formulated and implemented in a wide array of areas. According to the quantitative comparative analysis of the policies, and the relevant activities, the greatest challenge in reducing NOx and VOCs emissions is presented by the oil-powered vehicles in the road mobile sector and organic solvent production in the secondary industry sector. Therefore, in an effort to achieve better air quality and ensure that CO2 emissions reach a peak in Shenzhen by 2025, we propose key improvements in policies based on interdisciplinary cooperation, involving not only atmospheric and environmental science, but also governance and urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

With the aim of better understanding the influence of climate background on drought events in this region, we analyzed the role of the drought-related factors and extreme climate in the formation of droughts by investigating the relationship between the drought severity index (denoted as GRACE-DSI) based on the terrestrial water storage changes (TWSCs) derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) time-variable gravity fields and drought-related factors/extreme climate. The results show that GRACE-DSI was consistent with the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index in mainland China, especially for the subtropical monsoon climate, with a correlation of 0.72. Precipitation (PPT) and evapotranspiration (ET) are the main factors causing drought events. However, they play different roles under different climate settings. The regions under temperate monsoon climate and subtropical monsoon climate were more impacted by PPT, while ET played a leading role in the regions under temperate continental climate and plateau mountain climate. Moreover, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) events mainly caused abnormalities in PPT and ET by affecting the strength of monsoons (East Asian and Indian monsoon) and regional highs (Subtropical High, Siberian High, Central Asian High, etc.). As a result, the various affected regions were prone to droughts during ENSO or NAO events, which disturbed the normal operation of atmospheric circulation in different ways. The results of this study are valuable in the efforts to understand the formation mechanism of drought events in mainland China. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study aims at quantifying this effect by means of ground-level concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements and tropospheric NO2 column number density (NO2 TVCD), during the imposed governmental restrictions in spring 2020. The analyses were performed for both urban and non-built-up areas across the whole of Poland accompanied by Warsaw (urban site) and Strzyzow (a background site). The results revealed that mean PM2.5 concentrations in spring 2020 for urban and non-built-up areas across Poland and for Warsaw were 20%, 23%, 15% lower than the 10-year average, respectively. Analogous mean NO2 concentrations were lower by 20%, 18%, 30% and NO2 TVCD revealed 9%, 4%, 9% reductions in 2020 as compared to 2019. Regarding mean AOD, retrieved from MERRA-2 reanalysis, it was found that for the whole of Poland during spring 2020 the reduction in AOD as compared to the 10-year average was 15%. The contribution of the lockdown within total air pollution reduction is not easily assessable due to anomalous weather conditions in 2020 which resulted in advection of clean air masses identified from MERRA-2 reanalysis and Strzyzow observatory. © 2021 by the authors.

The goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030 can be reached through the strategy of glocali-zation, giving more responsibility to local administrations like municipalities. In this work, a scientific methodology is developed and validated to revise Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP) and the monitoring phase of municipalities. The methodology starts from measured data in the territory considered and makes use of specific statistical models in order to estimate the needed data. The methodology considers the energy consumption of the main sectors: residential, transportation, ter-tiary, and commercial, with a particular focus on municipal competences (public lighting, urban transport, municipal fleet, etc.). Renewable energy is also considered due to its importance in local energy production. In order to go deeper into SEAPs, in this paper, the authors describe the quantitative analysis of the Baseline Emission Inventory, the quantification of the SEAP planning actions, and the definition of the Monitoring Emission Inventory, which is the final step of the planning process. This step was done for nine municipalities of the Abruzzo region with different characteristics (size, population, climate, geographical position, economy, etc.) in order to widen the results of the analysis and test the robustness of the methodology. Indeed, it gave a quantitative dimension to the primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions for 2018, compared with the 2005 baseline values, and the final results are related to the reduction commitments planned for 2020. All the municipalities were considered to have achieved this goal, surpassing the 20% emissions reduction. This validated methodology is also the basis for the development of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAPs), which integrate adaptation actions and mitigation ones. © 2021 by the authors.

Climate-induced modification of environmental regimes, including changes in streamflow, water temperature, salinity, storm surges, and habitat connectivity can change fish physiology, disrupt spawning cues, cause fish extinctions and invasions, and alter fish community structure. Reducing greenhouse emissions remains the primary mechanism to slow the pace of climate change, but local and regional management agencies and stakeholders have developed an arsenal of adaptation strategies to help partially mitigate the effects of climate change on fish. We summarize common stressors posed by climate change in North America, including (1) increased water temperature, (2) changes in precipitation, (3) sea level rise, and (4) ocean acidification, and present potential adaptation strategies that fishery professionals may apply to help vulnerable fish and fisheries cope with a changing climate. Although our adaptation strategies are primarily from North America, they have broader geographic applicability to fish and aquatic biota in other jurisdictions. These strategies provide opportunities for managers to mitigate the effects of climate change on fish and fish habitat while needed global policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions emerge, which may offer more lasting solutions. © 2021 American Fisheries Society",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115385710

These alternative concepts primarily aim to remove emissions in terminal stops with longer stabling periods, with additional benefits reflected in the reduction of overall fuel consumption, produced emissions, and mon-etary costs. The alternative systems behavior is modeled using a backward‐looking quasi‐static simulation approach, with the implemented energy management strategy based on a finite state machine control. A comparative assessment of alternative propulsion systems is carried out in a case study of a selected regional railway line operated by Arriva, the largest regional railway undertak-ing in the Netherlands. The conversion of a standard diesel‐electric multiple unit vehicle, currently operating on the network, demonstrated a potential GHG reduction of 9.43–56.92% and an energy cost reduction of 9.69–55.46%, depending on the type of service (express or stopping), energy storage technology selection (lithium‐ion battery or double‐layer capacitor), electricity production (green or grey electricity), and charging facilities configuration (charging in terminal stations with or without additional charging possibility during short intermediate stops) used.

Therefore, the environmental policies and regulatory promotion for reusing waste wood as a carbon-negative resource in Taiwan were discussed in this work, which focused on mitigating the emissions of GHG from the energy industries and the manufacturing and construction industries. Considering the official GHG inventory report, the trend analysis of GHG emissions from the energy and the manufacturing and construction industries was addressed first. In addition, this study placed emphasis on the environmental policies and regulatory measures for the material and energy resources from waste wood according to the promulgation of the relevant acts. It was found that the total GHG emissions from the energy and the manufacturing and construction industries accounted for over 80% of net GHG emissions in 2018. In review of the resource recycling and circular economy, lignocellulose-based (or bamboo-based) char, ecological building material, and wood-to-biofuel pathways (e.g., solid recovered fuel) were discussed in this work because they have been promoted by the central competent authorities of the Council of Agriculture (COA), the Ministry of Interior (MOI), and the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), respectively.

To this end, samples were collected from different leaves (morphological properties) of different dominant species at 10 locations in Ahvaz, Iran which had different land uses (industrial, recreational, high-traffic and residential) in various time periods, including the first period (May 6-October 6), the second period (October 7-November 6), the third period (November 7-December 6), and the fourth period (December 7-March 6). Variations in mineral constituents of particulate matter and particle size distribution were analyzed using XRD and laser diffraction respectively. Results disclosed that the particle deposition of some plant species such as Phoenix dactylifera and Washingtonia filifera in various regions was significantly different from that of other species. The particles were generally composed of minerals such as calcite, silicate (quartz) and phyllosilicate which are derived from dust storms. Steel industries in Ahvaz are also one of the main sources of particles, but due to the fact that these particles are primarily made of iron, their adsorption is more likely to occur at distances close to this source. The findings of this study show that characteristics of different plant species have a significant effect on the adsorption of particles and the potential purification of urban air pollution. Therefore, the extension of green space using plant species with greater adsorption is recommended to pave the way for reducing urban air pollution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Dust; Green space; Particle deposition","adsorption; atmospheric pollution; dust; greenspace; particle size; size distribution; urban pollution; Ahwaz; Iran; Khuzestan; Phoenix dactylifera; Washingtonia filifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115361996

The objective of this research was the evaluation of the thermal-energy performances and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of different mixtures of engineered, bio-based earth mortars composed of bamboo particles, earth, and different cementitious materials. Four mixtures were assessed: mortars without bamboo particles (matrix), and mortars containing 3%, 6%, or 9% of bamboo particles by volume. The bulk density and thermal conductivity values obtained for the matrix and mortars with the highest percentage of bamboo particles (9%) were 1704.13 and 1471.80 kg/m3, and 0.62 and 0.43 W/M·K, respectively. Based on experimental results, thermal-energy simulations were carried out using a social housing project as a case study. The simulations evaluated different climate conditions and applied life cycle GHG emissions assessment methodology. Compared with typical cement and lime plastering mortars, the proposed bio-based earth mortars presented a superior thermal-energy performance and lower GHG emissions, particularly the 9% bamboo particles mixture. GHG emissions reached a maximum decrease of 28%. The main scientific contribution of this research is the presentation of an engineered, bio-based earth mortar that can be manufactured using local raw materials available in most developing countries with significant housing demands. The method used, based on experimental research, thermal-energy analysis, and life cycle GHG emissions, may be used for evaluating other innovative materials. It was verified that even with thin plastering in buildings, it is possible to achieve energy efficiency gains and to reduce GHG emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

The resulting sea level rise is starting to be noticed in some regions today, and based on projections, could have severe consequences in the future. These consequences would primarily be felt by resi-dents of coastal areas, but through the potential for irreparable damage to cultural heritage sites, could be significant for the general public. The primary aim of the research undertaken in this article was to assess the threat to cultural heritage objects on the case study area of Tri-City, Poland. A review of available elevation data sources for their potential use in analyses of sea level changes was required. The selection of the optimal data source for the cultural heritage threat analysis of historic sites was carried out. The analyses were conducted for three scenarios, using ArcGIS Pro 2.7 soft-ware. A series of maps were thus prepared to show the threats to specific historic sites for various global sea level rise scenarios. Even with the slightest rise in sea level, monuments could be perma-nently lost.

We aim to study the structure and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) of a sample of 27 gravitationally lensed quasars with up to five different epochs of observation. This sample is composed of ∼100 spectra from the literature plus 22 unpublished spectra of 11 systems. Methods. We measure the magnitude differences in the broad emission line (BEL) wings and statistically model the distribution of microlensing magnifications to determine a maximum likelihood estimate for the sizes of the C IV, C III], and Mg II emitting regions. Results. The BELs in lensed quasars are expected to be magnified differently owing to the different sizes of the regions from which they originate. Focusing on the most common BELs in our spectra (C IV, C III], and Mg II), we find that the low-ionization line Mg II is only weakly affected by microlensing. In contrast, the high-ionization line C IV shows strong microlensing in some cases, indicating that its emission region is more compact. Thus, the BEL profiles are deformed differently depending on the geometry and kinematics of the corresponding emitting region. We detect microlensing in either the blue or the red wing (or in both wings with different amplitudes) of C IV in more than 50% of the systems and find outstanding asymmetries in the wings of QSO 0957+561, SDSS J1004+4112, SDSS J1206+4332, and SDSS J1339+1310. This observation indicates that the BLR is, in general, not spherically symmetric and supports the existence of two regions in the BLR, one insensitive to microlensing and another that only shows up when it is magnified by microlensing. Disregarding the existence of these two regions, our estimate for Mg II, R1/2 = 67.3-15.7+3.8 √ (M/Mpdbl) light-days, is in good agreement with previous results from smaller samples, while we obtain smaller sizes for the C III] and CIV lines, R1/2 = 31.0-4.0+1.9 √ (M/Mpdbl) light-days and R1/2 = 15.5-3.9+0.8 √ (M/Mpdbl) light-days, respectively. © ESO 2021.","Gravitational lensing: micro; Quasars: emission lines; Quasars: general; Quasars: supermassive black holes","Electromagnetic wave emission; Geometry; Gravitation; Ionization; Kinematics; Magnesium compounds; Maximum likelihood estimation; Stars; Broad line region; Gravitational lensing: micros; Maximum-likelihood estimate; Micro-lensing; Quasar: supermassive black hole; Quasars: emission line; Quasars:general; Spectra's; Supermassive black holes; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115343212

In this study, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), total column nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were used from 2005 to 2020 to identify pollution hotspots and potential source areas responsible for air pollution in Jiangsu Province. The study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution and variability of NO2 and SO2, the SO2/NO2 ratio, and their trends, and potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis was performed to identify potential source areas. The spatial distributions showed higher values (>0.60 DU) of annual mean NO2 and SO2 for most cities of Jiangsu Province except for Yancheng City (<0.50 DU). The seasonal analyses showed the highest NO2 and SO2 in winter, followed by spring, autumn, and summer. Coal-fire-based room heating and stable meteorological conditions during the cold season may cause higher NO2 and SO2 in winter. Notably, the occurrence frequency of NO2 and SO2 of >1.2 was highest in winter, which varied between 9.14~32.46% for NO2 and 7.84~21.67% for SO2, indicating a high level of pollution across Jiangsu Province. The high SO2/NO2 ratio (>0.60) indicated that industry is the dominant source, with significant annual and seasonal variations. Trends in NO2 and SO2 were calculated for 2005–2020, 2006–2010 (when China introduced strict air pollution control policies during the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP)), 2011–2015 (during the 12th FYP), and 2013–2017 (the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AC)). Annually, decreasing trends in NO2 were more prom-inent during the 12th FYP period (2011–2015: −0.024~−0.052 DU/year) than in the APPC-AC period (2013–2017: −0.007~−0.043 DU/year) and 2005–2020 (−0.002 to −0.012 DU/year). However, no prevention and control policies for NO2 were included during the 11th FYP period (2006–2010), result-ing in an increasing trend in NO2 (0.015 to 0.031) observed throughout the study area. Furthermore, the implementation of China’s strict air pollution control policies caused a larger decrease in SO2 (per year) during the 12th FYP period (−0.002~−0.075 DU/year) than in the 11th FYP period (−0.014~−0.071 DU/year), the APPC-AC period (−0.007~−0.043 DU/year), and 2005–2020 (−0.015~−0.032 DU/year). PSCF analysis indicated that the air quality of Jiangsu Province is mainly influenced by local pollution sources. © 2021 by the authors.

This study evaluates the potential contribution of a bioretention system to flood control, non-potable water demands (NPD) and resources co-management. Bioretention setups were tested experimentally under variable conditions to identify operational key-factors to multiple purposes. Additionally, the efficiencies obtained for laboratory scale were extrapolated for household and watershed scale, quantifying the indicators of water demand reduction (WDR), energy demand reduction (EDR) and carbon emission reduction (CER) for hybrid systems with LID. The laboratory results indicated that the use of a bioretention with a submerged zone can improve the quality of the water recovered for reuse, while maintaining the efficiency of runoff retention and peak flow attenuation. Comparing the bioretention effluent quality with the Brazilian standards for stormwater reuse, the parameters color, turbidity, E. coli and metals were above the limits, indicating the necessity of a better treatment for solids particles and disinfection. Expanding the analysis to watershed scale, the bioretention helped to reduce NPD demands up to 45%, leading to a reduction in energy demand and carbon emission from the centralized water supply system. © 2021 The Authors","Exploratory analysis; Low impact development; Nature-based solutions; Runoff retention; Water quality; Water-energy-greenhouse gases nexus","Carbon; Climate change; Effluents; Emission control; Escherichia coli; Flood control; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Potable water; Quality control; Runoff; Storms; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Water supply systems; Watersheds; Bioretention; Development practices; Exploratory analysis; Greenhouses gas; Low impact development; Low impacts; Nature-based solution; Runoff retention; Water energy; Water-energy-greenhouse gas nexus; Water quality; ammonia; cadmium; carbon; chromium; copper; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; nitrate; phosphate; rain; storm water; zinc; nitrogen; rain; carbon emission; flood; peak flow; recycling; stormwater; urban drainage; water demand; watershed; Article; catchment area; climate resilience; color; controlled study; Escherichia coli; flooding; fluid balance; greenhouse gas; human; laboratory test; nonhuman; precipitation; retention basin; stormwater runoff; surface area; turbidity; waste water recycling; water quality; water retention; water supply; flooding; laboratory; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; Floods; Laboratories; Nitrogen; Rain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115323205

The technical requirements for the implementation of decentralized thermal networks and heat trading are increasing, both for thermal networks in new buildings and for those remodeled based on existing centralized thermal networks. In this study, a conventional centralized thermal network was implemented as a decentralized thermal network and the possibility of heat prosumers feeding thermal networks was demonstrated experimentally. A real-scale plant was constructed by employing unused thermal energy facilities as prosumers in a school and childcare center based on the existing small-scale block heating and cooling thermal network. The decentralized thermal network and heat prosumer concepts were proven through operation experiments performed on the constructed system in summer and winter. An economic benefit can be achieved by increasing the peak power cost. The experimental results also showed that the proposed bi-directional heat trading reduced carbon emissions by 12.7% compared with conventional centralized thermal systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, we evaluated carbon emission reduction effect of technological innovation in the transportation industry in China. Based on the panel data of 30 sample provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Tibet) from 2012 to 2018, using the Moran’I index and Getis-Ord Gi index, this paper analyzes the evolutionary trend and spatial autocorrelation of carbon emission in the transportation industry, and analyzes the impact of technological innovation on carbon emission levels of the transportation industry and its spatiotemporal differences by using the geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) model by using ArcGIS 10.4 software. The conclusions are as follows: The carbon emission level of China’s transportation industry generally has been rising steadily, showing a spatial distribution pattern of high emissions in the east and low emissions in the west. The cold spots are concentrated in the western region, and the hot spots are situated in the central and eastern regions. Technological innovation has a carbon reduction effect on the transportation industry in the eastern and north-eastern regions, while the effect in other regions is not obvious. However, there is an obvious “inverted U-shaped” relationship between technological innovation and the transportation industry’s carbon emissions. The technological innovation in the transportation industry will have a significant carbon reduction effect after breaking through the technical pain points. This carbon reduction effect has a higher effect on the western region than on the eastern region. In addition, the economic development level, the fiscal expenditure proportion of the transportation industry, the higher education level, and the proportion of fixed asset investment in the transportation industry have played a positive role in reducing carbon in the transportation industry, but the spatial heterogeneity of this carbon reduction effect is relatively strong. Therefore, during the “14th Five-Year Plan” development period in China, it is necessary to continuously promote the low-carbon development of the transportation industry with technological innovation, while highlighting the differentiated carbon reduction governance, and consolidating the role of talents and fiscal support. © 2021 by the authors.

Taking rice from a cold area as the research object, this article selects irrigation volume, nitrogen application volume, and biochar application volume as experimental factors, and rice yield, water use efficiency, greenhouse gas emission comprehensive warming potential as influencing indicators. The research design is D311 Field trials by 3 factors of 5 levels of saturation. Hence, we can obtain the data on rice yield, water use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and comprehensive warming potential under different levels of water and fertilizer, and biochar application, and regression equations were established respectively. The RAGA model was used to simulate the regression equations. The optimal combination of water and fertilizer, and biochar was obtained as follows: irrigation amount is 7230 m3.hm-2, nitrogen fertilizer application amount is 92.13 kg.hm-2, and biochar application amount is 30 t.hm-2. The optimal rice yield obtained under this combination is 9452.20 kg.hm-2. The water use efficiency is 1.94 kg.m-3, and the comprehensive warming potential of greenhouse gas emissions is 4546.73 kg.hm-2. The combined application of water and fertilizer, and biochar optimized by this model can provide a theoretical basis for achieving high yield, water-saving, and emission reduction of rice in cold areas, and it can also provide a reliable calculation method and idea for solving similar optimization problems in the field of agricultural production. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

These thermal conditions and their high sensitivity to climate change cause the accelerated disappearance of these elements; therefore, it is important to know the climatic factors that regulate them, as well as the physical characteristics of each cryospheric element. Unlike glaciers, permafrost and snow cover have not been widely studied. In recent decades, the study of the glacial and periglacial environment has been carried out in intertropical mountains. However, despite the altitude of their relief and the frequent occurrence of snowfall in tropical high mountains, the conditions that determine such events have been barely analyzed; and in the case of Mexico, the volume of snowfall and its thickness have not been quantified either, as well as their corresponding duration. Consequently, this work is aimed to analyze the temperature and precipitation conditions that determine the snowfall at the higher part of the Nevado de Toluca volcano; at the same time, the conditions of the cryotic climate and their possible implication on the surface are studied. The analysis of data from 1965 to 2016, using frequency statistics, allowed to realize that snowfall occurs with low intensity, its accumulation being less than 10 cm thick and 10 mm of snow water equivalent, which causes the snowpack to stay only a few weeks on average. At the same time, it was determined that there is a significant increase in the number of freeze-thaw cycles. Therefore, due to the climate conditions and their influence on the mountain surface, it is probable that the bedrock is subject to a greater gelifraction dynamics, and the unconsolidated soil surface increases; the combination of the above could cause a greater geomorphological dynamic over time, particularly due to debris flows, and by water and wind erosion of the surface. This work is intended to serve as a reference for the high mountain environment in the intertropical regions. © 2021, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air temperature; Cryotic conditions; High-mountain climatology; Periglacial geomorphology; Snow precipitation","air temperature; climate conditions; geomorphology; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; snow; snow cover; Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Mexico [North America]; Nevado de Toluca; Toluca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115245199

Although urban context somewhat unifies, climate and topography prevalent in India are varied and diverse. Most part of the country is hot, while some regions are dry throughout the year, some are humid and some others are composite. The building design features, therefore, need to vary with the diversity to provide comfortable environments naturally. The context and the requirements for thermal comfort provide the basis for building siting, selection of building form and envelope, fenestration design, choice of materials, and other aspects. The paper proposes and discusses the various climate-responsive design strategies that are best adapted for the different climatic zones of India and presents such design interventions and features as a comparative matrix. Such a comparative presentation is novel, convenient, easy to comprehend, and provides a useful toolkit for building designers. The climate-responsive interventions in building design proposed in this study have the potential to enhance built environments naturally, thereby mitigating the adverse environmental impact.

Nonetheless, qualitative methods still play an understated role in climate and ocean change research. One important reason for this are continuing tendencies in the natural sciences to value ‘hard’ and value-free quantitative approaches over ‘soft’ and value-laden qualitative approaches. This paper argues that to overcome such methodological reservations, it is necessary to inform not only about the key characteristics of qualitative research but also – and this has received little attention – about the concrete empirical insights that can be gained from qualitative as opposed to quantitative data, despite sharing the same research focus. The environmental literature still lacks relevant examples from fieldwork that explain in detail how exactly decisive information is elicited from specific qualitative datasets, thereby illustrating how qualitative approaches matter. This paper seeks to help fill this gap by demonstrating to sceptical quantitative researchers the necessity and added value of integrating qualitative data in global environmental change research and highlighting impeding factors. This is done by presenting empirical findings about climate and ocean change adaptation in Norwegian coastal fisheries and elucidating how different qualitative interview techniques reveal that fishers who initially state that they do not worry about climate change actually do worry, and vice versa. Self-categorisation theory from social psychology is used to better explain such contradictory statements. Detecting salient but masked climate concern and understanding the reasons behind it are crucial for avoiding misleading conclusions and effectively tailoring adaptation strategies to the requirements of specific audiences. © 2021 The Author","Adaptation; Climate sciences; Fisheries; Identity; Marine sciences; Qualitative research; Self-categorization theory","climate change; environmental change; fieldwork; fishery management; qualitative analysis; Norway; Martes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115235650

The microorganisms inhabiting these environments remain largely unknown. We studied the phylogenetic composition and metabolic potential of the prokaryotic communities of TMVs located in the Taman Peninsula, Russia, using a metagenomic approach. One of the examined sites harbored a unique community with a high abundance of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea belonging to ANME-3 group (39% of all 16S rRNA gene reads). The high number of ANME-3 archaea was confirmed by qPCR, while the process of anaerobic methane oxidation was demonstrated by radioiso-topic experiments. We recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of archaeal and bacterial community members and analyzed their metabolic capabilities. The ANME-3 MAG contained a complete set of genes for methanogenesis as well as of ribosomal RNA and did not encode proteins involved in dissimilatory nitrate or sulfate reduction. The presence of multiheme c-type cytochromes suggests that ANME-3 can couple methane oxidation with the reduction of metal oxides or with the interspecies electron transfer to a bacterial partner. The bacterial members of the community were mainly represented by autotrophic, nitrate-reducing, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, as well as by fermentative microorganisms. This study extends the current knowledge of the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of prokaryotes in TMVs and provides a first insight into the genomic features of ANME-3 archaea. © 2021 by the authors.

The drawbacks of these materials include their high cost and oil-based essence. In recent years, recycled materials have become possible alternative sources of carbon with several advantages. Firstly, the production of this alternative source of carbon may help to reduce biomass disposal, and secondly, it contributes to CO2 sequestration. The use of carbon derived from recycled materials by a pyrolysis treatment is called biochar. Here, we present composite materials based on different biochar filler contents dispersed in several thermoplastic polymer matrixes. Electrical conductivity and tensile break strength were investigated together with the material characterisation by DTA/TGA, XRD, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Materials with good flexibility and electrical conductivity were obtained. The local ordering in composites resembles both biochar and polymer ordering. The similarity between biochar and carbon nanotubes’ (CNTs) XRD patterns may be observed. As biochar is highly cost-effective, the proposed composites could become a valid substitute for CNT composites in various applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we estimate national-level aquatic food system climate risk using an integrative food systems approach that connects climate hazards impacting marine and freshwater capture fisheries and aquaculture to their contributions to sustainable food system outcomes. We show that without mitigation, climate hazards pose high risks to nutritional, social, economic and environmental outcomes worldwide—especially for wild-capture fisheries in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Small Island Developing States. For countries projected to experience compound climate risks, reducing societal vulnerabilities can lower climate risk by margins similar to meeting Paris Agreement mitigation targets.

However, sustainability education has not adequately integrated entrepreneurial skills to promote green hotel practices towards sustainable development. Therefore, this study explored the leadership roles of the Frangipani Hotel in Langkawi, Malaysia, because it adopted a circular economy in line with the zero-waste concept to develop the environmental and socio-economic condition of the locality. Extensive literature reviews were conducted to explore the transformational leadership roles of the Frangipani hotel for green practices. Interviews with the managing director, general manager, and the head of 10 operating branches of Frangipani also provided information about the green hotel practices to support its leadership roles. Similarly, interviews with the public, private, business, and community stakeholders also supported the transformational leadership roles of Frangipani to integrated green hotel practices with effective multi-stakeholder collaboration for quality control and quality assurance of its green practices. The patience of Frangipani and its roles as a liaison among government, non-government, business, and private and community sectors have been very effective in promoting green practices in the hospitability industry via training and knowledge-sharing. However, the monitoring and evaluation of these green practices are essential, and they can be completed via developing a special key performance index for the effective promotion of green hotels. © 2021 by the authors.

Its buildings consume more than a third of the energy and generate 40% of the emissions. This makes cities in general and their buildings in particular priority points of attention for policymakers and utilities. This paper uses population density as a variable to know its influence on energy consumption and emissions produced in buildings. Furthermore, to show its effect more clearly, the influence of the climate was elimi-nated. The usual energy consumption in buildings is thermal and electrical. The study was carried out at the city level, both per inhabitant and per household. The area actually occupied by the city was considered. The proposed method was applied to the case of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. The results show that the higher the population density, the higher the energy consumption per inhabitant and household in buildings. The consumption of thermal energy is elastic, while that of electrical energy is inelastic, varying more than 100% between extreme groups. Regarding CO2 emissions, the higher the population density, the higher the emissions. Emissions of electrical origin barely vary by 2% and are greater than those of thermal origin. In addition, the proportion of emissions of electrical origin, with respect to the total, decreases with increasing population density from 74% to 55%. This research aims to help policymakers and utilities to take the appropriate measures that favor the use of renewable energies and reduce CO2 emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

A systematic literature review and meta-analysis has been conducted to assess the relationship between the use of air filters, one of the most commonly studied interventions, and respiratory outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Methods: We systematically reviewed intervention studies on PM using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases up to September 2019. Studies that included data on PM concentration changes and respiratory symptoms or lung function in patients with respiratory diseases were eligible for inclusion. Effect estimates were quantified separately using the random-effects model. Results: Six studies were included in the quantitative analysis. Air filter use reduced indoor PM2.5 by 11.45 μg/m3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.88, 16.01 μg/m3). Air filter use was not associated with improvements in respiratory symptoms in 5 of the 6 studies or significant changes in the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (mean change, -1.77%; 95% CI, -8.25%, 4.71%). Air filter use was associated with improved peak expiratory flow rate by 5.86 (95% CI, 3.5, 8.19 of standardized difference). Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review suggest that air filters may reduce indoor PM and increase peak expiratory rate in asthmatic patients. However, most studies showed no significant effects of air filters on respiratory symptoms or FEV1. Further studies in regions with high-density PM may provide additional information on this issue. © 2021 Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

The systems are kinetically stable, as predicted from the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis showed that strong electron donation occurs to the central planar carbon atom by the peripheral atoms in all the studied systems. From the nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) analysis, it is shown that the systems possess both σ-and π-aromaticity. The presence of 18 valence electrons in these systems, in their neutral form, appears to be important for their stability with planar geometries rather than tetrahedral structures.

In this paper, we introduce a methodological starting point for analysing the ways in which landscape architects and spatial planners engage with coastal landscapes and coastal heritage in the context of current climate adaptation projects. We test these methodologies by applying them to the Marconi dike strengthening project in Delfzijl, the Netherlands. This city’s dike fortification is an interesting case, as it offers many opportunities for re-designing heritage. The city borders the Wadden Sea area, a tidal mudflat area protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its natural and geological heritage values. The area also consists of a rich cultural landscape, which is overlooked in the public image and in local policy.

According to Green Chemistry principles, five novel formulations were stabilized by “green” hybrid ionic surfactants such as cocobetaine—surfactin molecules obtained from coconut and fermented rapeseed meal. Preliminary optimization studies involving three dispersion stability tests, i.e., centrifugation, heating, and cooling cycles, indicated the most promising candidates for further physicochemical analysis. Finally, nanoemulsion colloidal characterization provided by scattering (dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering as well as backscattering), microscopic (transmission electron and confocal laser scanning microscopy), and spectroscopic (UV–Vis spectroscopy) methods revealed the most stable nanocarrier for transdermal biological investigation. In vitro, topical experiments provided on human skin cell line HaCaT keratinocytes and normal dermal NHDF fibroblasts indicated high cell viability upon treatment of the tested formulation with a final 0.02–0.2 mg/mL bakuchiol concentration. This excellent biocompatibility was confirmed by ex vivo and in vivo tests on animal and human skin tissue. The improved permeability and antiaging potential of the bakuchiol-encapsulated rich extract were observed, indicating that the obtained ecological nanoemulsions are competitive with commercial retinol formulations. © 2021 by the authors.

Climate and environmental databases are critical for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and for efficiently planning and implementing appropriate adaptation measures. Available federated and distributed databases can serve as necessary starting points for municipalities to identify needs, prioritize resources, and allocate investments, taking into account often tight budget constraints. High-quality geospatial, climate, and environmental data are now broadly available and remote sensing data, e.g., Copernicus services, will be critical. There are forward-looking approaches to use these datasets to derive forecasts for optimizing urban planning processes for local governments. On the municipal level, however, the existing data have only been used to a limited extent. There are no adequate tools for urban planning with which remote sensing data can be merged and meaningfully combined with local data and further processed and applied in municipal planning and decision-making. Therefore, our project CoKLIMAx aims at the development of new digital products, advanced urban services, and procedures, such as the development of practical technical tools that capture different remote sensing and in-situ data sets for validation and further processing. CoKLIMAx will be used to develop a scalable toolbox for urban planning to increase climate resilience. Focus areas of the project will be water (e.g., soil sealing, stormwater drainage, retention, and flood protection), urban (micro)climate (e.g., heat islands and air flows), and vegetation (e.g., greening strategy, vegetation monitoring/vitality). To this end, new digital process structures will be embedded in local government to enable better policy decisions for the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The geographical characteristics of the BRB feature eight major sub-basins or watersheds consisting of Libmanan-Pulantuna, Ragay Hills, Thiris, Naga-Yabo, Pawili River, Waras-Lalo, Naporog, and Quinali. The study applied the combination of the participatory tools and the Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA) framework to gather information on local climate vulnerabilities and contexts. Briefly, the CRVA employed geospatial modeling and utilized several indicators which are presumed to affect vulnerability including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity which were aggregated to provide an index of vulnerability. This enabled us to identify areas of exposure and vulnerability and pointed areas of greatest need for strengthened adaptive capacity and risk management. Our findings revealed that vulnerability in the BRB was perceived to be relatively prevalent and that typhoons, flooding, and drought were identified to contribute significant impacts to rural livelihood. Furthermore, our findings in the CRVA suggested significant regional differences in vulnerability in the BRB. The majority of the towns in the central and northwestern portions of the BRB will largely experience increased vulnerability, particularly, in the Thiris sub-basin including some parts of Ragay Hills, Waras-Lalo, and the northwestern Libmanan-Pulantuna sub-basins. On the contrary, the entire Quinali region on the south is revealed to have the lowest vulnerability index. The clear policy implication of these accounts will be on how to mobilize developmental thrusts in both areas of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the sub-national level to reinforce local-based climate priority setting in adaptation interventions and policies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Bicol River basin; Climate Change; Philippines; Rural livelihood; Vulnerability","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk management; Rivers; Rural areas; Watersheds; Agricultural sector; Agriculture sectors; Climate change adaptation; Climate vulnerability; Disaster risk reductions; Regional differences; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability index; Climate change; adaptive management; agroindustry; assessment method; climate change; detection method; disaster management; drought; flood control; natural disaster; perception; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115047134

Despite the advances reported in the literature, adaptation to climate change is still considered a challenge to move from planning to the practical implementation of successful interventions. In this regard, identifying international key barriers, exchanges of experiences and lessons learned may facilitate the progress of the coasts’ sustainable and resilient future. The coast of Mexico is an excellent study area. High population densities occur along the coastal zone, whose main economic activity is related to primary and tertiary sectors. Additionally, a great diversity of coastal ecosystems exists, which are threatened by anthropogenic and hydrometeorological impacts. Under these circumstances, the population is becoming aware of the urgent need to adapt to the consequences of climate change. In this sense, this paper reviews research contributions concerning population perception to climate change and adaptation strategies in Mexico’s coastal zone. The findings highlight critical institutional difficulties and social barriers that have impeded the effective implementation of adaptation strategies to climate change in Mexico and consider steps to address them. However, adaptation strategies that show the prevention culture of some coastal communities have been found and also results of successful projects carried out, especially on mangrove forest and coral reef restoration, which are of essential importance to consider to progress on the path of a successful adaptation to climate change in Mexico. © 2021 by the authors.

Total thirty-one parameters are used in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to prepare the risk zone which is segmented into four groups for individual group-wise risk assessment. Land use and Land cover (LULC) have been prepared using supervised classification techniques with 6000 signatures. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) based climatic data and population projection information play a major role, which has not been used previously for risk investigation in this study area. The risk zones of 2018 and the LULC classes have been validated by 978 field sample point and finally tehsil wise risk factors have been extracted using sensitivity analysis. The overall operation reflects a significant increase (4.35%) in the very high-risk zones in the absence of mangrove and coral ecosystem in 2030 compared to 2018. A large number of fishermen are trying to shift their primary occupation due to the unavailability of sufficient fishes in the near-shore regions, which is an indication of drastic changes in coastal ecosystems over the region in the last 3 decades. Therefore, the prediction of future coastal landscape in the absence of mangrove–coral ecosystem will draw a major concern in development planning which will strengthen the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) climate change mitigation, ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation planning, sustainable livelihood management practices, future research work in risk mitigation and management field. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AHP model; Coastal vulnerability; Community resilience; Representative concentration pathways (RCPs); Viability","Analytic hierarchy process; Biodiversity; Climate change; Coastal zones; Conservation; Ecosystems; Land use; Population statistics; Research and development management; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Biodiversity conservation; Climate change mitigation; Ecological restoration; Land use and land cover; Supervised classification; Sustainable livelihood; Sustainable management; Risk assessment; accuracy assessment; assessment method; biodiversity; climate change; coastal zone; conservation status; future prospect; livelihood; natural resource; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; alternative agriculture; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115000925

Thirty-four water samples from caves, springs, and wells were collected during two seasons for major ions (cations and anions) as well as stable isotope investigations on December 2014 (wet season) and October 2015 (dry season). Additionally, nine samples were also acquired from monthly precipitation (January 2015 till November 2015) for isotopic analyses from PV climatology station. Determining meteoric water line of Paveh (PMWL, δ2H = 6.9 δ18O + 11.9, R2 = 0.97) indicates that the origination of air masses of the region was found to be Mediterranean Sea. Hydrogeochemical investigations, on the other hand, indicated that three major formations including a pure limestone, Bistoun formation (JKb), and two limestones with some sort of impurities, i.e., Ilam–Sarvak (KIl-KSv) and Goru (Gr.) affected the water resources of the region. Regarding δ18O and δ2H results, most of karstic resources are plotted near PMWL and represent depleted isotopic values due to recharging from high altitudes. Finally, carbon isotope investigation was also utilized to determine the main source of carbon which was found to be carbonate dissolution and C4 plants. Furthermore, the karst development type (less-, moderate-, and well-developed) of all formations were identified. Providing that isotopic findings are complementary to hydrochemical features, this study gives an in-depth understanding of vulnerable karstic terrains in NW Iran, which are highly important frameworks for effective water management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Hydrochemistry; Karst aquifer; Local meteoric water line (LMWL); Residence time of water; Stable isotopes (δ2H, δ18O, and δ13C-DIC)","Carbon; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrochemistry; Lime; Limestone; Water management; Groundwater chemistry; Hydrochemical methods; Hydrogeochemical investigation; In-depth understanding; Isotopic analysis; Karst development; Mediterranean sea; Meteoric water lines; Isotopes; carbon isotope; dissolution; groundwater chemistry; hydrochemistry; hydrogeochemistry; karst; meteoric water; stable isotope; Iran; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114991002

Within this context, tracking the alignment of the performance with the mission and strategic objectives of the organization, based on reliable and up-to-date data, is of utmost importance to enable effective and continual improvement management. Organizational performance assessment in the water sector has been a topic of growing attention since the 1990s due to the increase in the role of regulators and tighter legislation. Proactive utilities are incorporating sustainability, resource efficiency, resilience, and continual improvement principles in their practices. Strategic planning provides the road map for management and interconnecting the different areas of the organization. An essential component of strategic management planning is the adoption of a tailored performance assessment system (PAS), allowing a better response to these challenges from the water utility management perspective. This paper presents a novel PAS at the strategic level, which was tested and validated with wastewater utilities, in a co-creation process. The proposed PAS fully adopts the objectives recommended in international standards, with a corresponding set of criteria and metrics, and a validated proposal of reference values for the metrics. © 2021 by the authors.

The results indicate that China’s electricity consumption presents a significant spatial spill over effect, and the spatial agglomeration of electricity consumption in local regions is mainly HH clusters. A 1% positive change in financial development causes an increase of 0.089% in electricity consumption, but a 1% rise in financial development reduces electricity consumption of neighboring regions by 0.051%. A 1% positive change in trade openness decreases electricity consumption by 0.051%, while the spatial spillover effect of trade openness is not significant.

Their sustainable management can reduce water pollution, mitigate climate change while providing recreation opportunities. This study assessed the current condition of the streams/torrents and their riparian areas in the city of Drama in Greece. In addition, practices to improve their functionality and enhance community awareness were recommended. A spatial database of the wider urban setting including suburbs and rural areas (weather, land cover, soils, roads, protected areas, riparian areas, etc.) was developed within GIS. The datasets were then inputted in a hydrologic model to simulate the water balance and stream discharge in the main urban streams and torrents. Field measurements of stream water discharge, and vegetation and stream channel conditions were undertaken using two visual protocols. The results of the protocols indicate that most streams/torrents and their riparian areas are of low ecological quality. Nature-based solutions were recommended to improve their ecological quality. In addition, the implementation of Eco-Routes was recommended to enhance the awareness of their importance and to promote their sustainable management. Overall, the urban streams/torrents and riparian ecosystems of Drama are degraded and innovative management practices should be implemented to conserve them and feature their ecosystem services. © 2021 The Authors Water Supply","Eco-Routes; GIS; Hydrologic models; Riparian; SWAT; Visual protocols","Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Wetlands; Ecosystem services; Hydrologic modeling; Management practices; Recreation opportunities; Riparian ecosystem; Stream channel conditions; Sustainable management; Urban environments; Rivers; river water; climate change; conservation management; ecosystem service; ecotourism; environmental quality; riparian vegetation; stream channel; suburban area; sustainability; Article; awareness; city; ecosystem service; ecotourism; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; fluid balance; Greece; hydrological model; quality of life; riparian ecosystem; rural area; simulation; soil; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; spatial analysis; stream (river); urban area; vegetation; water quality; water supply; weather; Drama; Eastern Macedonia and Thrace; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114948609

Their growing contribution to the total primary energy supply can significantly facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The paper provides findings from an in-depth comparative analysis of RES deployment trends during 2010–2019 in the Baltic countries in the context of energy policy documents of the European Union (EU). The dynamics of targeted RES indicators according to the Renewables Directive 2009/28/EC and National Programmes and the role of renewable energies in mitigating climate change are analysed. A key role of the heating and cooling sector in deploying RES is highlighted and a necessity to implement radical changes in the transport sector of the Baltic countries is revealed. The paper examines changes in energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the impact of driving factors in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and other countries of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR). The Kaya identity and the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method are used for the decomposition analysis. Based on the analysis conducted, the impact of population change, economic growth, decline of energy intensity, RES deployment and reduction of emission intensity on change of GHG emissions in countries of the BSR and, on average, in the EU-27 during 2010–2019 is revealed. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is difficult to precisely control the ratio of the different valence states on the surface and the relationship between the surface valence change and catalytic efficiency in the photocatalytic reaction process is unclear. Herein, CeVO4 ultrathin nanosheets were fabricated by one-step solvothermal method with ethanolamine (MEA) as the structure-directing agent. The ratio of the concentrations of intrinsic Ce4+ and Ce3+ ions is precisely modulated from 19.82:100 to 13.33:100 changed by the volume of MEA added without morphology modification. The photocatalytic efficiency increases as the concentrations of intrinsic Ce4+ and Ce3+ ions decrease and CV3 (prepared with 3 mL of MEA) shows the highest CO generation rate approx-imately 6 and 14 times larger than CV (prepared without MEA) and CV1 (prepared with 1 mL of MEA), respectively, in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Interestingly, about 6.8% photo-induced Ce4+ ions were generated on the surface of the catalysts during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction without any phase and morphology changes for CV3.

At the same time, the environmental quality in China has deteriorated significantly. In this study, provincial-level data for 31 Chinese provinces during 2007–2017 are used to investigate the impacts of government expenditure on the emissions of three specific measures of environmental degradation. The main objective of this study is to examine the influence of government expenditures, economic growth per capita, environment protection expenditure, and added second-sector value on environmental quality by measuring sulfur dioxide (SO2), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and ammonia nitrogen emissions (AN). Moreover, the study applied the generalized method of moments (GMM) and the fully modified least square (FMOLS) to estimate the co-integration relationship among the underlying factors. The results demonstrate a significant direct effect of government expenditure on improving environmental quality overall in the Chinese provinces, which increases with the level of economic growth. However, the results also confirmed the inverted N-shaped relationship between the pollution factor and economic growth per capita. Our key findings lead toward the manifestation and emphasis of the importance of appropriate policies for restoring government expenditure and, at the same time, strengthening the relationship between the industrial sector and environmental policy standards. Significantly, governments in developing countries should allocate larger budgets for environmental projects in their fiscal reforms for the sake of moving to greener and more inclusive economies with low-carbon activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Degradation is an inevitable phenomenon as aero-engines age with significant impacts on the engine performance, emissions level, and fuel consumption. The engine control system is a key element capable of coping with degradation consequences subject to the implementation of an advanced management strategy. This paper demonstrates a methodological approach for aero-engine controller adjustment to deal with degradation implications, such as emission levels and increased fuel consumption. For this purpose, a component level model for an aero-engine was first built and transformed to a block-structured Wiener model using a system identification approach. An industrial Min-Max control strategy was then developed to satisfy the steady state and transient limit protection requirements simultaneously while satisfying the physical limitation control modes, such as over-speed, surge, and over-temperature. Next, the effects of degradation on the engine performance and associated changes to the controller were analysed thoroughly to propose practical degradation management strategies based on a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the topic. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy was effective in restoring the degraded engine performance to the level of the clean engine while protecting the engine from physical limitations. The proposed adjustments in the control strategy reduced the fuel consumption and, as a result, the emission level and carbon footprint of the engine. © 2021 by the authors.

This study selects six small-scale, popular greenspaces with distinct characteristics that are jointly situated along the same main urban artery in a high-density central urban district. Field investigations and questionnaires are conducted and combined with statistical analyses, to explore the spatial-temporal distribution and influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations in these greenspaces. The study finds that the air quality conditions in the sites are non-ideal, and this has potential negative impacts on the health of the elderly visitors. Moreover, the difference values of PM2.5 concentrations’ spatial-temporal distributions are significantly affected by vehicle-related emissions, which have significant temporal characteristics. PM2.5 concentration is strongly correlated with percentage of green coverage (R = 0.82, p < 0.05), degree of airflow (R = −0.83, p < 0.05), humidity and comfort level (R = 0.54, p < 0.01 and R = −0.40, p < 0.01 respectively). Meanwhile, the sites’ “sky view factor” is strongly correlated with degree of airflow (R = 0.82, p < 0.05), and the comfort level plays an indirect role in the process of PM2.5 affecting crowd activities. Based on this analysis, an optimal set of index ranges for greenspace elements which are correlated with the best reduction in PM2.5 concentrations is derived. As such, this research reveals the technical methods to best reduce their concentrations and provides a basis and reference for improving the quality of small-scale greenspaces in high-density urban districts for the benefit of healthy aging. © 2021 by the authors.

Quantitative modeling of biogeochemical processes is a crucial way to advance the understanding of the global carbon cycle and the past, present, and future of climate change. Here, we present a new approach of dynamic transport-reaction model combined with sediment deposition. Compared to other studies, since the model does not need the methane concentration in the bottom of sediments and predicts that value, it provides us with a robust carbon budget estimation tool in the sediment. We applied the model to the Blake Ridge region (Ocean Drilling Program, Leg 164, site 997). Based on seafloor data as input, our model remarkably reproduces measured values of total organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, sulfate, calcium, and magnesium concentration in pore waters and the in situ methane presented in three phases: dissolved in pore water, trapped in gas hydrate, and as free gas. Kinetically, we examined the coexistence of free gas and hydrate, and demonstrated how it might affect methane gas migration in marine sediment within the gas hydrate stability zone. © 2021 by the authors.

The monthly spatial downscaled outputs of General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used, and a new Python procedure was developed to batch pick up site-scale climate change information. A combined modeling approach was proposed to estimate the responses of the streamflow and Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN) fluxes to four climate change scenarios during four future periods. The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) was used to generate synthetic daily weather series, which were further used in the Regional Nutrient Management (ReNuMa) model for scenario analyses of watershed hydrochemical process responses. The results showed that there would be 2–3% decreases in annual streamflow by the end of this century for most scenarios except SSP 1-26. More streamflow is expected in the summer months, responding to most climate change scenarios. The annual TDN fluxes would continue to increase in the future under the uncontrolled climate scenarios, with more non-point source contributions during the high-flow periods in the summer. The intensities of the TDN flux increasing under the emission-controlled climate scenarios would be relatively moderate, with a turning point around the 2070s, indicating that positive climate policies could be effective for mitigating the impacts of future climate changes on watershed hydrochemical processes. © 2021 by the authors.

Present modes of transports contributes significantly to green house gas emissions while the efforts to reduce these emissions can be improved in many countries. Pathways to a more sustainable form of mobility can be modelled using travel demand models to aid decision makers. However, to project human behavior into the future one should analyze the changes in the past to understand the drivers in mobility change. Mobility surveys provide sets of activity diaries, which show changes in travel behavior over time. Those activity diaries are one of the inputs in activity-based demand generation models like travel activity pattern simulation (TAPAS). This paper shows a method of using probability distributions between person and diary groups. It offers an opportunity for an increased heterogeneity in travel behavior without sacrificing too much accuracy. Additionally it will present the use case of temporal backand forecasting of changes in activity choices of existing mobility survey data. The results show the possibilities within this approach together with its limits and pitfalls. © 2021 by the authors.

Polar regions have received little attention due to their sparse populations, but active fires in the Arctic cause carbon losses from peatlands, which affects the global climate system. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the spatiotemporal variations in active fires in the Arctic and to assess the fire risk. We used MODIS C6 data from 2001 to 2019 and VIIRS V1 data from 2012 to 2019 to analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of active fires and establish a fire risk assessment model based on logistic regression. The trends in active fire frequency based on MODIS C6 and VIIRS V1 data are consistent. Throughout the Arctic, the fire frequency appears to be fluctuating and overall increasing. Fire occurrence has obvious seasonality, being concentrated in summer (June–August) and highest in July, when lightning is most frequent. The frequency of active fires is related to multiple factors, such as vegetation type, NDVI, elevation, slope, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and distances from roads and settlements. A risk assessment model was constructed based on logistic regression and found to be accurate. The results are helpful in understanding the risk of fires in the Arctic under climate change and provide a scientific basis for fire prediction and control and for reducing fire‐related carbon emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we investigate this trade-off using an integrated modelling framework. We quantify how different nitrogen mitigation options contribute to reconciling food security and compliance with regional nitrogen surplus boundaries. We find that even when respecting regional nitrogen surplus boundaries, hunger could be substantially alleviated with 590 million fewer people at risk of hunger from 2010 to 2050, if all nitrogen mitigation options were mobilized simultaneously. Our scenario experiments indicate that when introducing regional N targets, supply-side measures such as the nitrogen use efficiency improvement are more important than demand-side efforts for food security. International trade plays a key role in sustaining global food security under nitrogen boundary constraints if only a limited set of mitigation options is deployed. Policies that respect regional nitrogen surplus boundaries would yield a substantial reduction in non-CO2 GHG emissions of 2.3 GtCO2e yr−1 in 2050, which indicates a necessity for policy coordination. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114884005

PB is commonly applied in the management of fire-prone ecosystems to mitigate large, high-intensity wildfires, the associated emissions, and high fire suppression costs. However, the effectiveness of such fire management in reducing large wildfires and emissions over Brazil remains mostly unevaluated. Here, we aim to fill the gap in the scientific evidence of the PB benefits by relying on the most up-to-date, satellite-derived fire datasets of burned area (BA), fire size, duration, emissions, and intensity from 2003 to 2018. We focused on two Cerrado ITs with different sizes and hydrological regimes, Xerente and Araguaia, where IFM has been in place since 2015. To understand fire regime dynamics, we divided the study period into three phases according to the prevalent fire policy and the individual fire scars into four size classes. We considered two fire seasons: management fire season (MFS, which goes from rainy to mid-dry season, when PBs are undertaken) and wildfires season (WFS, when PBs are not performed and fires tend to grow out of control). Our results show that the implementation of the IFM program was responsible for a decrease of the areas affected by high fire recurrence in Xerente and Araguaia, when compared with the Zero Fire Phase (2008–2013). In both regions, PB effectively reduced the large wildfires occurrence, the number of medium and large scars, fire intensity, and emissions, changing the prevalent fire season from the WFS to the MFS. Such reductions are significant since WFS causes higher negative impacts on biodiversity conservation and higher greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that the effect on wildfires can still be reduced if effective fire management policies, including PB, continue to be implemented during the coming decades. © 2021 by the authors.

For this reason, since 2017, the Green Climate Fund placed gender among its key programming prerequisites, making it the first multilateral climate fund to do so worldwide. However, to date, no lessons to inform planned gender-responsive ecosystem-based interventions in Namibia have been drawn from community-based natural resource management. Thus, this paper aims to share key lessons regarding the way in which gender assessment is useful in enhancing equity in an eco-system-based adaptation programme for the Green Climate Fund. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews and group discussions in the 14 rural regions of Namibia with 151 participants from 107 community-based natural resource management organisations (73.5:26.5; male:female ra-tio). The results identified gender imbalances in leadership and decision-making due to intersecting historic inequalities, ethnicity and geography, as well as other socio-cultural factors in local com-munity-based natural resource management institutions. We also identified income disparities and unequal opportunities to diversify livelihoods, gendered differentiated impacts of climate change and meaningful participation in public forums. Overall, the assessment indicates that considering gender analysis at the initiation of a community-based climate change adaptation project is crucial for achieving resilience to climate change, closing the gender gap, building capacity to increase equity and empowering women in resource-dependent environments in Namibia and Sub-Saharan Africa more broadly. © 2021 by the authors.

Such systems would satisfy consumers’ energy needs and also comply with environmental standards, especially because the systems would account for more than 80% of residential energy use. This paper investigates two complementary efficient systems that can support these heating systems; ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) and organic Rankine cycle systems (ORCs). The study proposes to couple these two systems in a parallel configuration. A dynamic simulation model created in TRNSYS platform has been deployed to assess the performance of the combined ORC-GSHP based micro-cogeneration system. This former provides heating to a residential house during the heating mode as needed. It has the capacity to switch to a charging mode, during which the ORC system is directly coupled to the ground heat exchanger (GHE), which works as a thermal energy storage and supplies energy to the GSHP. The feasibility of this combined system arrangement, and its comparison with a conventional GSHP system are examined for use in residential buildings in three cities across the varied climatic regions within Canada, namely Edmonton (AB), Halifax (NS), and Vancouver (BC). Results showed that the proposed micro-cogeneration system recorded less energy use of over 80%. The addition of the ORC system had a definite effect on the performance of the GSHP in that it decreased the operating hours from 11–58% compared to the conventional GSHP case and maintained consistently higher COP values. These results may help to specify viable ORC-GSHP based micro-co/trigeneration systems in cold climatic applications and should be useful for prototype design and development. © 2021 by the authors.

RDEC can be considered the inverse of double photoionization by a single photon. For the gaseous targets, measurements were done for 2.11 MeV/u F9+ and F8+ ions interacting with N2 and Ne, while for the thin-foil target the measurements were done for 2.11 MeV/u F9+ and F8+ and 2.19 MeV/u O8+ and O7+ ions striking thin C targets. Reports on this work were already published separately in shorter accounts by La Mantia et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 133401 (2020)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.124.133401 for the gas targets and Phys. Rev. A 102, 060801(R) (2020)2469-992610.1103/PhysRevA.102.060801 for the thin-foil targets]. The gas targets were studied under single-collision conditions, while the foil targets suffered unavoidable multiple collisions. The measurements were carried out by detecting x-ray emission from the target at 90° to the beam direction in coincidence with outgoing ions undergoing double, single, and, in the case of the foil targets, no charge change inside the target. Striking differences between the gaseous and foil targets were found from these measurements, with RDEC for the gaseous targets occurring only in coincidence with q-2 outgoing projectiles as expected, while RDEC for the foil targets was seen in each of the outgoing q-2, q-1, and no charge-change states. The no charge-change result was totally unexpected. The cross sections for RDEC for the fully stripped ions on gas targets were found to be about six times larger than those for the one-electron projectiles. For the foil targets, the RDEC cross sections for the fully stripped and one-electron projectiles differ somewhat from one another but not to the the extent they did for the gas targets. In this work the cross sections for all of the projectiles for the foil targets were adjusted due to the target contaminant background from potassium and calcium atoms that existed in the spectra. Also, the cross sections for the incident one-electron projectiles were modified due to a correction for the fraction of these ions that becomes fully stripped in passage through the foil. These differences are attributed to the effects of the multiple collisions that occur for the foil targets. The differential cross sections at 90° determined for each of the projectiles interacting with each of the targets are compared with each other and with the previous measurements. To the extent that the cross sections follow a sin2θ dependence, the total cross sections are compared with theoretical calculations [E. A. Mistonova and O. Yu. Andreev, Phys. Rev. A 87, 034702 (2013)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.87.034702], for which the agreement is poor, with the measured cross section exceeding the predicted ones by about an order of magnitude.

Thus, it is necessary to have a powerful simulation model that is able to efficiently and simultaneously solve all coupled energy carriers in a single simulation environment in only one simulation step. As an answer to the de-scribed computational challenges, a unique model for the steady-state analysis of a multi-energy system (MES) using the electrical analogy approach is developed. Detailed electrical equivalent models, developed using the network port theory and the load flow method formulation, of the most important natural gas network elements, as well as of the linking facilities between the power and natural gas systems, are given. The presented models were loaded up into a well-known software for the power system simulation—NEPLAN.

A large part of the emissions and energy consumption corresponds to buildings, both in the residential sector and in the service sector. This means that a large part of the measures taken by governments to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are focused on this sector. With this background, this paper studies energy consumption in city buildings and the CO2 emissions they produce. It only makes use of publicly available data. The analysis is made from the point of view of income per inhabitant, and the results are obtained per inhabitant and household. To facilitate the analysis of the results, an index has been defined. The main contributions of this work are to analyze energy consumption and emissions due to buildings, study them from the point of view of the income of their inhabitants, and consider cities individually. The proposed methodology has been applied to the case of Spain. A total of 145 Spanish cities that have more than 50,000 inhabitants have been studied. The results show that the higher the income, the higher the consumption and emissions. Electricity consumptions are almost inelastic, while those of thermal origin are greatly influenced by the level of income. Regarding CO2 emissions, the percentage of emissions of electrical origin with respect to total emissions is higher than that of thermal origin. In addition, the lower the income, the higher the percentage of emissions of electrical origin. © 2021 by the authors.

The concept is based on the cycle of municipal food waste (MSW) to be used for bioenergy, byproducts and biofuels. In turns, these outputs become new inputs for advanced agriculture. In particular, the project aims to obtain new substrates using organic wastes, to be applied in outdoor green wall farms for food and non-food plants, and biofertilizers to be used in indoor and outdoor farming. Inorganic fertilizers, such as struvite and ammonium sulfate, can be produced during the waste treatments, while organic fertilizers can then be upscaled and engineered to obtain a correct nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in line with plant demands. Water, CO2, energy and hot water, coming from the processes of municipal waste treatments, are valuable inputs to be used in indoor and in vertical farming. In the project, small advanced indoor and vertical unit farms are designed as 'Container Farms', provided of a complete indoor growing facility and a complete outdoor vertical growing surface. These modular units can provide food and an ecosystem service to small communities, inserted in the circularity of the food waste recovery. One prototype of the advanced indoor and vertical farm model, named SmartMIC (modular indoor cultivation), is being built and tested for growing microgreens, herbs, medicinal and aromatic plants and other high value species inside and for growing green walls outside. The prototype serves also to evaluate inputs and outputs cost efficiency of the system. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

To reduce emissions in the EU, a shift from the currently 745,000 operating public buses to electric buses (EBs) is expected in the coming years. Large-scale deployments of EBs and the electrification of bus depots will have a considerable impact on the local electric grid, potentially creating network congestion problems and spikes in the local energy load. In this work, we implement an exact, offline, modular multi-variable mixed-integer linear optimization algorithm to minimize the daily power load profile peak and optimally plan an electric bus depot. The algorithm accepts a bus depot schedule as input, and depending on the user input on optimization conditions, accounts for varying time granularity, preemption of the charging phase, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging capabilities and varying fleet size. The primary objective of this work is the analysis of the impact of each of these input conditions on the resulting minimized peak load. The results show that our optimization algorithm can reduce peak load by 83% on average. Time granularity and V2G have the greatest impact on peak reduction, whereas preemption and fleet splitting have the greatest impact on the computational time but an insignificant impact on peak reduction. The results bear relevance for mobility planners to account for innovative fleet management options. Depot infrastructure costs can be minimized by optimally sizing the infrastructure needs, by relying on split-fleet management or V2G options. © 2021, The Author(s).","Multi-variable optimization; Preemption; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114842385

On the other hand, statistical trends of dry spell occurrences in some areas of the continent are unclear or even negative. Therefore, further research should be directed towards a better understanding of this hazard, particularly the seasonal changes, in order to elaborate adequate strategies to prevent and mitigate its undesirable effects. The main goal of the work, conducted as part of the research strategy on con-temporary climate change, was to confirm the hypothesis of increasing frequency and intensity of droughts during the period of active plant growth and development (May–August) in central Poland in 1961–2020. The prevailing rainfall conditions in this period determine the production and economic effects of agricultural output. The analysis covered a multiannual period, including two separate climate normals: 1961–1990 and 1991–2020. The work is also aimed at detecting relationships between indicators characterizing meteorological drought (the Standardized Precipitation Index—SPI) and agricultural drought (the actual precipitation deficiency—PAdef). It was found that the frequency of meteorological droughts in the studied period amounts to 30.0% (severe and extreme constitute 6.7%). No significant increase in the frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts over time was observed. Relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought indicators were significant, so the SPI can be considered an indicator of plant irrigation needs in the studied area. © 2021 by the authors.

These dust sources can be linked with the large, heavily cultivated cropland areas in this province, which leaves fields vulnerable to wind erosion after the harvest in the winter. For this study, the focus was on the factors that influence the emission from bare, flat surfaces on agricultural lands in this region. The Portable In-Situ Wind Erosion Laboratory (PI-SWERL) was used to measure the emission flux from adjacent crusted and loose surfaces, which was combined with shear strength, moisture, and soil texture measurements. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analyses were used to identify the variable with the highest relevance on the emission flux. On the whole dataset, that the shear strength is the most important variable that controls the emission. This is reflected in the significantly lower emission from the crusted surfaces (0.49 mg m−2 s−1) compared to that of loose surfaces (2.34 mg m−2 s−1). However, for crusted surfaces, the presence of abraders appeared to be the most significant factor in emission, showing a power relationship between the abrader count and the emission flux (R2 = 0.76). In the case of the loose surfaces, the presence of clay and silt was a major influence in emissivity, with a linear relationship between the two variables (R2 = 0.68). This difference in factors depending on the agricultural disturbance, asks for a more holistic approach when predicting emission from such arid cropland areas. © 2021 The Author(s)","Croplands; Dust emission; PI-SWERL; Soil crust; South Africa","agricultural land; dust; particulate matter; pollutant source; sandy soil; soil crust; soil emission; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114829842

In this development, the transition of the heating sector is still in its infancy despite the relatively large share of thermal energy in the total energy consumption. Industrial companies can contribute significantly to reduce CO2 emissions by using waste heat through connecting their industrial energy supply system (IESS) to a district heating system (DHS). This paper focuses on emission reduction potential of an (industrial) heat transfer station (HTS) regarding energy flexibility and sector coupling required for the successful integration of industrial waste heat. To optimize the operating behaviour of the HTS, a data and optimization model is integrated into a digital twin (DT) based on reference architecture model for industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). Within the DT, the information, functional and business layer are modeled. The effects of operating the HTS supported by central modules of the DT are evaluated on one year’s data of an IESS of a real industrial site. The results show a potential operating cost reduction by 6 % for the IESS and increases in profits of 1.3 % for the DHS. Scope 2 emissions can be reduced by 25 % for the IESS and 180 % for the DHS respectively, strongly depending on emission factors and allocation methods. © 2021, The Author(s).","Digital twin; District heating systems; Heat transfer station; Industrial energy supply systems; Optimization; Smart grids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114821351

Despite the large decrease in CO2 emissions, no reduction in the trend in background atmospheric CO2 concentrations has been detected. So, how long would it take for sustained COVID-19 CO2 emission reductions to be detected in daily and monthly averaged local CO2 concentration measurements? CO2 concentration measurements for five measurement sites in the UK and Ireland are combined with meteorological numerical weather prediction data to build statistical models that can predict future CO2 concentrations. It is found that 75% of the observed daily variability can be explained by these simple models. Emission reduction scenario experiments using these simple models illustrate that large daily and seasonal variability in local CO2 concentrations precludes the rapid emergence of a detectable signal. COVID-19 magnitude emissions reductions would only be detectable in the daily CO2 concentrations after at least 38 months and in monthly CO2 concentrations after 11 months of sustained reductions. For monthly CO2 concentrations the time of emergence is similar for all sites since the seasonal variability is largely driven by non-local fluxes of CO2 between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. The COVID-19 CO2 anthropogenic emissions reductions are similar in magnitude to those that are required to meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global temperatures below 2° C. This study demonstrates that, using measurements alone, there will be a considerable lag between changes in global anthropogenic emissions and a detected signal in local CO2 concentration trends. Thus, there is likely to be a delay of several years between changes in policy designed to meet CO2 anthropogenic emissions targets and our ability to detect the impact of these policies on CO2 concentrations using atmospheric measurements alone. © 2021 The Author(s).

This has significant implications for our ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. SDGs 2, 3, 13, 15) and for the design of effective mitigation and adaptation policies and risk management. To be able to achieve the SDG targets, closer integration of climate change and air pollution both in terms of impact assessment for human health and agricultural productivity and respective policy development is needed. Currently, studies estimating the impacts of climate and air pollutants on human health and crops mostly treat these stressors separately, and the methods used by the health and agricultural science communities differ. Better insights into the methods applied in the different communities can help to improve existing and develop new methods to advance our knowledge about the combined impacts of climate change and air pollution on human health and crops. This topical review provides an overview of current methodologies applied in the two fields of human health and agricultural crop impact studies, ranging from empirical regression-based and experimental methods to more complex process-based models. The latter are reasonably well developed for estimating impacts on agricultural crops, but not for health impacts. We review available literature addressing the combined effects of climate and air pollution on human health or agricultural productivity to provide insights regarding state-of-the-art knowledge and currently available methods in the two fields. Challenges to assess the combined effect of climate and air pollution on human health and crops, and opportunities for both fields to learn from each other, are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

In order to balance the supply and demand of power system in integrated energy, it is necessary to establish a scientific model for power load forecasting. Different algorithms for short-term electric load forecasting considering meteorological factors are presented in this paper. The correlation between electric load and meteorological factors is first analyzed. After the principal component analysis (PCA) of meteorological factors and autocorrelation analysis of the electric load, the daily load forecasting model is established by optimal support vector machine (OPT-SVM), Elman neural network (ENN), as well as their combinations through linear weighted average, geometric weighted average, and harmonic weighted average method, respectively. Based on the actual data of an industrial park of Nantong in China, the prediction performance in the four seasons with the different models is evaluated. The main contribution of this paper is to compare the effectiveness of different models for short-term electric load forecasting and to give a guideline to build the proper methods for load forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

This study mainly focused on the forest status during 1999-2019, especially after establishing a wildlife reserve forest and after rehabilitation activity. We used a combination of canopy density model, carbon conversion, and changes of management-related data to analyze land cover classes in two decades of 1999-2009 and 2009-2019 representing the change in status of the area, rehabilitation, and management dynamics through the time. The result shows that at baseline (1999), the status was still production plantation forest dominated by non-forest/open land with the most carbon storage in plantation forest of 5463.04 tons of carbon. In the first decade, important events occurred such as continuing illegal logging until 2001; change of area status to wildlife reserve forest; and initiation of rehabilitation in 2003. There was an increase in non-forest areas during the first decade, and carbon storage decreased mostly in plantation forests with only 867.71 tons of carbon remaining. In the second decade, rehabilitation has shown a positive impact in increasing forested areas, and altered non-forest to the forested area dominated by open forest/mixed agriculture area, followed by plantation forest, and secondary forest. In this decade, the legality of the area status and rehabilitation activity underwent to be more advance. The carbon storage also shows the positive result with the most increase of storage in plantation forest of 4072.932 tons carbon, or almost 4.7 times higher than that in 2009. Total carbon storage in 2019 was 13257.50 tons, or almost three times higher than that in 2009. The rehabilitation required a longer period to achieve a more dense forest condition as in 2019 the area was still dominated by open forest or agriculture. The smallholder farmers and high dependency of the surrounding community manage the land to feed their livestock, impede the rehabilitation and restoration process, and de-escalate the transition from non-forest to forest resulted in the more vegetated area. This result is important for stakeholders for designing appropriate forest-related policies and supporting further rehabilitation strategies. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The transport sector of these countries emitted 23.3% of the total CO2 emissions in 2015. The potential of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) mitigation in the road transport is huge as vehicle technologies keep advancing. Therefore, this study presents mitigating GHG emissions from the road transport of the selected GMS countries using scenario-based analysis. Besides the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, three mitigation scenarios: Alternative Fuel (AF), Modal Shift (MS), and Electric Vehicle (EV) were developed. In addition, each countermeasure scenario is divided into two levels namely, low-ambition and high-ambition levels of GHG mitigation. The Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) model is used to estimate the energy demand and GHG emissions. The findings of the study show that the total GHG emissions in the road transport of the selected GMS countries in 2050 will be reduced by 69.75% in the high EV (EVH) scenario, 26.15% in the high AF (AFH) scenario, and 52.24% in the high MS (MSH) scenario. Results reveal that EVs have a high potential to mitigate GHG emissions in the road transport. Therefore, policymakers should encourage people to shift from conventional vehicles to EVs. In addition, the government should strive to attract EV manufacturers and provide incentives to those firms as well as EV owners. Furthermore, the electricity supply for EVs should come from green energy. © 2021 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

In the context of sustainable development, how to improve land use efficiency (LUE) has become a major challenge on the road to sustainable development in China. Carbon finance provides a new idea for sustainable development. With the help of carbon emissions trading policy (CETP), this paper aims to investigate whether carbon finance can optimize LUE in terms of economic effects and environmental effects. Based on the data of 158 prefectural-level cities in China from 2010 to 2017, this paper uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis to investigate these issues. Specifically, this paper measures the land use efficiency from economic effects (LUE_Eco) and environmental effects (LUE_Env) using the entropy method, and visualizes the data to obtain information on their spatio-temporal evolution patterns. Furthermore, this paper verifies the causal relationship between policy implementation and LUE_Eco and LUE_Env by using the difference in differences (DID) method. The conclusions show that: (1) the levels of LUE_Eco and LUE_Env in the pilot regions generally increase after the implementation of the CETP, but only the increase of LUE_Env is due to the policy implementation; (2) the CETP not only effectively reduces CO2 emissions, but also promotes the reduction of industrial ‘three wastes’ emissions. Accordingly, this paper has gained insights on how to improve LUE in China. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on 5796 cases of environmental complaints lodged by citizens via hotline and the internet to the MEP of China, we examined the spatial characteristics and influencing factors of citizen complaints for the period of 2013–2017 using spatial analysis methods and spatial econometric models. The roles of citizen complaints in the two systems were then reevaluated. The results show that, among all cases, 75.88% of cases were identified as verified complaints, while nearly a 25% noisy rate directed large amounts of inspection resources to be utilized in response to nonverified cases. Air pollution received the most attention by citizens in China, accounting for 67.22% of total cases. The hotspots of citizen complaints were mostly distributed in the three major national urban agglomerations in China. We found that industrial wastewater and SO2 were positively associated with the likelihood of citizens filing complaints, while the effect of industrial soot/dust emission was insignificant. Citizen complaints might be triggered by certain, but not all, forms of pollutants, even though highly visible particulate pollutants did not necessarily induce corresponding complaints. Moreover, the negative relationship between citizen complaints and per capita GDP revealed the unbalanced geographical pattern between economical development and environmental quality. The proliferation of the internet greatly facilitated citizens lodging complaints through various ways. The synergy mechanism between citizen environmental complaints and other parts in China’s environmental monitoring and governance system should be established in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The World Bank estimates that the AfCFTA could lift tens of millions of people out of poverty by 2035. Previous studies have shown that an increase in annual mean temperature can significantly affect economic growth. The AfCFTA economy will therefore be affected by future warming. However, without the AfCFTA, the impact of the increased annual average temperature on local economies could be severe, further depriving low-income African countries of economic recovery. To assess the damage to regional economic growth caused by future warming, trend analyses are conducted in the aggregated historical CFSR/NCEP and CMIP6 (GFDL-ESM4) climate projection data from 1979 to 2100 for different emission pathways over some major continental economic centres. The long-term impact of surface temperature increase on gross regional product (GRP) per capita growth rates are investigated by fitting CMIP6 daily and annual mean temperatures to a log-polynomial regression model. The results show that an increase in annual mean temperature will significantly affect the economic growth of low latitude and altitude regions compared to high latitude and altitude regions. Most emerging African economies and many member states of the African Union and AfCFTA are located in this low latitude zone. This makes the economies of the newly created AfCFTA very vulnerable to climate change. Several studies suggest that FTAs can help reduce the economic vulnerability of developing countries. The results presented here can contribute to better design and implementation of economic, trade and climate policies in the AfCFTA to mitigate the economic impacts of future warming. © 2021 The Author(s).

For example, modern centralized conventional fossil fuel power generation commonly adds DG using renewable energy resources to the grid. Therefore, in these changes, it is necessary to optimize renewable energy systems to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions. In previous studies, meta-heuristic algorithms were used to optimize DG location and capacity, but different types of DG systems and integrated energy hub conditions were not considered. Determining the most effective DG type for an integrated energy hub is critical. Accordingly, this study presented a methodology for selecting the most cost-efficient DG for metropolitan residential customers of energy hubs. In this paper, we model energy hubs for residential customers and the most cost-efficient DG type using MATLAB and HOMER software, considering microturbine (MT), photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, and fuel cell (FC) power sources. For this purpose, the energy hub was modeled as a combined cooling heat and power (CCHP) system and selected a specific metropolitan area as a testbed (Atlanta, USA). For practical simulation, the total active power of the Atlanta community was measured by multiplying the average load profile data of residential houses collected by open energy information (OpenEI). The first case study showed that optimal-blast MTs without absorption chillers (AbCs) were the most cost-efficient compared to other optimal-blast DG systems without AbCs. Additional second case studies for optimal and full-blast MTs with AbCs were performed to verify the results for energy consumption, costs, and emissions savings.

To reduce GHG emissions, besides minimizing waste heat production at the source, an integrated approach should be adopted for waste heat management, namely, waste heat collection and recycling. One solution to enable waste heat capture and conversion into useful energy forms (e.g., electricity) is employing solid-state energy converters, such as thermoelectric generators (TEGs). The simplicity of thermoelectric generators enables them to be applied in various industries, specifically those that generate heat as the primary waste product at a temperature of several hundred degrees. Nevertheless, thermoelectric generators can be used over a broad range of temperatures for various applications; for example, at low temperatures for human body heat harvesting, at mid-temperature for automobile exhaust recovery systems, and at high temperatures for cement industries, concentrated solar heat exchangers, or NASA exploration rovers. We present the trends in the development of thermoelectric devices used for thermal management and waste heat recovery. In addition, a brief account is presented on the scientific development of TE materials with the various approaches implemented to improve the conversion efficiency of thermoelectric compounds through manipulation of Figure of Merit, a unitless factor indicative of TE conversion efficiency. Finally, as a case study, work on waste heat recovery from rotary cement kiln reactors is evaluated and discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

The measurement methodology and mandatory information content of disclosures are yet to be decided for corporate CO2 reporting by EU regulators and standard-setting organisations. In our study, we reviewed the sustainability reports of three leading German automotive groups by revenue for the period 2016–2020 as a case study. The research methodology was carried out with text-mining-aided content analysis to provide a collection of sustainability standards (GRI and SASB) in the evaluation of emissions reporting. As an addition to prior literature, conditions of relevance and clarity regarding published information were introduced in the evaluation process of compliance to CO2 disclosures. Companies by reporting practice were assigned to different stages of carbon management and actual emissions were evaluated. In the conclusions, discussion of the reliability of reported sustainability information, the applicability of digital reporting is provided through regional perspectives. We found that although analytical methods are available to assess the level of corporate carbon management, their usefulness is limited if the data are not reliable.

PEPC participates in photosynthesis by catalyzing the initial fixation of atmospheric CO2 and is abundant in both C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism leaves. PEPC is differentially expressed at different stages of plant development, mostly in leaves, but also in developing seeds. PEPC is known to show tissue-specific distribution in leaves and in other plant organs, such as roots, stems, and flowers. Plant PEPC undergoes reversible phosphorylation and monoubiquitination, which are posttranslational modifications playing important roles in regulatory processes and in protein localization. Phosphorylation activates the PEPC enzyme, making it more sensitive to glucose-6-phosphate and less sensitive to malate or aspartate. PEPC phosphorylation is known to be diurnally regulated and delicately changed in response to various environmental stimuli, in addition to light. PEPCs belong to a small gene family encoding several plant-type and distantly related bacterial-type PEPCs. This paper provides a minireview of the general information on PEPCs in both C4 and C3 plants. © 2021 by the authors.

How-ever, water-intensive grasslands and woodlands could form dry soil layers in the arid or semi-arid zones. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a management method to solve this pedological prob-lem. In this study, based on the Environment Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, the crop productivity and soil dry layer was predicted from 2018 to 2038 in alfalfa and apple land. Then, conservation agriculture and conventional tillage systems were used to repair the soil dry layer in apple and alfalfa systems from 2039–2050 in order to explore their potential. Model verification showed that EPIC simulations of yield, ET, and SWC were generally reliable. The predicted results showed that soil drought was more intense in alfalfa systems. Alfalfa’s annual decrease rate and total amount in the soil available water (SAW) were 27.31 mm year−1 and 652.76 mm, higher than 13.62 mm year−1 and 476 mm of the apple system, and the DSLT of apple’s system was thicker, but DSL-SWC was higher than alfalfa. In the recovery process, the restoration degree of soil desiccation in conservation agriculture was significantly higher than in conventional tillage systems (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the recovery effect increased with the increase of planting times of shallow root crops, such as potato and soybean. The recovery rate was 27.1 ± 1.72 mm year−1, DSLT was 750 ± 51.2 cm in conventional tillage systems, and the recovery rate was 44.7 ± 1.99 mm year−1, DSLT was 258.3 ± 74.9 cm in conservation agriculture systems. This study provides an effective farmland management method to alleviate soil desiccation and further reveals the new role of the Epic Model in future drought assessment. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, this research presents a 48V mild-hybrid technology feasibility study to reduce vehicle fuel consumption to achieve the ASEAN roadmap 2025 target as the automotive industry worldwide moves toward energy-efficient vehicles in the future. The research aims to design and develop a 1-D full vehicle model equipped with a 48V belted alternator starter (BAS) as a mild-hybrid solution and understanding the impact on overall vehicle fuel consumption in the drive cycle. This research's vehicle model is a mid-sized sedan powered by a 1.8L engine coupled to a 6-Speed Automatic Transmission (6AT). The baseline vehicle model is developed using industrial vehicle simulation software. The results have been compared and correlated with actual vehicle measurements. The models with and without the BAS system are then reviewed in a few aspects related to fuel consumption, according to NEDC and WLTP drive cycles. Implementing mild-hybrid systems is expected to reduce the overall vehicle fuel consumption by approximately 7.3% in NEDC and 3.5% in WLTP. The fuel consumption assessment of both drive cycles has proven that the BAS system's implementation could reduce fuel consumption. The research's significant findings are valuables for further development in strategizing the hybrid technologies and its control strategy in supporting low carbon footprint initiatives by the local authority and ASEAN roadmap. © 2021 Seventh Sense Research Group®.","Belted alternator starter; Fuel consumption; Mild-hybrid; NEDC; WLTP",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114711057

This study focused on mapping the wind potential of southern coastal areas of Bangladesh to estimate the wind energy potential, along with the reduction in carbon emissions due to wind energy. Analysis of the carbon footprint was based on the annual energy production (AEP) from the selected low-wind turbine generators (WTGs). The time series-measured and-predicted wind data were incorporated with the high-resolution mesoscale and microscale wind re-source mapping technique at 60, 80, and 100 m above ground level (AGL). Coupling mesoscale and microscale modeling provided reliable mapping results for the commercially exploitable wind resource and was verified by ground-based wind measurement. The results revealed that, among the selected areas, two sites named Charfashion and Monpura have a promising annual mean wind speed of 7.3 m/s at 100 m AGL for energy generation. Different WTGs with ranges of 1–3.3 MW were used to estimate the wind energy generation capacity at different sites in the study area. A WTG with a 1 MW wind energy generation capacity installed at 60 m AGL in the selected site has the potential to produce 2.79 GWh/year of clean energy, reducing 1781.689 tons of CO2 per year, whereas a 3.3 MW WTG at 80 m AGL can produce 18.99 GWh/year of energy, reducing 12,098.54 tons of CO2 per year, and a 1.6 MW WTG at 100 m AGL produces 11.04 GWh/year of energy, cutting 7035.028 tons of CO2 per year. With its reliable scientific and time-tested wind energy estimation method, this research is very important for the development of wind energy in the southern coastal areas of Bangladesh to meet the increasing energy demands through initiating the development of renewable energy to improve the energy security and reduce the carbon emissions of the country. © 2021 by the authors.

Macadamia is one of Malawi’s most important and profitable crop species; however, climate change threatens its production. Thus, this study’s objective is to quantitatively examine the potential impacts of climate change on the climate suitability for macadamia in Malawi. We utilized an ensemble model approach to predict the current and future (2050s) suitability of macadamia under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We achieved a good model fit in determining suitability classes for macadamia (AUC = 0.9). The climatic variables that strongly influence macadamia’s climatic suitability in Malawi are suggested to be the precipitation of the driest month (29.1%) and isothermality (17.3%). Under current climatic conditions, 57% (53,925 km2) of Malawi is climatically suitable for macadamia. Future projections suggest that climate change will decrease the suitable areas for macadamia by 18% (17,015 km2) and 21.6% (20,414 km2) based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, with the distribution of suitability shifting northwards in the 2050s. The southern and central regions of the country will suffer the greatest losses (≥ 8%), while the northern region will be the least impacted (4%). We conclude that our study provides critical evidence that climate change will reduce the suitable areas for macadamia production in Malawi, depending on climate drivers. Therefore area-specific adaptation strategies are required to build resilience among producers. © 2021 Zuza et al.

Many human settlement products report exceptional detection accuracies above 85%, but there is a substantial blind spot in that product validation typically focuses on large urban areas and excludes rural, small-scale settlements that are home to 3.4 billion people around the world. In this study, we make use of a data-rich sample of 30 refugee settlements in Uganda to assess the small-scale settlement detection by four human settlement products, namely, Geo-Referenced Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development settlement extent data (GRID3-SE), Global Human Settlements Built-Up Sentinel-2 (GHS-BUILT-S2), High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) and World Settlement Footprint (WSF). We measured each product’s areal coverage within refugee settlement boundaries, assessed detection of 317,416 building footprints and examined spatial agreement among products. For settlements established before 2016, products had low median probability of detection and F1-score of 0.26 and 0.24, respectively, a high median false alarm rate of 0.59 and tended to only agree in regions with the highest building density. Individually, GRID3-SE offered more than five-fold the coverage of other products, GHS-BUILT-S2 underestimated the building footprint area by a median 50% and HRSL slightly underestimated the footprint area by a median 7%, while WSF entirely overlooked 8 of the 30 study refugee settle-ments. The variable rates of coverage and detection partly result from GRID3-SE and HRSL being based on much higher resolution imagery, compared to GHS-BUILT-S2 and WSF. Earlier established settlements were generally better detected than recently established settlements, showing that the timing of satellite image acquisition with respect to refugee settlement establishment also influenced detection results. Nonetheless, settlements established in the 1960s and 1980s were inconsistently detected by settlement products.

The change in the conditions under which agriculture is practiced has various effects on the agricultural economy but also on the social structure of rural areas. Climate change has multiple effects on agricultural production, necessitating the reorganization of agricultural production in some cases. These effects of climate change will also impact the economic and social aspects of farms in rural areas. This paper attempts to identify these effects by measuring the socioeconomic impacts of climate change in the region of Central Macedonia in Greece. For this reason, a multicriteria model was developed to simulate these impacts by estimating a set of seven social and economic indicators. The model was implemented to the average farm which was estimated from the main cultivations of the region. A scenario analysis was also used in combination with the multicriteria model. The multicriteria model suggests modifications are needed in the average farm crop plan of the region as a result of the climate change impact. The scenarios results show that climate change will negatively affect all the social and economic indicators and will continue to affect them over the years. These results can be used by policymakers to understand the economic and social impacts of climate change in the region to plan their future policies. © 2021 by the authors.

Various technologies have been developed to satisfy these needs. In this paper, a composite scrubber for ships that can simultaneously reduce sulfur oxide and noise was proposed, and the flow characteristics and noise characteristics were analyzed. For the silencer, vane type and resonate type were applied. In the case of the vane type, the effects of the direction, size, and location of the vane were analyzed, and in the case of the resonate type, the effects of the hole location and the number of holes were analyzed. The result shows that the length increase of the vane increased the average transmission loss and had a great effect, especially in the low frequency region. The transmission loss increased when the vane was installed outside, and the noise reduction effect was excellent when the vane was in the reverse direction. In the resonate type, increasing the number of holes is advantageous for noise reduction. The condition for maximally reducing noise in the range not exceeding 840 Pa, which is 70% of the allowable back pressure, is a vane length of 225 mm in the outer vane reverse type. The pressure drop under this condition was 777 Pa, and the average transmission losses in the low frequency region and the entire frequency region were 43.5 and 54.5 dB, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we study the changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown in Medellín and its metropolitan area, Colombia, for periods with and without enhanced regional fire activity, considering the effects of meteorology using random forest and multiple linear regression methods. The lockdown measures, which reduced mean traffic volume by 70% compared to 2016–2019, resulted in reductions for PM2.5 (50–63%), PM10 (59–64%), NO (75–76%), NO2 (43–47%), and CO (40–47%), while O3 concentration increased by 19–22%. In contrast, when fire activity was high, the effects of the lockdown on air quality were shadowed by the long-range transport of biomass burning emissions, increasing fine particulate matter and ozone. This study shows that healthier levels are achievable through significant efforts from decision-makers and society. The results highlight the need to develop integral measures that do not only consider reductions in the local emissions from transportation and industry, but also the role of fire activity in the region, as well as the difficulties of achieving reductions in ozone from measures that are effective at reducing primary pollutants. © 2021 by the authors.

However, this involves extracellular enzymes that require energy from ATP, so the process depends on the microbes’ physiological state and soil P availability. To elucidate the key relationships we compared P acquisition processes in P-poor soil (Cambisol) and links between C:P stoichiometry, enzyme activity, and ATP with microbial communities in contrasting activity states (dormancy, growth followed by starvation and gradually activated, respectively induced by no, single large (50 μg C g−1 soil) and multiple low (five days of 10 μg C g−1 soil day−1) additions of glucose as a carbon (C) source). A sole P input, without C addition, almost doubled microbial C (Cmic) contents, maintained stable phosphatase activity at 36 nmol h−1 per nmol ATP and raised microbial P (Pmic) 2.7-fold. In contrast, sole glucose addition increased Pmic by only 8%, confirming that P-limitation was much stronger than C limitation. Only 5–10 % of P potentially mineralized by phosphatase was recovered as microbial P. Cmic:Pmic ratios in microbial biomass &lt;200 and &gt;350 respectively reflected C starvation and strong P starvation. The ATP was a suitable predictor of microbial biomass in soil lacking fresh substrate, but weak predictor of microbial biomass after substrate input. Structural equation models revealed contrasting strategies of P utilization depending on microbial activity state. Dormant microorganisms (without glucose addition) invested most P to ATP production. In contrast, following substrate addition P-limited microorganisms accelerated phosphatase production, and hence capacity to mine P in organic sources. Thus, the P utilization/acquisition strategies depended on C accessibility and were modulated by P availability. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","ATP; Enzyme activity; Microbial biomass; Molar microbial C:P stoichiometry; P fertilization; Structural equation modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114679800

The MOMOS (microorganisms and organic matter of soils) model integrates simplified descriptions of photosynthesis (origin of organic C in soil), N microbial exchange (soil origin for N), N fixation (atmospheric origin for N), and plant growth with an organic matter decomposition core that has the soil microbial community at its center. This work provides estimates of the exchange parameters between plant organs and microbes, which were compared to literature data when available. In a connection with photosynthesized C, the root demand for inorganic N can be adjusted by its microbial production. Our approach is a new methodology for improving plant production, by optimizing the interactions with soil microorganisms. Additionally, the coupling of plant growth and microbial processes enabled determining changes of the organic compartments of soil. In the unfertilized limestone soil of this study, sequestration was found to be located in the labile microbial metabolites for one year, then significantly transferred to stable humus during 6-year intercropping.

Mexico makes an interesting case study because it shows how difficult it is to reduce fossil energy dependence despite geographic and climatic conditions that favour renewable energy deployment and use. Resolving path dependencies and the related carbon lock-in are key to Mexico’s sustainable energy transition. This applied teaching guide contemplates the use of a case-illustration typology to identify and discuss how the politics about carbon lock-in affects Mexico’s sustainable energy transition. This methodology is an innovative endeavour that aims to apply the case study in classrooms with the intention to encourage discussions and solution-oriented approaches when tangible actions are identified by the educator and students. This methodology elevates the case study to a “living” case study that leads to recommended actions. The applied teaching guide allows educators, who are mostly researchers, to reflect on how Mexico’s case study could be explained not only to promote the students’ understanding of the challenges, but also to provide educators/researchers the skills on how to effectively disseminate knowledge. Mexico’s carbon lock-in involves oil and oil-run power plants that are costly to build but relatively inexpensive to operate. To conclude, this case study identifies potential entry points for transitioning towards sustainable energy in Mexico—resources that can promote the use of clean energy despite carbon lock-in. For example, focusing on electrification— particularly the carbon-intensive sectors—can help Mexico transit towards sustainable energy despite institutional constraints. Complementing this case study is a teaching guide with recommendations for using Mexico’s energy transition in courses on sustainability. By understanding how to explain the case study, the educator/researcher can better structure the complexity of the case study. This approach introduces a “learning activation framework” to identify emerging opportunities that can advance sustainable energy transitions in different cases of carbon lock-in. The framework also gives students a chance to help dismantle or cope with carbon lock-ins. Mexico’s energy transition makes a valuable teaching example because its energy transition is part of a broader developmental goal. This teaching guide’s systematic approach can maximise the students’ learning experience. © 2021 by the authors.

Areas especially impacted are Australia, the Amazon, and western United States. The common factors at these locations are a dry environment and brush or forests fueling the fires once they start. As the climate continues to change, less moisture is present in the ground in these areas. This proliferates the susceptibility to wildfire. Prevention methods for inhibiting wildfires include reducing our carbon footprint, using care around campfires and other causes of wildfire, as well as routine thinning and removal of excess vegetation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a link between Climate Change and the extraordinary magnitude, intensity, and frequency of recent wildfires.

The outbreak has been a one-of-a-kind situation unlike anything seen in the last one hundred years. As a result of various measures put in place by governments, travel was vastly reduced, and air travel diminished to near zero. Consumption and the price of fossil fuels decreased significantly and hundreds of millions of metric tons of CO2 emissions were prevented. The impact of Covid-19 on the worldwide energy industry and greenhouse gas emissions has been drastic but seemingly temporary. In 2020, wildfires in western United States more than made up for the reduction in global emissions in the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic. Renewable energy has made major advances recently, but fossil fuels still supply 84% of the global energy. Advancements in aircraft efficiency and extensive utilization of electric vehicles charged with renewable sources of electricity offer remarkable opportunities for improving our environment. Without major changes in the energy and transportation industries, greenhouse gas emissions are likely to return to their 2019 levels before long. © 2021, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Some studies also reported a further amplified rate of climate warming at high elevations; namely, the elevation dependency of climate change. This elevation-dependent climate change could have important implications for the fate of glaciers and ecosystems at high elevations under climate change. However, the lack of long-term climate data at high elevations, especially in the Arctic, has hindered the investigation of this question. Because of the linkage between climate warming and plant phenology changes and remote sensing’s ability to detect the latter, remote sensing provides an alternative way for investigating the elevation dependency of climate change over Arctic mountains. This study investigated the elevation-dependent changes to plant phenology using AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) time series from 1985 to 2013 over five study areas in Canada’s Arctic. We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) became earlier faster with an increasing elevation over mountainous study areas (i.e., Sirmilik, the Torngat Mountains, and Ivvavik National Parks). Similarly, the changes rates in the end of growing season (EOS) and the growing season length (GSL) were also higher at high elevations. One exception was SOS in the Ivvavik National Park: “no warming trend” with the May-June temperature at a nearby climate station decreased slightly during 1985–2013, and so no elevation-dependent amplification. © 2021 by the authors.

However, their development into cities is generally limited by a high initial investment cost. The development of optimization methods intended to draft efficient systems using heating consumption profiles into a prescribed geographic area are useful in this purpose. Such tools are already referred to in the scientific literatureyet they are often restricted to limit the computational load. To bridge this gap, the present contribution proposes a multi-period mixed integer linear programming model for the optimal outline and sizing of a district heating network maximizing the net cash flow based on a geographic information system. This methodology targets a large range of problem sizes from small-scale to largescale heating networks while guaranteeing numerical robustness. For sake of simplicity, the developed model is first applied to a scaled down case study with 3 available heating sources and a neighborhood of 16 streets. The full-scale model is presented afterwards to demonstrate the applicability of the tool for city-scale heating networks with around 2000 streets to potentially connecwithin a reasonable computational time of around only one hour. © 2021 by the authors.

Although source controls are the most effective approaches for improving air quality and reducing health risks, individuals can also take actions to reduce their personal exposure by staying indoors, reducing physical activity, altering modes of transportation, filtering indoor air, and using respirators and other types of face masks. A synthesis of available evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness, and potential adverse effects or unintended consequences of personal interventions for air pollution is needed by clinicians to assist patients and the public in making informed decisions about use of these interventions. To address this need, the American Thoracic Society convened a workshop in May of 2018 to bring together a multidisciplinary group of international experts to review the current state of knowledge about personal interventions for air pollution and important considerations when helping patients and the general public to make decisions about how best to protect themselves. From these discussions, recommendations were made regarding when, where, how, and for whom to consider personal interventions. In addition to the efficacy and safety of the various interventions, the committee considered evidence regarding the identification of patients at greatest risk, the reliability of air quality indices, the communication challenges, and the ethical and equity considerations that arise when discussing personal interventions to reduce exposure and risk from outdoor air pollution.

While very simple structures are adopted in mild winter climatic conditions, high technology greenhouses are used in Northern countries and where the environmental control is more demanding due to outdoor climate and demand of the market for high-quality produce. The greenhouse technology, climate control management, production technologies and strategies to improve resource use efficiency in the greenhouses have been advancing significantly. Greenhouse climate control worldwide has received much attention during the past decade for extension of growing season and increasing the yield and quality with more emphasis on resource use efficiency. Particularly, heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting systems are more advanced, both plant focused and data centric to optimize the crop production and help growers to make improved management decisions. In addition, the growing systems and techniques involved in soilless growing enable food production in urban and peri-urban areas and/or in intensive commercial production. In this paper, recent trends and developments in greenhouse technology (i.e., design, covering material), climate control strategies (i.e., heating, cooling, artificial lighting) and production technologies (i.e., vertical systems, biostimulant use) are discussed. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

However, the response to even higher doses is not clear. First, to investigate the effects of high-dose radiation on the locomotion of C. elegans, we investigated the dose range that reduces whole-body locomotion or leads to death. Irradiation was performed in the range of 0–6 kGy. In the crawling analysis, motility decreased after irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to 6 kGy of radiation affected crawling on agar immediately and caused the complete loss of motility. Both γ-rays and carbon-ion beams significantly reduced crawling motility at 3 kGy. Next, swimming in buffer was measured as a motility index to assess the response over time after irradiation and motility similarly decreased. However, swimming partially recovered 6 hours after irradiation with 3 kGy of γ-rays. To examine the possibility of a recovery mechanism, in situ GFP reporter assay of the autophagy-related gene lgg-1 was performed. The fluorescence intensity was stronger in the anterior half of the body 7 h after irradiation with 3 kGy of γ-rays. GFP::LGG-1 induction was observed in the pharynx, neurons along the body, and the intestine. Furthermore, worms were exposed to region-specific radiation with carbon-ion microbeams and the trajectory of crawling was measured by image processing. Motility was lower after anterior-half body irradiation than after posterior-half body irradiation. This further supported that the anterior half of the body is important in the locomotory response to radiation. © 2021 by the authors.

The use of fossil energy emits CO2, e.g. by heating greenhouses, and nitrous oxides through the application of nitrogen fertilizers. This will backfire with unfavorable temperature changes expressed in global warming and increased occurrence of extreme weather events. As a consequence, higher temperatures and heat periods could have dramatic effects on product quality in terms of marketable yield, e.g. fruit size and physiological disorders, such as blossom-end rot in fruiting greenhouse vegetables. Protected cultivation that includes mini- and walk tunnels, plastic-, glass-, and screenhouses could be an adaptation tool to climate changes due to the modification of microclimate conditions within the cultivation area. However, clean technologies in terms of energy consumption, cladding manufacturing as well as cultivation practices are required. Generally, we are speaking for climate-smart agriculture, but what does it mean for protected cultivation? Here we present some smart solutions that can mitigate climate change by reducing emissions during the whole production chain of greenhouse vegetables as well as provide protection against adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. The smart systems used in the greenhouse could be divided into systems that are aiming to control the energy, chemicals and water inputs. Concerning the energy inputs, several decision support systems have been recently developed to aid in a smart greenhouse climate control. When these systems are combined with the recently developed greenhouse climate control equipment (energy, shading and insect-proof screens, novel covering materials, microclimate and crop sensors) and concepts such as the closed or semi-closed greenhouses lead to lower energy needs and gas emissions and lower impact of the outside to greenhouse climate. For water and nutrients inputs in greenhouses, the use of soilless cultivations, soil moisture and substrate water content sensors and relevant technologies may lead to high reductions of inputs to and effluents from the greenhouse. Several models and decision support systems have been developed that could be effective for optimizing water and fertilizer management.

Emission regulations are becoming increasingly tight, and governments have been allocating multiple funds to facilitate the spreading of the so-called green mobility. In this context, steering towards electrified solutions not only for passenger vehicles, but also for compact off-highway vehicles extensively employed, for instance, on construction sites located in urban areas, warehouses, and greenhouses, is essential even if seldom considered. Moreover, the electrification of compact offhighway machinery may allow manufacturers to increase their expertise in and lower the costs of these alternative solutions, while gathering useful data to be applied in bigger and more remunerative off-highway vehicles. In fact, while electric automobiles are as of now real alternatives for buyers, off-highway vehicles, regardless of the application, are mostly in the research and experimental phase, with few of them already on the market. This delay, in comparison with the passenger automotive industry, is caused by different factors, mostly related to the different tasks of off-highway vehicles in terms of duty cycles, productivity performance parameters and user acceptability. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the many aspects of the electrification of compact off-highway vehicles, to highlight the key differences between on-highway and off-highway vehicles and to summarize in a single source of information the multiple solutions investigated by researchers and manufacturers. © 2021 by the authors.

Existing evidence suggests an urgent need for polycentric and transformative approaches, as global and local systems have come under strain. This study conducted a systematic literature review at the global level to assess the progress made towards achieving a circular economy between 2010 and 2020, a period covering the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the initial five years of their implementation. The focus was on the potential of improved water and energy use efficiency, linking them to food production within the context of a circular economy. Identifying successes, opportunities, challenges, and pathways towards a circular economy from the literature review facilitated developing a conceptual framework to guide strategic policy formulations towards a more sustainable economy. A combination of transformative approaches is analysed in an integrated way in response to the 2030 global agenda on sustainable development. Thus, the study is informed by the initiatives to attain SDGs and mitigating negative environmental impacts due to waste and pollution. The premise is to enhance transformational change as a catalyst for employment creation and the attainment of a green economy while reducing waste. Transformative approaches have been identified to provide pathways towards global climate targets and protection of the environment from further degradation. They are a catalyst to achieve SDG 12 on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

In this way, Fondillón production is based on rain-based vineyards, over-ripe Monastrell grapes, and non-alcohol fortification. Thus, Fondillón is a naturally sweet red wine, protected within the Alicante Denomination of Origin, recognized by the European Union in its E-bachus database. The study aim was to evaluate the effect of the aging (solera factor) on Fondillón: (i) basic enological parameters (e.g., total, and volatile acidity), (ii) chromatic characteristics, (iii) antioxidant activity (ABTS•+, FRAP and DPPH• ), (iv) total contents of condensed tannins and anthocyanins, (v) volatile composition, (vi) sensory profile, and (vii) overall liking. Experimental data proved that the wine (1960 solera) with the highest total contents of condensed tannins and anthocyanins and total antioxidant activity was the most liked by Spanish consumers. Experimental results clearly established a positive relationship among Fondillón chemical composition, its antioxidant activity, and overall consumer liking. Exceptional harvest with grapes having extremely high antioxidant power (e.g., 1960 solera) will result, even more than 50 years later, in high quality wines with high consumer acceptance and a high monetary worth. © 2021 by the authors.

In 2020, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic, which led to severe nationwide blockade measures, unexpectedly provided a valuable opportunity to study the synergistic reduction in greenhouse gases and polluting gases. This paper uses a combination of NO2, O3, and CO2 column concentration products from different satellites and surface concentrations from ground-based stations to investigate potential correlations between these monitoring indicators in four Chinese representative cities. We found that XCO2 decreased in March to varying degrees in different cities. It was witnessed that the largest decrease in CO2, −1.12 ppm, occurred in Wuhan, i.e., the first epicenter of COVID-19. We also analyzed the effects of NO2 and O3 concentrations on changes in XCO2 . First, in 2020, we used a top-down approach to obtain the conclusion that the change amplitude of NO2 concentration in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan were −24%, −18%, −4%, and −39%, respectively. Furthermore, the O3 concentration increments were 5%, 14%, 12%, and 14%. Second, we used a bottom-up approach to obtain the conclusion that the monthly averaged NO2 concentrations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan in March had the largest changes, changing to −39%, −40%, and −61%, respectively. The corresponding amounts of changes in monthly averaged O3 concentrations were −14%, −2%, and 9%. However, the largest amount of change in monthly averaged NO2 concentration in Guangzhou was found in December 2020, with a value of −40%. The change in O3 concentration was −12% in December. Finally, we analyzed the relationship of NO2 and O3 concentrations with XCO2 . Moreover, the results show that the effect of NO2 concentration on XCO2 is positively correlated from the point of the satellite (R = 0.4912) and the point of the ground monitoring stations (R = 0.3928). Surprisingly, we found a positive (in satellite observations and R = 0.2391) and negative correlation (in ground monitoring stations and R = 0.3333) between XCO2 and the O3 concentrations. During the epidemic period, some scholars based on model analysis found that Wuhan’s carbon emissions decreased by 16.2% on average. Combined with satellite data, we estimate that Wuhan’s XCO2 fell by about 1.12 ppm in February. At last, the government should consider reducing XCO2 and NO2 concentration at the same time to make a synergistic reduction. © 2021 by the authors.

The absolute biases, pattern correlation, the reduction of variance (RV) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI at 3-, 6-and 12-month aggregate periods) techniques were used to evaluate the climate model simulations. The result, in general, shows each climate model has a skill in reproducing at least one of the climatic indices considered in this study. Based on the pattern correlation result, however, EC-EARTH.HIRHAM5 and MPIESM-LR.CRCM5-UQAM RCMs showed a relatively good skill in reproducing the observed climatic indices as compared to the other climate model simulations. EC-EARTH.RCA4, CanESM2.RCA4 and MPI-ESM-LR.CRCM5-UQAM RCMs showed a good skill when evaluated using the reduction of variance. The ensemble mean of the RCMs showed relatively better skill in reproducing the observed temperature-based climatic indices as compared to the precipitation-based climatic indices. There were no exceptional differences observed among the performance of the climate models compared to the SPEI, but CanESM2.CRCM5-UQAM, EC-EARTH.RCA4 and the ensemble mean of the RCMs performed relatively good in comparison to the other climate models. The good performance of some of the RCMs has good implications for their potential application for climate change impact studies and future trend analysis of extreme events. They could help in developing an early warning system to mitigate and prepare for possible future impacts of climate extremes (e.g., drought) and vulnerability to climate change across Florida. © 2021 by the authors.

We refined a generalized additive model for selecting thresholds with substantial health risk enhancement, based on Taiwan population records of 2000–2017, considering lag effects and different spatial scales. Reference-adjusted risk ratio (RaRR) is proposed, defined as the ratio between the relative risk of an essential health outcome for a threshold candidate against that for a reference; the threshold with the highest RaRR is potentially the optimal one. It was found that the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a more sensitive heat-health indicator than temperature. At lag 0, the highest RaRR (1.66) with WBGT occurred in emergency visits of children, while that in hospital visits occurred for the working-age group (1.19), presumably due to high exposure while engaging in outdoor activities. For most sex, age, and sub-region categories, the RaRRs of emergency visits were higher than those of hospital visits and all-cause mortality; thus, emergency visits should be employed (if available) to select heat-warning thresholds. This work demonstrates the applicability of this method to facilitate the establishment of heat-warning systems at city or country scales by authorities worldwide. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, decoupling analysis is important to keep a high pace of economic growth while reducing carbon emission and its carbon footprint. Taking the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration in China as a case, this paper examined the changes in carbon footprint and carbon footprint pressure by incorporating land resource limits. On this basis, we further analyzed the decoupling relationships between carbon footprint, carbon footprint pressure and economic growth. The GeoDetector was also employed to detect the spatial heterogeneity of the carbon footprint pressure. The results showed that despite the decrease of carbon emissions from 2011 to 2019 in the YRD, carbon footprint pressure still revealed an increased trend in this period. As to the decoupling relationships between carbon footprint, carbon footprint pressure and economic growth, they were improved in most of the cities in the YRD, changing from expansive coupling to weak decoupling to strong decoupling. However, the descending trend of decoupling elasticity coefficient for carbon footprint pressure is smaller than that of the carbon footprint. This result could be explained by the fact that not only carbon emission but also carbon sequestration (by productive lands including forests and grasslands) pose large impacts on carbon footprint pressure.

Based on the stress–strain curve and IET function, the loading process of the sample is divided into five stages: crack closure, linear elastic deformation, microcrack generation and development, macroscopic fracture generation and energy surge, and post-peak failure. The evolution trend and fracture evolution law of the acoustic emission signal event interval function in different stages are analyzed. In particular, the signals with an amplitude greater than 85 dB, a peak frequency greater than 350 kHz, and a frequency centroid greater than 275 kHz are defined as the failure precursor signals before the rock reaches the peak stress. The defined precursor signal conditions agree well with the experimental results. The time–frequency analysis and wavelet packet decomposition of the precursor signal are performed on the extracted characteristic signal of the failure precursor. The results show that the time-domain signal is in the form of a continuous waveform, and the frequency-domain waveform has multi-peak coexistence that is mainly concentrated in the high-frequency region. The energy distribution obtained by the wavelet packet decomposition of the characteristic signal is verified with the frequency-domain waveform. The energy distribution of the signal is mainly concentrated in the 343.75–375 kHz frequency band, followed by the 281.25–312.5 kHz frequency band. The energy proportion of the high-frequency signal increases with the confining pressure. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on a study of the sedimentary proxies of Balkhash Lake, Central Asia’s largest lake, changes in the organic carbon sequestration in the lake sediments and their possible influence over the past 150 years were studied. The results suggested that the organic carbon in the sediments of Lake Balkhash comes mainly from aquatic plants. The organic carbon burial rate fluctuated from 8.16 to 30.04 g·m−2·a−1 and the minimum appeared at the top of the core. The organic carbon burial rate continues to decline as it has over the past 150 years. Global warming, higher hydrodynamic force, and low terrestrial input have not been conducive to the improvement of organic carbon sequestration in Balkhash Lake; the construction of a large reservoir had a greater impact on the sedimentary proxy of total organic carbon content, which could lead to a large deviation for environmental reconstruction. This is the first study to assess the sediment organic carbon sequestration using the modern sediments of Central Asia’s largest lake, which is of great scientific significance. The results contribute to an understanding of organic carbon sequestration in Central Asia and may provide a scientific basis for carbon balance assessment in regional and global scales. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, three global agendas, namely the New Urban Agenda, Sustainable Development Goals and the Nationally Determined Contributions towards climate change mitigation also demand actions in the cities. The traditional urban planning approach, based on master/development planning, and stemming from it, urban planning education, is highly technocratic and unable to deal with the reality of development challenges. In addition, urban planning education in India suffers from over-regulation and standardization, which leaves educational institutions devoid of innovation. Thus, for urban planning education to be relevant in India there is a need to revise and broaden the scope of the urban planning profession, non-standardize its contents, pay attention to substantive aspects including issues of equity and sustainability, have a future-facing approach towards dealing with climate change and rethink its pedagogic methods. However, for these changes to occur, urban planning educational institutes must take the lead and initiate radical reforms in country’s higher education regulatory system. © 2021 National Institute of Urban Affairs.","global agendas; India; planning education; reforms; Urban","education reform; educational development; regulatory framework; urban development; urban planning; urbanization; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114507780

Improvements in silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and the use of fast high frequency readout make it possible to use the prompt Cherenkov emission in BGO in order to boost the achievable coincidence time resolution (CTR) significantly. The large fluctuations in the detected Cherenkov photon yield are causing time or amplitude walk effects in the leading edge time discrimination, which are corrected by measuring the initial signal rise time via a double threshold system. Further a classification of 'fast' and 'slow' timing events is shown to make best use of all the information and upgrades the CTR for most of the 511-keV events. In order to assess the practicability of this novel approach various crystal geometries and state-of-The-Art SiPMs from HPK, Ketek, Broadcom, and FBK have been evaluated with the focus on the applicability in total body PET systems. For typical PET sized crystals (3 \times 3 \times 20 mm3) coupled to area matching 3 \times 3-mm2 Broadcom SiPMs a time resolution of 261 ± 8 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) was measured when applying time walk corrections, while the CTR of individual types of events with different Cherenkov yield range from 205 to 302-ps FWHM. A further thorough discussion and prospects of TOF-PET with BGO are given, especially in view of timing event classification of all detected 511-keV events, corresponding to various time of flight kernels ranging from high to low time resolution. © 2017 IEEE.","Cherenkov emission in Bismuth germanate (BGO); scintillators; semiconductors; signal processing; time-of-flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET)","Bismuth compounds; Classification (of information); Crystals; Full width at half maximum; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Bismuth germanate; Cherenkov emissions; Cherenkov photons; Event classification; High frequency HF; Positron emission tomography scanners; Silicon photomultiplier; Time discriminations; Positron emission tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114507494

To reduce the operation cost, renewable energy source (RES) abandonment, and purchased electricity of IEHS, an optimal dispatching method of IEHS with multiple functional areas considering the flow regulation of the heat network is proposed. Firstly, the functional area of IEHS is classified and the functional area’s load characteristics are analyzed. Secondly, a heat network model considering refined resistance and dynamic characteristics is constructed and the operation regulation modes of the heat network are analyzed. Thirdly, an optimal dispatching model of IEHS with multiple functional areas considering heat network flow regulation is established to minimize the operation cost of IEHS with multiple functional areas while considering the penalty cost of RES abandonment and time-of-use electricity price. Finally, a certain region in China is taken as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimal dispatching model. The case study shows that the quality regulation mode of the heat network considering flow change in multiple stages can effectively reduce RES abandonment by 2.4%, purchased electricity by 5.4%, and the system operation cost by 1.7%. In addition, compared with the independent dispatching of each functional area, the joint dispatching of IEHS with multiple functional areas can reduce the amount of RES abandonment by 95.2% and purchased electricity by 66.5%, and lower the operation cost of IEHS by 23.6%. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to design a hotel building for hot and dry climate conditions and perform its energy performance analysis using energy simulation tools. The model of the hotel building was constructed by a graphical tool OpenStudio and EnergyPlus following the ASHRAE Standard 90.1. To reduce the energy demand of the hotel, parametric analysis was conducted and building envelope parameters such as the thickness of insulation layer in the exterior wall and the roof, thermal conductivity of insulation layer, rate of infiltration, U-factor of windows, and thermal resistance of air gap in the interior walls (R-value), window-to-wall ratio, and orientation of the building were tested and the impact on the energy use of the building was analyzed. It was found that most of the design assumptions based on the ASHRAE standard were already optimal for the considered locality, however, were still optimized further to reach the highest efficiency level. Apart from this, three sustainable technologies—thermochromic windows, phase change materials, and solar panels—were incorporated into the building and their energy consumption reduction potential was estimated by energy simulations. Cumulatively, these sustainable technologies were able to reduce the total energy use from 2417 GJ to 1593 GJ (i.e., by 824 GJ or 34%). Calculation of payback period and return on investments showed that thermochromic windows and solar panels have relatively short payback periods and high return on investments, whereas PCM was found to be economically nonviable. The findings of this study are deemed to be useful for designing a sustainable and energy-efficient hotel building in a sub-tropical climate. However, the overall design and energy performance analysis algorithm could be used for various buildings with varying climate conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, two light-duty passenger cars (LDPCs) and three light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs) were tested to investigate the on-road emission factors (EFs) with a portable emission measurement system. Emission characteristics of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from vehicles at different speeds, accelerations and vehicle specific power (VSP) were analyzed. The results demonstrated that road conditions have significant impacts on regulated gaseous emissions.

There was a rough positive relationship between transient CO, NOx, and HC emission rates and vehicle speeds, while the EFs decreased significantly with the speed decrease when speed ≤ 20 km/h. The emissions rates of NOx and HC tended to increase and then decrease as the acceleration increased and the peak occurred at 0 m/s2 without considering idling conditions. For HC and CO, the emission rates were low and changed gently with VSP when VSP &lt; 0, while emission rates increased gradually with the VSP increase when VSP &gt; 0. For NOx NOx emission rates were lower and had no obvious change when VSP &lt; 0. However, NOx emissions were positively correlated with VSP, when VSP &gt; 0. © 2021 by the authors.

The measures taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions largely relate to the decarbonization of the economy. Changes in the Polish energy sector are a huge challenge because the energy mix is dominated by the energy derived from coal combustion. Decarbonizing the energy sector will require significant financial resources. Therefore, several questions arise: What is the social attitude to the planned changes? How do residents treat the issue of greenhouse gases? Do they perceive the relationship between energy production and the quality of the natural environment? What are their expectations regarding the transformation of the energy sector?

The study was conducted at the turn of 2020 and 2021. The survey was partial and carried out using the CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interview) method; 1539 questionnaire forms were filled in and the sample was randomly selected. The study confirms the following research hypotheses: 1. There is social support for the view that climate change is currently one of the greatest threats to modern civilization. 2. There is a social belief that the quality of the natural environment in southeastern Poland is good compared to other regions of Poland and Europe. 3. Increasing the share of energy based on renewable energy sources is socially expected. 4. There is a social expectation of nuclear energy. It can therefore be concluded that the surveyed community accepts the direction of changes in the energy sector. © 2021 by the authors.

However, these forest responses may vary with local conditions and forest types. Accordingly, this study was carried out to determine gross primary productivity (GPP) sensitivity to changes in environmental parameters. Central European beech (at Štítná) and spruce species (at Bílý K˘rí˘z and Rájec), growing under contrasting climatic conditions, were studied. The comparative analyses of GPP were based on a five-year-long dataset of eddy covariance fluxes during the main growing season (2012–2016). Results of forest GPP responses with changes in environmental factors from a traditional Stepwise multiple linear regression model (SMLR) were used and compared with Random forest (RF) analyses. To demonstrate how actual GPP trends compare to potential GPP (GPPpot) courses expected under near-optimal environmental conditions, we computed normalized GPP (GPPnorm) with values between 0 and 1 as the ratio of the estimated daily sum of GPP to GPPpot. The study confirmed the well-known effect of total intensity of the photosynthetically active radiation and its diffuse fraction on GPPnorm across all the forest types. However, the study also showed the secondary effects of other environmental variables on forest productivity depending on the species and local climatic conditions. The reduction in forest productivity at the beech forest in Štítná was presumed to be mainly induced by edaphic drought (anisohydric behaviour). In contrast, reduced forest productivity at the spruce forest sites was presumably induced by both meteorological and hydrological drought events, especially at the moderately dry climate in Rájec. Overall, our analyses call for more studies on forest productivity across different forest types and contrasting climatic conditions, as this productivity is strongly dependent on species type and site-specific environmental conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Public policies are necessary to induce economic efficiency and to create conditions to preserve or stimulate a competitive en-vironment. This paper aims to assess the competitiveness of hydrous ethanol price in a period of political, social and economic crises, in 15 Brazilian state capitals between the years 2012 and 2019. We compared the ethanol–gasoline price ratio behavior in two different periods, before and after the import parity price policy implemented by Petrobras in 2016. Mann–Whitney and Levene’s tests, two non-parametric statistical methods, were applied to verify significant changes between these periods. The implementation of changes in Petrobras’ pricing policy from 2016 onwards caused a statistically significant increase in the ratio coefficient of variation in two-thirds of the distribution market and more than the half of analyzed retail markets. Second, overall, the cities that showed statistically significant changes in the median and coefficient of variation in the distribution market price ratio were followed by the retail market. Our findings suggest that government interventions in the fuel and byproduct final selling prices to distributors negatively impact competition between companies that are part of the fuel distribution and retail chain, also affecting the sale of biofuels in Brazil and discouraging the initiatives to use renewable fuels to reduce the emission of pollutants. © 2021 by the authors.

On the basis of the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction by iron porphyrins developed by trapping and characterizing the intermediates involved (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 11214), a porphyrinoid ligand is envisaged to switch the selectivity of the iron porphyrins by reducing CO2 from CO to HCOOH as well as lower the overpotential to the process. The results show that the iron porphyrinoid designed can catalyze the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH using water as the proton source with 97% yield with no detectable H2 or CO. The iron porphyrinoid can activate CO2 in its Fe(I) state resulting in very low overpotential for CO2 reduction in contrast to all reported iron porphyrins, which can reduce CO2 in their Fe(0) state. Intermediates involved in CO2 reduction, Fe(III)-COOH and a Fe(II)-COOH, are identified with in situ FTIR-SEC and subsequently chemically generated and characterized using FTIR, resonance Raman, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The mechanism of the reaction helps elucidate a key role played by a closely placed proton transfer residue in aiding CO2 binding to Fe(I), stabilizing the intermediates, and determining the fate of a rate-determining Fe(II)-COOH intermediate. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Formic acid; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Iron metallography; Porphyrins; Proton transfer; Reaction intermediates; Transition metals; CO2 reduction; First row transition metals; In-situ FT-IR; Iron porphyrin; Overpotential; Resonance Raman; Selective reduction; Ssbauer spectroscopies; Iron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114445354

Compared to approaches that examine vulnerability to a specific hazard, our analysis offers an alternative perspective that conceptualizes vulnerability to climate change as a phenomenon that is independent of any specific type of hazard but relevant to multiple hazards. Vulnerability is thus a product of structural inequality and systemic in nature. Based on two established index systems, we perform global analyses of specific phenomena - such as poverty, access to basic infrastructure services and forced migration - that influence and determine vulnerability. Our statistical and spatial analyses reveal an emerging pattern of climate vulnerability within regional clusters and shows that vulnerability is a transboundary issue, crossing political, sectorial and geographical borders and impacting shared resources. The spatial statistical hotspot analysis of vulnerability underscores that hotspots, for example of high vulnerability, state fragility, low biodiversity protection or forced migration, emerge in multi-country clusters. This aspect has often been overlooked, most attention to-date having been given to the positioning of individual countries within vulnerability rankings. In hotspots such as in the Sahel, East and Central Africa, as well as in Southern Asia and Central America, vulnerability is interwoven with high levels of state fragility, making adaptation solutions more complex. The recognition of the regional clusters and the transboundary nature of vulnerability calls for new research and action on how to strengthen transboundary approaches for vulnerability reduction, potentially enhancing prospects for successful adaptation. © 2021 The Author(s).

Empirical evidence routinely indicates that jurors change their minds throughout the process. What is less clear is when and why this occurs and whether the causes are consistent across juries that consider the same topic but are situated within different contexts. We present evidence of opinion change in citizens’ juries through a natural experiment, contrasting three local contexts of onshore windfarm development in Scotland; viz. existing, planned, and absent. Jurors’ individual opinions of climate change, wind energy, and windfarms were measured through questionnaires at four time points: the start, following information-giving, reflection, and deliberation. Statistical examination of jurors’ responses, through paired sample t-tests, Wilcoxon sign-tests, and Generalised Least Squares regression, reveals to what extent substantive changes were associated with different phases and locational contexts. In all three juries, opinion change occurs throughout the process, on different topics, and to different degrees. While the information phase consistently influences jurors’ opinions the most, jury composition affects the magnitude and direction of opinion change, with outcomes contingent on contexts. Our findings are important for informing how mini-publics are designed and used to inform environmental policy-making at different scales. © 2021 by the authors.

While the current control measures on traffic pollution have reduced particulate matter, new solutions by emerging vehicular technologies can help protect citizens from exhaust-gas emissions. The electric vehicle (EV) is a promising solution to alleviate traffic-induced pollution in urban areas. However, traffic flow will be mixed with fuel vehicles (FVs) and EVs before the FV would be phased out. In this paper, traffic management by road pricing is introduced to reduce the tailpipe emission of the protected area by imposing environmental capacity constraints for network traffic mixed with EVs and FVs. Second-best toll pricing schemes are formulated as side constrained user equilibrium problems for both fixed demand and elastic demand cases. Both the tailpipe emission of FVs and the energy consumption of EVs are assumed to depend nonlinearly on network traffic conditions. Although the EVs do not contribute to the tailpipe emission, all vehicles contribute to congestion externality that induces more emission of FVs. Therefore, both types of vehicles are charged, but the toll on FVs is significantly higher than that on EVs. A new projected dynamics based algorithm is introduced to solve the toll from the Lagrange multiplier associated with the environmental constraint apart from the equilibrium flow. Numerical examples are conducted to evaluate the equilibrium cost and toll, and to analyze the impacts of EV penetration rate on the pricing scheme. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","electric vehicle; Environmental externality; nonlinear environmental constraint; projected dynamics; road pricing","Conservation; Economics; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Highway planning; Lagrange multipliers; Pollution control; Traffic congestion; Transportation charges; Environmental capacity; Environmental constraints; Particulate Matter; Penetration rates; Projected dynamics; Tailpipe emission; Traffic management; Vehicular technologies; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114379876

Accordingly, the installed capacity of wind turbines grew at an annualized rate of about 14% during the last two decades and wind turbines now provide ~6–7% of the global electricity supply. This renewable electricity generation source is thus already playing a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector. Here we document trends within the industry, examine projections of future installed capacity increases and compute the associated climate change mitigation potential at the global and regional levels. Key countries (the USA, UK and China) and regions (e.g., EU27) have developed ambitious plans to expand wind energy penetration as core aspects of their net-zero emissions strategies. The projected climate change mitigation from wind energy by 2100 ranges from 0.3–0.8◦ C depending on the precise socio-economic pathway and wind energy expansion scenario followed. The rapid expansion of annual increments to wind energy installed capacity by approximately two times current rates can greatly delay the passing of the 2◦ C warming threshold relative to pre-industrial levels.

Men and women farmers equally experience climate-change related effects, including drought, short rainy seasons and increased pest and disease incidence. Our study relies on exploratory data analysis of 1001 households surveyed in four sites in 2016. Farmers surveyed preferred early-maturing, heat-tolerant, high-yielding, and pest-and disease-resistant varieties, all important climate-adaptive traits. Seed systems of the focus crops studied are largely informal—overall, 68% women and 62% men use their own seed, indicating women’s higher reliance on ‘informal’ seed and information sources. Only 21% of respondents reported interacting with seed experts who are affiliated with formal organizations. Both formal and informal organizations play a key role in providing access to climate-adapted seed/information, with access for men and women varying across the countries studied. There is a need to support further development of those connections, building on existing social networks. We conclude that inclusive and gender-responsive context-and country-specific seed interventions will ensure equitable outcomes, increase women’s empowerment and strengthen both formal and informal seed systems for more effective climate-change adaptation. © 2021 by the authors.

While in some climate-relevant sectors, such as the transport sector, there already is some initial research on the relationship between climate and gender, research on the climate–gender nexus in the coal sector is still underdeveloped, and the few existing studies focus on dichotomous relations (gender–coal and coal–climate). This article discusses the currently neglected climate, coal, and gender triad and develops a conceptualization along the following aspects: (i) common lines of arguments, (ii) shortcomings in predominant arguments, and (iii) the state-of-the-art regarding the climate–gender–coal triad. To illustrate this outline, it uses the empirical case of the Colombian coal sector. Based on original data obtained via semi-structured interviews, it analyzes how imminent national-level climate policies for the coal sector, i.e., an energy transition, can be made gender-responsive and thus contribute to a just transition. The empirical example shows that women are already important change agents at the local level and in informal decision-making spaces. Although more research is needed to obtain further insights and evidence, this article contributes to the findings of more recent research which allow for the assumption that addressing climate and gender simultaneously may be mutually beneficial for both policy objectives. © 2021 by the author.

Thermal treatment of solid waste contributes at least 2.8–4% of the GHG in part due to increased generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and inefficient treatment processes, such as incineration and landfill. Thermal treatment processes, such as gasification and pyrolysis, are valuable ways to convert solid materials, such as wastes into syngas, liquids, and chars, for power generation, fuels, or for the bioremediation of soils. Subcoal™ is a commercial product based on paper and plastics from the source segregated waste that is not readily recyclable and that would otherwise potentially find its way in to landfills. This paper looks at the kinetic parameters associated with this product in pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion conditions for consideration as a fuel for power generation or as a reductant in the blast furnace ironmaking process. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) in Nitrogen (N2), CO2, and in air, was used to measure and compare the reaction kinetics. The activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor A were measured at different heating rates using non-isothermal Ozawa Flynn Wall and (OFW) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sonuse (KAS) model-free techniques. The TGA curves showed that the thermal degradation of Subcoal™ comprises three main processes: dehydration, devolatilization, and char and ash formation. In addition, the heating rate drifts the devolatilization temperature to a higher value. Likewise, the derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) results stated that Tm degradation increased as the heating rate increased. Substantial variance in Ea was noted between the four stages of thermal decomposition of Subcoal™ on both methods. The Ea for gasification reached 200.2 ± 33.6 kJ/mol by OFW and 179.0 ± 31.9 kJ/mol by KAS. Pyrolysis registered Ea values of 161.7 ± 24.7 kJ/mol by OFW and 142.6 ± 23.5 kJ/mol by KAS. Combustion returned the lowest Ea values for both OFW (76.74 ± 15.4 kJ/mol) and KAS (71.0 ± 4.4 kJ/mol). The low Ea values in combustion indicate shorter reaction time for Subcoal™ degradation compared to gasification and pyrolysis. Generally, TGA kinetics analysis using KAS and OFW methods show good consistency in evaluating Arrhenius constants. © 2021 by the authors.

This study employs an environmentally extended input–output model to conduct an economy-wide assessment of GHG emissions in the European Union (EU). Model results indicate that the assumed growth of economic activity by 2030 will lead to a large increase in GHG emissions by 89%, assuming no technological change and no additional policy mitigation efforts. The electricity sector and agriculture create the highest direct and indirect GHG emissions per unit of economic output across the 27 EU member states (EU-27); for every 1-million-euro-increase in the final demand for the products and services of the electricity sector and agriculture, 2198 and 1410 additional tons of GHG emit, respectively. Regional climate projections under a low-decarbonisation pathway (RCP8.5), in accordance with our economic analysis, indicate a further increase of regional warming, combined with pronounced changes in the hydrological cycle. Contrariwise, following a strong mitigation pathway (RCP2.6) will result in warming levels lower than 1.5 °C with respect to the 1986–2005 reference period. Our findings reveal the importance of both direct and indirect contribution of economic sectors in the generation of GHG emissions, taking into consideration the size of the sectors and the assumed growth rates. The design and implementation of sectoral emission reduction policies from the perspective of the whole production supply chain can effectively contribute to GHG emission reduction commitments. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change; Economic growth; Environmentally extended input–output analysis; Europe; GHG emissions","carbon emission; climate change; economic growth; economic structure; environmental economics; European Union; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114329300

Probably the most significant one of these are negative externalities. Another issue hindering renewable energy production is low technological and commercial maturity. These technologies might not become commercially viable in the near future without state intervention. This study aims to analyse Finnish energy policy based on current legislation related to renewable energy production and budget policy related to renewable-energy subsidies. This study shows that the polluter-pays principle is implemented quite well in Finland due to the emissions trading scheme and taxation. Still, this principle is not entirely implemented in electricity production as electricity tax is not based on the carbon intensity of the fuel used, but rather on who uses the electricity. National subsidy policies focus on a short-term increase in renewable energy production as most subsidies are production subsidies granted through a bidding process, making these subsidy policies partly technology-neutral. These policies do not take into account long-term needs for energy policy as much as they could. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

We assessed the SOC sequestration potential of the eastern Corn Belt (ECB) in the United States (Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia) in response to the adoption of conservation farming practices and land use change (pasture and forestation) using the SOCRATES model. Input data was provided through an intersection of the State Soil Geographic database, National Land Cover Database, and a PRISM (https://prism.oregonstate.edu) climate surface. At the end of the 20th century, the 15.3 Mha of cropped soils in the ECB contained 632 Tg C, an estimated reduction of 52% since the introduction of agriculture in the mid 1800s. Complete adoption of no-tillage practices on prime cropland would potentially recover 147 Tg SOC over 20 yr, whereas a continuation of conventional tillage would produce a loss of 35 Tg SOC over that period. Sequestration hotspots (&gt;500 Gg increase in SOC) under no-tillage cover 2.3 Mha providing 28 Tg C over 20 yr. The conversion of marginal (nonprime) agricultural lands to forests would yield an additional 13 Tg C in SOC and 381 Tg C in aboveground biomass. The rehabilitation of minelands to forest would yield an additional 4 Tg C in SOC and 42 Tg C in biomass. Opportunities to sequester C in the ECB via tillage and reforestation are substantial and should be incorporated into regional and national climate change mitigation strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

The escaping electrons generate a net positive charge at the target surface. Depending on whether the target is grounded or isolated from the vacuum chamber, either this positive charge is neutralized by the current flowing from the ground or generates a voltage on the isolated target corresponding to its capacitance. Under certain experimental conditions, it can be expected that this charge can retroactively affect not only the expansion velocity of the emitted ions and their number, but also the total number of escaped electrons. In this work, we deal with ion emission and measuring the voltage arisen on an isolated target or the current of electrons flowing between the ground and a grounded target. For the first time, this made it possible to estimate the ratio of the number of electrons released from plasma to the number of electrons stopped by a potential barrier. Irradiating various targets with a 60-110 mJ energy delivered by a 23-ns KrF excimer laser, this portion is 10−3 for grounded targets and 10−5 for targets isolated from the vacuum chamber. The observation of target currents also makes it possible to identify the level of influence of the contamination of the target surface with chemisorbed hydrocarbons on plasma production and ion separation caused by their different atomic weights. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Capacitance; Chemical elements; Electrons; Excimer lasers; Fluorine compounds; Ions; Laser ablation; Laser produced plasmas; Emissive properties; Expansion velocity; Experimental conditions; KrF excimer laser; Number of electrons; Plasma production; Positive charges; Potential barriers; Electric grounding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114306088

Riparian wetlands play a significant role in regulating carbon and nitrogen cycles. In this study, we analyzed the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from riparian wetlands in the Xilin River basin to understand the role of these ecosystems in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, the impact of the catchment hydrology and soil property variations on GHG emissions over time and space was evaluated. Our results demonstrate that riparian wetlands emit larger amounts of CO2 (335-2790ĝ€¯mgm-2h-1 in the wet season and 72-387ĝ€¯mgm-2h-1 in the dry season) than CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere due to high plant and soil respiration. The results also reveal clear seasonal variations and spatial patterns along the transects in the longitudinal direction. N2O emissions showed a spatiotemporal pattern similar to that of CO2 emissions. Near-stream sites were the only sources of CH4 emissions, while the other sites served as sinks for these emissions. Soil moisture content and soil temperature were the essential factors controlling GHG emissions, and abundant aboveground biomass promoted the CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. Moreover, compared to different types of grasslands, riparian wetlands were the potential hotspots of GHG emissions in the Inner Mongolian region. Degradation of downstream wetlands has reduced the soil carbon pool by approximately 60ĝ€¯%, decreased CO2 emissions by approximately 35ĝ€¯%, and converted the wetland from a CH4 and N2O source to a sink. Our study showed that anthropogenic activities have extensively changed the hydrological characteristics of the riparian wetlands and might accelerate carbon loss, which could further affect GHG emissions. © Authors 2021.",,"aboveground biomass; carbon dioxide; global warming; grassland; greenhouse gas; human activity; nitrous oxide; soil temperature; wet season; wetland; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114301622

In controlled laboratory conditions, we conducted a preliminary study on six different forest soils (two conifer-ous, two deciduous, and two mixed sites comprising trees of different ages) collected from the same region. The aim was to explore any differences and assess seasonal changes in soil microbial parameters (basal respiration BR, microbial biomass Cmic, metabolic quotient qCO2, dehydrogenase activity DHA, and Cmic:Corg ratio). Indicator-and forest-specific seasonality was assessed. In addition to litter input, soil parameters (pH, nutrient content, texture and moisture) strongly regulated the an-alyzed microbial indicators. PCA analysis indicated similarity between mature mixed and deciduous forests. Among annual mean values, high Cmic and DHA with simultaneously low qCO2 suggest that the mature deciduous stand was the most sustainable in microbial activities among the investigated forest soils.

This study quantita-tively shows the effect of retrofitting measures and represents strengths and weaknesses of different development scenarios. Improvements in production units show improvements in fuel use efficiency and thus indirectly reduce CO2 emissions due to unburned fuel. For this purpose, validated district planning tools have been used. Tool uses mathematical model for calculation and evaluation of all three main components of the DH system. For the quantitative evaluation, nine efficiency and balance indicators were used. For each indicator, recommended boundary values were proposed. In total, six simulation scenarios were simulated, and the last scenario have shown significant re-duction in CO2 emissions by 40% (from 3376 to 2000 t CO2 compared to the actual state), while share of biomass has reached 47%. © 2021 by the authors.

The greenhouse gases (GHGs) responsible for global warming include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NOx), water vapor (H2O), and fluorinated gases. A fraction of the increased emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere is due to agricultural and municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems. There is a need for a sustainable solution which can degrade the pollutants and provide a technology-based solution. Hence, the present work deals with the custom design of a loop photobioreactor with 34 L of total volume used to handle different inlet CO2 concentrations (0.03%, 5%, and 10% (v/v)). The obtained values of biomass productivity and CO2 fixation rate include 0.185 ± 0.004 g L−1 d−1 and 0.333 ± 0.004 g L−1 d−1, respectively, at 10% (v/v) CO2 concentration and 0.084 ± 0.003 g L−1 d−1 and 0.155 ± 0.003 g L−1 d−1, respectively, at 5% (v/v) CO2 concentration. The biochemical compositions, such as carbohydrate, proteins, and lipid content, were estimated in the algal biomass produced from CO2 mitigation stud-ies. The maximum carbohydrate, proteins, and lipid content were obtained as 20.7 ± 2.4%, 32.2 ± 2.5%, and 42 ± 1.0%, respectively, at 10% (v/v) CO2 concentration. Chlorophyll (Chl) a and b were determined in algal biomass as an algal physiological response. The results obtained in the present study are compared with the previous studies reported in the literature, which indicated the feasi-bility of the scale-up of the process for the source reduction of CO2 generated from waste management systems without significant change in productivity. The present work emphasizes the cross-disciplinary approach for the development of bio-mitigation of CO2 in the loop photobioreactor. © 2021 by the authors.

One source in an emission inventory, an industrial source, has been known with high uncertainty in both location and magnitude in China. In this study, a new reallocation method based on blue-roof industrial buildings was developed to replace the conventional method of using population density for the Chinese emission development. The new method utilized the zoom level 14 satellite imagery (i.e. Google®) and processed it based on hue, saturation, and value (HSV) colour classification to derive new spatial surrogates for province-level reallocation, providing more realistic spatial patterns of industrial PM2.5 and NO2 emissions in China. The WRF-CMAQ-based PATH-2016 model system was then applied with the new processed industrial emission input in the MIX inventory to simulate air quality in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) area (formerly called Pearl River Delta, PRD). In the study, significant root mean square error (RMSE) improvement was observed in both summer and winter scenarios in 2015 when compared with the population-based approach. The average RMSE reductions (i.e. 75 stations) of PM2.5 and NO2 were found to be 11ĝggm-3 and 3gppb, respectively. Although the new method for allocating industrial sources did not perform as well as the point- and area-based industrial emissions obtained from the local bottom-up dataset, it still showed a large improvement over the existing population-based method. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that the blue-roof industrial allocation method can effectively identify scattered industrial sources in China and is capable of downscaling the industrial emissions from regional to local levels (i.e. 27 to 3gkm resolution), overcoming the technical hurdle of ĝ1/4g10gkm resolution from the top-down or bottom-up emission approach under the unified framework of emission calculation. © Authors 2021.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; emission inventory; industrial emission; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114286385

Compared with the direct impact, the spillover effect of urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations in adjacent regions was underestimated. Urbanization is highly multi-dimensional phenomenon and previous studies have rarely distinguished the different driving influence and interactions of multi-dimensional urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations in Africa. This study combined grid and administrative units to explore the spatio-temporal change, spatial dependence patterns, and evolution trend of PM2.5 concentrations and multi-dimensional urbanization in Africa. The differential influence and interaction effects of multi-dimensional urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations under Africa’s rapid urbanization was further analyzed. The results show that the positive spatial dependence of PM2.5 concentrations gradually increased over the study period 2000–2018. The areas with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 35 µg/m3 increased by 2.2%, and 36.78% of the African continent had an increasing trend in Theil–Sen index. Urbanization was found to be the main driving factor causing PM2.5 concentrations changes, and economic urbanization had a stronger influence on air quality than land urbanization or population urbanization. Compared with the direct effect, the spillover effect of urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations in two adjacent regions was stronger, particularly in terms of economic urbanization. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations resulted from the interaction of multi-dimensional urbanization. The interaction of urbanization of any two different dimensions exhibited a nonlinear enhancement effect on PM2.5 concentrations. Given the differential impact of multi-dimensional urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations inside and outside the region, this research provides support for the cross-regional joint control strategies of air pollution in Africa. The findings also indicate that PM2.5 pollution control should not only focus on urban economic development strategies but should be an optimized integration of multiple mitigation strategies, such as improving residents’ lifestyles, optimizing land spatial structure, and upgrading the industrial structure. © 2021 by the authors.

However, they mostly concentrated on the changes during the lockdown period, and the studies considering the consequences of de-escalation of lockdown are inadequate. Therefore, we investigated the changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during the pre-lockdown, strict lockdown, unlocking, and post-lockdown scenarios. In addition, we assessed the influence of meteorology, mobility, air mass transport, and biomass burning on PM2.5 using Google’s mobility data, back trajectory model, and satellite-based fire incident data. Average PM2.5 concentrations in Ghaziabad, Noida, and Faridabad decreased by 60.70%, 63.27%, and 60.40%, respectively, during the lockdown. When compared with the preceding year (2019), the reductions during the shutdown period (25 March–31 May) were within the range of 36.34–44.55%. However, considering the entire year, this reduction in PM2.5 is momentary, and a steady increase in traffic density and industrial operations within cities during post-lockdown reflects a potent recovery of aerosol level, during which the average mass of PM2.5 three- to four-folds higher than the lockdown period. Back trajectories and fire activity results showed that biomass burning in the nearby states (Haryana and Punjab) influence aerosol load. We conclude that a partial lockdown in the event of a sudden surge in pollution would be a beneficial approach. However, reducing fossil fuel consumption and switching to more environmentally friendly energy sources, developing green transport networks, and circumventing biomass burning are efficient ways to improve air quality in the long term. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomass burning; COVID-19 lockdown; HYSPLIT; North Indian cities; PM2.5","Aerosols; Air quality; Fossil fuels; Meteorology; Back trajectories; Back-trajectory models; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Green transports; Industrial operations; Influence of meteorologies; PM2.5 concentration; Traffic densities; Biomass; air mass; air quality; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; biomass burning; COVID-19; meteorology; mobility; particulate matter; Faridabad; Ghaziabad; Haryana; India; Uttar Pradesh; air pollutant; air pollution; biomass; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; meteorology; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114279441

The reduction of exhaust emissions from motor vehicles is on the focus of environmental studies. The main targets of this paper are the modeling of motor vehicle particulate matter (PM10) emissions by American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) and California Line Source for Queuing and Hot Spot Calculations (CAL3QHCR) models and investigating the effectiveness of a hypothetical green wave scenario as a pollution reduction strategy. The portion of D010 State Road in Zonguldak (Turkey) is selected. Vehicle counting is applied for determining the traffic volume. Then, the PM10 emission inventory is prepared. After that, PM10 pollution distribution maps at signalized intersections are created by running air quality models. Next, the CAL3QHCR model is run again for the green wave scenario which assumes free flow at signalized intersections. The maximum PM10 concentrations predicted by AERMOD and CAL3QHCR models are 16.8 µg/m3 and 14.9 µg/m3, respectively. Although these values are below the threshold value, it can be said that air quality may pose a threat to public health in the existence of other sources. With the implementation of signal optimization, the PM10 pollution is reduced by 10–50% at intersections. Cumulative model validation is employed including other PM10 sources in the study area. PM10 contribution of other sources at Zonguldak air quality monitoring station is determined by the AERMOD model. Finally, the sum of model outputs is validated against measured concentrations. According to the validation, both models are found as satisfactory and AERMOD performed better than CAL3QHCR. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AERMOD; CAL3QHCR; Green wave scenario; Motor vehicle emissions; PM10","Air quality; Health risks; Air quality monitoring stations; American meteorological societies; Environmental studies; Motor vehicle emissions; Particulate Matter; Pollution reduction; Signal optimization; Signalized intersection; Vehicles; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; emission inventory; particulate matter; pollutant source; public health; air monitoring; article; calculation; California; environmental protection; motor vehicle; particulate matter 10; public health; running; Turkey (republic); air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; particulate matter; California; United States; Meleagris gallopavo; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114276016

We use the UK Climate Projections 2018 as an example of such information. Their probabilistic, global, and regional land projections exemplify some of the key methodologies that are at the forefront of constructing regional climate information for decision support in adapting to a changing climate. We assess the quality of the evidence and the methodology used to support their statements about future regional climate along six quality dimensions: transparency; theory; independence, number, and comprehensiveness of evidence; and historical empirical adequacy. The assessment produced two major insights. First, a major issue that taints the quality of UKCP18 is the lack of transparency, which is particularly problematic since the information is directed towards non-expert users who would need to develop technical skills to evaluate the quality and epistemic reliability of this information. Second, the probabilistic projections are of lower quality than the global projections because the former lack both transparency and a theory underpinning the method used to produce quantified uncertainty estimates about future climate. The assessment also shows how different dimensions are satisfied depending on the evidence used, the methodology chosen to analyze the evidence, and the type of statements that are constructed in the different strands of UKCP18.

A total of 121 smallholder farmers were randomly selected from three vulnerable rural farming communities in northern Ghana through a mixed methodological approach involving household surveys, interviews and focus group discussions. Data were analysed using descriptive and binary logistic regression with the help of IBM SPSS statistical software package integrated with qualitative thematic analysis involving transcription, categorization and interconnecting. The results show that majority (95.9%) of the smallholders have observed climatic changes in their local ecology with manifestations involving protracted drought (95.9%), unpredictable rainfall pattern (94.2%), high temperature (99.2%), strong winds (66.9%) and frequent flood events (99.2%). As a consequence, smallholders have observed that changes in temperature (99.2%) and rainfall patterns (97.5%) result in decreased agricultural output. In resolving the impacts, these smallholders employ preferred livelihood adaptive strategies involving non-farm diversification (51.2%), crop diversification (75.2%), changes in farm location (76.9%) and agrochemical application (100%) with moderate or high levels of effectiveness across space. The logistic regression results revealed that factors such as age, gender and access to credit significantly influenced smallholder farmers’ observation and adaptation to climate change and variability. The findings suggest the need for a location-specific climate adaptation policy. By this, the local knowledge, adaptive capacity and resilience of smallholder farmers could be built upon to mitigate their vulnerability to food insecurity and poverty. © 2021","Climate change and variability; Food security; Livelihood adaptive strategy; Northern Ghana; Smallholder farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114259842

The effect of individual pre‐trial CH4‐emitting characteristics on dietary emissions mitigation was also examined. Twenty Nordic Red cows at 71 ± 37.2 (mean ± SD) days in milk were assigned to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments (GS, GS supplemented with RSO, GS plus MS, GS plus MS supplemented with RSO) applied in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Partial replacement of GS with MS decreased the intake of dry matter (DM) and nutrients, milk production, yield of milk components, and general nutrient digestibility. Supplementation with RSO decreased the intake of DM and nutrients, energy‐corrected milk yield, composition and yield of milk fat and protein, and general digestibility of nutrients, except for crude protein. Individual cow pre‐trial measurements of CH4‐emitting characteristics had a significant influence on gas emissions but did not alter the magnitude of CH4 emissions. Dietary RSO decreased daily CH4, yield, and intensity. It also increased the relative abundance of rumen Methanosphaera and Succinivibrionaceae and decreased that of Bifidobacteriaceae. There were no effects of dietary MS on CH4 emissions in this study, but supplementation with 41 g RSO/kg of DM reduced daily CH4 emissions from lactating dairy cows by 22.5%. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, plant architecture, which affects micro-climate in the shoot, may considerably affect the uniformity of cannabinoids in the Cannabis sativa plant, which has significant pharmaceutical and economic importance. Variability of micro-climates in plant shoots intensifies with the increase in plant size, largely due to an increase in inter-shoot shading. In this study, we therefore focused on the interplay between shoot architecture and the cannabinoid profile in large cannabis plants, ~2.5 m in height, with the goal to harness architecture modulation for the standardization of cannabinoid concentrations in large plants. We hypothesized that (i) a gradient of light intensity along the plants is accompanied by changes to the cannabinoid profile, and (ii) manipulations of plant architecture that increase light penetration to the plant increase cannabinoid uniformity and yield biomass. To test these hypotheses, we investigated effects of eight plant architecture manipulation treatments involving branch removals, defoliation, and pruning on plant morpho-physiology, inflorescence yield, cannabinoid profile, and uniformity. The results revealed that low cannabinoid concentrations in inflorescences at the bottom of the plants correlate with low light penetration, and that increasing light penetration by defoliation or removal of bottom branches and leaves increases cannabinoid concentrations locally and thereby through spatial uniformity, thus supporting the hypotheses. Taken together, the results reveal that shoot architectural modulation can be utilized to increase cannabinoid standardization in large cannabis plants, and that the cannabinoid profile in an inflorescence is an outcome of exogenous and endogenous factors. © 2021 by the authors.

First, the frosting characteristics at the evaporator side of the air source heat pump system are analyzed. Then, a new defrost technology is proposed, and dimensional theory and neural network are combined to predict the transfer performance of the new system. Finally, an adaptive network control algorithm is proposed to predict the frosting amount. This algorithm optimizes the traditional neural network algorithm control process, and it is more flexible, objective, and reliable in the selection of the hidden layer, the acquisition of the optimal function, and the selection of the corresponding learning rate. Through model performance, regression analysis, and heat transfer characteristics simulation, the effectiveness of this method is further confirmed. It is found that, the new air source heat pump defrost system can provide auxiliary heat, effectively regulating the temperature and humidity. The mean square error is 0.019827, and the heat pump can operate efficiently under frosting conditions. The defrost system is easy to operate, and facilitates manufactures designing for different regions under different conditions.

We used the analytic hierarchy process (ANP) and a variety of MCDM methods to quantitatively evaluate renewable energy indicators. This study measured the sequence and differences of the development and utilization of renewable energy in different regions from the point of view of carbon emission reduction, which provides a new analytical perspective for the utilization and distribution of renewable energy in China and a solution based on renewable energy for achieving the goal of carbon emission reduction as soon as possible. The reliability of the evaluation system was further enhanced by confirmation through a variety of methods. The results show that the environment and carbon dimensions are the primary criteria to evaluate the priority of renewable energy under carbon emission reduction. In the overall choice of renewable energy, photovoltaic energy is the best solution. After dividing regions according to carbon emission intensity and resource endowment, areas with serious carbon emissions are suitable for the development of hydro-power; areas with sub-serious carbon emissions should give priority to the development of photo-voltaic or wind power; high-carbon intensity area I should vigorously develop wind power; high-carbon intensity area II should focus on developing photovoltaic power; second high-carbon intensity areas I and II are suitable for the development of wind power and photovoltaic power; and second high-carbon intensity areas III and IV are the most suitable for hydropower. © 2021 by the authors.

Land use activities are crucial to the growth of carbon emissions. However, few scholars focus on the influence mechanism between industrial land use efficiency (ILUE) and industrial carbon emissions. In this paper, the threshold model and the spatial Durbin model are used to investigate the spatial threshold effect of industrial land use efficiency on industrial carbon emission from 2003 to 2018. The results show that ILUE of China’s provinces basically shows an improvement trend, with little difference in spatial distribution, showing a pattern of high in the eastern region and low in the western region. When economic development level (A) and technical level (T) are taken as the threshold variable, ILUE has a single threshold effect on industrial carbon emissions in the eastern region. In the central region, with a as the threshold variable, ILUE shows a double threshold effect on industrial carbon emission. Under the 0–1 geographical proximity weight matrix, the indirect spillover effect of ILUE on reducing regional carbon emissions is significant, and the indirect effect is even greater than that on regional carbon emissions. The spatial spillover effect is not significant in the eastern region. These findings have important practical significance for promoting regional industrial transformation and upgrading, optimizing land space and realizing high-quality economic development. © 2021 by the authors.

Women organisations are one of the non-state stakeholders, whose role is acknowledged in the UNFCCC Decision 3/CP.25 for improving gender-responsiveness of climate finance. Within the UNFCCC, orchestration is used as a governance approach to enhance the mobilisation of non-state actors for facilitating the implementation of policy goals. The study utilises mixed methods including document review and interviews with key informants. The findings of the study indicate that the quality of orchestration has been low, i.e., the engagement of women organisations in the UNFCCC-led climate finance decision making has, so far, been limited. This is due to the lack of policy convergence on the purposes of orchestration, as well as the newness, and complexity of the issues at the intersection of climate finance and gender. While the concept of orchestration is intended to enhance decision making practices, the study suggests that in the case of the engagement of women organisations in the UNFCCC-led climate finance governance, orchestration is used only for symbolic purposes. To make the engagement of women organisations more meaningful, there is a need to diversify the existing orchestration practices and improve consistency in policy framing. © 2021 by the author.

Data were collected (n = 2010) from 13 Chinese cities with varying air pollution gradients using questionnaires. The results demonstrated that air pollution was significantly correlated with people’s risk perception and concern about air pollution, which significantly affected their pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). However, high-risk perceptions undermine the public’s self-efficacy and reduce people’s PEB in the private sphere. People with high scores of the authoritarian personality type were reluctant to engage in PEB in the private sphere; interestingly, it can also be transformed into a stronger PEB in the public sphere via social norms. Thus, this study suggests that educational activities can break the negative link between authoritarianism and environmentalism, leading to behavioural change. Hence, it is essential for education programs to harvest positive outcomes via adaptive approaches for varying authoritarian personalities. © 2021 by the authors.

The emissions of AHs are unregulated, and the number of devices is high; therefore, they make considerable contributions to local air quality, and even the global emissions budget. Experiments for studying the emissions were performed in Finland for a total of eight selected vehicles with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) AHs installed, including both diesel‐ and gasoline‐operated heaters. We present the numerical results of particle emissions and compare the particle concentrations in the AH exhaust to values found in the tailpipe exhaust of the same vehicle. Our results show that the emissions from auxiliary heaters are typically several orders of magnitude higher than of a car exhaust when idling. This raises the question of whether the use of heaters is justified based on the goal to reduce total emissions from vehicle use; furthermore, whether fuel-operated heaters should also be applied in electric vehicles for cabin heating. More research will be needed to characterize the emissions more thoroughly to understand the air quality and climate effects from AHs, and to provide further recommendations on the use of these heaters. © 2021 by the authors.

We show the role of private households in the sustainable energy transition process induced by Swiss energy policy. For the analysis, we define six scenarios that enable us to study the potentials and impacts of different combinations of DG technologies in terms of costs, CO2 emissions, and amounts and shares of DG provided by non-industrial end-users (essentially private households and the services sector). Three variants are investigated, one with real electricity costs and CO2 emissions, one with increased electricity costs (e.g., construction of new power plants), and one with increased CO2 emissions (e.g., due to the planned nuclear phase-out in Switzerland). We find that non-industrial entities can play an important role as prosumers. They mitigate the need for centralized generation. Within a scenario where the non-industrial energy end-users install water-water heat pumps and photovoltaics, a total reduction of the gas procurement from the grid is possible whereas the electricity demand from the grid increases by 24%. This scenario reveals higher DG electricity costs in comparison to conventional electricity supply, but the total costs of energy supply decrease due to the elimination of gas supply, and the CO2 emissions can be reduced by 68%. © 2021 by the authors.

The key prerequisite to successfully achieve these goals seems to be extensive support and adequate commitment of the member states and their citizens to the implementation of the clean energy transition and climate neutrality measures. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive analysis aiming to identify the factors determining the EU citizens’ attitudes towards the European Energy Union priorities. The analysis was based on representative data obtained from residents of twenty‐seven EU countries using a Eurobarometer survey. The collected data were subjected to a comparative analysis and binary logistic regression. The research results demonstrated that the support for specific energy policy priorities varies significantly depending on different perceptions of the EU citizens and was affected by a number of demographic variables. It was indicated that per-ceiving the environment, climate and energy as the most important issues from the perspective of an individual, a country and the EU significantly affects attitudes towards energy policy priorities. However, this mostly concerned the awareness of the importance of these issues at the EU level. Individuals who supported a common energy policy among the EU member states were more likely to point to green energy priorities, whereas guaranteeing low energy prices for companies and consumers seemed less important for them. It was remarkable that the reduction of energy consumption was indicated as an energy policy priority by respondents expecting both more and less deci-sion‐making at the European level in the field of environmental protection. People with a right-wing orientation were the most likely to support the competitiveness of the EU’s industry, while individuals with a leftist ideology showed the strongest tendency to opt for environmental protec-tion. Furthermore, gender, occupation and the place and country of residence emerged as very important determinants of attitudes towards the European Energy Union priorities, whereas age and the educational level were predictors in very few cases only. © 2021 by the authors.

Caribbean islanders have been exposed to climatic challenges since the initial occupation of the archipelago between five to eight thousand years ago. They have been continually confronted with severe droughts, tropical cyclones, extreme wave events, sea-level changes, and the accompanying impacts. The various phe-nomena have stimulated island residents both to anticipate and respond to such events, adapting their lifestyles and socio-cultural and political structures and ties across the region over time. In this article, we innovatively combine archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data with longitudinal coastal-erosion data and ethnographic data to further develop and promote sustainable local strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and increasingly frequent and violent weather events on small-island settings. To find proxies, we first look into the region’s pre-colonial archaeological record. Second, we delve into predictive modeling and the current and future climatic challenges for heritage sites and local coastal communities, as well as related collaborative heritage mitigation efforts. Third, we discuss the contribution of traditional knowledge practices to climate change adaptation. The results show how the long-term perspective and multidisciplinary approach adopted here may lead to realistic solutions to seemingly intractable problems. They also reveal how collaborative projects involving all stakeholders on an equal basis in all phases of research have become a top priority in climate change mitigation and heritage safeguarding. © 2021 by the authors.

China’s regulatory planning remains the basis for building permission in the original urban and rural planning, and the new territorial spatial planning systems, determining the quality of urban plan implementation. Comprehensive regulatory plans effectively reduce carbon emissions. This study employs Q methodology to compare and analyze urban planners’ and practitioners’ perceptions of China’s regulatory planning in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The findings show that while regulatory planning is key, potential deficiencies include the gaps between regulatory from master plans, capacity shortages of designations and indicators, and unequal rights and responsibilities of local governments. However, mandatory indicators in regulatory planning, especially “greening rate,” “building density,” “land use type,” and “application of renewable energy technologies to the development of municipal infrastructure” could effectively mitigate climate change. “Greening rate” is the core indicator in regulatory planning since it provides empirical evidence for the “green space effect”.

Previous research concludes that people often do not support and legitimize such taxes because they perceive them as unfair. However, the notion of fairness implies a multitude of factors and despite attempts of the previous research to further nuance people's fairness perceptions, we currently lack a more precise understanding of what people mean when they regard carbon taxes as unfair. In this article, we thoroughly investigate this problem by using original survey data from YouGov collected in the United States in 2018 and analyzing open-ended survey responses on why people think carbon taxes are unfair. Applying structural topic modeling, we unpack the multi-dimensional meaning of unfairness, as perceived by the US population. The results from our analysis show that people regard carbon taxes based on gas pricing as unfair because they perceive gas prices already being high, because of the need to drive, unfairness for the poor or rural population, lack of trust in government, or considerations that the purpose of the tax is unjustified. These findings help provide a more nuanced policy design to address fairness concerns related to carbon taxes. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon dioxide tax; Fairness; Justice; Public opinion","carbon dioxide; environmental policy; pollution tax; survey; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114162074

Ambient particulates were analyzed in samples of snow cover and washout from vegetation (conifer tree needles). According to particle size distribution data, the relative content of particles with a diameter up to 10 microns (PM10 ) reaches 40% in three snow samples taken in the central part of the town. Among ore minerals, pyrite and arsenopyrite predominated in the samples. In addition, sphalerite, galena, cassiterite, and iron–chromium–nickel formations of various shapes were found in the studied particles. The presence of these metals in airborne PM can negatively affect the incidence rate of PM-associated diseases and the determination of their levels are very useful for air pollution prevention strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Construction of new roads and improvement of existing ones promotes economic development. However, as the number of cars increases, so does the level of air emissions. In reducing pollutant emissions, the analysis of the technological possibilities used and the improvement of their efficiency with the simultaneous minimization of generated pollution is also of particular importance. The purpose of the publication is to present development trends in road transport in Poland and the possibility of reducing emissions in this respect. The method of analysing strategic documents and statistical data was used to achieve this goal.

As Portland cement clinker is mainly responsible for the high CO2 emissions of concrete, its reduction is necessary. In order to be sustainable, the concrete must meet processing, mechanical and durability properties while taking cost aspects into account. The paper presents (i) the “micro-filler/eco-filler concept” for achieving a clinker reduced, optimised binder and (ii) a performance-based approach to put sustainable “Eco-concrete” into practice. Clinker is substituted by locally available inert fillers by at least two different particle size fractions and supplementary cementitious materials. The method is based on particle packing optimisation, reduction in water demand and optimisation of the mix ratio of the binder blend, which allows the performance requirements to be met. The new Eco-concretes deliver the desired performance in terms of processability, strength and durability (water penetration, frost, carbonation and chloride resistance) while lowering the environmental impact in comparison to standard concrete.

The evaluation framework is part of an Urban Regeneration Model designed to accelerate the urban transformation toward the smart city concept, taking into account all aspects of sustainability. This model has been developed and validated in the three EU cities (Valladolid, Spain; Nottingham, United Kingdom; and Tepebaşı, Turkey) where interventions in the energy, mobility, and ICT fields have been deployed. This model relies on an Evaluation Framework to support its main phases considering two levels of evaluation: city level, to assess globally the smartness and sustainability of the city, and project level, to support the decision-making and assess the impacts of specific implementations. This paper is focused on the second level and its application through the evaluation-supporting tool STILE in the assessment of the energy efficiency and sustainable urban mobility actions implemented in the city of Valladolid. The assessment analysis has allowed assessing how the energy efficiency interventions carried out in the Valladolid district have reduced the energy consumption, increased the use of renewable energies, and reduced the CO2 emissions. In addition, it has allowed evaluating other aspects such as the air quality, thermal comfort, and energy bill, which have been also improved for the residents. Considering the analysis of the sustainable mobility interventions, the evaluation framework supports the assessment of the reduction of emissions and air pollutants and how the actions have converted electro-mobility into a real option for citizens. The evaluation of results after the implementation of this kind of actions is key to ensuring that successful actions can be replicated in other places achieving smarter and more sustainable cities. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the main sources of household air pollution (HAP) is the traditional stove. So-called improved cookstoves (ICS) do not reduce emissions to levels that benefit health, but the poorest communities are unlikely to have access to cleaner cooking in the medium term. Therefore, ICS are being promoted as an intermediate step. This paper summarises the current evidence on the ICS available to the global poorest, utilising data from the Clean Cookstoves Catalog and systematic review evidence from the field. The cheapest stoves offer little reduction in HAP. Only one ICS, available at US$5 or less, (the canarumwe) minimally reduced pollutants based on ISO testing standards and no studies included in the systematic reviews reported tested this stove in the field. We recommend field testing all ICS as standard, and clear information on stove characteristics, sustainability, safety, emissions efficiency, in-field performance, affordability, availability in different settings, and the ability of the stove to meet community cooking needs. In addition, ICS should be promoted alongside a suite of measures, including improved ventilation and facilities to dry wood, to further reduce the pollutant levels. © 2021 by the authors.

Regional transport pathways and potential source areas of pollutants were analyzed using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF). The results showed that the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO were 30.5%–53.8% lower in the Level I period and 49.4%–65.0% lower in the Level II period than in the pre-lockdown period, respectively. Conversely, O3 increased 59.6% and 58.1% during Level I and Level II, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown period. During the 55-day lockdown, daily average concentrations of each pollutant were lower than in previous years on 36-55 days, while O3 was higher on 35 days. The pollutants that decreased in concentration during the lockdown also showed an increase during the Level III period (up to 188.5%). The maximum daily growth rate of PM2.5 during the lockdown period in 2020 was 16.0%, which was higher than this value in the same period of previous years (21.8%, 21.4%, 17.4%). This shows that the change trend of pollutants during the lockdown period is smoother than in previous years. Temperature and O3 were positively correlated before the lockdown and during Level I and weakly negatively correlated during Level II and Level III. Despite the prevalence of northwest winds in winter, a high percentage of trajectories from other directions (up to 36.8%) was observed during the lockdown. Simultaneously, the lockdown reduced the potential source area for PM2.5 (WPSCF ≥ 0.000007), but rebounded after the lockdown was lifted. In conclusion, the lockdown only temporarily reduced the air pollution in Changchun. © 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Waste heat and exhaust emissions from motor vehicles and industrial combustion cause the warming of cities, resulting in microclimates' changes. Recently, national lockdown regulations restricting movement and socio-economic activities to curb the spread of a novel COVID-19 and the associated deaths have been implemented in various countries worldwide. Consequently, these unprecedented restrictions resulted in reductions in traffic volumes and industrial activities in most urban areas across the world. Thus, it was hypothesised that these reductions in traffic congestion and industrial activities in cities would reduce both air pollutants and thermal radiation. Using multisource data from Sentinel-5P, MERRA-2, and MODIS, this study assessed the short-term trends in emissions and land surface temperature in South Africa's economic hub, i.e., Gauteng Province. Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) trend analysis were used to characterise trends in CO, SO2, SO4, long-wave radiation (LWR), and land surface temperature (LST) at periods corresponding to various lockdown restrictions. The results showed a significant decline in atmospheric pollutants at Level-5 lockdown restrictions, followed by an abrupt increase as the regulations were eased to Level-4 lockdown. Similarly, LST and surface urban heat island (SUHI) reduced when compared to the previous year. Therefore, the lockdown restrictions provided an experimental scenario in which pollutants could be drastically reduced, thus accentuated the human impact on microclimates. © The Author(s).","COVID-19; Emissions; Lockdown; Nitrogen dioxide; Sentinel-5P","Air pollution; Economics; Industrial emissions; Land surface temperature; Landforms; Light water reactors; Particulate emissions; Solid wastes; Sulfur dioxide; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Traffic congestion; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric pollutants; Industrial activities; Industrial combustion; Long-wave radiation; Surface urban heat islands; Temporal analysis; Urban heat island; Atmospheric temperature; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; combustion; COVID-19; exhaust emission; heat island; human activity; MODIS; Sentinel; socioeconomic conditions; temporal analysis; traffic congestion; urban area; Gauteng; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114116348

Seasonal forecasts are compared against the reanalysis data provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The reanalysis is used to train adaptive filters based on the Recursive Least Squares algorithm in order to reduce the forecast error. The K-means unsupervised learning algorithm is used to obtain the number of filters to employ from the climate variables. The proposed approach is applied to some climate variables such as the meridional wind, zonal wind, and the geopotential height. The forecast is produced by the Eta RCM at 40-km resolution in a domain covering most of Brazil. Results show that the proposed approach is capable of reducing the forecast errors, according to evaluation metrics such as normalized mean square error, maximum absolute error, and maximum normalized absolute error, thus improving the seasonal climate forecasts. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper measures green total factor productivity for 30 provinces in China from 2004–2018 and tests whether technological progress is selectively biased towards the pollutants emitted. The results find a selective bias of technological progress on pollutant emissions, and there is also heterogeneity in the selective bias across regions. The current level of technological progress is on the right side of the inverted U-shaped inflection point for SO2 and PM2.5 and the left side of the inverted U-shaped inflection point for CO2. The improvement of technological progress can reduce the emissions of SO2 and PM2.5. Still, the results indicate that the reduction effect of these two pollutants originates from the treatment process rather than reducing the source of the production side. The inability of technological advancement to reduce CO2 emissions suggests some carbon lock-in in China’s technological advancement.

In recent years, ambient PM2.5 concentrations in China have declined substantially due to the combined effect of PM2.5 control and meteorological con-ditions. To this end, it is critical to assess the health impact attributable to PM2.5 pollution improvement and to explore the potential benefits which may be obtained through the achievement of future PM2.5 control targets. Based on PM2.5 and population data with a 1 km resolution, premature mortality caused by exposure to PM2.5 in China from 2014 to 2018 was estimated using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). Then, the potential benefits of achieving PM2.5 control targets were estimated for 2030. The results show that premature mortality caused by PM2.5 pollution decreased by 22.41%, from 2,361,880 in 2014 to 1,832,470 in 2018. Moreover, the reduction of premature mortality in six major regions of China accounted for 52.82% of the national total reduction. If the PM2.5 control target can be achieved by 2030, PM2.5-related premature deaths will further decrease by 403,050, accounting for 21.99% of those in 2018. Among them, 87.02% of cities exhibited decreases in premature deaths. According to the potential benefits in 2030, all cities were divided into three types, of which type III cities should set stricter PM2.5 control targets and further strengthen the associated monitoring and governance. The results of this study provide a reference for the formulation of air pollution control policies based on regional differences. © 2021 by the authors.

A new holistic model was developed based on the Rational Exergy Management Model (REMM). This model optimally solves the energy and exergy conflicts between the benefits of using widely available, low-temperature, low-exergy waste and renewable energy sources, like solar energy, and the inability of existing heating equipment, which requires higher exergy to cope with such low temperatures. In recognition of the challenges of retrofitting existing buildings in the EU stock, most of which are more than fifty years old, this study has developed a multi-pronged solution set. The first prong is the development of heating and cooling equipment with heat pipes that may be customized for supply temperatures as low as 35◦ C in heating and as high as 17◦ C in cooling, by which equipment oversizing is kept minimal, compared to standard equipment like conventional radiators or fan coils. It is shown that circulating pump capacity requirements are also minimized, leading to an overall reduction of CO2 emissions responsibility in terms of both direct, avoidable, and embodied terms. In this respect, a new heat pipe radiator prototype is presented, performance analyses are given, and the results are compared with a standard radiator. Comparative results show that such a new heat pipe radiator may be less than half of the weight of the conventional radiator, which needs to be oversized three times more to operate at 35◦ C below the rated capacity. The application of heat pipes in renewable energy systems with the highest energy efficiency and exergy rationality establishes the second prong of the paper. A next-generation solar photo-voltaic-thermal (PVT) panel design is aimed to maximize the solar exergy utilization and minimize the exergy destruction taking place between the heating equipment. This solar panel design has an optimum power to heat ratio at low temperatures, perfectly fitting the heat pipe radiator demand. This design eliminates the onboard circulation pump, includes a phase-changing material (PCM) layer and thermoelectric generator (TEG) units for additional power generation, all sandwiched in a single panel. As a third prong, the paper introduces an optimum district sizing algorithm for minimum CO2 emissions responsibility for low-temperature heating systems by minimizing the exergy destructions. A solar prosumer house example is given addressing the three prongs with a heat pipe radiator system, next-generation solar PVT panels on the roof, and heat piped on-site thermal energy storage (TES). Results showed that total CO2 emissions responsibility is reduced by 96.8%. The results are discussed, aiming at recommendations, especially directed to policymakers, to satisfy the Paris Agreement. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on this, from the perspective of information flow, this study used the differences-in-differences method (DID) to identify the “net effect” of the carbon emissions reduction caused by China’s environmental information disclosure. The results showed the following: first, environmental information disclosure could effectively promote regional carbon emissions reductions and had a better effect on the central and western regions and low carbon emissions density regions. Second, the achievement of carbon emissions reduction targets was mainly attributed to the positive impact of information disclosure in the process of “coal with-drawal.” Finally, this study also found that environmental information disclosure helped to promote the positive effect of clean energy development on “coal withdrawal,” and the promotion of public awareness regarding environmental supervision helped to strengthen the external impact of environmental information disclosure on regional carbon emissions reduction. © 2021 by the authors.

Because economic profit takes priority over environmental cost, increasing amounts of fertilizer have been used in mature subtropical Torreya grandis orchards. However, given the magnitude of global nitrogen deposition, it’s worth considering whether heavy fertilizer treatment is necessary. To elucidate the balance between T. grandis nutrient demands and fertilizer supply, we determined the C, N, and P concentrations of foliar and soil ([C], [N], [P]) at 9 orchards undergoing long-term fertilizer treatments in two scenarios of N and N + P addition with different intensity. After documenting the dynamic variation of plant growth, nutrients characteristic, and the corresponding resorption efficiency, we found that excessive N addition interfered T. grandis’ sensibility to P availability in this N-enrichment area, leading to an increasing foliar [P] and resorption efficiency (PRE) and decoupling plant C:N:P ratios. As a result, enhanced fertilizer supply failed to improve carbon accumulation, plant growth, and yield effectively. These results demonstrate that extra fertilization in the N-saturated study area highly reduced the economic and ecological efficiency of fertilizers. Thus, our research suggests that N addition in the studied orchards should be rejected, and we recommend organic management as a more conducive method to achieve sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.

Road wear is exacerbated in cold climate by the widespread use of studded tires. The goal of this research was to assess the anthropogenic levers for suspendable road dust generation and climatic conditions governing the environmental fate of non-exhaust particles in a wet maritime winter climate. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the NORTRIP model for the Capital region of Reykjavík, Iceland (64.1° N). Precipitation frequency (secondarily atmospheric relative humidity) governed the partitioning between atmospheric and waterborne PM10 particles (55% and 45%, respectively). Precipitation intensity, however, increased proportionally most the drainage to waterways via stormwater collection systems, albeit it only represented 5% of the total mass of dust generated in winter. A drastic reduction in the use of studded tires, from 46% to 15% during peak season, would be required to alleviate the number of ambi-ent air quality exceedances. In order to achieve multifaceted goals of a climate resilient, resource efficient city, the most important mitigation action is to reduce overall traffic volume. Reducing traffic speed may help speed environmental outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

Predictors included climate change attitudes, environmental attitudes, political ideology, political party affiliation, and demographic variables. Most (72%) of the 644 respondents only talked about climate change with peers a few times a year or less, though 65% were very or extremely worried about climate change. Many respondents indicated a willingness to do somewhat or a lot more, from 38% willing to talk to peers to 25% for willing to take political actions.

However, such an unfounded relationship that would consider urban sustainability measures is a serious challenge, especially considering the effects of climate change. The Greater Cairo Region (GCR) has recently witnessed numerous serious urban vehicular network re-development, leaving the city less green and in need of strategically re-thinking the plan regarding, and the role of, green infrastructure. Therefore, this study focuses on approaches to the optimization of the urban green infrastructure, in order to reduce solar irradiance in the city and, thus, its effects on the urban climatology. This is carried out by studying one of the East Cairo neighborhoods, named El-Nozha district, as a representative case of the most impacted neighborhoods. In an attempt to quantify these effects, using parametric simulation, the Air Temperature (Ta), Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt), Relative Humidity (RH), and Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) parameters were calculated before and after introducing urban trees, acting as green infrastructure types that mitigate climate change and the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Our results indicate that an optimized percentage, spacing, location, and arrangement of urban tree canopies can reduce the irradiance flux at the ground surface, having positive implications in terms of mitigating the urban heat island effect. © 2021 by the authors.

By coupling remote sensing measurements with a high-resolution regional climate model, this study evaluated the land surface changes and corresponding climate impact caused by planting rice on saline-alkali land in western Jilin (China). Our results showed that paddy field expansion became the dominant land use change in western Jilin from 2015 to 2019, 25% of which was converted from saline-alkali land; this percentage is expected to increase in the near future. We found that saline-alkali land reclamation to paddy fields significantly increased the leaf area index (LAI), particularly in July and August, whereas it decreased albedo, mainly in May and June. Our simulation results showed that planting rice on saline-alkali land can help decrease the air temperature and increase the relative humidity. The temperature and humidity effects showed different magnitudes during the growing season and were most significant in July and August, followed by September and June. The nonradiative pro-cess, rather than the radiative process, played a dominant role in regulating the regional climate in this case, and the biophysical competition between evapotranspiration (ET) and albedo determined the temperature and relative humidity response differences during the growing season. © 2021 by the authors.

Accordingly, in this work, sewage sludge from a wastewater treatment plant was carbonized at different pyrolysis temperatures in the range of 400-800 °C via a one-pot synthesis method, which was used to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Among the samples, biochar pyrolyzed at 800 °C (BC800) showed the best catalytic performance for the removal of SMX (85.3% in 60 min reaction). In the initial pH range of 5.0-11.0, PDS could be activated (0.75 g L-1) efficiently by BC800 for the degradation of SMX. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, quenching experiment, steady-state kinetics experiment and electrochemical results, the degradation of SMX in the BC800/PDS system was proposed to be a degradation mechanism involving electron transfer as the main pathway.

However, the idea of EVs will be genuinely sustainable only if they are charged using renewable energy. This paper presents results from the design of a solar-powered EV charging station for an Indian context. PVsyst 7.2 software has been used for the system design. The analysis, based on the number of cars charged annually, the monthly variation in energy generation, the investment cost, and the decrease in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using different module technologies for six Indian cities, has been deliberated. The results indicate that an off-grid 8.1 kWp system with two days of battery autonomy has the fewest unused energy losses, with a good performance ratio (PR). It can completely charge around 414 vehicles of 30 kWh battery capacity annually. This would help to reduce annual CO2 emissions by approximately 7950 kg. For cities near the equator, maximum energy is produced during March or January, and for cities near the Tropic of Cancer, energy production maximizes during May–June. The overall system has better energy generation and economy when monocrystalline modules are used. © 2021 by the authors.

A key challenge for energy transition in Poland is to build an energy system that corresponds with social needs not only in terms of energy demand, but also environmental protection, with a strong role of local initiatives. The aim of this study is to present the expectations of the Poles regarding the optimal energy mix, especially representatives of local governments, and their awareness of the needs and expectations of their local communities. According to the authors, local governments are extremely important links, responsible for the development of the energy economy and energy security at the local level. The authors set themselves the task of verifying whether local authorities are prepared to create a substantive energy policy at the local level in accordance with the directions of the Polish energy policy and on the basis of local conditions, including the opinions of the inhabitants of a given region. The objective of this work was achieved by reviewing the available sources and the adopted survey method. A review of the literature, in particular in terms of the conducted research on the social acceptance in terms of energy policy, showed that there are no comprehensive surveys of the opinions of local government representatives. The results of study conducted by the authors showed that although the vast majority of respondents know the assumptions of the Polish energy policy until 2030, almost a quarter did not realize that the energy policy will be changed in the near future. At the same time, the vast majority of respondents believe that the Polish government should prepare a social campaign related to the energy policy. According to the authors, this proves the need to improve the awareness of this research group, which may bring benefits in the process of shaping the energy economy of the regions. The survey also showed preferences of the representatives of local governments for the optimal energy mix in Poland and their subjective assessment of the knowledge of public opinion in the region on the expected shape of the energy policy. From the findings, it can be concluded that more in-depth research is needed on the preparation of local governments to shape energy policy at the local level, including more detailed research on how opinions of the inhabitants of a given region and the specificity of a given region are taken into account while shaping local energy policy. © 2021 by the authors.

The infection strategy used by the fungus comprises a magnificent set of tools to penetrate and overcome plant defenses. In this context, the plant-pathogen communication through membrane receptors and signal transduction cascades is essential to trigger specific routes and the final success of the infection. In previous reports, proteomics approaches to B. cinerea signal transduction cascades changes in response to different carbon source and plant-based elicitors have been performed. Analyzing the secretome, membranome, phospho-proteome, and the phosphomembranome. Moreover, phenotypic changes in fungal biology was analyzed, specifically toxin production. To obtain the whole picture of the process and reveal the network from a system biology approach, this proteomic information has been merged with the phenotypic characterization, to be analyzed using several bioinformatics algorithms (GO, STRING, MCODE) in order to unravel key points in the signal transduction regulation crucial to overcome plant defenses, as well as new virulence/pathogenicity factors that could be used as therapeutic targets in the control of the gray mold rot disease. A total of 1721 and 663 exclusive or overexpressed proteins were identified under glucose (GLU) and deproteinized tomato cell walls (TCW), summarizing all of the protein identifications under phenotypic characterized stages. Under GO analysis, there are more biological process and molecular functions described in GLU, highlighting the increase in signaling related categories. These results agree with the high number of total identified proteins in GLU, probably indicating a more varied and active metabolism of the fungus. When analyzing only GO annotations related with signal transduction, it was revealed that there were proteins related to TOR signaling, the phosphorelay signal transduction system, and inositol lipid-mediated signaling, only under GLU conditions. On the contrary, calcium-mediated signaling GO annotation is only present between the proteins identified under TCW conditions. To establish a potential relationship between expressed proteins, cluster analyses showed 41 and 14 clusters under GLU and TCW conditions, confirming an increase in biological activity in GLU, where we identified a larger number of clusters related to transcription, translation, and cell division, between others. From these analyses, clusters related to signal transduction and clusters related to mycotoxin production were found, which correlated with the phenotypic characterization. The identification of the proteins encompassed in each condition and signal transduction cascade would provide the research community with new information about the B. cinerea infection process and potential candidates of pathogenicity/virulence factors, overcoming plant defenses, and new therapeutic targets. © 2021 by the authors.

On average, 61% of plants per site (all species combined) survived and 77% of the species planted persisted after the first summer post-planting. Rates of survival varied considerably among plant species, with differences in outcomes evident across bioregions. Overall, the survival of plantings (all species combined) was greater at sites with higher mean annual rainfall and where plants were protected by guards. Widespread adoption of monitoring will assist project managers to better understand how plants survive and grow, and to adaptively manage revegetation programmes under a changing climate.

Current operating systems rely on optical data that are constrained by persistent cloud-cover conditions in tropical regions. Synthetic aperture radar data represent an alternative to this technical constraint. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three machine learning algorithms applied to multitemporal pairs of COSMO-SkyMed images to detect timber exploitation in a forest concession located in the Jamari National Forest, Rondônia State, Brazilian Amazon. The studied algorithms included random forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), and multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN). The geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of logged trees and the LiDAR point clouds before and after selective logging were used as ground truths. The best results were obtained when the MLP-ANN was applied with 50 neurons in the hidden layer, using the ReLu activation function and SGD weight optimizer, presenting 88% accuracy both for the pair of images used for training (images acquired in June and October) of the network and in the generalization test, applied on a second dataset (images acquired in January and June).

Previous studies of the emission reduction effects of carbon trading policies focused mostly on the reduction of carbon source emissions, and there is a lack of research from the comprehensive perspective of carbon sources and carbon sinks. Understanding the effect of carbon trading policies on emission reduction from the perspective of CELU may help to improve the evaluation system of carbon trading policies, as well as provide important implications for the construction of China’s carbon trading market in the context of global carbon neutrality. Here, based on China’s current carbon-trading pilot areas, quasi-natural experiments were conducted by using the CELU data from 2005 to 2017, the synthetic control method (SCM) and the mediation effect model, aiming to empirically study the reduction effect and mechanism of carbon trading policies on CELU. The following main findings were obtained. (1) Carbon trading policies have had a significant reduction effect on the average CELU of the pilot areas by at least four million tons per year during the study period. (2) The carbon emission reduction effect of carbon trading policies has certain regional heterogeneity. (3) Carbon trading policies reduce CELU through the intermediate effect of energy structure, whose contribution rate reaches 30.433%. (4) Carbon trading policies did not achieve the Porter effect of technological progress during the study period, and technological progress has no significant intermediate effect on the reduction of CELU by carbon trading policy. Based on the above findings, the following policy implications can be proposed. Carbon trading and carbon offset should be studied from a comprehensive perspective of land use; regional heterogeneity should be considered when promoting the carbon emission trading system nationwide; and the energy structure should be optimized continuously. © 2021 by the authors.

In our scenario called Integrated Cycles for Urban Biomass (ICU), biowaste is degraded on-site into biogas that is converted into heat and electricity. Nitrification processes upgrade the liquid fermentation residues to refined fertilizer, which can be used subsequently in house-internal gardens to produce fresh food for residents. Our research aims to assess the ICU scenario regarding produced amounts of biogas and food, saved CO2 emissions and costs, and social–cultural aspects. Therefore, a model-based feasibility study was performed assuming a building with 100 residents. The calculations show that the ICU concept produces 21% of the annual power (electrical and heat) consumption from the accumulated biowaste and up to 7.6 t of the fresh mass of lettuce per year in a 70 m² professional hydroponic production area. Furthermore, it saves 6468 kg CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) per year. While the ICU concept is technically feasible, it becomes economically feasible for large-scale implementations and higher food prices. Overall, this study demonstrates that the ICU implementation can be a worth-while contribution towards a sustainable CO2-neutral society and decrease the demand for agricultural land. © 2021 by the authors.

Ten clusters are identified with the Ward algorithm in a hierarchical-agglomerative method. The results underline a further need for RES expansion projects in order to close the gap between supply and demand. Only then, bioenergy can effectively balance the offset and support a truly self-sufficient local energy system. While the model results indicate that the majority of the counties are suitable for further expansion, this suitability is to be questioned in cluster 10. High population density is a critical characteristic, because with it come both a high demand and limited sites for further RES expansion projects. © 2021 by the authors.

Zhundong coal with a high content of alkali metal can enhance the reburning process. In this paper, the influence of sodium and a defect on NO heterogeneous adsorption was studied by the density functional theory, and the thermodynamic characteristic was also analyzed. The results indicate that the binding energy for NO adsorption on the pristine graphene surface (graphene-NO), Na-decorated pristine graphene surface (graphene-Na-NO), defect graphene surface (gsv-NO) and Na-decorated defect graphene (gsv-Na-NO) is −5.86, −137.12, −48.94 and −74.85 kJ/mol, respectively, and that the heterogeneous adsorption is an exothermic reaction. Furthermore, except for covalent bonds of C and N, C and O for gsv-NO, other interactions are a closed-shell one, based on the analysis of AIM, ELF and IGM. The area of electron localization for NO is graphene-Na-NO &gt; gsv-Na-NO &gt; gsv-NO &gt; graphene-NO. The dispersion interaction is the main interaction force between NO and the pristine graphene surface. The δg index for the atom pairs about N–C and O–C on the pristine graphene surface is also the smallest. The density of spikes at graphene-Na-NO is bigger than that at gsv-Na-NO. Moreover, the thermodynamics characteristic showed that the reaction equilibrium constant of graphene-NO is less than those on the other surfaces under the same temperature. Thus, NO on the pristine graphene surface is the most difficult to adsorb, but the presence of sodium and a defect structure can promote its adsorption. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on panel data for 271 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2016, this paper uses the dynamic spatial fixed‐effects Durbin model to analyze the correlation between FDI and PM2.5 pollution and the effect of FDI on urban PM2.5 concentrations, as mediated by industrial structure transfor-mation, which is clarified using Stata/SE 16.0. The results showed that PM2.5 pollution in China has significant spatial spillover effects, and the pollution haven hypothesis is applicable to Chinese cit-ies. The industrial structure partially mediates the relationship between FDI and PM2.5. This paper proposes that local governments should promote the market‐oriented reform of FDI to create a more convenient, legalized, and international environment for FDI and innovate the governance philos-ophy of only reducing the existing emissions.

In addition, the process of soil mineral fragmentation and aggregation, as an event closely related to the cold climate, plays an irreplaceable role in reconstructing the climatic conditions of a certain area and a certain period of time and has important referential significance for the restoration of historical permafrost boundaries and the study of climate change. Therefore, in order to better study the effect of freeze–thaw cycles on the fragmentation and aggregation of soil mineral particles, four soil specimens were selected for this study; the freeze–thaw cycle tests were carried out 0, 3, 6, 9, 50, and 100 times, respectively, and the test results were analyzed. The results of these experiments indicate that (1) after freeze–thaw cycles, the changes in grain-size distribution are different in various soil types, and the changes are mainly concentrated in 0.001–0.1 mm; (2) the coarse particle size particles (sand, silt) can be fragmented into relatively fine-grained particles (silt, clay). The fine-grained particles (clay) cannot undergo fragmentation, and the decrease in clay is due to its aggregation; (3) with the increase in freeze–thaw cycles, the fraction change trend of four specimens is parallel to the x-axis, which means the fragmentation and aggregation of soil mineral particles are in a state of equilibrium or balance; (4) the increase in the Kvar value indicates the change in grain-size distribution, which means aggregation and fragmentation of soil mineral particles. After the 100th cycle, the Kvar value of four specimens is &lt;0.1, which belongs to a low-intensity area; (5) the freeze–thaw cycle will change the type of soil, and after 100 freeze–thaw cycles, the soil type of specimen (H) changes from silty clay loam to silty clay; (6) during the freeze–thaw process, different types of soil have different situations of aggregation and fragmentation. © 2021 by the authors.

Maximizing green energy to meet the demand reduces the burden on conventional power plants, hence lesser burning and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. For this purpose, this study draws a relationship between tracking schemes of the PV systems to GHG mitigation potential. The best fit location for detailed analyses is selected among the 15 most populous cities of Australia. The solar radiation potential is increased to 7.78 kWh/m2/d through dual axes tracking compared to 7.54, 6.82, 5.94, 5.73 kWh/m2/d through the one axis, azimuth based, fixed‐tilted, and fixed‐horizontal surface schemes, respectively. Through the dual axes tracking scheme, a 1MW PV system per annum energy output avoids the burning of 796,065.3 L of gasoline, 4308.7 barrels of crude oil which is equal to the mitigation of 1852.7 tCo2 equivalent GHGs. Concisely, the PV system, through its green energy out-put, can avoid the release of greenhouse gases from fossil‐fuel plants to tackle climate change more effectively. © 2021 by the authors.

In the present study, the atmospheric Hg emission inventory in Thailand was developed using a bottom-up approach. To reflect the emitting behaviors of various Hg sources in Thailand in 2018, activity data specific to individual sources were collected, and emission factors were obtained from local sources or adapted from the literature with proper adjustments. It was found that about 4,337.8 kg of anthropogenic Hg was emitted: 52 % from biomass open burning and 40 % from combustion sources. Mercury speciation was also investigated. Hg0 was found to be dominant at 73 %, followed by Hg2+ at 18 % and HgP at 9 %. Maps were produced using the Spatial Geographic Information System, which showed that the emissions were relatively dense in the Central region of Thailand where most industrial activities take place and in the Northern and Northwestern regions as a result of biomass open burning. Hg emissions were also observed to mainly take place during the early months of the year, particularly in March and April. These two months were determined to account for 47 % of the total annual emissions of Hg, mostly due to increased combustion activities and biomass open burning. The output of the present work is a Hg emission database that can serve as model to investigate the status of Hg and the risks it poses to human health and ecosystems as well as support policy makers in developing emission control strategies. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Anthropogenic; Emissions inventory; Mercury; Thailand",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113699578

This parameter is essential for air dispersion modeling, mitigating air pollution, i.e., reducing harmful effects on human health, and potential site selection for establishing new industries. Five-year (2015–2019) mean monthly, seasonal, and annual maps of ventilation coefficient (VC) and air pollution potential index (APPI) were prepared for the first time for India using the inputs from daily data of planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) derived using CrIS onboard SOUMI-NPP satellite and wind speed from ERA-5. Climatology of VC and APPI over 14 cities in India was also analyzed. Below medium to very low pollution potential (VC: 6000 to &gt; 10,000 m2/s) has been observed at the east coast of Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu (TN) during the winter and most of western India and New Delhi during the summer monsoon. During pre-monsoon, western Gujarat, southwest of Rajasthan, and parts of Indo-Gangetic Plains show below medium to low pollution potential. Below medium pollution potential is observed at the east coast of TN during the post-monsoon season. Annual averages of VC and APPI suggest east coastal TN and western Gujarat consistently are below medium to very low pollution potential zone, indicating their suitability for setting up new industries. Annual average VC shows the cities with increasing pollution potential as Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Patna, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Varanasi, Kolkata, Kanpur, Lucknow, New Delhi, Nagpur, and Rourkela. This information is helpful to the regulatory authorities to prioritize the air pollution mitigation measures in different cities.

Although some studies on biogenic VOCs and aerosols have been conducted, their environmental effects at the community scale are uncertain, particularly in suburban areas where abundant vegetation and pollutants coexist. Simple data processing methods cannot well address complex environmental conditions, whereas the long short-term memory (LSTM) model can learn relationships between research objects autonomously, thus enabling the analysis of influencing factors. Therefore, we collected 11 indicators of isoprene and submicron aerosol (PM1) concentrations, as well as other pollutants and meteorological factors, for six consecutive months in a suburban plantation in Shanghai. On the basis of correlation and redundancy analyses, LSTM was used to determine the main environmental factors influencing isoprene and PM1 concentrations. The results showed that nitrogen oxides (NOX), O3, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and temperature had the highest influence. The reactions between NOX, O3, and isoprene, PM1 are complex, and high levels of both isoprene and NOX in suburban areas may favor O3 production. PAR and temperature control the emission and photooxidation of isoprene and influence their conversion from a gaseous state to a particulate state. Considering the complex atmospheric environment, this study analyzed the sensitivity of isoprene and PM1 to environmental factors by artificial intelligence method.

Here, the CHL of the state of a W atom is manipulated experimentally by adjusting the emission rate of a resonant fluorescence channel with the assistance of an x-ray thin-film planar cavity. The enhanced emission rate is linearly accelerated by the photonic density of states inside the cavity, which can be directly controlled by adjusting the cavity field amplitude through choosing different cavity modes or changing the angle offset in experiment. This experimental observation is in good agreement with the prediction of a developed theoretical model. It is found that the manipulated resonant fluorescence channel can even dominate the CHL. The controllable CHL realized here will facilitate the nonlinear investigations and modern x-ray scattering techniques in the hard x-ray region. © 2021 Published by the American Physical Society",,"X ray scattering; X rays; Cavity field; Cavity mode; Core-hole lifetime; Emission rates; Enhanced Emission; Photonic density of state; Planar cavities; Theoretical modeling; Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113599252

The complexes exhibit absorption bands stretching up to the edge of the visible domain due to ligand → ligand charge transfer (LLCT) transitions and strong emission at room temperature in the visible due to radiative deactivation of 3LLCT state having lifetime within 1.0–3.0 ns. The stilbene motifs in the complexes undergo trans to cis isomerization upon irradiating with UV and visible light accompanied by significant alteration of their absorption, emission, and 1H NMR spectral profiles. Apart from the variation of electron donating and electron withdrawing substituent (X), the isomerization studies were also carried out in three different solvents (DCM, MeCN, and DMSO) to further tune their kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. The rate, rate constant and quantum yield of isomerization were estimated in all the solvents. The reverse process (cis to trans) also occurs very slowly on keeping but could be accelerated upon heating. Trans to cis photoisomerization leads to quenching of emission in case of 1 and 2, whereas backward thermal cis to trans conversion leads to restoration of emission. By contrast, for the nitro-derivative (3) forward process induces emission enhancement, while backward process gives rise to emission quenching. In essence, “on–off” and “off–on” emission switching is feasible for 1 and 2, whereas “off–on” and “on–off” emission switching occurs in case of 3. Emission spectral responses upon successive action of photonic and thermal input lead to the fabrication of INHIBIT and IMPLICATION logic gates. DFT and TD-DFT computational investigations were also undertaken to visualize their electronic structures, correct assignment of the spectral bands, and mode of isomerization process.

The environmental supervision system mainly uses the four functions of supervision, investigation, coordination, and emergency response to strengthen environmental protection supervision and law enforcement, respond to environmental emergencies, and coordinate cross-regional pollution disputes. As an important system design for China to control environmental pollution and promote the ecological transformation of economic development, the policy effect of the environmental supervision system deserves attention. This paper uses the difference-in-differences method to investigate the impact of the top-down environmental supervision system on air quality based on the 2000-2016 data for 285 prefecture-level cities in China. The results indicate that the annual average concentration of PM2.5 decreased significantly after the implementation of the environmental supervision system. The dynamic analysis shows that PM2.5 decreased most markedly in the first year after the implementation of the policy, and then the effect gradually weakened. Mechanism analysis suggests that the environmental supervision system can break the collusion between government and enterprise, encourage enterprises to carry out technological innovation, change pollutant discharge behavior and push local governments to adjust the industrial structure, enhance environmental protection awareness to reduce the PM2.5 concentration, and improve air quality. Comparing different regions, the PM2.5 in East China, North China and Northeast China are relatively high, and the pressure for air pollution control is great. Meanwhile, we find that the environmental supervision system has a significant station effect. Compared with other cities, the cities where the environmental supervision centers are located are more deterred by the environmental supervision, and their air quality has improved to a significantly greater degree. In the future, we should further strengthen the environmental supervision of high-pollution areas and non-station cities, and pay more attention to improving the long-term effect of the environmental supervision system. © 2021, Science Press.

In addition, it is the rate-determining step that decides sensor’s response. In this study, in-situ bulk AC, DC and surface electronic conductivities of CaCO3 + Li2CO3 binary solid electrolyte were investigated at different temperatures and CO2 gas partial pressures using complex impedance spectroscopy, Wagner’s DC polarization technique and four-probe method, respectively. For the four-probe conductivity measurements with crucial requirement of high temperatures and test gas variations, a customized sample holder was designed and fabricated having gold-plated equidistant, spring-loaded electrodes and localized heating system (maximum 593 K). The AC bulk conductivity was found to decrease with rise in CO2 gas concentration (from 0.1 to 100%) by about two orders and one order of magnitudes at lower and higher temperatures, respectively. Similarly, surface conductivity variation with temperature also showed Arrhenius behaviour for both the concentrations of CO2 viz. 0.04 and 10%, giving lower value of activation enthalpy for lower CO2 concentration. The surface conductivity change in the presence of different concentrations of CO2 gas is justified by comparing with AC bulk conductivity measurements at different CO2 partial pressures and DC conductivity along with sensing response. The mechanism is explained using activated charge transfer data. The range of Ea values on adsorption of CO2 gas was found to be in the electronic excitation window, suggesting involvement of a new parameter to be investigated for non-Nernstian response of EC sensors. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.","Charge transfer reaction; complex impedance spectroscopy; electrochemical CO2 gas sensor; solid electrolyte; surface conductivity","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Electric conductivity; Electric conductivity measurement; Electron transport properties; Gas detectors; Gases; Gold plating; Probes; Solid electrolytes; Activation enthalpies; Complex impedance spectroscopy; Conductivity measurements; Electronic excitation; Governing parameters; Rate determining step; Surface conductivity; Surface electronic conductivity; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113517575

This is pertinent, given its inherent implications for environmental sustainability. This study explores the growth impact of international tourist arrivals on quality of the environment in terms of a causality relationship for 16 selected Mediterranean countries by a multivariate framework; this is based on tourism-led growth and the tourism-induced pollutant emissions model for annual data from 1995 to 2014. Our model, therefore, explores the dynamic causal links between tourism, growth, energy, and the environment. We employ the panel causality technique (Emirmahmutoglu and Kose 2011) that allows for heterogeneity and correlations across cross-sections. The data shows correlation among international tourism, economic growth, energy consumption, and pollutant emission. The findings from the causality analysis support the evidence on tourism-induced pollutant emissions and energy consumption as well as the validity of the tourism-led growth hypothesis. The findings also suggest that international tourism is a catalyst for energy consumption and economic growth, which translates into pollutant emissions, implying insightful policy prescriptions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; panel data; policy implementation; tourism development; tourism market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113450495

However, the availability of electrified commercial vehicles like waste collection vehicles is still limited, despite their significant contribution to urban emissions. Moreover, there is a lack of clarity whether electric waste collection vehicles can persist in real world conditions and which system design is required. Therefore, we introduce a multi-agent-based simulation methodology to investigate the technical feasibility and evaluate environmental and economic sustainability of an electrified urban waste collection. We present a synthetic model for waste collection demand on a per-link basis, using open available data. The tour planning is solved by an open-source algorithm as a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This generates plausible tours which handle the demand. The generated tours are simulated with an open-source transport simulation (MATSim) for both the diesel and the electric waste collection vehicles. To compare the life cycle costs, we analyze the data using total cost of ownership (TCO). Environmental impacts are evaluated based on a Well-to-Wheel approach. We present a comparison of the two propulsion types for the exemplary use case of Berlin. And we are able to generate a suitable planning to handle Berlin’s waste collection demand using battery electric vehicles only. The TCO calculation reveals that the electrification raises the total operator cost by 16–30%, depending on the scenario and the battery size with conservative assumptions. Furthermore, the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) can be reduced by 60–99%, depending on the carbon footprint of electric power generation. © 2021 by the authors.

Most predictions of changes in phenology and the consequences for ecology and conservation are based on research in temperate systems. Climate-driven changes in phenology are largely undocumented in subtropical regions, which host much of the world's biodiversity. Factors important to regulating phenology in temperate systems (e.g. winter chilling requirements) are likely weak or absent in subtropical ecosystems; plant phenology in these regions could respond to climate differently than in the temperate zone. Here we examine flowering phenology data for 105 plant species based on herbarium specimens and photographs from 1911 to 2015 in the southern subtropical Nanling region in south China. Temperatures in this region warmed 0.3°C over the 105-year study period, and most plant species flowered earlier over time, although species varied substantially in the magnitude of phenological response to warming temperatures. Spring flowering times advanced in response to warming temperatures in late summer and early autumn and in early spring, with late summer and early autumn temperatures having almost twice as strong an effect on spring flowering times as early spring temperatures (−4.7 versus −2.5 days °C−1). This strong effect of late summer and early autumn temperatures is very different from temperate systems and has substantial implications for anticipating future changes in phenology. The temperatures in late summer and early autumn may affect spring phenology by accelerating bud formation or initial growth. Warming January temperature delayed summer flowering and advanced winter flowering. Increases in precipitation during April to June also tended to delay summer flowering. Autumn flowering species showed inconsistent responses to warming. These results highlight important differences between climate-driven changes in phenology in temperate and subtropical areas. Understanding these differences will be important in understanding the effects of climate change on vegetation phenology and ecosystem processes. © 2021 The Authors.

Yet actual policies in the real world, especially in large federal governments, are often highly heterogeneous and vary in political support and administrative capabilities within a country. While the benefits of heterogeneous action have been discussed widely for experimentation and leadership, little is known about its costs. Focusing on the United States, we represent plausible variation (by more than a factor of 3) in the stringency of state-led climate policy in a process-based integrated assessment model (GCAM-USA). For a wide array of national decarbonization targets, we find that the nationwide cost from heterogeneous subnational policies is only one-tenth higher than nationally uniform policies. Such results hinge on two critical technologies (advanced biofuels and electricity) for which inter-state trade ameliorates the economic efficiencies that might arise with heterogeneous action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; environmental policy; federal system; government; pollution policy; pollution tax; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113400129

In this paper, we deepen the conceptualization of the industrial system transition to decarbonization, dematerialization, and sustainable industrial production. Aided by fuzzy cognitive maps that use perception-based data from stakeholders to model complex and difficult-to-model systems, we chart the pathways for industrial system transition. The industrial system transition entails interactions between dematerialization and decarbonization goals while enabling governance and systemic corporate strategies. The respondents of the fuzzy cognitive maps-based surveys comprised practitioners from companies, authors, and the policymaking community. Fuzzy cognitive map-based simulations reveal that resorting to technical measures of dematerialization and decarbonization is insufficient to accomplish industrial system transition. The efficient industrial system transition to dematerialization and decarbonization requires the combined measures of (i) dematerialization and decarbonization, (ii) governance, policies, and regulations (effective governance including transnational governance, technology push, market-pull, technology transfer and financial flows, carbon price and carbon market; and (iii) enabling corporate strategies (regenerative and conscious capitalism, a new conception of transparency, and collaborative and constructive lobbying). Large companies are mostly transnational entities, necessitating the adoption of effective transnational governance strategies for achieving the objectives of dematerialization and decarbonization. Several transnational governance networks have partnered under the public–private co-governance mechanism in the decarbonization space dominated by mainly larger players. The advent of polycentric governance provides new opportunities for trans-local governance where large numbers of small and medium enterprises can participate in the advancement of at least decarbonization objectives; however, such networks require support from national governments. Besides implications for governance, policy and regulations, the findings of this research could also have implications for corporate behavior in terms of promoting conscious and transparent organizational culture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Decarbonization; Dematerialization; Environmental governance; Environmental strategy; Sustainable production","conceptual framework; corporate strategy; global warming; industrial structure; research; stakeholder; technology transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113383350

Significant advances have already been achieved in understanding how some characteristics of copper electrodes, the current state-of-the-art catalyst for multi‑carbon formation via CO2RR, affect the product spectrum. Advances and insights have been reported for, among others, the effect of crystallographic orientation, active surface area, and composition of M‑copper (M = Au, Ag, Zn, etc.) materials, and how these alter the distribution of CO2RR products. However, a systematic study evaluating the significance of these variables in the CO2RR to C2+ products is still lacking in the literature and represents an important step in the development of new materials with optimized properties that can be more selective to C2+ compounds. In this paper, we have systematically investigated the effect of the roughness factor, chemical composition, and surface morphology of CuxZny electrocatalysts on the product distribution during CO2RR. Firstly, Cu, Cu90Zn10, and Cu75Zn25 electrodes were exposed to oxidation-reduction cycles to produce Cu and CuxZny electrodes with different morphologies, roughness factors, and chemical composition. Our results show that an increase in the roughness factor and Zn content lead to higher faradaic efficiency (FE) to C2+ products. Furthermore, the influence of the nanoscale morphology is imperative for the production of C2+ compounds. Specifically, nanocubes of Cu and CuxZny presented the highest FE to C2+ products among the different surface morphologies studied in this work (polished flat surface, nanosheres, nanocubes, nanodendrites, and nanocauliflowers), showing that C–C coupling during CO2RR is mainly shape dependent. © 2020 The Author(s)","CO2 electroreduction; Cu; CuZn; Roughness factor; Shape","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Copper; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Morphology; Surface morphology; Chemical compositions; Chemical surfaces; CO$-2$/ reduction; CO2 electroreduction; Cu; Electrocatalytic; Faradaic efficiencies; Nanocubes; Roughness factor; Shape; Surface roughness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113344975

Studying the law of dust diffusion in local areas is of great significance for the atmospheric particulate control. In this study, a pile of sodium carbonate in a large open-air pile in Weifang, China, is regarded as the research object. The dispersion characteristics of dust particles around the pile under the action of unidirectional wind are studied through wind tunnel test and numerical simulation. The complex atmospheric environment is simplified as unidirectional wind, and the influence of different wind speeds on the dispersion of particles with diverse sizes in the pile is studied. Although a large gap exists between the assumption and the real atmospheric environment, this study provides a reference for the evaluation of the pollution scope of blowing dust and prevention and control of pollution. Results show that a high-concentration range of the dust exists near the pile behind the wind direction and may continue to spread to the height due to the influence of a whirlpool, and the dispersion distance and width can increase with the increase in wind speed. The increase in particle diameter increases the kinetic energy loss of particles for the fluid. Under the same starting speed, the dispersion distance of dust decreases with the increase in particle diameter. With the increase in particle diameter, the dust concentration distribution presents the trend of interior hollowing and high-concentration area fragmenting. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dust particle dispersion; Large open-air piles; Numerical simulation; Particle diameter; Wind speed; Wind tunnel test","concentration (composition); dust; kinetic energy; pollution control; wind direction; wind tunnel; China; Shandong; Weifang; air pollutant; air pollution; China; diffusion; dust; environmental monitoring; particle size; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Diffusion; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113341726

Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering on croplands (ERW) is a NET with co-benefits for agriculture, soils and ocean acidification that creates opportunities for generating income unaffected by diminishing carbon taxes as emissions approach net-zero. Here we show that ERW deployment with croplands to deliver net 2 Gt CO2 yr-1 removal approximately doubles the probability of meeting the Paris 1.5 °C target at 2100 from 23% to 42% in a high mitigation Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 baseline climate. Carbon removal via carbon capture and storage (CCS) at the same rate had an equivalent effect. Co-deployment of ERW and CCS tripled the chances of meeting a 1.5 °C target (from 23% to 67%), and may be sufficient to reverse about one third of the surface ocean acidification effect caused by increases in atmospheric CO2 over the past 200 years. ERW increased the percentage of coral reefs above an aragonite saturation threshold of 3.5 from 16% to 39% at 2100, higher than CCS, highlighting a co-benefit for marine calcifying ecosystems.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) pp 659-740). For both GHGs, the present-day budget is dominated by anthropogenic emissions (Friedlingstein P et al 2019 Earth Syst. Sci. Data 11 1783-838; Saunois M et al 2020 Earth Syst. Sci. Data 12 1561-623).

Here, we investigate the evolution of atmospheric methane until 3000 CE under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, for the first time using a methane-enabled state-of-the-art Earth System Model (ESM). We find that natural methane emissions, i.e. methane emissions from the biosphere, rise strongly as a reaction to climate warming, thus leading to atmospheric methane concentrations substantially higher than assumed in the scenarios used for CMIP6.

Many studies have demonstrated that improved air quality and reduced carbon emissions have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, questions remain regarding changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations because of the complex cycles involving the interaction of CO2 with the natural environment. In this study, we compared the changes in urban CO2 enhancement (△CO2) reflecting the contribution of local CO2 emissions to the atmospheric CO2 in urban areas, according to the intensity of social distancing policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Seoul, South Korea. We used data from three CO2 ground observation sites in the central area of Seoul and outside the urban area of Seoul. By comparing the urban CO2 concentration in Seoul with that of the background area using two different methods, considering both vertical and horizontal differences in CO2 concentration, we quantified the △CO2 of the pre-COVID-19 period and two COVID-19 periods, during which intensive social distancing policies with different intensities were implemented (Level 1, Level 2.5). During the pre-COVID-19 period, the average △CO2 calculated using the two methods was 24.82 ppm, and it decreased significantly to 16.42 and 14.36 ppm during the Level 1 and Level 2.5 periods, respectively. In addition, the urban contribution of Seoul to atmospheric CO2 concentration decreased from 5.27% during the pre-COVID-19 period to 3.54% and 3.19% during the Level 1 and Level 2.5 periods, respectively. The results indicate that the social distancing policies implemented in Seoul resulted in reduced local CO2 emissions, leading to a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration.

While more advanced cameras developed in recent years have led to lower uncertainties in measuring gas concentrations, a systematic analysis of the uncertainties associated with leak rate estimation have been overlooked. We present a systematic categorization of the involved uncertainties with a focus on a theoretical analysis of projection uncertainties that are inherent to this technique. The projection uncertainties are then quantified using Large Eddy Simulation experiments of a point source release into the atmosphere. Our results show that while projection uncertainties are typically about 5% of the emission rate, low acquisition times and observation of the gas plume at small distances from the emission source (<10 m) can amount to errors of about 20%. Further, we found that acquisition times on the order of tens of seconds are sufficient to significantly reduce (>50%) the projection uncertainties. These findings suggest robust procedures on how to reduce projection uncertainties, however, a balance between other sources of uncertainty due to operational conditions and the employed instrumentation are required to outline more practical guidelines. © 2021 by the authors.

Coal chemical looping gasification (CCLG) is a promising coal utilization technology to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction targets for highly pure synthesis gas. As a downstream product of synthesis gas, methyl methacrylate (MMA), is widely used as raw material for synthesizing polymethyl methacrylate and resin products with excellent properties. So this paper proposes a novel system integrating MMA production and CCLG (CCLG-MMA) processes aiming at “energy saving and low emission”, in which the synthesis gas produced by CCLG and purified by dry methane reforming (DMR) reaction and Rectisol process reacts with ethylene for synthesizing MMA. Firstly, the reaction mechanism of CCLG is investigated by using Reactive force field (ReaxFF) MD simulation based on atomic models of char and oxygen carrier (Fe2O3) for obtaining optimum reaction temperature of fuel reactor (FR). Secondly, the steady-state simulation of CCLG-MMA system is carried out to verify the feasibility of MMA production. The amount of CO2 emitted by CCLG process and DMR reaction is 0.0028 (kg CO2)−1·(kg MMA)−1. The total energy consumption of the CCLG-MMA system is 45521 kJ·(kg MMA)−1, among which the consumption of MMA production part is 25293 kJ·(kg MMA)−1. The results show that the CCLG-MMA system meets CO2 emission standard and has lower energy consumption compared to conventional MMA production process. Finally, one control scheme is designed to verify the stability of CCLG-MMA system. The CCLG-MMA integration strategy aims to obtain highly pure MMA from multi-scale simulation perspectives, so this is an optimal design regarding all factors influencing cleaner MMA production. © 2021 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China","CCLG-MMA system simulation; Plant wide control; ReaxFF MD simulation; Sensitivity analysis","Acrylic monomers; Air purification; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Coal; Coal deposits; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Esters; Ethylene; Gasification; Hematite; Polymethyl methacrylates; Reforming reactions; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Dry-methane reforming; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Methyl methacrylates; Multi-scale simulation; Optimum reaction temperature; Reactive force field; Steady-state simulations; Total energy consumption; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113296375

While the discourse is still rather muted in Nigeria, this study will contribute to the ongoing effort to raise public awareness regarding green building development and the potential benefits by evaluating the opinion of professionals regarding the subject matter. Structured questionnaires were distributed among five different professions in the built environment and information sourced includes the level/mode of awareness, benefits and bottleneck, and support for its development. The survey results showed that 43.48% of the professionals advocated for the development of green construction in Nigeria. The benefits and bottlenecks were ranked according to their perceived importance. The study recommends public enlightenment on green education, enforcement of mandatory training, formulation and implementation of policies directed towards green building acceptability.

Understanding these trends is central to the design of current and future climate change mitigation policies, requiring up-to-date methodologically robust emission inventories such as the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), the European Commission's in-house, independent global emission inventory. EDGAR is a key tool to track the evolution of GHG emissions and contributes to quantifying the global carbon budget, providing independent and systematically calculated emissions for all countries. According to the results of the EDGAR v.5.0 release, total anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions (excluding land use, land use change and forestry) were estimated at 49.1 Gt CO2eq in 2015, 50 % higher than in 1990, despite a monotonic decrease in GHG emissions per unit of economic output. Between 1990 and 2015, emissions from developed countries fell by 9%, while emissions from low to medium income countries increased by 130%, predominantly from 2000 onwards. The 27 Member States of the European Union and the United Kingdom led the pathway for emission reductions in industrialised economies whilst, in developing countries, the rise in emissions was driven by higher emissions in China, India, Brazil and nations in the South-East Asian region. This diversity of patterns shows how different patterns for GHG emissions are and the need for identifying regionally tailored emission reduction measures. © 2021 The Author(s)","EDGAR v.5.0; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sectorial greenhouse gas emissions; Socio-economic changes; Technological transitions","climate change; emission control; environmental technology; European Union; global change; greenhouse gas; mitigation; regulatory approach; socioeconomic impact; trend analysis; Brazil; China; India; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113256779

This study evaluates the global impact of lockdowns on air pollutants using tropospheric and ground-level indicators over a five-month period. Moreover, the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 cases and mortalities was examined. Changes in the global tropospheric (NO2, aerosols, and O3) and ground-level (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3) pollutants were observed, and the maximum air quality improvement was observed immediately after lockdown. Except for a few countries, a decline in air pollutants correlated with a reduction in Land Surface Temperature (LST). Notably, regions with higher tropospheric NO2 and aerosol concentrations were also COVID-19 hotspots. Our analysis showed moderate positive correlation for NO2 with COVID-19 cases (R2 = 0.33; r = 0.57, P = 0.006) and mortalities (R2 = 0.40; r = 0.63, P = 0.015), while O3 showed a weak-moderate positive correlation with COVID-19 cases (R2 = 0.22; r = 0.47, P = 0.003) and mortalities (R2 = 0.12; r = 0.35, P = 0.012). However, PM2.5, and PM10 showed no significant correlation with either COVID-19 cases or mortality.

How could a more flexible compensation scheme, that would improve the efficiency of the GFGP, be designed? Using China's Loess Plateau region as a case study, we developed ordinary panel and panel threshold models to examine the effects of the GFGP on vegetation recovery, as well as the relationship between local economic growth and vegetation cover change, from 2002 to 2017. We found that a combination of climate warming and humidification contributed the most to vegetation recovery on the Loess Plateau, while the positive effect of the GFGP may be exaggerated. We also identified double thresholds in the effect of economic growth on vegetation change. As the relative contribution of the primary sector output to the local GDP decreased, the impact of economic growth on vegetation status changed from negative to positive, and the positive effect first increased and then decreased. These findings suggest that a new, more context-specific and market-based approach should replace the original ‘one-size-fits-all’ in the compensation scheme for the new round of the GFGP. Additional consideration should be given to contextual differences in local economic development, industrial structure, and the availability of alternative livelihood sources for the enrolled farmers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Grain for Green Program; Loess Plateau; Payment for ecosystem services; Threshold regression; Vegetation","alternative agriculture; economic development; economic growth; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental management; green economy; livelihood; vegetation cover; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113208039

Ecological restoration is a vital step for biodiversity maintenance and climate change mitigation. For restoration practice, evaluation of species performance at early stages is crucial to avoid failure of the efforts and for screening species suitable to a region. Though the long-term performance of restoration plantings has been well-documented, few studies have evaluated the performance during the establishment of the planted saplings, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Restoration efforts in Northeast India, a region experiencing high forest loss, is limited by the lack of species-specific data on survival and growth. We compared inter-specific variation in seasonal survival and growth rates (diameter and height) for multiple native rainforest species from this region. We planted 3022 saplings of 50 species at a degraded open forest site. After 18 months, sapling survival varied between 9.1-94.3% for 32 species, and only six species showed ""excellent""survival after 18 months. Eight out of 17 species that were tested for seasonal variation in survival showed significant differences in survival between seasons. While the diameter growth rate varied for species between seasons, the height growth rate was different between both species and season, but the interaction term between species and season was not significant. Certain animal-dispersed, medium to large-seeded primary forest species performed well and are vital for future restoration efforts in this region. © 2021 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.","Active restoration; Arunachal Pradesh; Sapling diameter growth rate; Sapling height growth rate; Sapling survival",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113181208

The study area possesses a diverse geographical setting and is generally an unexplored region in term of research on climatic variability. All the hydro-climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall, river discharge, and snowfall are extremely challenging to quantity in case of climate change. There should be a comprehensive study to model and measure the significant four significant hydro-climatic parameters relevant to climate change scenario i.e. rainfall, temperature, snowfall, and discharge (runoff). In this study, a fuzzy logic based-rule model was applied to assists the climatic change variability and trend prediction for all four parameters. Specifically the fuzzy logic rule-based model was used for climate change trends detection in uncertain circumstances. A case study focused on the Swat River Basin in Northern Pakistan was used for validation and calibration of this fuzzy technique in MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB).

In the case ofPinus caribaeaMorelet, reproduction limits the species suitability, decreasing towards southernmost latitudes where dry conditions increase. Context: Caribbean pine is an ecologically and economically important species planted in all the tropical regions of the world, where it shows optimal growth and survival but low reproduction rates. Aims: This study investigates Caribbean pine fitness-related traits, accounting for phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation, to detect co-variation among traits and predict their relationship across the tropics. Methods: I re-analysed earlier data of survival, growth, reproduction, stem quality and development stage from 25 provenances of Caribbean pine planted in 16 trials in the tropical regions in a two-step modelling approach including (i) structural equation modelling (SEM) based on the current knowledge of the species and theoretical expectations coming from other species; (ii) mixed-effects model accounting for trait-relationships as defined by SEM and allowing for trait prediction. Results: Growth, survival and reproduction showed a slight but significant provenance effect indicating population differentiation and a positive co-variation between growth and reproduction, suggesting that trees reached optimal growth before they reproduced. Models predicted low reproduction rates of Caribbean pine across the tropics, decreasing towards southern latitudes where dry conditions increased. Conclusion: This study opens new perspectives to investigate trait adaptation syndromes through phenotypic integration prediction at large geographical scales. © 2021, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Common gardens; Fitness; Growth; Mixed-effects models; Pinus caribaea Morelet; Reproduction; Species distributions; Structural equation modelling; Survival; Tropical biome","climate change; genetic differentiation; growth modeling; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; pine; reproductive phenomena; Pinus caribaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113142729

Overall, we found that while measured impacts of climate change were positively correlated with PRDs' climate-change adaptation plans and actions, most PRDs perceived few impacts of climate change on urban green spaces. We also found that levels of adaptation varied across ecoregions, with direct experiences with climate change impacts being a primary contributor to action.

Since numbers of plant invasions continue to increase globally, it is crucial to investigate the effects of multiple co-occurring alien species on native communities. Furthermore, priority effects due to the earlier emergence of certain species affecting fitness of later arriving species can shape community structure and affect native species performance. We investigate in a common garden pot experiment the interactions among five alien-native species pairs. First we focus on the effect of growing with either one or two alien neighbour species on a native plant, second we alter the arrival time of the alien or native neighbour by 3 weeks. Generally, native species performance decreased when surrounded by two alien species compared to only one, although the magnitude of this effect varied depending on species, with one species even performing better with alien neighbours than in monoculture. Species performance greatly decreased when arriving second in the pot, for both native and alien species. In contrast, alien species tended to benefit more from arriving early. Given that we studied annual ruderal species, their potentially lower competitive ability might explain why we detected negative effects of late arrival. We highlight the need to further elucidate underlying mechanisms of small-scale invasion dynamics to achieve generalisations concerning the response of multiple alien and native plants given their species-specific differences in response to neighbour species and arrival time. © 2021, The Author(s).","Competition; Invasional meltdown; Native-alien interaction; Pot experiment; Priority effect","biodiversity; community structure; ecosystem function; fitness; globalization; introduced species; native species; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; introduced species; plant; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Introduced Species; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112805917

Sequestration occurs through mineral carbonation due to the abundance in divalent minerals making them efficient geological hosts where they occur. Rapid population and industrial growth in developing countries leads to an exponential increase in their CO2 emissions, from stationary sources hence there is an imminent need for solutions to limit the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. Carbon Capture and storage (CCS) projects globally are at various stages of development majority are located in America and Europe. However, the suitability of continental basalts occurring in the East African Rift for CCS has not been assessed. Their characteristics and occurrence close to stationary CO2 sources thus limiting the high cost of transportation to far-flung locations make them ideal. Our review identified about 19 basalt groups of Miocene to Recent age (23.02 to 0.01 Ma) with thickness ranging from a few meters to 1500 m in the Kenya rift. We assessed four key parameters to determine potential CO2 sequestration sites: water availability; subsurface temperature; permeability and porosity of target formation; and accessibility to geothermal systems. Minerals such as calcic plagioclase, iron oxides and clinopyroxenes in the basalts offer the divalent elements required for carbonation. The basalts have varying porosity values ranging between 1-30%. We assessed the viability and ranked the suitability of the regions in the Kenyan rift as central Kenya rift &gt;northern Kenya rift &gt; southern Kenya rift. The environmental and financial challenges and their mitigation options of CO2 sequestration in the Kenya rift basalts have also been discussed. The challenges that CCS projects in the Kenya rift have to deal with include the impact of toxic and corrosive gases from geothermal systems, leakages through faults and fractures, induced seismicity, and economic costs. This knowledge is required for identifying areas where more site-specific assessment and modelling can be done for CCS projects in identifying carbon sequestration areas that can help slow down climate change. © 2021 The Author(s)","Basalts; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon sequestration; Climate mitigation; CO2emissions; Kenya rift",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112772964

Reducing the number of samples required to determine the impact of land management on soil carbon (C) and mineral constituents via proximal sensing techniques such as hyper-spectral radiometry can reduce the cost and personnel required to monitor changes in our natural resource base. Previously, we used an expensive, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) field spectrometer to correlate soil constituents to hyperspectral diffuse reflectance (HDR), over the 350–2500 nm (VIS-SWIR) wavelength range. This research is an extension of preceding research but focuses solely on the 400–1000 nm (VIS-NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This region can be measured using less expensive (albeit with lower SNR), miniaturized, field spectrometers that allow minimal sample preparation. Our objectives are to: (1) further evaluate the use of soil HDR in the visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) region acquired using an expensive field hyperspectral spectroradiometer for prediction of soil C and selected fractions and nitrogen (N) constituents, (2) repeat the above measurements using HDR data from samples examined in objective (1) using lower SNR hyperspectral radiometers, and (3) add to the limited literature that addresses determinations of selected soil properties using proximal sensing in the VIS-NIR region. Data analyzed in this study confirms that good to satisfactory prediction equations for soil constituents can be developed from spectral reflectance data within the 400–1000 nm wavelength region obtained using relatively inex-pensive field radiometers. This application could reduce the time and resources required to monitor gains or losses in carbon constituents, information that can be used in programing such as Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Climate-smart agriculture (CSA). © 2021 by the authors.

Analyzing data from identical survey-experiments administered in the United States, Canada, and Germany, we examine the extent to which returning revenues to the public has the potential to broaden the political acceptability of carbon taxes across ideological and national contexts. While public opinion is sensitive to the cost attributes of carbon taxes, we find that in some cases, opposition to carbon taxes can be offset by a reduction in income taxes. However, these effects tend to be modest in size, limited to some ideological groups, and varied across countries.

N2O-N emission factor (EF-N2O, % applied N emitted as N2O-N) and yield-scaled N2O-N emissions (N2O-N emitted per yield unit) for wheat, bean and black oat were determined in southern Brazil. Four EEN fertilizers were evaluated for comparison with common urea, namely: urea with urease inhibitor (Ur-NBPT), urea coated with an inorganic polymer (Ur-pol), ammonium nitrate (Nitrate), urea treated with copper and boron polymer (Ur-CuB) and control treatment with no N fertilizer. The first two EEN fertilizers were applied to all crops, the third only to wheat and the fourth to bean and black oat. None of the EEN fertilizers reduced N2O-N emissions or increased crop yields relative to common urea in winter wheat or black oat. By contrast, Ur-pol and Ur-CuB reduced N2O-N emissions in summer bean by 41 and 39%, respectively, and Ur-pol increased grain yield by 40%, relative to common urea. Although the Ur-NBPT proved efficient in decreasing soil N2O-N fluxes at an early stage, no effect was observed in the mid or long term (&gt; 12 days) and, thus, the effect on total N2O-N emissions was not significant. Our findings testify to the potential of some EEN fertilizers for decreasing N2O-N yield-scaled emissions in summer crop seasons relative to common urea, the effect having no considerable impact under the mild winter conditions.

Even the “school climate” approach, which is innovative in viewing the child in light of social influences contributing to identity and affective co-regulation, may not sufficiently illuminate the interactions among neurobiology, teaching methods, family support/networks, organizational systems, and cultural/political disruptions. In this article, we focus on Cohen and Rappaport’s complementary papers on preventing school violence. Although both papers thoughtfully consider individual and school-climate factors, a common feature in both is the replication of our cultural tendency to split the psychic domain from the social realm—to favor approaches that emphasize individual psychopathology over ones that view the individual and community as inextricably linked and mutually constitutive (Layton, 2020). Models for assessment often unconsciously favor frameworks for understanding individuals' symptoms as opposed to approaches that view symptoms as expressing the needs and troubles of both the individual and the community. We propose that the dialectical relationship between individual and community is the nexus from which we can understand the impact of family and community distress on individual psychopathology in ways that could culminate in a violent incident. We will explore how, in the context of Cohen's policy proposals and Rappaport's case study, a community psychoanalytic model can mobilize different interventions and resources. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","community psychoanalysis; community-school partnerships; implicated subject; school violence prevention; social psychoanalysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112601136

To reduce pollutant emissions, new sustainable technologies have been adopted in the transport sector. To date, no studies have conducted a technoeconomic analysis of the environmental impact of electric vehicles (EVs) in regard to taxis in Mexico. To address this gap in the research, this study aimed to perform a cost‐environmental impact assessment of electric taxi introduction in Mexico City using the life‐cycle cost (LCC) methodology and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assessment. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify parameters with the greatest influence on the LCC. The LCC of EVs was found to be larger than that of internal combustion vehicles (ICVs); the acquisition cost was identified as the greatest contributor to the total LCC, followed by the maintenance cost. Worldwide, mixed results have been reported due to differences in the use of local parameters and values. To promote EVs, it is necessary to reduce either acquisition costs or battery costs. The environmental analysis showed that there is only a slight reduction in GHG emissions with electric taxi introduction.

Bush Heritage’s Victorian reserves have experienced eucalypt dieback probably due to intense drought and heat shock linked to climate change. Planned revegetation on the Nardoo Hills reserve provided an opportunity to establish and test the potential for new climate-matched genotypes to expand the adaptive capacity of the plantings. As NRM practitioners, here we document our experiences in implementing this approach. Using the Climate Analogues tool and the Australasian Virtual Herbarium, we selected provenances from four climate analogue regions where remnants of our focal species, Grey Box (Eucalyptus microcarpa) and Yellow Box (E. melliodora), were located. Replicated plots were established covering five provenances for Grey Box and 5 provenances for Yellow Box with up to 10 ‘families’ (mother trees) per provenance. Numerous challenges were encountered including locating suitable provenances, the design and scientific compromises associated with the experimental layout, sourcing of adequate seed from remote regions (especially drought affected) and high mortality during seedling establishment. Monitoring nine months after planting revealed not only high overall mortality (around 70%, probably due to drought conditions during establishment) but also significant differences in height between provenances and in mortality and height among families in both species. Despite the initial mortality, the nested design and level of replication applied in these plots appear adequate to test hypotheses about the value of climate matching and will continue to be monitored in the future. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adaptation; climate-related dieback; Eucalyptus melliodora; Eucalyptus microcarpa; Nardoo Hills reserve; provenancing strategy; restoration; translocation","climate change; dieback; drought; genotype; mortality; revegetation; seedling establishment; Australia; Victoria [Australia]; Eucalyptus melliodora; Eucalyptus microcarpa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112544872

Hence, this study uses cross-sectional data from Didi, a Chinese ridesourcing service company, from 2017 to study the impact mechanism of shared mobility on haze. First, it applies the generalized spatial two-stage least squares model after controlling for urban economic, geographic, transportation, meteorological, and policy variables. We then use urbanization depth (urban agglomeration) and breadth (urban sprawl) variables, which represent the intensity and scope of human activities, respectively, as mediators to test the transmission mechanism from shared mobility to haze. Finally, differences based on urban heterogeneity were tested in the end. The study finds that the scale of ridesourcing and haze show a significant U-shaped relationship: the initial development of ridesourcing has a significant effect on reducing haze, but will then intensify haze as it develops to scales such as those of Beijing and Shenzhen. Moreover, the depth of urbanization is the main transmission mechanism of haze. This conclusion is verified in Tier 3 cities and above; however, the transmission mechanism in Tier 4 and Tier 5 cities is not obvious, indicating that the scale of ridesourcing should be compatible with the scale of urban development. Therefore, the design of emission reduction policies should be considered from the perspective of urban agglomeration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","City form; Haze; Ridesourcing; Sharing economy; Spatial spillover","agglomeration; analytical hierarchy process; economic development; emission control; environmental degradation; heterogeneity; least squares method; regional development; urban development; urbanization; China; China; city; cross-sectional study; human; mobile application; quality of life; urbanization; China; Cities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mobile Applications; Quality of Life; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112536043

The main objectives of this study are to analyse the role and interactions of anthropogenic and biogenic CO2 emission sources and sinks in the total carbon cycle within city limits, determine processes controlling urban ecosystem-atmosphere gas exchange under varying environmental conditions with a high temporal and spatial resolution. The research addressing this issue was carried out in Wroclaw, the fourth largest city in Poland, throughout the year from July 2017 to August 2018. Chamber measurements of surface-atmosphere CO2 and CO2 net fluxes across various types of land cover (grassland, city park and arable land) provided the basis for assessing biogenic component of the urban C budget. In particular, the approach applied Picarro CRDS (cavity ring-down spectroscopy) technique with model G2201-I. Anthropogenic C fluxes were reported based on local statistical datasets and existing emission inventories, as well as the Low Emission Economy Plan from the Wroclaw urban area. The findings showed that biogenic fluxes, over the course of one year, accounted for about 16.3% (RESP = 0.68 Mton CO2·yr−1) of the total city carbon emissions for Wroclaw, being entirely compensated by local vegetation C uptake (GEE = −0.89 Mt. CO2·yr−1). Compared to fluxes given by the previously reported emission inventory, the net biogenic CO2 sink (NEE) of 0.201 Mt. CO2·yr−1 was substantially greater, which indicates that the biosphere in Wroclaw is a net biogenic C sink. The average annual C budget in Wroclaw, obtained from the investigation of sectoral emission trends including those related to energy, road traffic, industrial processes, and other fluxes (human respiration), reaches about 3.87 kg C·m−2·yr−1. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chamber measurements; CO2 flux; Emission inventory; Urban C budget",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112516327

We use a data-driven approach to apply these heuristics to a representative baseline of U.S. drive cycles. The simulated driving-style improvements provide an average fuel savings per trip of 6%, alongside a 1.5% increase in trip duration. Decelerating early and reducing highway speeds can each contribute substantially to fuel savings. Accelerating more gradually contributes less. The percentage fuel savings are relatively consistent across locations and vehicle classes. These findings can inform several decision-makers, including drivers aiming to reduce fuel consumption, car manufacturers or software developers designing driving style feedback, and policy makers examining emissions savings opportunities. © 2021","Driving style; Eco-driving; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Light-duty vehicle","Automobile manufacture; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Driving styles; Eco-driving; Energy emissions; Energy use; Fuel savings; Greenhouse gas emissions; Infrastructure technologies; Light duty vehicles; Vehicle fuels; Vehicle technology; Fuel economy; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; heuristics; transportation development; transportation planning; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112514503

The need to explore the climatic suitability and sustainability of landscape plants is especially relevant due to globalization and climate change. Nevertheless, this research area is constrained by the limited understanding of the biogeographical origin of landscape plants. We have compiled data on species lists, taxonomic information, and geographical and climatic origins for woody landscape plants in 36 major cities across China. We used climatic niche breadth (CNB) and climatic mismatched ratio (CMR) to assess the climatic suitability and sustainability of landscape plants. We found that 412 alien species had several hotspots of origin, mainly tropical regions in the Americas, Asia, and Australia. The 1258 domestic species mainly originated from temperate southern China. Tropical species had a conspicuous geographical clustering in coastal cities of southern China, while the temperate species were abundant in all cities. The CNBs of domestic species were wider than those of alien species, and arid cities with harsher environmental stresses (mainly due to the limited precipitation) registered higher CMRs. In terms of sustainability, the response of landscape plants to climate change varied across climate zones, being influenced by a rich presence of temperate species. Overall, our findings emphasized that landscape plant selections should not only pay attention to the existing landscape needs, but also consider the climatic sustainability of landscape plant species to climate change, especially for long lifespan woody plants. © 2021","Climate change resilience; Climate matching; Domestic and alien species; Ecological amplitude; Landscape plants; Species origin","climate change; ecosystem resilience; globalization; landscape; sustainability; urban ecosystem; Asia; Australia; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112510567

Most of these discussions deal with the distribution of responsibility for climate change mitigation at the international level. The aim of this paper is to investigate if and how these principles can be used to inform the search for a fair distribution of responsibility for climate change adaptation on the local level. We found that the most influential distribution principles on the international level were in turn built on one or more of seven basic principles: (P1) equal shares, (P2) desert, (P3) beneficiary pays, (P4) ability, (P5) self-help, (P6) limited responsibility for the worst off, and (P7) status quo preservation. It was found that all the basic principles, but P1, P3, and P7, are to some extent translatable to local climate adaptation. Two major problems hamper their usefulness on the local level: (1) several categories of agents need to take on responsibility; and (2) emissions do not work as a base for all principles. P4, P5, and P6 are applicable to local adaptation without changes. P4 is of particular importance as it seems to solve the first problem. P2 is applicable only if the second problem is solved, which can be achieved by using risk of harm instead of emissions as the basis for desert. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is still challenging to design for sustainable carbon sequestration. This study developed a transdisciplinary framework to link carbon sequestration research with planting design practices. Taking 28 urban parks in Beijing as a case, we integrated field investigation and remote sensing images to analyze the relationship between planting design indicators and carbon sequestration efficiency, and the change of carbon sequestration efficiency with the growth of plant biomass. The results showed that carbon sequestration efficiency varied over the urban parks with a mean value of 8.72 gC m−2d-1, and varied with plant growth. The difference was associated with individual plant properties and biotope structure. Medium-sized plants and biotopes with partly open structure are proved cost-effective for sustainable carbon sequestration of urban greenspace. We summarized adaptive planting design strategies for different biotope types and emphasized the benefits of nurturing growing and partly open biotopes structured with different sizes of plants.

If these decisions are made incorrectly, irreversible changes can take place that threaten environmental, social and economic sustainability of agriculture. This study applies a land use change model to guide regional agricultural land use planning, with a focus on the case of the south basin of the Urmia Lake, NW Iran, using data from Landsat images, statistics, questionnaire and checklist. The findings indicate the significant changes in the five factors, namely rainfall, humidity, minimum temperature, average temperature and maximum temperature. For example, the rainfall decreased more than 10 mm and the average temperature has increased by 3.5 °C in the last 30 years. The results of factor analysis showed that the studied variables were grouped into eight factors. These factors explained 57.4% of the variance of the determinant factors of farmers' behavior on climate change in the study area. The results obtained from supervised classification showed that all land uses have undergone many changes. The irrigated agriculture and rainfed agriculture have increased 79.43% and 82.5%, respectively, while water bodies, dense grass and woodlands, and sparse grass have declined sharply in the south basin of Urmia Lake. The forecasted results for the year 2027 show that if the existing situation continues, more crises will be faced in terms of land use change, since irrigated agriculture and rainfed agriculture are expected to grow by nearly 9000 ha and more than 1000 ha, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; CLUE-s model; Factor analysis; Farmers' behavior; Logistic regression; Supervised classification","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Lakes; Land use; Rain; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Agricultural land use; Economic sustainability; Environmental vulnerability; Irrigated agriculture; Land use change modeling; Planning and development; Rain fed agriculture; Supervised classification; Climate change; agricultural land; climate change; land use change; rainfed agriculture; regional planning; supervised classification; sustainability; Iran; Lake Urmia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112449605

However, previous research on the effect of topographic factors affecting soil properties on carbon stocks in tea plantations has been limited in the humid Black Sea region. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of elevation, aspect, and soil depth on carbon stocks and soil properties of tea plantations in the Black Sea region. The tea plantations in the research area were divided into two elevation steps and two different aspect groups. Twelve soil sampling plots were then determined according to the stratified random sampling method in each elevation and aspect group; soil samples were taken at 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm soil depths. The amount of carbon stored at a soil depth of 30 cm was found to be 49.38 and 32.36 Mg C ha−1 at the upper and lower altitudes, respectively. Highest carbon density in the tea plantations in the research area was found to be 16.34 kg m−3 at a depth of 0–10 cm. The changes in the soil organic carbon (SOC) values according to elevation and soil depth were statistically significant, while the difference among the carbon storage values was not statistically significant. According to the results of our investigation, elevation is a more effective factor than aspect on SOC in tea plantation areas of highly humid climates. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","aspect; Black Sea; carbon stock; elevation; soil properties; tea plantation","Organic carbon; Tea; Black Sea regions; Carbon density; Carbon storage; Humid climates; Soil organic carbon; Soil sampling; Stratified random sampling; Tea plantations; Soils; carbon sequestration; humid environment; plantation; sampling; soil analysis; soil carbon; soil depth; soil property; tea; Black Sea; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112395590

Countries, with greater resources and the capacity to create binding agreements to overcome public goods problems, appear to view carbon reduction as an unappealing burden. So why are municipalities, with fewer resources and no way to guarantee a coordinated global effort, so eager to take on the potential disadvantages of stringent carbon reduction? Based on examination of municipal-level carbon reduction activity in Sweden and Portugal, I argue that in fact local-level climate activity represents not a burden but a tool. Municipal climate policy forms the basis for ‘paradiplomacy’ that captures goods for cities, creates international linkages for municipalities, and allows direct participation in setting the terms of global carbon commons policy. The evidence suggests that the nature of the climate commons – incompletely structured from a legal and political perspective, and open to access and intervention by actors at multiple levels – provides unique opportunities for actors to act as makers rather than takers of global governance structure and diplomatic effort in a critical area of emerging international policymaking. © The Author(s) 2021.","cities; climate; global commons; governance; international climate policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112393956

We study the large-scale structure traced by ELGs using a combination of a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, a code that computes the nebular emission from H ii regions using the properties of the interstellar medium, and a large-volume, high-resolution N-body simulation. We consider fixed number density samples where galaxies are selected by their H α, [O iii] λ5007, or [O ii] λλ3727-3729 emission-line luminosities. We investigate the assembly bias signatures of these samples, and compare them to those of stellar mass- and star formation rate-selected samples. Interestingly, we find that the [O iii]- and [O ii]-selected samples display scale-dependent bias on large scales and that their assembly bias signatures are also scale dependent. Both these effects are more pronounced for lower number density samples. The [O iii] and [O ii] emitters that contribute most to the scale dependence tend to have a low gas-phase metallicity and are preferentially found in low-density regions. We also measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature and the β parameter related to the growth rate of overdensities. We find that the scale of the BAO peak is roughly the same for all selections and that β is scale dependent at large scales. Our results suggest that ELG samples include environmental effects that should be modelled in order to remove potential systematic errors that could affect the estimation of cosmological parameters. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; galaxies: statistic; large-scale structure of Universe",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112386823

We assess six categories that represent the diversity of methodological approaches that have been used to study low carbon learning: (1) learning curves; (2) expert elicitations; (3) patent analysis; (4) engineering-based decomposition; (5) policy intervention studies; and (6) case studies. Based on a review of low carbon learning studies in these six areas, we summarize what we know about low carbon learning, and what we have yet to fully understand, including the methodological strengths and limitations of key studies conducted to date. We find that a more comprehensive understanding of low carbon learning is necessary and timely given the massive scale and short time horizon of the low carbon transition, and that there are real benefits to employing a comprehensive approach using multiple methods. We find a need for better data sets, and for studies of a more diverse set of technologies, as well as of interactions among technologies. In addition, studies should be more explicit about local context, with a particular need for additional focus on emerging and developing countries. We identify key topics that warrant further research, including technology specific learning methods; spatial distinctions and the local and global linkages that influence learning; and an expanded study of the cultural, social, environmental, and political factors that influence learning. Finally, we recommend more nuance in the design of policies directed at accelerating low carbon learning.

The survey has been designed with multiple exposure times and at least two different air masses per field to maximize its photometric dynamic range, comparable to that of Gaia, and ensure the accuracy of its photometric calibration. The goal is to reach at least 1 per cent accuracy and precision in the seven bands for all stars brighter than AB magnitude 17 while detecting fainter stars with lower values of the signal-to-noise ratio. The main purposes of GALANTE are the identification and study of extinguished O+B+WR stars, the derivation of their extinction characteristics, and the cataloguing of F and G stars in the solar neighbourhood. Its data will be also used for a variety of other stellar studies and to generate a high-resolution continuum-free map of the Hα emission in the Galactic plane.

Warmed by the world’s soaring greenhouse gases, its ice cap is melting, and it is heating twice as fast as the rest of the planet, deepening the earth’s climate crisis. As its ice thaws, buried resources, trade routes, and new tourist opportunities are suddenly accessible. The borders of the earth’s two largest nuclear rivals, the US and Russia are less than 3 miles apart in the Arctic region and their hostility is growing. Seeking new trade routes and investment opportunities and rapidly rising above its rank as the earth’s third most powerful country, China, has declared itself a ‘near Arctic state’ and is exercising a voice in Arctic affairs. Russia and Arctic NATO members have expanded their military presence in the far North. Despite potential tensions and rapidly melting ice, there is no effective overarching governing regime in the region that can mitigate the climate crisis or manage conflicts were they to arise. Nonetheless, the Arctic remains free of interstate violence. The explanation for the absence of violent conflict cannot be found in traditional International Relations (IR) Theories. Looking below the radar of IR theory and expanding the Human Heritage approach, I show that the region contains a web of overlapping local, regional, national, and pan-Arctic institutions and agreements, built on both traditional and Western knowledge and often steered by indigenous knowledge holders in Arctic governance. This informal web of governing regimes manages Arctic resources to protect human heritage and guard human security. In doing so, it creates a cooperative environment which guides dispute settlement among Arctic states. It is the power of these networks, their normative commitments, and the knowledge that informs them that help to explain the absence of violent interstate conflict in the region. © The Author(s) 2021.","Arctic; global commons; indigenous peoples; Russia; TEK; US",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112370061

We track the emergence of international adaptation law within the climate and non-climate regime, alongside increasingly dire extreme events and strident scientific consensus. Examining the growth in national and subnational laws for adaptation, we reflect on the role of framework legislation and legal mechanisms used in sectoral laws. Based on progress over the past decade, we outline how the role of law can be enhanced and accelerated in the decade ahead. We identify important trends in adaptation law and consider the potential for these innovations to drive future adaptation: the sheer growth in priority and volume of laws directed towards adaptation; the intersection of adaptation with other policy domains, especially disaster risk reduction; the need for improved architecture for funding adaptation; and the important role of strategic litigation. Largely absent from the past decade of adaptation law reform is evaluation of effectiveness, or examples of systemic reform that addresses underlying causes of vulnerability. With slow progress in implementing transformational adaptation law reform, we identify five design principles for adaptation laws. The design of laws must (1) be responsive to change; (2) address equity dimensions of climate change; (3) implement innovative solutions; (4) maximize co-benefits; and (5) establish processes for managing trade-offs.

The increase in PM2.5 above the background level around a mine represents a potential disturbance to caribou. To quantify the spatial distribution of the elevated PM2.5, we investigated three different sampling schemes to measure PM2.5 concentration using a portable monitor. We found that the best sampling scheme was to use the regional background PM2.5 as the reference and analyze the anomaly of PM2.5 measured at sites around the mine complex from the background level. The regional background PM2.5 values were measured at the Daring Lake Tundra Research Station during 2018 and 2019. Our results indicated that the background PM2.5 was not a low and constant value but varied with rain events, wind direction, and the impacts of forest fire smoke. After excluding periods affected by forest fires smokes, we found the background PM2.5 was close to 0 μg m−3 for the first few hours after rain, and then increased logistically with the time after rain (tar) to the maximum of 5 (or 10) μg m−3 when the wind came from the north (or south) of the NW-SE axis. The NW-SE axis in western Canada divides the tundra north with few anthropogenic PM2.5 sources from the forested south with many PM2.5 sources from forest fire smokes and human activities. Analyses of PM2.5 anomaly from the background (i.e., PM2.5 measured at a site around the mining complex—the background level at the corresponding tar and wind direction) revealed that the zone of elevated PM2.5 around the mine (Zepm) expanded with tar. In the first few hours after rain, PM2.5 was close to 0 everywhere except within meters of a source (e.g., a truck exhaust) in the downwind direction. During tar = 6 to 96 h, Zepm expanded to 6.3 km in the downwind direction when the wind came from south of the NW-SE axis. A similar result was found in the downwind direction when the wind came from north of the NW-SE axis, with Zepm = 4.4 km. In the upwind direction, the value of Zepm was much smaller, being 0.7 km (or 1.0 km) when the wind came from the north (or south) of the NW-SE axis. For the period of tar between 96 and 192 hours, Zepm further expanded to 21.2 km when the wind from the south of the NW-SE axis.

Nowadays, they are a non-timber forest product and a diverse genetic resource with great ecological, sociocultural, economic, medicinal and biotechnological relevance around the world. Therefore, they have a paramount role to play in meeting the United Nations global sustainable development goals 2030. EMF may promote forest sustainability, biodiversity conservation, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions through the maintenance of forest masses, human nutrition and health, economic development, conservation of biocultural heritages, women empowerment and hunger mitigation. We provide a worldwide review of the knowledge, biodiversity, novel approaches, future challenges and perspectives in the post-COVID era of this important genetic resource whose relevance has usually received marginal attention despite its strategic global significance. Summary: Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They have a paramount importance in nutrient cycling, plant protection against pathogens and abiotic stress, and establishment of underground networks that connect trees and other plants in nature, therefore being the wood wide web, the ‘internet’ of the forests. According to our literature review, globally 970 mycorrhizal fungal species (including both mushrooms and truffles) are edible, and they have enormous relevance either as a source of subsistence in low-income human groups around the world or as an important economic component whose international commerce is worth billions of American dollars annually. Since edible mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are a non-timber forest product, their sustainable use and management is crucial in order to maintain forest stands and to provide well-being to the human communities surrounding the forested areas where they grow. In different parts of the world, different cultures have developed a traditional knowledge of EMF over millennia. Their knowledge might play an important role in food supply and food security in the future, hence contributing towards the “zero hunger” global goal. The biotechnological development of EMF has also been crucial in the establishment of plantations, or successful reforestation and ecosystem restoration, which contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, a worldwide review of how EMF might contribute to forest sustainability, food supply, biocultural conservation, and hunger and climate change mitigation is addressed by analysing the similarities, contrasts and challenges in all five continents. © 2021 The Authors.

Using the first four low-order Balmer emission lines (H α, H β, H γ, and H δ) detected in the composite spectrum of all galaxies in the sample, we derive a nebular attenuation curve in the range of 0.41 to 0.66, μm that has a similar shape and normalization to that of the Galactic extinction curve (Milky Way curve), the SMC curve and the nebular attenuation curve derived recently for typical star-forming galaxies at z ∼2. We divide the galaxies into bins of stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and specific star formation rate, and derive the nebular attenuation curve in each of these bins. This analysis indicates that there is very little variation in the shape of the nebular dust attenuation curve with the properties used to bin the galaxies, and suggests a near universal shape of the nebular dust attenuation curve at least among the galaxies and the range of properties considered in our sample. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","Dust, extinction; Galaxies: star formation; H ii regions; Local Group",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112222280

A wide range of studies has proved the ecotoxic potential of atmospheric particles. PM exerts chemical stress on vegetation by its potentially toxic constituents; however, relatively few studies are available on assessing phytotoxic effects under laboratory conditions. In our study, aqueous extract of particulate matter was prepared and used for treatment. Experiment was following the procedure defined by the No. 227 OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals: Terrestrial Plant Test. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants were used; elucidated toxicity was assessed based on morphological and biochemical endpoints such as biomass, chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b, carotenoids, and protein content. Biomass reduction and protein content showed a clear dose–effect relationship; the biomass decreased in comparison with the control (100%) in all test groups (TG) at a steady rate (TG1: 87.73%; TG2: 71.77%; TG3: 67.01%; TG4: 63.63%). The tendency in protein concentrations compared to the control was TG1: 113.61%; TG2: 148.21% TG3: 160.52%; TG4: 157.31%. However, pigments showed a ‘Janus-faced’ effect: nutrient content of the sample caused slight increase at lower doses; actual toxicity became apparent only at higher doses (chlorophyll-a concentration decrease was 84.47% in TG4, chlorophyll-b was 77.17%, and finally, carotene showed 83.60% decrease in TG4). © 2021, The Author(s).","Aerosol ecotoxicity; Growth inhibition; Lycopersicon esculentum Mill; Photosynthetic pigments; Protein; Vegetative vigour test","Atmospheric chemistry; Biomass; Chlorophyll; Fruits; Plants (botany); Proteins; Toxicity; Atmospheric particles; Atmospheric particulate matter; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Environmental concerns; Laboratory conditions; Lycopersicon esculentum; Protein concentrations; Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.); Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112131501

As momentum builds for greater climate action, it is necessary to better understand how carbon markets and other low-carbon transportation policies influence one another. First, we demonstrate that emissions trading between California and Quebec has been asymmetric, with linking having little influence on carbon prices from California's perspective but leading to a considerable cost reduction from the point of view of Quebec. Second, we present evidence that Quebec has replicated many of California's low-carbon transportation policies that promote increased electric vehicle use, where Quebec has an advantage, while deferring to the Canadian federal government with regard to policies that incentivize the production of other low-carbon transportation fuels. Third, we demonstrate that while the stringency of the policy mix of carbon pricing and flexible transportation regulations has increased over time in both jurisdictions, the stringency of flexible regulations has been more aggressively ratcheted up and is expected to continue to dominate. Overall, our findings suggest that the policy sequence observed in California and Quebec can be attributed to the political economy benefits that the selected instruments confer to governments seeking to move from the middle towards the bottom of the clean technology experience curve.

Results suggest that stakeholders strategically framed their policies in terms of economic benefits, and other aspects of a policy's design, as opposed to focusing on climate change or climate science.

Here, we investigated the impact of lockdown on surface ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over a tropical coastal station – Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram (8.5°N, 76.9°E). Daytime as well as night-time NO2 showed reduction by 0.8 (40%) and 2.3 (35%) ppbv, respectively during the lockdown period of 25–30 March 2020 as compared with the same period of previous 3 years. Unlike many urban locations, daytime surface O3 is found to be dramatically reduced by 15 ppbv (36%) with O3 production rate being lower by a factor of 3 during the lockdown. Interestingly, a feature of O3-hump during the onset of land breeze typically observed during 1997–1998 has reappeared with magnitude of 5–10 ppbv. A photochemical box model, capturing this feature, revealed that significant O3 sustained till onset of land breeze over the land due to weaker titration with NOx during lockdown. It is suggested that the transport of this O3 rich air with onset of land breeze led to the observed hump. Our measurements unravel a remarkable impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the chemistry and dynamics of O3 over this tropical coastal environment. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.","land and sea breeze; photochemistry; Thumba; trace gases","Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112060298

It has been argued that climate change may contribute to the severity of the issue; hence “impact assessment” is being replaced by “adaptation,” which explores more adapting scenarios and approaches. This study explores the adaptability of the proposed cyclic and non-cyclic conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources in increasing groundwater sustainability while increasing the sustainability of water allocation to the agricultural sector under possible climate change scenarios. To simulate climate change in the study area, precipitation and temperature variables are extracted from the results of three global atmospheric circulation models (Ensemble, CMCC-CMS, MRI-CGCM3) under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios in the period of 2021–2031. Spatial downscaling is performed using the M5 decision tree algorithm. The Wavelet-M5 hybrid model is used to predict runoff values as a rainfall-runoff model. Also, the Kharrufa method is applied to calculate evaporation in the future seasons. The system's adaptability to climate change is examined using the multi-objective cyclic and non-cyclic conjunctive use of surface and groundwater models. The study reveals that cyclic operation strategy improves the conjunctive use system adaptability compared to the optimal operation strategy that employs the non-cyclic approach. In this study's case study, the improvement in groundwater sustainability index exceeds 27 percent over the non-cyclic conjunctive use strategy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate Change; Cyclic and Non-Cyclic Conjunctive Use; Groundwater Sustainability; Sustainability Index","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Decision trees; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Runoff; Surface water resources; Sustainable development; Trees (mathematics); Atmospheric circulation model; Climate change scenarios; Decision-tree algorithm; Groundwater overdraft; Optimal operation strategy; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Sustainable management; Temperature variables; Climate change; adaptation; assessment method; climate change; groundwater resource; rainfall-runoff modeling; seasonal variation; surface water; sustainability; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112046383

Here, we report a detailed characterization of the mineralogy, chemistry, particle size and surface area of six mined basalts being used in large-scale ERW field trials. We use 1-D reactive transport modelling (RTM) of soil profile processes to simulate inorganic CDR potential via cation flux (Mg2+, Ca2+, K+ and Na+) and assess the release of the essential plant nutrients phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for a typical clay-loam agricultural soil. The basalts are primarily composed of pyroxene and plagioclase feldspar (up to 71 wt%), with accessory olivine, quartz, glass and alkali feldspar. Mean crushed particle size varies by a factor of 10, owing to differences in the mining operations and grinding processes. RTM simulations, based on measured mineral composition and N2-gas BET specific surface area (SSA), yielded potential CDR values of between c. 1.3 and 8.5 t CO2 ha−1 after 15 years following a baseline application of 50 t ha−1 basalt. The RTM results are comparative for the range of inputs that are described and should be considered illustrative for an agricultural soil. Nevertheless, they indicate that increasing the surface area for slow-weathering basalts through energy intensive grinding prior to field application in an ERW context may not be warranted in terms of additional CDR gains. We developed a function to convert CDR based on widely available and easily measured rock chemistry measures to more realistic determinations based on mineralogy. When applied to a chemistry dataset for &gt;1300 basalt analyses from 25 large igneous provinces, we simulated cumulative CDR potentials of up to c. 8.5 t CO2 ha−1 after 30 years of weathering, assuming a single application of basalt with a SSA of 1 m2 g−1. Our RTM simulations suggest that ERW with basalt releases sufficient phosphorus (P) to substitute for typical arable crop P-fertiliser usage in Europe and the USA offering potential to reduce demand for expensive rock-derived P. © 2021","Carbon dioxide removal potential; Enhanced rock weathering; Geochemical modelling; Mineralogy; Soil rock amendments; Surface area analysis","Basalt; Chemical analysis; Feldspar; Grinding (machining); Magnesium compounds; Mineralogy; Nutrients; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Phosphorus; Soils; Weathering; Carbon dioxide removal; Carbon dioxide removal potential; Enhanced rock weathering; Geochemical models; Plant nutrients; Reactive transport modelling; Rock weathering; Soil rock amendment; Surface area; Surface area analysis; Carbon dioxide; agricultural soil; chemical weathering; clay loam; crop plant; fertilizer application; mineralogy; physicochemical property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111999857

Environmental and climate concerns have gained particular relevance among sustainability goals in recent years, thus reshaping political agendas all over the world. Against this background, this paper explores the practical relevance of accessibility instruments for low carbon mobility planning. A theoretical framework on usefulness is developed, which outlines potential application purposes related to identifying needs for interventions in the land use and transport system, assessing the impacts of potential solutions, as well as communicating between planning sectors and stakeholders. Three real-world planning issues in the Munich region serve to test the hypothetical usefulness of accessibility instruments for low carbon mobility planning in empirical applications. Practitioners were involved at various stages throughout the process in order to capture their perspectives on practical relevance. Both the identified planning issues and the types of accessibility implementations were diverse in nature, showing that accessibility analysis is applicable to a variety of tasks connected to the aim of reducing transport-related emissions. Earlier findings about the practical relevance of accessibility instruments were confirmed in this context, in particular the importance of communicative outputs. While more research in other spatial contexts is clearly needed, we conclude that accessibility instruments can contribute to a low carbon transition by enabling practitioners to plan for low carbon mobility options and communicate the benefits of these options. However, the implementation of accessibility instruments might be hampered by emerging barriers, such as the need to quantify emissions and emission savings, the desire to consider qualitative aspects in addition to quantitative indicators, and the lack of accessibility standards and reference values. © 2021 The Authors","Accessibility instruments; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Low carbon policy","accessibility; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; implementation process; planning practice; pollution policy; Bavaria; Germany; Munich",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111972998

Forest species changes have direct impacts on carbon stocks and may lead to undesirable climate trade‐offs. In this paper, we measure aboveground biomass (AGB) and the impact of forest changes on climate regulation through three land policy scenarios by 2030 in continental Portugal. We found that a High intervention scenario, supported by an important increase in “Other coniferous trees” class, will provide 29.5% more of carbon sequestration, whereas a Low intervention scenario, in which there is a moderate increase in all forest classes, will result in an increase of 5.7%. A business as usual (BAU) scenario, supported by an increase in eucalyptus forests and a decrease in autochthonous species, will decrease carbon sequestration (-2.7%), particularly Lisboa, Algarve and North regions. Economic valuation shows that the High intervention scenario will generate the highest economic outcome for climate regulation by 2030.

The combination of ecosystem service losses from forest disturbances that are immediate as well as the slower post-disturbance process of forest regrowth could result in long-lasting social, economic, and environmental costs. Using economic and geospatial analysis, we estimate the value of recreational services losses due to drought and quantify the social cost of carbon emissions due to wildfires and bark beetle damage in three National Forests in the Sierra Nevada region, California (Inyo National Forest, Tahoe National Forest, and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit). Our findings indicate that recent droughts resulted in an annual reduction of about $73 million, $36 million, and $15 million for Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Tahoe, and Inyo National Forests, respectively. Tree biomass loss due to wildfires and bark beetle damage generated around 10 Mt CO2 of total emissions from 2003 and 2012. The estimated cumulative social costs of such emissions were around $0.8 million for fire and $2.4 million for bark beetle (using a 3% discount rate for related climate change damage). The social costs almost tripled under extreme climate damage projections.

However, no prior works have evaluated the effects of road grade on tailpipe volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions of motorcycles. This study investigated the effects of road grade on real-world tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), total hydrocarbons (THC), nitric oxide (NO), and speciated VOCs for a Euro 5 motorcycle. Real-world emissions of CO, CO2, THC, and NO were measured in real-time using a miniature portable emissions measurement system (mini-PEMS), while VOCs were measured in integrated exhaust samples collected during real-world driving. PEMS tests (n = 20) were conducted on urban (UR), suburban (SU), uphill (UH), and downhill (DH) routes. The road grade range encountered in this study was approximately −14 % to +14 %. The mean UH emission factors of CO, THC, and ΣVOC were 9890 ± 1619, 101.0 ± 6.7, and 18.81 ± 4.31 mg/km, respectively.

Results show that there are about 4 original policy innovations in each city, only a third of the policy innovations are actually implemented, and nearly half of the cities have no applied policy innovations. The setting of mandatory carbon emission reduction targets at the national level will help local governments to formulate corresponding policies and achieve carbon emission reduction targets through policy innovation. The internal comparison of these policy innovations between different cities can promote low-carbon urban policy diffusion and learning.

However, the changes in shallow coastal regions, like the marginal seas near China, cannot be fully resolved in GCMs. To improve regional sea level simulations, a high-resolution (;8 km) regional ocean model is set up for the marginal seas near China for both the historical (1994-2015) and future (2079-2100) periods under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The historical ocean simulations are evaluated at different spatiotemporal scales, and the model is then integrated for the future period, driven by projected monthly climatological climate change signals from eight GCMs individually via both surface and open boundary conditions. The downscaled ocean changes derived by comparing historical and future experiments reveal greater spatial details than those from GCMs, such as a low dynamic sea level (DSL) center of 20.15 m in the middle of the South China Sea (SCS). As a novel test, the downscaled results driven by the ensemble mean forcings are almost identical with the ensemble average results from individually downscaled cases. Forcing of the DSL change and increased cyclonic circulation in the SCS are dominated by the climate change signals from the Pacific, while the DSL change in the East China marginal seas is caused by both local atmosphere forcing and signals from the Pacific. The method of downscaling developed in this study is a useful modeling protocol for adaptation and mitigation planning for future oceanic climate changes. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

In particular, the crisis highlights the need for local communities reliant on rural tourism to enhance their resilience to the risks simultaneously generated by the pandemic and accelerating impacts of climate change. This is important as the effects of these hazards are intertwined and cannot be treated in isolation. We explore community responses and resilience through case study Quebrada Verde, Peru, a small rural community in the Andes Mountains. Specifically, we report on a qualitative examination involving in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key informants from the community, supplemented by relevant documentary analysis. Drawing on community resilience and social networks perspectives, we find that the community's preparedness to both threats is unbalanced. On one hand, the community eco-tourism system has developed sufficient tools to adapt to the temporary effects of COVID-19 derived from the community's self-organization skills and topophilia. Specifically, the community possesses a cohesive social structure, it has a solid cultural identity rooted in its customs and traditions, and maintains a social humour that enables it to see the positive aspects of adversity. On the other hand, the analysis of the measures towards strengthening the resilience to climate change delivers mixed results. In particular, the relationship that the community has built with other local organizations to successfully prevent and react to climate change is weak. Therefore, stronger efforts towards bridging this gap must be implemented in order to sustain the wider social network of such organizations, of which the community is a part. This would enable further development and implementation of appropriate risk management strategies to counteract climate change, enhancing the community's resilience of its eco-tourism system to this emergent threat. Importantly, this finding might be relevant to other local communities seeking to improve their resilience to COVID-19 and climate change. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change; Community resilience; COVID-19; Rural tourism; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111913406

The analysis shows that CuO receives a stable doping structure on MoSe2 surface. CuO modification increases the conductivity of the system, especially by 2CuO doping. After gas adsorption, it can be found that 2CuO-MoSe2 shows strong adsorption for COF2 gas while weak adsorption for CF4 gas.

They are covalently functionalized with -SO3H groups via C-PhSO3H or C-SO3H linkages with special carbon structures. To date, the types of SCC for biodiesel production ranges from biochar (BC), activated carbon (AC), graphene, graphite oxides, multiwalled carbon nanotubes, order mesoporous carbon, and graphitic carbon nitride. Lignocellulosic and biomass wastes are important carbon precursors for low-cost BC and AC production. This review critically reviews and summarizes the most up-to-date research progress in the evolution of SCC for biodiesel production. Systematic discussions and comparisons on the different carbon materials, preparation methods, and sulfonation preparation parameters which directly affect the physicochemical attributes and catalytic performance are provided.

Land as the underlying surface of atmosphere, which has a significant effect on PM2.5. This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 and its relationship to land use in China during 2005–2017, then put forward suggestions for land use optimization to improve air quality. The results suggested that PM2.5 generally showed a downward trend, with obvious spatial pattern. High-pollution areas were formed in the North China Plain, the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Plain, the Sichuan Basin and the Taklimakan Desert. Furthermore, PM2.5 was significantly positive correlated with the area of cultivated land and artificial surfaces, and cultivated land fragmentation was conducive to the decline of PM2.5, while contiguous expansion of artificial surfaces would increase PM2.5. Forest and grassland had an inhibitory effect on PM2.5, and the larger area, the more complex shape, the better PM2.5 retention effect. Moreover, cultivated land and forest were the main land use types that affect PM2.5, and the effect of cultivated land was greater than that of forest. The percentage of cultivated land landscape, the shape index of forest and water bodies were the main landscape metrics that affect PM2.5, and their effect on PM2.5 decreased in turn. Therefore, strengthening the pollution control of cultivated land, promoting the land recuperation, further expanding the scale of forest and grassland, enriching vegetation types, promoting the grain for green, reasonably controlling the scale of urban development, are conducive to reduce PM2.5. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","China; Land use; Landscape; PM2.5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111837254

Emergency care systems and providers have an opportunity to be at the forefront of efforts to combat the worst health effects from climate change. The 2020 African Conference on Emergency Medicine, under the auspices of the African Federation for Emergency Medicine, convened its first ever workshop on the topic of climate change and human health. Structured as a full day virtual course, the didactic sections were available for both live and asynchronous learning with more than 100 participants enrolled in the course. The workshop introduced the topic of the health effects of climate as they relate to emergency care in Africa and provided a forum to discuss ideas regarding the way forward. Lectures and focused discussions addressed three broad themes related to: health impacts, health care delivery, and advocacy. To our knowledge, this is the first workshop for health professionals to cover topics specific to emergency care, climate change, and health in Africa. The results of this workshop will help to guide future efforts aimed at advancing emergency care approaches in Africa with regard to medical education, research, and policy. African relevance: • Climate-related extreme weather events are adversely affecting health and health care delivery in African countries. • African organisations, cities, and nations have taken positive steps to adapt and build climate resilience. • There are opportunities for emergency care professionals and scholars to continue to expand, and lead, climate and health education, research, and policy initiatives on the continent. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change; Climate-smart healthcare; Disasters; Education; Policy; Research; Resilience","adult; Africa; city; climate resilience; disaster; emergency care; emergency medicine; extreme weather; female; health care delivery; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; male; medical education; note",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111827246

The rice–wheat rotation system is often regarded as a dominant source of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Under the general trend of global warming, it is of vital significance to explore farmland production methods for the reduction of GHGs. The study was based on a three-year field experiment conducted to investigate the effects of tillage methods (CF, conventional farming; OF, optimized fertilization; OF + N, optimized fertilization + no-tillage; OF + S, optimized fertilization + straw return) on the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) collected by way of “closed static box-gas chromatography”. The factors needing simultaneously monitored are atmospheric temperature, 5 cm ground temperature, soil redox potential (Eh), etc. Among the total Global warming potential (GWP) processed by CF, OF, OF + N, and OF + S, the GWP produced by CH4 accounted for 86.01%, 88.23%, 86.34%, and 88.96%, respectively; The sequence of the total yields of rice and wheat is: OF &gt; CF &gt; OF + N &gt; OF + S, the GWP is CF &gt; OF + S &gt; OF &gt; OF + N, and that of greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) is CF &gt; OF + S &gt; OF + N &gt; OF. Comprehensively, tillage methods have great potential to reduce GWP, and OF is considered the optimal tillage method to achieve effective greenhouse gases reduction while ensuring stable and increased production. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CH4; GHGI; GWP; N2O; Tillage methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111810730

Our analysis of empirical documentation of migration factors as well as theoretical demographic models shows three predominate types of US cities affected by climate migration pathways: (1) vulnerable cities—those that will suffer significant losses in population and tax revenue; (2) recipient cities—those that serve as unsuspecting or unwilling “receiving communities” from sudden-onset disasters without preparation; and (3) climate destinations—cities seeking to rebrand their communities as “climate havens” that welcome displaced residents through equitable planning and preparation. Despite the evidence of such migration trends, there currently is limited guidance for governments at any scale to plan and prepare for these changes. Forced or unplanned migrations will have a profound and disproportionate impact on communities of color, the elderly, and other at-risk populations that are already experiencing the compounding effects of climate and environmental injustices. A lack of adequate preparation and resources dedicated to minimizing the impacts of planned and unplanned migration pathways could exacerbate existing economic, environmental, and social inequalities. Drawing from case studies in cities across the country that illustrate the typology outlined above, this paper presents a framework with preliminary strategies for policy makers to bridge knowledge gaps and design responses for both short- and long-term planning initiatives. In particular, we encourage the use of typological frameworks for implementing scenario planning that can help cities navigate the challenges of planning for future climate-migration to plan for more sustainable, inclusive, and equitable cities for all. © 2021, AESS.","Climate change; Climate migration; Equity; Justice; Managed retreat","maximum sustainable yield; planning process; policy implementation; policy making; strategic approach; sustainability; tourist destination; typology; urban agriculture; urban area; vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111760086

While most of the attention has been focused on the physiological mechanisms associated with drought-induced tree responses of a few species at specific locations, the ecological attributes of these species, like their niche breadth, may be also important in determining species’ sensitivity or resilience to drought. We postulated that wide-niche breadth tree species should be more drought-resilient than narrow-niche breadth species. Using the most severe 2015–2016 El Niño drought event in the last 70 years in Patagonia, we determined pre- and post-drought growth (BAI, basal area increment), C reserves in the form of non-structural carbohydrate concentrations (NSCs = starch and soluble sugars), wood isotope (δ13C, iWUE and δ18O) signalling and xylem anatomy (mean vessel diameter, mvd) in eight angiosperm tree species of contrasting niche breadth across a sharp precipitation gradient in southern Chile. All species responded in unison after the drought with a non-water-conservative response, maintaining BAI and NSCs, decreasing δ13C, and increasing both mvd and the soluble sugars:NSCs ratio relative to pre-drought time. Contrary to previous results reporting species-specific drought responses, our results show unequivocally a functional coordination of organisms’ vital traits associated with a non-water-conservative strategy, and a drought-induced acclimation based on starch conversion into soluble sugars in all of the tree species we examined, regardless of their niche breadth and habitat preference. We state that abiotic drivers such as drought may have selected similar interspecific responses provided that they operate at the community level rather than at the species level. These findings mark the need to revise current views about the ultimate interspecific functional coordination of organisms’ vital traits when facing more frequent and intensive drought events.

Compared to the Cu NPs with deficient PVP protection, the Cu NPs capped with a sufficient amount of PVP remain almost completely as Cu0 species. In contrast, the Cu NPs that are considered PVP deficient form an oxide structure in which the inner layer is face-centered cubic Cu and the outer layer is, at least in part, made up of Cu2O species. Furthermore, to eliminate CO2 molecule diffusion and simultaneously obtain significant current density (200 mA cm−2) for industrial applications, a flow cell configuration is used for carbon dioxide electro reduction reaction (CO2RR) testing in 0.5 m potassium hydroxide solution. The Cu NPs with zero valence deliver Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for the CO2 reduction to CH4 of over 70%, with a current density exceeding 200 mA cm−2, outstripping the performances of the majority of the reported CO2 electrocatalysts. Interestingly, the distribution of products catalyzed by the Cu NPs with +1 valence includes multicarbon products (C2+) such as C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, and C3H7OH with combined FEs of &gt;80%, with current densities of up to 300 mA cm−2. The above results unambiguously establish that surface oxidation of Cu species plays a crucial role in the CO2RR. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","CO 2 electroreduction; Cu nanoparticles; Cu oxidation","Acetic acid; Carbon dioxide; Catalytic oxidation; Copper oxides; Current density; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Nanoparticles; Oxide minerals; Potassium hydroxide; Cu nano-particles; Electro reduction; Face-centered cubic; Faradaic efficiencies; Molecule diffusion; Polyvinyl pyrrolidone; Potassium hydroxide solution; Surface oxidations; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111731578

WWTP influents and stormwater outfalls were sampled to a lesser extent. All sampling methods were harmonised and aimed at collecting event or multi-day composite samples over periods of ≥1 year. Among the substances analysed were biocides and pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated alkyl substances, metals, pharmaceuticals, benzotriazoles, phenols, acesulfame, di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, and hexabromocyclododecanes. Occurrence, concentration ranges, and removal rates of selected WWTPs are presented. CSOs can be confirmed as an important pathway of metals and PAH to receiving waters when compared to WWTPs on the basis of annual per capita loads. The derived volume-weighted site mean concentrations are qualified to be used as representative input data for estimation of average substance emissions in large areas, e.g. on river basin scale, if no site-specific data are available. As such, they will contribute to the development of strategies to reduce substance emissions, taking into account not only WWTPs but also stormwater-related discharges. © 2021","Combined sewer overflow; Micropollutants; Priority substances; Stormwater outfall; Wastewater treatment plant; Water quality","Combined sewers; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Effluents; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sewage pumping plants; Storm sewers; Storms; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Combined sewer overflows; Micropollutants; Pollutant concentration; Priority substances; Stormwater outfall; Stormwater quality; Stormwaters; Urban wastewater; Waste water treatment plants; Wastewater quality; Water quality; concentration (composition); pollution monitoring; stormwater; urban area; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water quality; Germany; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; environmental monitoring; river; sewage; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Rivers; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111679027

We examined the relationship between olfaction, longitudinal change in cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei and their target regions, and cognition in early PD. Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 97 PD participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative with brain MRIs at baseline, 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years. Using probabilistic maps, regional grey matter density (GMD) was calculated for Ch4, cholinergic nuclei 1, 2, and 3 (Ch123), and their target regions. Results: Baseline University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test score correlated with change in GMD of all regions of interest (all p &lt; 0.05). Rate of change of Ch4 GMD was correlated with rate of change of Ch123 (p = 0.034), cortex (p = 0.001), and amygdala GMD (p &lt; 0.001), but not hippocampus GMD (p = 0.38). Rate of change of Ch123 GMD was correlated with rate of change of cortex (p = 0.001) and hippocampus (p &lt; 0.001), but not amygdala GMD (p = 0.133). In a linear regression model including change in GMD of all regions of interest and age as predictors, change in cortex GMD (βˆslope= 38.2; 95 % CI: [0.47, 75.9]) and change in hippocampus GMD (βˆslope= 24.8; 95 % CI: [0.80, 48.8]) were significant predictors of Montreal Cognitive Assessment score change over time. Conclusion: Impaired olfaction is associated with degeneration of the cholinergic basal forebrain and bilateral cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus in PD. The relationship between impaired olfaction and cognitive decline may be mediated by greater atrophy of the cortex and hippocampus. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cholinergic basal forebrain; Olfaction; Parkinson disease; Parkinson's disease dementia; Volumetric MRI",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111672477

We find a threshold effect: In small coalitions incentives to be a coalition member decrease whereas in large coalitions they increase. Thus, trade sanctions can be an effective tool in climate policy only after a sufficiently large climate coalition has already been formed. Even if larger stable coalitions are achieved with trade sanctions, implications for global welfare can be adverse, because additional trade distortions trade off with the environmental gains. We identify the USA and Europe as essential members of stable coalitions if outsiders retaliate. © 2021 The Authors","Climate clubs; Computable general equilibrium; International environmental agreements; Retaliation; Trade sanctions","Environmental regulations; Pollution control; Climate policy; Effective tool; Global welfare; International environmental agreements; Stable coalition; Threshold effect; Trade off; Economic and social effects; climate change; detection method; environmental policy; international agreement; trade-off; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111647334

Yet deployment of CCUS has been slow, with fewer than 20 large-scale facilities operating worldwide in 2019. We estimate the total and marginal cost of constructing and operating new CCUS facilities and associated infrastructure to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from current and planned industrial facilities on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast. We compare these cost estimates to scheduled CCUS tax incentives through 2026 under section 45Q of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to quantify cost-effective emissions abatement. Our analysis measures the cost-reducing potential of economies of scale in regional CO2 pipeline networks. We also compare CCUS costs to one measure of the benefits of carbon capture, the social cost of carbon. Results suggest that U.S. federal tax incentives currently in place through 2026 could justify between 3.3 million and 77.6 million tons of annual CCUS in the Gulf region, depending on the choice of storage technology and the degree of pipeline network coordination. Finally, we highlight several potential policy barriers that may explain low adoption of CCUS in the Gulf Region and elsewhere. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","45Q tax incentive; Carbon capture; Climate change mitigation; Cost-effectiveness; Industrial emissions; Marginal abatement cost","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Cost reduction; Industrial emissions; Pipelines; Taxation; 45q tax incentive; Carbon storage; Carbon utilization; Climate change mitigation; Gulf region; Marginal abatement costs; Pipeline networks; Policy incentives; Scale economies; Tax incentive; Cost effectiveness; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; incentive; industrial emission; policy approach; pollution tax; Louisiana; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111598196

Several Latin American countries have referred to planned relocation or managed retreat as one of their adaptation strategies within their Nationally Determined Contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. However, a gap in academic analysis exists regarding not only the potential impacts but also the consequences of climate-induced planned relocations both in the broader context of Latin America and in the specific case of Indigenous Peoples living in that region. In addition, academia has so far underexplored the adverse impacts of managed retreat on Indigenous Peoples, such as the loss of a sense of community, culture, and traditional knowledge. Against this background, this article offers an overview on two key cases of climate-induced (planned) relocation of Indigenous Peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean (the Gunayala people in the San Blás archipelago in Panama and the case of the densely Indigenous-inhabited Mexican state of Chiapas), explores whether managed retreat has been or may become a tool or a threat, and provides a list of specific policy recommendations to be taken into consideration in similar cases. © 2021, AESS.","Chiapas; Climate change; Gunayala; Indigenous Peoples; Managed retreat; Planned relocation","adaptive management; archipelago; climate change; indigenous population; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Caribbean Coast [Panama]; Chiapas; Kuna Yala; Latin America; Mexico [North America]; Panama [Central America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111573338

Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate the long-term effects of gestational exposure to diesel engine exhaust (DE) on adult offspring phenotype in a rabbit model. Methods: The protocol was designed to mimic human exposure in large European cities. Females rabbits were exposed to diluted (1 mg/m3) DE (exposed, n = 9) or clean air (controls, n = 7), from 3 days after mating, 2 h/d and 5 d/wk in a nose-only inhalation system throughout gestation (gestation days 3–27). After birth and weaning, 72 offspring (47 exposed and 25 controls) were raised until adulthood (7.5 months) to evaluate their cardio-metabolic status, including the monitoring of body weight and food intake, fasting biochemistry, body composition (iDXA), cardiovascular parameters and glucose tolerance. After a metabolic challenge (high fat diet in males and gestation in females), animals were euthanized for postmortem phenotyping. Results: Sex-specific responses to maternal exposure were observed in adult offspring. Age-related increases in blood pressure (p = 0.058), glycaemia (p = 0.029), and perirenal fat mass (p = 0.026) as well as reductions in HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.025) and fat-to-body weight ratio (p = 0.011) were observed in exposed males, suggesting a metabolic syndrome. Almost only trends were observed in exposed females with higher triglycerides and decreased bone density compared to control females. Metabolic challenges triggered or amplified some biological responses, especially in females. Conclusions: In utero exposure to air pollution predisposed rabbit offspring to cardiometabolic disorders in a sex-specific manner. © 2021 The Authors","Adult offspring; Fetal programming; Gestational exposure; Intergenerational effect; Rabbit biomedical model","adult; atmospheric pollution; blood; diesel engine; exhaust emission; glucose; health risk; observational method; phenotype; pollution exposure; pregnancy; womens health; Oryctolagus cuniculus; adult; adverse event; air pollution; animal; cardiovascular disease; exhaust gas; female; human; Leporidae; male; maternal exposure; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; toxicity; Adult; Air Pollution; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rabbits; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111548465

However, the system modeling, optimization design, application site, and comprehensive performance analysis of the novel DES need to be further studied. Therefore, this paper combines photovoltaic technology, HES with P2G technology, and EVs with DESs to form a DES that combines HES. Taking the annual net energy import volume and annual cost as targets, a two-layer collaborative optimization method considering both system optimal configuration and operation strategy is used. The novel system will be used to supply energy to a nearly zero-energy community. The influence of various parameters is discussed through parameter analysis. The results show that under the operation strategy in charging during the daytime, the annual net energy import and annual value cost of the novel system are 2170772 kWh and 2272786 yuan, respectively; compared with the multi-parameter collaborative optimization method, it decreased by 3.1% and 5.0%, respectively. Finally, the two-layer collaborative optimization method of this paper is also applicable to the collaborative optimization design of other complex energy systems.

This manuscript presents a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of concentrated solar power (CSP) integration technology with various energy sources. Compared to CSP alone, integration of CSP and fossil fuel provides promising solution to solar energy intermittence, emissions and installation cost reduction, with 25% increase in electric power generation. On the other hand, integration of CSP with other sources such as geothermal and biomass can supply dispatchable power with almost zero emissions. The electricity produced via integrated CSP and photovoltaic (PV) has better power quality and less cost compared to that produced by PV alone or CSP alone, respectively. Integration of CSP and wind energy can meet peak demand, reduce power fluctuation and provide electrical power at a high capacity factor. However, the lack of reliable biomass, geothermal and wind data with the solar availability at specific locations is the main obstacle for the acceptance and further deployment of hybridization systems. The advantages and limitations of the hybrid technologies presented in this paper according to the literature are reviewed. Moreover, future directions of CSP such as production of hydrogen, solid particles receivers and the integration of supercritical carbon dioxide cycle are also discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

Using data on NH3 and N2O emissions following land-applied manures and excreta deposited during grazing, emission factors (EFs) disaggregated by climate zone were developed, and the effects of mitigation strategies were evaluated. The NH3 data represent emissions from cattle and swine manures in temperate wet climates, and the N2O data include cattle, sheep, and swine manure emissions in temperate wet/dry and tropical wet/dry climates. The NH3 EFs for broadcast cattle solid manure and slurry were 0.03 and 0.24 kg NH3–N kg–1 total N (TN), respectively, whereas the NH3 EF of broadcast swine slurry was 0.29. Emissions from both cattle and swine slurry were reduced between 46 and 62% with low-emissions application methods. Land application of cattle and swine manure in wet climates had EFs of 0.005 and 0.011 kg N2O–N kg–1 TN, respectively, whereas in dry climates the EF for cattle manure was 0.0031. The N2O EFs for cattle urine and dung in wet climates were 0.0095 and 0.002 kg N2O–N kg–1 TN, respectively, which were three times greater than for dry climates. The N2O EFs for sheep urine and dung in wet climates were 0.0043 and 0.0005, respectively. The use of nitrification inhibitors reduced emissions in swine manure, cattle urine/dung, and sheep urine by 45–63%. These enhanced EFs can improve national inventories; however, more data from poorly represented regions (e.g., Asia, Africa, South America) are needed. © 2021 The Authors.

These processes provide insight into predictable landscape-level relationships between organisms and their abiotic environment in the form of regular and irregular patterns of biota and resources. However, two aspects have largely been overlooked; the roles played by plant – soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy in spatial self-organization, and their potential contribution, along with plant-resource feedbacks, to community assembly through spatial self-organization. Here, we expand the drivers of spatial self-organization from a focus on plant-resource feedbacks to include plant – soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy, and integrate concepts of nonlinear physics and community ecology to generate a new hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, below-ground processes can affect community assemblages through two types of spatial self-organization, global and local. The former occurs simultaneously across whole ecosystems, leading to self-organized patterns of biota, allelochemicals and resources, and niche partitioning. The latter occurs locally in ecotones, and determines ecotone structure and motion, invasion dynamics, and species coexistence. Studies of the two forms of spatial self-organization are important for understanding the organization of plant communities in drier climates which are likely to involve spatial patterning or re-patterning. Such studies are also important for developing new practices of ecosystem management, based on local manipulations at ecotones, to slow invasion dynamics or induce transitions from transitive to intransitive networks of interspecific interactions which increase species diversity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Allelopathy; Ecotones; Invasion fronts; Plant-soil feedbacks; Scale-dependent feedbacks; Vegetation pattern formation","Plants (botany); Community assembly; Ecosystem management; Interspecific interactions; Self organizations; Self-organization process; Self-organized patterns; Spatial patterning; Structure and motions; Ecosystems; allelopathy; biota; body patterning; climate; ecotone; environmental management; human; motion; physics; plant community; review; soil; species coexistence; species diversity; vegetation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111488794

For many Indigenous communities, the history of colonialism became a history of dispossession for Indigenous peoples, their land, water, traditional knowledge, and practices. This paper addresses the ongoing environmental heritage conflict between the Cree First Nation communities’ traditional environmental heritage practices and developmental energy projects in Saskatchewan, Canada. Drawing from a relational research framework, we (Cree First Nation Knowledge Keeper and settler scholar of color) shared our learning reflections from Cree First Nation communities on how energy projects (particularly pipeline leaks) have negatively impacted Indigenous land, water, and traditional heritage and practices. In this paper, we focus our learnings from the Cree First Nation communities on the following questions: Why and how do developmental projects neglect Indigenous heritage rights, particularly environmental heritage rights? What can be or should be done about it? What are our responsibilities as researchers and educators? In this study, we learned about traditional-knowledge-based consultation and solutions to the ongoing challenges of incorporating Indigenous interests into environmental heritage to foster Indigenous environmental heritage rights.

Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the cooling potential in the application of strategies based on biomimicry for the microclimate in a historical heritage city of Panama. For this, three case studies (base case, case 1, and case 2) of outdoor thermal comfort were evaluated, in which the Envi-met software was used to emulate and evaluate the thermal performance of these strategies during March (highest temperature month) and October (rainier month). The strategies used were extracted from the contrast of zebra skin, human skin, evaporative cooling, and ant skin. The results showed a reduction of 2.8◦C in the air temperature at 11:00, the radiant temperature decreased by 2.2◦C, and the PET index managed to reduce the thermal comfort indicator among its categories. The importance of thinking based on biomimicry in sustainable strategies is concluded; although significant changes were obtained, high risks of discomfort persist due to the layout and proximity of the building. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the increase in global temperature together with the increase in transported people and goods in recent years has forced regulatory authorities around the world to establish strict regulations on pollutant and CO2 emissions. These scenarios are challenging for vehicle manufacturers, but they also create opportunities for the development of new technologies and concepts. For example, automotive companies and researchers are currently exploring hybrid powertrains with either advanced internal combustion engine technologies and low levels of electrification, or with high levels of electrification combined with simpler internal combustion engines. While these hybridization approaches can provide significant improvements in efficiency and emissions. There is also a global movement at the, consumer, manufacturing and government level to accelerate the adoption of zero tailpipe emitting vehicles (e.g., battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles). This paper reviews the current state of powertrain technologies, analyzing first the evolution of emissions regulations in major markets and emphasizing the future tighter measures that will be adopted in Europe and the US. After that, an analysis of current global vehicle sales considering the COVID situation is performed, followed by a forecast of future powertrain technology market share trends.

Urban green infrastructure has emerged as an important tool for climate change adaptation and resilience given their capacity to provide ecosystem services such as local temperature regulation, stormwater mitigation, and air purification. However, realizing the benefits of ecosystem services for climate adaptation depend on where they are locally supplied. Few studies have examined the potential spatial mismatches in supply and demand of urban ecosystem services, and even fewer have examined supply–demand mismatches as a potential environmental justice issue, such as when supply–demand mismatches disproportionately overlap with certain socio-demographic groups. We spatially analyzed demand for ecosystem services relevant for climate change adaptation and combined results with recent analysis of the supply of ecosystem services in New York City (NYC). By quantifying the relative mismatch between supply and demand of ecosystem services across the city we were able to identify spatial hot- and coldspots of supply–demand mismatch. Hotspots are spatial clusters of census blocks with a higher mismatch and coldspots are clusters with lower mismatch values than their surrounding blocks. The distribution of mismatch hot- and coldspots was then compared to the spatial distribution of socio-demographic groups. Results reveal distributional environmental injustice of access to the climate-regulating benefits of ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in NYC. Analyses show that areas with lower supply–demand mismatch tend to be populated by a larger proportion of white residents with higher median incomes, and areas with high mismatch values have lower incomes and a higher proportion of people of color. We suggest that urban policy and planning should ensure that investments in “nature-based” solutions such as through urban green infrastructure for climate change adaptation do not reinforce or exacerbate potentially existing environmental injustices. © 2021 The Authors.

We conducted a mesocosm study comprising shallow and deep soils, and variable and uniform soil depths, and two levels of plant community composition, and exposed them to a simulated drought to test for interactive effects of these treatments on the resilience of carbon dioxide fluxes, plant functional traits, and soil chemical properties. We tested the hypotheses that: (a) shallow and variable depth soils lead to increased resistance and resilience of ecosystem functions to drought due to more exploitative plant trait strategies; (b) plant communities associated with intensively managed high fertility soils, will have more exploitative root traits than extensively managed, lower fertility plant communities. These traits will be associated with higher resistance and resilience to drought and may interact with soil depth and depth heterogeneity to amplify the effects on ecosystem functions. Our results showed that while there were strong soil depth/heterogeneity effects on plant-driven carbon fluxes, it did not affect resistance or resilience to drought, and there were no treatment effects on plant-available carbon or nitrogen. We did observe a significant increase in exploitative root traits in shallow and variable soils relative to deep and uniform, which may have resulted in a compensation effect which led to the similar drought responses. Plant community compositions representative of intensive management were more drought resilient than more diverse “extensive” communities irrespective of soil depth or soil depth heterogeneity. In intensively managed plant communities, root traits were more representative of exploitative strategies. Taken together, our results suggest that reorganization of root traits in response to soil depth could buffer drought effects on ecosystem functions. © 2021 The Authors.

Nature-based solutions are multifunctional, and so their planning and implementation are by necessity interdisciplinary. As such, to support urban transitions with nature-based solutions, the role of intermediary actors deserves research attention. Intermediaries play key roles in linking between sectors, across different levels of government and between disciplines and policy domains. We identified three key points for research and planning nature-based solutions through intermediaries as key agents for change: intermediaries are creators of enabling institutional spaces needed for mainstreaming nature-based solutions in cities; intermediaries as actor configurations are dynamic over time and in context, and intermediation has to be understood as a fundamental governance activity in cities that want to scale up their climate adaptation planning with nature-based solutions. Using a case study of the development and initial implementation of the metropolitan urban forest strategy in Melbourne Australia, we analyze the multi-actor landscape that emerged, through the lens of intermediation. We systematically investigated which actors, partnerships and platforms acted as intermediaries in the transformative agenda of the Urban Forest strategy, how these actors interacted over the course of the strategy's development and how their roles and functions shifted during the early implementation stages of the strategy. We found that an ‘ecology of intermediaries’ adopted a range of roles to support key functions including building collaboration, informing and disseminating policy learning, and strengthening political support. While intermediaries’ roles and functions shifted across the strategy's development, their contributions were critical in the complex metropolitan governance context. Collaborative planning and governance for nature-based solutions in cities require intermediaries to remain topical, focused and inclusive/open to new ideas and lessons from innovations both emerging and driven. © 2021","Australia; Cities; Intermediaries; Metropolitan; Nature-based solutions; Planning; Urban forest","interdisciplinary approach; landscape ecology; policy implementation; strategic approach; suburbanization; urban forestry; urbanization; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111335649

Here, we explored the associations between ocean biogeochemical and cloud properties in a region that seasonally experiences polluted and pristine atmospheric conditions in winter and summer, respectively. The implications of ocean surface chlorophyll-a and biogeochemical fluxes (sea salt, dimethyl sulphide and organic fraction in sea spray) to cloud properties (cloud effective radii (Re), cloud optical thickness, and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC)) were studied using MODIS (Terra, Collection 6, L3) monthly data from 2001 to 2015 along with reanalysis information. We have adopted a climatological averaging approach in time (monthly, seasonal and annual) and space (coastal, open and total (basin) Arabian Sea). This approach was used to minimize incompatibility, if any, between ocean and cloud properties arising from spatio-temporal lags due to different dynamics in the respective boundary layers. The trends in monthly means suggest decreases in chlorophyll-a and CDNC, while Re increased over the Arabian Sea basin during 2001–2015. Variability at the basin scale (expressed as standard deviation in each month, SD) exceeded mean values of respective months for chlorophyll-a, whereas it was nearly half of the mean values for CDNC. An increase in Re seems facilitated more during warmer 2011–2015 than in the 2001–2010 period, which coincided with the decrease in CDNC. Fifteen-year monthly mean climatologies suggest considerable associations among ocean biogeochemical indices and cloud properties, which is more conspicuous during summer monsoon. Increase in sea salt flux appears to account for the higher values of Re in June–July over the basin due to strong monsoon wind. Inverse relations between chlorophyll-a and Re are indicative of smaller droplets that resulted from new particles formed from and/or facilitated by marine biogeochemical emissions. Decline in new particle production due to decrease in surface chlorophyll-a and the growth of particles facilitated by increase in warming, seem responsible for increase in Re and decrease in CDNC from 2001 to 2015. Using chlorophyll-a as the main proxy for ocean biogeochemical indices, we demonstrated that connections between ocean biogeochemistry and clouds are sustained in both small and large scales in space and time over the Arabian Sea. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.","Arabian Sea; biogeochemistry; cloud droplet number; Dimethyl sulphide; ocean–atmosphere links","air-sea interaction; biogeochemistry; chlorophyll a; climatology; cloud microphysics; dimethylsulfide; marine atmosphere; MODIS; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111310608

Here, we demonstrate enhanced hydrocarbon biodegradation in soil slurries under saline conditions of up to ~1 M (5%) compared to non-saline systems and the underlying causes. The mineralization extent of hexadecane was enhanced by salinity in the absence of nutrients. Salinity, similar to nutrients, enhanced the mineralization but through ecological selection. Microbial community analysis indicated a significant enrichment of Actinobacteria phylum and an increase in the absolute abundance of the hydrocarbon-degrading Dietzia genus, but a decrease in the total population size with salinity. Moreover, the in situ expression of alkane hydroxylases genes of Dietzia was generally increased with salinity. The data demonstrate that indigenous halotolerant hydrocarbon degraders were enriched, and their hydrocarbon degradation genes upregulated under saline conditions. These findings have positive implications for engineered biotreatment approaches for hydrocarbons in saline environments such as those affected with produced waters and oil sands tailing ponds. © 2021","Dietzia; Groundwater; Halotolerant; Microbial community; Mineralization; Oil spill; Produced water","Aquifers; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Mineralogy; Oil sands; Oil spills; Paraffins; Population statistics; Produced Water; Dietzia; Halotolerant; Hydrocarbon biodegradation; Hydrocarbon contamination; Hydrocarbon degrading bacteria; Microbial communities; Mineralisation; Saline conditions; Salt contamination; Slurry bioreactors; Biodegradation; biodegradation; groundwater resource; hydrocarbon; indigenous population; microbial activity; mineralization; oil production; salinity; Actinobacteria; Dietzia; hydrocarbon; petroleum; bacterium; bioreactor; bioremediation; genetics; oil and gas field; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Hydrocarbons; Oil and Gas Fields; Petroleum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111264155

A hydrodynamic model was calibrated for a baseline scenario and three representative scenarios of climate change adopted by the Inter-Governmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) were analyzed for year 2050. The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) was applied to evaluate wind speed and direction, and precipitation for the IPCC scenarios. Comparing the different scenarios, results showed that the changes in water level are relatively small. A harmonic analysis of the main components (M2, S2, O1 and K1) showed that the diurnal harmonics are amplified for 2050 scenarios. The semidiurnal constituents were amplified or damped, depending on the station analyzed. The form number showed that for the Laranjeiras bay, there was a change from semidiurnal tide in the baseline scenario to mixed tide for the 2050 scenarios. It was also analyzed the amplification factor, defined as the relation between the amplitude of the simulated harmonic constant and the amplitude of the harmonic constant in the open boundary condition. Also, the results show a dominance of the principal lunar semidiurnal constituent (M2), principal solar semidiurnal constituent (S2) and the lunar terdiurnal (M3), that together are responsible for approximately 50% of the tidal amplitude in all the stations and scenarios. Another scenario was performed considering sea level rise, and the results showed the higher increase occurring in the stations located in the internal regions of the Paranaguá Estuarine Complex. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Circulation; Climate change; Climate downscaling; Estuary; Freshwater flow; Wind speed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111241499

Currently, the spatial and temporal variations of the communities of M. nitroreducens-like archaea and the factors regulating their distribution in paddy soils are poorly known. Here, we examined the diversity, community composition and abundance of these anaerobic methanotrophs at four representative depths (0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 cm) of paddy soils across four rice growth stages (tillering, jointing, flowering and milky stages). High-throughput sequencing of M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA genes showed that their community structure varied among different depths. In contrast, the community structure of these archaea remained relatively stable across rice growth stages. Further, both soil depth and rice growth stage had a significant impact on the abundance of mcrA genes. The gene abundance varied from 7.6 × 105 to 5.0 × 106 copies g−1 dry soil with higher values in 20–30 cm soils, and the abundance was found to be decreased from tillering to milky stages. The soil organic carbon content and ammonium content were the key factors affecting the community structure of these archaea. Our results indicated that both soil depth and crop growth stage greatly affected the abundance of M. nitroreducens-like archaea, while their community structure seemed to be more responsive to soil depth. Taken together, both space and time scales should be considered for better understanding the role of M. nitroreducens-like archaea reducing methane emissions from paddy ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Abundance; Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens; Community structure; mcrA gene; Spatial and temporal variations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111107936

Both rainfall event size and timing are expected to be altered by climate change, but the relative responses of dryland ecosystems to changes in rainfall event size versus timing have not been resolved. Here, we disentangle the effects of these different aspects of precipitation pattern on ecosystem dynamics. We experimentally assessed how these two aspects of rainfall variability impacted a semi-arid grassland ecosystem by altering an ambient precipitation pattern to eliminate variability in (a) rainfall event size (all events were made the same size), (b) rainfall event timing (all events were uniformly spaced in time) and (c) both. Total precipitation amount was constant for all treatments. We measured responses of soil moisture, ecosystem carbon flux (e.g. net primary production and soil CO2 flux), plant community composition and physiological responses of the dominant C4 grass, Bouteloua gracilis. Removing variability in rainfall event size altered ecosystem dynamics more than a pattern of uniform event timing, but the largest impact occurred when variability in both were removed. Notably, eliminating variability in both event size and timing increased above-ground net primary productivity by 23%, consistent with reduced water stress in the dominant C4 grass, while also reducing seasonal variability in soil CO2 flux by 35%, reflecting lower seasonal variability in soil moisture. Synthesis. Unique responses to different aspects of precipitation variability highlight the complexity of predicting how dryland ecosystems will be affected by climate change-induced shifts in rainfall patterns. Our results provide novel support for the key roles of rainfall event size and timing, in addition to total precipitation amount, as determinants of ecosystem function. © 2021 British Ecological Society","ecosystem functioning; multifunctionality; net primary production; precipitation variability; pulse dynamics; semi-arid ecosystems; soil CO2 flux; soil moisture","carbon flux; climate change; ecosystem dynamics; grassland; growing season; net primary production; plant community; precipitation intensity; rainfall; soil carbon; water stress; Bouteloua gracilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111082780

However, these climate interventions do not fit completely into existing international governance structures. To grapple with and innovate proposed governance mechanisms that accommodate the associated technical, social, and environmental challenges, a scenario exercise took place at the 2019 International Geoengineering Summer School. The present paper summarizes and analyzes the experience working with one of the four hypothetical scenarios of geoengineering deployment, that titled “Private sector to the rescue?”. It describes SG deployment by a centralized non-state actor who also pursues CDR. The exercise revealed that early engagement of a wide range of stakeholders and open sharing of knowledge base are necessary to pursue a constructive international dialogue. First, the scenario directs a particular attention to the power limitations of state actors, suggesting the collaborative governance regime. Second, because governance is not exercised in a vacuum, it is crucial to consider a broader range of transnational challenges that may jeopardize even a thoroughly designed governance structure. Third, the exercise highlights the importance of an integrated view on climate policy response that recognizes interactions, trade-offs, and synergies between mitigation, adaptation, CDR, and SG. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change; Geoengineering; Global warming; Scenarios; Solar geoengineering","carbon dioxide; climate change; environmental policy; global warming; solar power; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111072291

However, its high-cost visibility creates political challenges for its implementation at a sufficiently stringent level to achieve deep decarbonization. Flexible regulations, such as renewable portfolio standards and low-carbon fuels standards, incorporate flexibility mechanisms similar to carbon pricing, but seem to face lessor political acceptability barriers. Unlike prescriptive (command-and-control) regulations, flexible regulations do not require technologically-specific compliance pathways and allow credit trading to reduce costs and incentivize innovation. Despite their potential for driving the decarbonization transition, there is comparatively little research on the design and impact of flexible regulations implemented to date. This comparative policy analysis examines government policy documents and academic literature to identify flexible climate regulations implemented in OECD countries and evaluates their implementation context, design characteristics, effectiveness, and public support. In total, 61 unique flexible regulations were identified across 11 countries and 42 sub-national jurisdictions that can be classified into six categories. Findings suggest that as jurisdictions seek to strengthen their climate policy portfolios, flexible regulations can provide a relatively cost effective, broadly supported, and complementary tool to achieve deep emissions reductions, so long as policies are well-designed and interaction and equity impacts are considered. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy; Comparative policy analysis; Emission reductions; Flexible climate regulations; Political acceptability","Carbon; Climate change; Compliance control; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Carbon pricing; Climate policy; Comparative policy analyse; Decarbonisation; Emission reduction; Flexible climate regulation; Greenhouse gas emissions; High costs; Policy analysis; Political acceptability; Emission control; carbon emission; climate change; comparative study; environmental policy; OECD; policy analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111066187

This paper asks in what ways warming temperatures may affect the ability of REDD+ programs to sequester carbon and support rural livelihoods. An example from the forest-rich central Himalayan region of India is used for modeling the implications of crop productivity decline on land use change decisions. Local communities derive their livelihoods through multiple avenues including forestry and farming. When faced with warming-led declining crop productivity, communities may find it attractive to enroll farmland into REDD+ programs. However, a reduced biomass growth rate due to increasing temperatures and declining precipitation would also lower the benefits from REDD+ participation, thereby delaying the timing of irreversible land use decisions. Results suggest that while higher carbon prices and declining crop incomes incentivize early farmland conversion into forests, a lower biomass growth rate discourages REDD+ enrolment. If communities are allowed fuelwood harvesting from forests, it could make land enrollment into REDD+ more attractive, leading to early conversion. However, the value of fuelwood to the communities plays a crucial role in determining the timing of REDD+ participation. When fuelwood is less scarce, warming will delay enrollment into REDD+ schemes. Whereas, when fuelwood is valuable to the community, early afforestation becomes an attractive option. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Forest carbon sequestration; Forest communities; Fuelwood; Land use change; REDD+; Warming climate","afforestation; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop production; emission control; environmental economics; environmental management; food security; forest management; fuelwood; growth rate; land use change; land use planning; livelihood; pollution tax; reforestation; rural area; temperature effect; warming; Himalayas; India; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111058048

However, how and why the composition of soil microbial proteins (the metaproteome) changes across wide gradients of vegetation, climatic and edaphic conditions remains largely undetermined. By applying high-resolution mass spectrometry to soil samples collected from four continents, we identified the most common proteins in soils, and investigated the primary environmental factors driving their distributions across climate and vegetation types. We found that soil proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, DNA repair, lipid metabolism, transcription regulation, tricarboxylic acid cycling, nitrogen (N) fixation and one-carbon metabolism dominate soils across a wide range of climates, vegetation types and edaphic conditions. Vegetation type and climate were important factors determining the community composition of the topsoil metaproteome. Moreover, we show that vegetation type, climate, and key edaphic proporties (mainly soil C fractions, pH and texture) influenced the proportion of important proteins involved in biogeochemical cycles and cellular processes. We also found that protein-based taxonomic information based on proteins has a greater resolution than 16S rRNA gene sequencing with regards to the ability to detect significant correlations with environmental variables. Together, our work identifies the dominant proteins produced by microbes living in a wide range of soils, and advances our understanding of how environmental changes can influence the structure and function of the topsoil metaproteome and the soil processes that they support. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bacterial communities; Biodiversity; Climate; Functionality; Metaproteomics; Vegetation","Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Forestry; Gas emissions; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Natural frequencies; Nitrogen fixation; Proteins; RNA; Soils; Textures; Transcription; Vegetation; Bacterial community; Climate; Edaphic conditions; Functionality; Metaproteomic; Soil fertility; Soil microbes; Soil process; Topsoil; Vegetation type; Bacteria; biogeochemical cycle; biome; microbial activity; microbial community; soil microorganism; topsoil; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111006446

Flights were simulated using crowd-sourced ADS-B/Mode-S data, via filtering and other mathematical treatments. Landing and take-off emissions had to be accounted by direct simulation of the missing segments in the flight trajectory. We demonstrate that these phases of flight are essential for accounting of short-haul emissions.

Through a case study, we present the actions and the political will of the local authorities and discuss the logic involved in the local government's response to the low-carbon pilot city project. We conclude that the bottom-up initiative has become a top-down policy implementation process, which contributes little to the design of new and appropriate policy instruments and initiatives. The local government only “package up” the low-carbon related policies responding to the country's requirement, showing less enthusiasm and political will toward low-carbon development initiatives.

Although much effort has been put toward mitigating air pollutant exposures for the public and WFFs, the current burden in this worker population is unclear as are the most effective exposure reduction strategies. Objective: Quantify fireline carbon monoxide (CO) exposures in WFFs and identify predictors of exposures. Methods: We collected 1-min breathing zone CO measurements on 246 WFFs assigned to fires between 2015 and 2017. We used generalized estimating equations to evaluate predictors of CO exposure. Results: Approximately 5% of WFFs had fireline CO exposure means exceeding the National Wildfire Coordinating Group’s occupational exposure limit of 16 ppm. Relative to operational breaks, direct suppression-related job tasks were associated with 56% (95% CI: 47%, 65%) higher geometric mean CO concentrations, adjusted for incident type, crew type, and fire location. WFF perception of smoke exposure was a strong predictor of measured CO exposure. Significance: Specific job tasks related to direct suppression and WFF perceptions of smoke exposure are potential opportunities for targeted interventions aimed at minimizing exposure to smoke. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Carbon monoxide; Occupational; Prevention; Wildland firefighter","carbon monoxide; fire; fire fighter; human; occupational exposure; smoke; United States; Carbon Monoxide; Firefighters; Fires; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Smoke; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110832038

Poor air quality has claimed many lives and distorted the environment across the globe, and much more severely in African countries where air quality monitoring systems are scarce or even do not exist. Here in Africa, dirty air is brought about by the growth in industrialization, urbanization, flights, and road traffic. Air pollution remains such a silent killer, especially in Africa, and if not dealt with, it will continue to lead to health issues, such as heart conditions, stroke, and chronic respiratory organ unwellness, which later result in death. In this paper, the Kampala Air Quality Index prediction model based on the fuzzy logic inference system was designed to determine the air quality for Kampala city, according to the air pollutant concentrations (nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matter 2.5). It is observed that fuzzy logic algorithms are capable of determining the air quality index and therefore, can be used to predict and estimate the air quality index in real time, based on the given air pollutant concentrations. Hence, this can reduce the effects of air pollution on both humans and the environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Groundwater recharge in this region is focused in topographic depressions, which receive lateral inputs of snowmelt runoff in addition to vertical inputs of precipitation. The response of depression-focused recharge to climate change is largely unknown due to the difficulty of representing the complex interaction between depressions and surrounding uplands in hydrological models. This study evaluates climate change effects on recharge using a process-based hydrological model and the pseudo-global warming (PGW) approach representing a climate of 2092–2100, which has a higher mean annual temperature (+4.9 °C) and precipitation (+135 mm or +27%) compared with the present climate. The recharge model is conditioned using field data from an instrumented grassland site in the Canadian Prairies. Under the present climate, snowmelt runoff occurred in March–April over frozen soil, which accounted for the majority of water transfer from the upland to the depression. Under the PGW scenario, the amount of snowmelt runoff in March–April decreased due to lower snow accumulation and shorter periods of frozen soil. Instead, runoff occurred in midwinter and also in summer months due to increased intensity and duration of summer storms. Despite the increased precipitation, mean annual recharge rates decreased from 10.2 to 3.2 mm yr–1, indicating the importance of considering the complex effects of warmer and wetter climate on hydrological processes in cold semiarid regions. © 2021 The Authors.

Soil fungi are important in controlling the belowground carbon and nutrient cycling in peatlands; however, the impact of altered fire regimes on these fungi is still unclear. Methods: We assessed fungal abundance, composition, and diversity across four soil depths (0–5 cm, 6–10 cm, 11–15 cm, 16–20 cm) under low-severity and high-severity fire in a subtropical peatland in the southeastern USA. Results: Low-severity fire significantly increased fungal Shannon diversity and saprotrophic fungi in the 0–5 cm soil layer immediately after fire and then retracted within 2 years. This pattern was not observed below 5 cm soils. The dominant fungal class − Archaeorhizomycetes declined initially and then returned to pre-low-severity fires levels at 0–5 cm depths. Time since low-severity fire was a primary driver of fungal composition in the 0–10 cm soil depth, while spatial distance among sites affected the deeper soils (11–20 cm). The fungal Shannon diversity failed to recover in the unburned state even 30 years after high-severity fire, especially in 6–20 cm soil layers. Stratification patterns of the fungal community were diminished by high-severity fire. Soil properties (either phenolics or carbon) were the primary drivers in shaping fungal community reassembly after high-severity fire across all soil depths. Conclusion: Collectively, the fungal communities seem to be highly resilient to low-severity fire, but not to high-severity fire in the shrub-dominated coastal peatlands. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Archaeorhizomycetes; Community assembly; Depth-dependent; Fire severity; Fire stage","abundance; fungus; microbial community; peatland; soil depth; species diversity; subtropical region; wildfire; United States; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110718023

The promotion of GTFP cannot be separated from the financial support and guarantee provided by financial agglomeration. According to the theory of new economic geography and agglomeration, this study uses location entropy and directional SBM-DEA methods to calculate the financial agglomeration level and GTFP of 283 cities at prefecture-level and above in China from 2003 to 2018. A temporal and individual two-way fixed-effect model and a spatial measurement model are constructed to empirically study direct and spillover impacts of financial agglomeration on GTFP. The empirical results show that financial agglomeration facilitates GTFP growth in a given city, but it significantly reduces GTFP in surrounding areas of the city. Divided the cities by their geolocations in eastern, central, and western regions, we find that, in each region, financial agglomeration can significantly promote GTFP of a city but does not have a significant impact on its surrounding areas, indicating a weak spillover effect. Cities with a population of less than 3 million are associated with higher GTFP. Industrial structure, foreign direct investment and human capital play a positive role in GTFP growth, but the role of urban infrastructure construction appears trivial. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","City scale heterogeneity; Financial agglomeration; GTFP; Regional heterogeneity; SDM","Agglomeration; Economics; Investments; Population statistics; Urban growth; Chinese cities; City scale heterogeneity; Financial agglomeration; Green economies; Green total factor productivity; Productivity growth; Regional heterogeneity; SDM; Spatial Durbin models; Total factor productivity; Productivity; agglomeration; energy efficiency; energy market; heterogeneity; power generation; regional economy; total factor productivity; China; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110656227

This goal is approached by integrating crop protection measures and non-chemical measures or applying crop protection products only when needed, thus eliminating unnecessary applications. In addition, preventive farm management methods such as optimal management of the aerial environment in greenhouses with sufficient installed technology may provide adequate disease suppression, as the grower can avoid conditions that favour pests and fungus development. Aim of this study is the development of a web-based decision support system (DSS) that estimates the risk for a fungi disease outbreak in a greenhouse. The disease development risk assessment is based on disease models already available in the literature that correlate the rate of disease development to crop microclimate conditions and cultivation practices. Up to now such models were mainly used for the disease development risk assessment based on past or historical data. A strong point of the work is related to the fact that the DSS makes use of the outside climate forecast to predict the greenhouse microclimate conditions during a set of days that will follow. Then, based on the predicted microclimate inside the greenhouse the Botrytis disease development models are used to assess the potential risk for disease development in a greenhouse tomato crop during the following days. The greenhouse microclimate is estimated based on the outside weather forecast for the region of the greenhouse, the greenhouse energy and vapour balance, the greenhouse control concept and methodology, the climate control equipment and the greenhouse climate set points. The last part of the DSS, contains a tactical and strategical tool that, according to the risk assessment, suggests climate control actions to prevent fungi development for preventive and optimal disease control. Such a DSS can then be included in disease management systems to assist growers to decide when to proceed to a certain action in order to modify the conditions that favour the development of a disease, or if necessary, when to apply the proper permitted plant protection products. In this work, the development of the DSS and the results of the validation process of the microclimate predicted values are presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Botrytis; Decision support system; Microclimate management; Organic farming; Pesticides reduction; Preventive farm management; Tomato","Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Disease control; Fruits; Fungi; Greenhouses; Pesticides; Risk assessment; Botrytis; Decision supports; Disease development; Disease suppression; Microclimate management; Organic farming; Pesticide reduction; Preventive farm management; Risks assessments; Support systems; Decision support systems; agricultural management; decision support system; fungal disease; greenhouse ecosystem; historical perspective; horticulture; microclimate; risk assessment; Botrytis; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110558269

Exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) induces direct plant resistance to B. tabaci, but the underlying mechanism of JA-induced exogenous defenses is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that exogenous JA not only increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) in tomato mesophyll cells but also induces the expression of Ca2+-sensor genes and plant defense genes. Pre-treatment with Ca2+ inhibitor (ruthenium red) significantly repressed the elevation of [Ca2+]cyt, expression of JA-induced genes, and emission of plant volatiles induced by JA, thus reducing the JA-induced direct (feeding choice and fitness of B. tabaci) and indirect [olfactory choice and parasitism by the parasitoid Encarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae)] plant resistance to B. tabaci. These results indicate that the Ca2+ signal induced by JA mediates and directs the plants defenses against whitefly.

Nevertheless, ensuring their integration and direction for moving toward low carbon mobility transitions is often challenging in practice. Urban experimentation has emerged as a governance model to foster innovations for climate change mitigation in cities while articulating a sustainable future. This paper aims to review how urban public transport experiments ensure the selection and consolidation of ASI measures to support low carbon mobility transitions. Our analysis is based on a systematic review of 41 documents gathered from peer-reviewed and grey literature databases. We find that experimentation is a critical platform for introducing novel ASI-public transport measures and exploring potential pathways toward the transitions through participative backcasting approaches. In our database, the experiments generally contribute to the rollout of LEV technologies and BRT systems, followed by the development of other ASI measures. Some of the experiments establish climate change targets to support low carbon mobility. Our review demonstrates that the experiments hold a pivotal role in developing niches for ASI-based measures and stimulating policy processes for the long-term transitions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; CO2 emission; Low carbon mobility; Public transport; Transition; Urban experiment","Carbon; Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Urban transportation; Climate change mitigation; CO$-2$/ emission; Governance models; Greenhouse gas emissions; Low carbon; Low carbon mobility; Public transport; Systematic literature review; Transition; Urban experiment; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110486175

It is urgent to find a sustainable development way. CO2 geological storage combined with enhanced water recovery (CO2-EWR) is a win-win technology that can increase CO2 geological storage potential and obtain abundant groundwater resources meanwhile. A 3D heterogeneous geologic model was built to estimate the potential of field-scale CO2 geological storage combined with enhanced water recovery according to the seismic, well logging data and well testing data of the Cretaceous Donggou Formation in the eastern Junggar Basin of China. Twelve injection-production scenarios were designed. The results show that CO2-EWR technology can greatly reduce the pressure buildup with the minimum pressure increase of 1.3 MPa and thus increase CO2 injection with a maximum cumulative amount of 100 Mt, three times more than that for sole CO2 injection. Also, it can enhance total production of deep saline water by a factor of ~100 compared to that for sole water production. Formation parameters such as permeability, porosity and slope of the reservoir primarily control the migration and dissolution of CO2. The heterogeneity of the reservoir plays an important role in the CO2 spatial distribution and even saline water production. One injection well with constant rate injection of CO2 and one production well with constant pressure production of saline water scenario is the preferred option in engineering practice of eastern Junggar Basin, which can obtain the maximum amount of CO2 injection and saline water resources.

This contrasts with the USA, China, Norway and Germany, who have offered substantial subsidies and incentives to upgrade to EVs, to minimize air pollution and fossil fuel consumption. The main purpose of this paper was to review the policies, strategies, and technical considerations for developing EVs, by analyzing both the Indian EV market and the global evolution of EVs. This study also considered the development and research status of EVs in India. In addition, the current deployment of EVs in India, together with the challenges and opportunities within this sector, was explored and a strength weakness opportunity and challenges (SWOC) analysis performed. This study will encourage policy makers, government and businesses to incentivize the deployment of EVs in India in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It was concluded that the Indian government should provide more research funds for the development of both EVs and the charging infrastructure. Also, central government could play a major role in coordinating the activities of the state and EV related businesses, to support the emerging Indian EV sector. © 2021 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Air pollution; Automobile industry; Electric vehicles; Electric vehicles market penetration; India","atmospheric pollution; electric vehicle; energy policy; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; policy making; strategic approach; trend analysis; China; Germany; India; Norway; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110464380

We carried out a collaborative study in a densely populated city-state (Singapore) to assess the integrated PE to fine particles (PM2.5), ultrafine particles (UFPs) and black carbon (BC) across diverse indoor and outdoor urban MEs, estimate related health risks and make suitable recommendations for healthy living in cities. Two volunteers with different lifestyles participated in the study by tracking their PE to particulate air pollution and the time-activity patterns over 24 hours using portable PM monitoring devices and recording their whereabouts using GPS coordinates. Home, transport and recreation (i.e., food court) MEs represented pollution hotspots of PM2.5 (21.0 μg/m3), BC (3.4 μg/m3) and UFP (33.0 × 103 #/cm3), respectively. Among the different modes of transport used by the participants (walking, cycling, e-scooter, mass rapid transport (MRT), bus, car and taxi), the air pollutants had elevated concentrations while commuting by public transport (bus and MRT) as well as during active modes of transport (walking and cycling). Air-conditioned cars and taxis, equipped with air filtration systems, represented the lowest PE. The health risk assessment revealed that there are potential carcinogenic risks associated with the long-term exposure to elevated levels of PM2.5-bound toxic trace elements. These risks can be mitigated with the introduction of low-carbon and active modes of transport in place of internal combustion engines and the use of indoor air pollution exposure mitigation devices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Airborne particles; Health risk assessment; Personal exposure; Time-activity; Urban air quality","Air conditioning; Carbon; Health; Health risks; Indoor air pollution; Particles (particulate matter); Risk assessment; Risk perception; Taxicabs; Trace elements; Airborne particle; Health risk assessments; Microenvironments; Mode of transport; Particulate air pollution; Particulate Matter; Personal exposures; Time-activity; Ultrafine particle; Urban air quality; Air quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110452036

In such context, Integrated Energy System (IES) is a promising solution to improve system performance by coupling various energy carriers in an energy hub to fulfill diverse consumers’ energy needs. However, the widely used criteria for energy system modelling is based on energy analysis that considers energy quantity only and neglects energy quality. Consequently, exergy index computation becomes a vital issue that accounts energy quantity along with energy quality to provide an accurate assessment. Hence, this paper proposes an exergy hub approach to model IES that constitutes electricity, District Heating (DH) and Individual Heating (IH) infrastructure of China for the year 2020. At first, the exergy efficiency of energy-producing components is calculated by using Cycle-Tempo and Engineering Equation Solver (EES). Then, IES performance is evaluated by computing annual costs, Primary Energy Supply (PES), CO2 emissions and renewable energy share with the help of EnergyPLAN technical simulation strategy. These aforementioned performance indicators are investigated for three different cases like IRES maximum integration in electricity infrastructure (Case 1), Heat Pump (HP) inclusion in IH infrastructure (Case 2) and Thermal Storage (TS) addition in DH infrastructure (Case 3) and these cases comparison with energy hub results are also provided. Energy and exergy hub approaches substantiate different results as IRES integration proves the most cost-efficient and decarbonized alternative in exergy hub while in energy hub TS addition is the best case alternative. Though IRES integration deemed cost-efficient with reduced emissions in exergy hub but in comparison to energy hub, this case is costly as exergy efficiency of IRES are lower than energy efficiency. Similarly, HP and TS exergetic results are inferior to energetic because high quality energy is being exploited to produce low quality energy and heat producing components are less exergetically efficient. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cycle-Tempo; energy analysis; EnergyPLAN; exergy efficiency; integrated energy system; intermittent renewable energy sources","Energy efficiency; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Integration; Natural resources; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Cycle tempo; Energy; Energy analysis; Energy hubs; EnergyPLAN; Exergy efficiencies; Integrated energy systems; Intermittent renewable energy source; Renewable energy source; Sources integrations; Exergy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110387472

However, it is unclear how diet affects GHG emissions from dung patches left by grazing cattle. In this study, we evaluated the impact of supplementing the diet of grazing beef steers with maize grain on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from dung patches, and estimated the corresponding emission factors (EF). Gas fluxes from dung and soil were monitored over 125 days, using the static chamber technique. Dung from supplemented grazing steers produced significantly lower CH4 and higher N2O emissions (1.7 g CH4-C/m2 and 0.4 g N2O-N/m2) than dung from non-supplemented steers (4.0 g CH4-C/m2 and 0.1 g N2O-N/m2). Total GHG emissions from dung showed a tendency to be lower with maize grain supplementation (47.8 and 63.5 ± 5.9 g CO2eq/head/d for supplemented and non-supplemented steers, respectively). The EF values (0.8 g CH4/kg volatile solids (VS) and 0.09 % N2O) were lower than the default values established by IPCC (2006), but comparable to those established by IPCC (2019). Thus, the IPCC (2019) EF values should be used for GHG inventories in the study region (Argentina) until more region-specific values are obtained. Using local data, this study showed that supplementing the diet of grazing steers can reduce dung GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to assess the full implications of dietary supplementation on GHG emissions at farm level. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cattle grazing; Dietary supplementation; Dung; Emission factor; Methane; Nitrous oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110351396

Lockdown has resulted in drastic mobility reduction and subsequent unlocking process brought back mobility gradually to a certain level, substantially lower than the Pre-COVID periods. However, this is expected to be back gradually to same level of Pre-COVID after certain period of time. While this change is planned to be gradual, it creates an opportunity to improve mobility towards non-motorized transport (NMT) which can influence travel behavior for present as well for the future covering Pre and Post-COVID periods. Apart from studying the influencing travel behavior during Pre and Post-COVID conditions, change in quantum of commuting population is required to be studied for various estimations related to transport planning. This quantum of commuting population is largely affected by the adopted locking/unlocking strategies by Government of India. Commuting population and travel behavior got influenced by the large migration from metro cities to smaller towns, adopted work from home (WFH) styles, reduced commute of elderly and children and other restrictions on gatherings, etc. Considering the range of allowed activities, influenced by the phases of locking/unlocking strategies, twelve different scenarios have been developed for various estimations. The developed scenarios have been named with alpha numeric style ranging from A0 to E5. A0 presenting the Pre-COVID scenario. Alphabet “A” represent Pre-COVID scenario, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” Scenarios represent the unlocking phases, while number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 represents the different policy aspects related to the change on capacity of transport services (i.e. public transport capacity and change due to infrastructural improvement for NMT). Scenario A0 represents the Pre-COVID situation, while other ranges (viz., B1, B2, B3, C2, C3, C4, D2, D3, D5) represents various locking/unlocking levels. The Scenario E5 represents the situation without any movement restrictions, where public transport systems are assumed to be functioning with full capacity and infrastructure has been improved for NMT trips. Estimations for all the 12 scenarios include commuting population, their modal split, vehicle kilometers travelled by these vehicles and corresponding vehicular emission. Estimated modal split also includes the influence of improved NMT friendly infrastructure and reduced capacity of public transport systems. The results of developed scenarios provide a handy information for the policy makers to choose right policy to promote sustainable transportation with adequate emphasis on NMT. It is evident that as compared to the Pre-COVID scenario (A0), Post-COVID scenario with improved NMT infrastructure (E5) has VKT reduction of 19% in MTWs, 5% in Cars and 49% in Buses. Increase in bicycle trips have been estimated to be 5.88 million for Post-COVID scenario as compared to 1.1 million trips estimated for the Pre-COVID Scenario. Similar trend has also been observed for fuel consumption (reduction of 4.7%–11.8%) and corresponding vehicular emission (reduction of 14%). This study estimated the potential benefits of providing NMT friendly infrastructure considering the gradual shift influenced by locking/unlocking phases of COVID pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID; Modal split; Non motorized transport; Sustainable transportation; Vehicular emission","public transport; traffic emission; transportation; transportation planning; transportation policy; transportation system; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110348156

We review the literature on bioenergy use for climate change mitigation, including studies that use top-down integrated assessment models or bottom-up modelling, and studies that do not rely on modelling. We summarize the state of knowledge concerning potential co-benefits and adverse side effects of bioenergy systems and discuss limitations of modelling studies used to analyse consequences of bioenergy expansion. The implications of bioenergy supply on mitigation and other sustainability criteria are context dependent and influenced by feedstock, management regime, climatic region, scale of deployment and how bioenergy alters energy systems and land use. Depending on previous land use, widespread deployment of monoculture plantations may contribute to mitigation but can cause negative impacts across a range of other sustainability criteria. Strategic integration of new biomass supply systems into existing agriculture and forest landscapes may result in less mitigation but can contribute positively to other sustainability objectives. There is considerable variation in evaluations of how sustainability challenges evolve as the scale of bioenergy deployment increases, due to limitations of existing models, and uncertainty over the future context with respect to the many variables that influence alternative uses of biomass and land. Integrative policies, coordinated institutions and improved governance mechanisms to enhance co-benefits and minimize adverse side effects can reduce the risks of large-scale deployment of bioenergy. Further, conservation and efficiency measures for energy, land and biomass can support greater flexibility in achieving climate change mitigation and adaptation. © 2021 The Authors.

Therefore, the promotion of low-carbon cities (LCC) in China is of great importance to achieve this mission. This paper examines the performance of practicing LCC in China by conducting a temporal-spatial evolution analysis on LCC performance. By combining the entropy weight method and the linear weighted sum method, the LCC performance score is calculated to help establish performance grades. The quartile method and the Boston matrix method are used to conduct temporal analysis and spatial analysis respectively. The data employed in this study were collected from 34 cities in China for the period from 2006 to 2018. The findings are as follows: (1) The overall LCC performance in China has been improved in recent years and the implementation of the low carbon pilot project (LCPP) has made contributions to this improvement. (2) The LCC performance of those cities in Southern China is generally better than that in Northern cities. (3) Good LCC performance cities are those economically developed cities, in which the industrial structure is dominated by low carbon industries. This study provides a holistic picture of the LCC practice in China and also provides supportive references for policymakers to make tailor-made measures to improve the LCC performance internationally. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","China; Evolution analysis; LCC performance assessment; Low carbon city (LCC); Temporal-spatial perspective","Carbon; Emission control; Carbon emission reductions; Entropy weight method; Industrial structures; Linear weighted sum methods; Low-carbon cities; Low-carbon industries; Spatial evolution; Temporal analysis; Spatial variables measurement; economic development; emission control; industrial structure; performance assessment; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110316362

Also contributing to this growth is the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme, firstly developed to enhance the accuracy in the contextualisation of urban measurements, and lately used for characterising urban areas. Due to its relative novelty, researchers are still investigating the potential of LCZs and its indicators for urban temperature variability detection. In this respect, the present study introduces the results of an extensive monitoring campaign carried out in the city of Madrid over a two-year period (2016–2018). The aim of this work is to further examine the relationships between LCZs and air temperature differences, with emphasis on their hourly and seasonal evolution. A graphical and statistical analysis to identify temperature variability trends for each LCZ is performed. Results support the existing evidence suggesting a high level of effectiveness in capturing the heat island (UHI) profile of different urban areas, while underperforming when it comes to capturing diurnal temperature variability. The incorporation of indicators that explain the daytime temperature variation phenomenon into the LCZ scheme is therefore recommended, warranting further research. © 2021 The Authors","Air temperature measurements; Intra-urban temperature variability; Local climate zones (LCZs); Urban canopy layer; Urban heat Island; Urban meteorological network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110316229

In this article, we address the carbon emission responsibility of the city of Bogota from a consumption-based perspective, by assessing the carbon footprint for the whole city. We use an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model where a survey-based input-output table of Bogota is nested, avoiding the downside of using assumptions regarding the production and trade structure of the city. We identify city's emissions hotspots across the globe, mainly in China and the United States, proving that consumption-based accounting is required when highly open systems as cities are under analysis, to finally propose source shifting scenarios as mitigation strategies. Our results indicate that Bogota is a net importer of CO2 emissions and, the city's carbon footprint almost double direct emissions generated within its territory. China, the rest of Colombia, and the United States are heavily affected by Bogota's carbon footprint as those three regions bear 38% of the city's footprint. The main drivers of those emissions are Electrical equipment, Computers, Vehicles and Machinery, goods that are imported and consumed by Bogota's residents. Important opportunities for emission reductions arise when sourcing changes from China to the US and Latin American countries, which provide fresh evidence for national and local authorities to improve their efforts on reducing emissions. © 2021","Bogota; Carbon Footprint; City emissions; Consumption-based inventories; MRIO; Source shifting","Carbon footprint; Machinery; Open systems; Bogotum; Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint; Carbon footprint reductions; City emission; Consumption-based inventory; Import sources; Input-output modeling; MRIO; Source shifting; Emission control; carbon emission; carbon footprint; consumption behavior; emission control; emission inventory; pollution control; pollution policy; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; city; Colombia; environmental impact; environmental management; exhaust gas; imports source shifting; industry and industrial phenomena; machine; United States; Bogota; China; Colombia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110266106

These coastal “Saline Volcanic Basins” (SVB) have massive volume, heterogeneous internal structure, and relatively low temperatures. SVB's occur in island arcs and so-called hot spots such as Hawaii and Iceland. In both settings, the volcanic formations are exceedingly thick, border the ocean, are below sea level, and are saturated with seawater at storage depths. Many SVB reservoirs are accessible with onshore wells within which intercalated high and low-permeability layers and low temperatures can keep supercritical CO2 in a relatively high-density state and promote solution and capillary trapping, in addition to mineralization. Some regions of the subsurface may be at low enough temperature to allow for CO2 hydrate formation as an additional trapping mechanism. Our initial assessment of storage potential focuses on the northeast portion of the island of Hawaii, where there is direct information about the subsurface volcanic stratigraphy and hydrology based on observations made during two scientific drilling projects that penetrated to 3.5 km with continuous coring. Initial analysis, including simulations of a 50 Megaton injection of supercritical CO2, suggests that this region could be effective for permanent storage, and potentially for gigatons of CO2. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon mineralization; Carbon sequestration; CO2 hydrate; Hawaii; Volcano structure","Low permeability reservoirs; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sea level; Sedimentary rocks; Stratigraphy; Volcanic rocks; Volcanoes; Concept description; Initial assessment; Internal structure; Scientific drilling; Storage potential; Supercritical CO2; Trapping mechanisms; Volcanic formation; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; coastal zone; conceptual framework; gas hydrate; reservoir rock; volcano; Hawaii [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110265360

The production and consumption of both gases is determined by the interplay between abiotic (such as oxygen availability) and biotic (such as community structure and trophic interactions) factors. Fish communities play a key role in driving carbon fluxes in benthic and pelagic habitats. Previous studies indicate that trophic interactions in the water column, as well as in the benthic zone can strongly affect aquatic CO2 and CH4 net emissions. However, the overall effect of fish on both pelagic and benthic processes remains largely unresolved, representing the main focus of our experimental study. We evaluated the effects of benthic and pelagic fish on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates; on CO2 and CH4 diffusion and ebullition, as well as on CH4 production and oxidation, using a full-factorial aquarium experiment. We compared five treatments: absence of fish (control); permanent presence of benthivorous fish (common carps, benthic) or zooplanktivorous fish (sticklebacks, pelagic); and intermittent presence of carps or sticklebacks. We found trophic and non-trophic effects of fish on CO2 and CH4 emissions. Intermittent presence of benthivorous fish promoted a short-term increase in CH4 ebullition, probably due to the physical disturbance of the sediment. As CH4 ebullition was the major contributor to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, incidental bioturbation by benthivorous fish was a key factor triggering total carbon emissions from our aquariums. Trophic effects impacted GHG dynamics in different ways in the water column and the sediment. Fish predation on zooplankton led to a top-down trophic cascade effect on methane-oxidising bacteria. This effect was, however, not strong enough as to substantially alter CH4 diffusion rates. Top-down trophic effects of zooplanktivorous and benthivorous fish on benthic macroinvertebrates, however, were more pronounced. Continuous fish predation reduced benthic macroinvertebrates biomass decreasing the oxygen penetration depth, which in turn strongly reduced water–atmosphere CO2 fluxes while it increased CH4 emission. Our work shows that fish can strongly impact GHG production and consumption processes as well as emission pathways, through trophic and non-trophic effects. Furthermore, our findings suggest their impact on benthic organisms is an important factor regulating carbon (CO2 and CH4) emissions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","benthic processes; greenhouse gases; methane oxidation; methane production; pelagic processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110253685

At the moment, EJ is defined as a framework for discussing fairness in energy systems and operates as an umbrella term to signify various concerns related to energy development across diverse groups to enable communication. Thus, we call EJ a boundary object (BO) and discuss its further evolution into a standard, or its dissolution into several locally specific concepts. This study provides a systematic review of the literature that applies the concept of EJ: how its features developed and how it gained popularity in academic publications to mid-2019. We present a bibliometric overview of the number of occurrences of the concept across the literature using the Scopus and WOS databases (N = 182) and, using VOSviewer software, we describe similarities between research topics to which the concept was related. By mapping out its diverse thematic and geographic applications, we review the critical trends and claim that EJ can address real-life challenges. We submit that it will have more practical power once it starts being used more broadly to build cooperation among scholars, policymakers, activists, and grassroots movements. © 2021","Boundary concepts; Boundary objects; Energy justice; Energy transition; Literature review; VOS viewer",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110248745

In this study, we quantified the role of dispersal limitation and the potential mitigating effect of large-scale reforestation on the redistribution of the herbaceous forest plant species Primula elatior under climate change. Location: Europe. Methods: High resolution (100 m) landscape-scale and macro-climatic variables were combined to predict range-wide habitat suitability using Maxent. Dispersal limitation was modelled, based on isolation-by-resistance (IBR) principles through integration of circuit theory and genomic data, to assess patch accessibility and metapopulation stability under climate change. Large-scale reforestation was evaluated as a potential mitigating strategy by incorporating a land use change scenario into the distribution and dispersal models. Results: Landscape-scale variables contributed significantly to the distribution of P. elatior (78.33%) and to the accuracy of our model (AUC = 0.81). Isolation-by-resistance (R2cond =.92) was driven by land use (45.5%), distance from rivers (36.4%) and elevation (18.2%). It was estimated that 46.4 ± 13.9% (mean ± SD of climate change scenarios) of the total distribution area would be lost due to climate change by 2050 and an additional 15.6 ± 1.7% (mean ± SD) of the distribution would not be accessible through migration. The median latitude of the patch distribution shifted 183.2 ± 34.8 km (mean ± SD) northwards and 58.1 ± 9.3 km (mean ± SD) to more maritime regions. The patch accessibility was low in these regions and the metapopulation stability decreased considerably in the south of the distribution. Reforestation mitigated 54.1 ± 18.2% (mean ± SD) of the accessible distribution area loss and 49.5 ± 4.2% (mean ± SD) of the decrease in metapopulation stability. Main conclusion: To alleviate the loss of the accessible distribution area of P. elatior under climate change, it will be required to integrate climate mitigation strategies (RCP 2.6), range-wide afforestation, restoration of ecological connectivity and focused assisted migration to newly available habitat. © 2021 The Authors.

Methods: A mixed-methods (surveys, semistructured interviews, and nondisguised direct observation) approach was used to ascertain facilitators and barriers to implementation and to subsequently develop a scalable implementation strategy with the aim to accelerate TPV scalability across a large community pharmacy chain in states where it is permitted. One-on-one staff interviews and observations provided qualitative data to identify facilitators and barriers to TPV. A Web-based survey was used to gather perceptions on a variety of implementation strategies that would make use of identified facilitators and work to overcome identified barriers. Results: During the mixed-method study, 3 key themes emerged: TPV is a complex intervention whose implementation is facilitated by both adaptability and trialability and is highly dependent on state practice regulations; the implementation climate of the pharmacy organization serves as a facilitator to TPV; and individual beliefs about TPV change over time as implementation experience increases. Conclusion: TPV is an expansion of the technician role that allows the profession of pharmacy to increase the provision of clinical activities by delegation of a nonclinical-based task. Early adopters of TPV recognize that verification is a task that is increasingly automated by mail-order pharmacies and that verification may no longer be considered a pharmacist task. Pharmacies in this study tended to revert to comfortable, traditional workflow at the first sign of distress. To be successful in the future, TPV should be thought of as the primary workflow procedure and not as an option.

This study uses multiple methods to empirically assess the impact of interprovincial population migration of China on its trade-induced carbon transfers from a spatial view over 2002–2012. We constructed two networks of migration and carbon transfers, and based on the analysis of their topological structure, we inferred that carbon flows and migration are complements–larger migration flows typically correlate with larger trade-related carbon flows. Furthermore, we analyzed how migration affects interprovincial carbon transfers; in addition, we explored the geographical factor by dividing Chinese provinces into five subregions. The results illustrated that trade-induced carbon emissions situation in China was shaped partly by interprovincial migration at the national level. While the contribution of migration varies markedly across subregions owing to the unbalanced regional economic development and carbon intensity, migration-focused emission control strategy should be enhanced discriminatively to better understand China's inter-provincial joint energy conservation and emission reduction policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission transfers; China; Interprovincial migration; Spatial impacts; STIRPAT-inspired model","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Population dynamics; Regional planning; Carbon emission transfer; Carbon emissions; Carbon flow; Carbon transfer; China; Interprovincial migration; Large-scales; Multiple methods; Spatial impacts; STIRPAT-inspired model; Carbon; carbon emission; consumption behavior; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110139507

We optimised various objects and compared the results. The results showed that the positive effects of increased electricity sales revenue could not always balance the negative effects of increased investments after configuring energy storage. Moreover, the simulation of the pumping state, discharging state, and state of charge (SOC) examined the system performance. The annual energy distribution analysed quantitively the reservoirs utilisation frequency and energy utilisation efficiency, which revealed the effect of design variables on pumping and discharging operation. Additionally, the effects of system stability constraints and load demand levels on the economic benefits, system performance, and CO2 emission reduction were compared and analysed.

Over time, tougher regulations have forced the introduction of new engine and emission control technologies to reduce emissions from YTs. This paper reviews the history and emissions from a range of technologies that were introduced during the past years with the understanding that a variety of technology solutions may be used by ports worldwide to address air pollution concerns. These new technologies included: cleaner engines, new liquid and gaseous fuels (natural gas [NG] and liquified petroleum gas [LPG]), and new emission control technology. The results show how technology improvements in YT emissions control technology have led to reductions of >70% in NOx and >90% in PM in the emissions inventories for CHE at ports in Southern California. © 2021","Cargo handling equipment; Diesel engines; NOx emissions; PM emissions; Yard tractors","Air pollution; Diesel engines; Emission control; Freight transportation; Gas emissions; Liquefied petroleum gas; Nitrogen oxides; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Truck transportation; Cargo handling equipment; Emission control technologies; Freight terminals; Nitric oxide emissions; Particulate matter emissions; Port facilities; Terminal facilities; Yard tractors; Zero emission; Nitric oxide; atmospheric pollution; cargo handling; diesel engine; emission control; emission inventory; environmental planning; freight transport; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; port operation; transportation planning; transportation technology; trucking; waste technology; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110029454

This study quantifies spatially explicit the availability of marginal land in the EU, its production biomass potentials for eight different crops, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of advanced biofuel supply chains. Available land is mapped based on land marginality and Renewable Energy Directive Recast (REDII) land-related sustainability criteria. Biomass potentials are assessed with a water-use-to-biomass-production approach while considering the available land, location-specific biophysical conditions and crop-specific phenological characteristics. The GHG balance of advanced biofuels from energy crops produced on marginal lands is assessed considering both land-related carbon stock changes and supply chain emissions with the carbon footprint approach from the REDII. Available marginal land that meets REDII criteria is projected at 20.5–21 Mha 2030 and 2050, respectively. Due to biophysical limitations, not all available land is suitable for energy crop production. The maximum biomass potential of lignocellulosic energy crops (optimal crop choice with maximum yield for each available location) varies between 1951 PJ year−1 in 2030 and 2265 PJ year−1 in 2050. The GHG emission performance (net emissions) of different advanced biofuel supply chains varies on average between −32 g CO2-eq MJfuel−1 for poplar/willow diesel to 38 g CO2-eq (Formula presented.) for reed canary grass renewable jet fuel. The large variability in GHG performance is strongly determined by the spatial heterogeneity, which dictates the type of feedstock produced under specific local biophysical conditions, the crop characteristics, and the best conversion pathway. Negative GHG emissions are related to increased carbon stocks for the biomass and soil organic carbon pools compared to the land prior to conversion. When for each location, the advanced biofuel supply chain with the highest GHG performance (lowest net GHG emissions) is selected, 618 PJ year−1 of advanced biofuels can be produced by 2030. Under REDII GHG emission criteria, slightly less (552 PJ year−1) is viable. Smart choices on location, crop type and supply chain design are paramount to achieve maximum benefits of bioenergy systems. © 2021 The Authors.

They contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide fluxes through their photosynthesis, and thus regulate climate similar to plants. However, microbial photosynthesis remains overlooked in most terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we hypothesise that phototrophic microbes significantly contribute to peatland C uptake, unless environmental conditions limit their development and their photosynthetic activity. To test our hypothesis, we studied phototrophic microbial communities in five peatlands distributed along a latitudinal gradient in Europe. By means of metabarcoding, microscopy and cytometry analyses, as well as measures of photosynthesis, we investigated the diversity, absolute abundance and photosynthetic rates of the phototrophic microbial communities. We identified 351 photosynthetic prokaryotic and eukaryotic operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across the five peatlands. We found that water availability and plant composition were important determinants of the composition and the structure of phototrophic microbial communities. Despite environmental shifts in community structure and composition, we showed that microbial C fixation rates remained similar along the latitudinal gradient. Our results further revealed that phototrophic microbes accounted for approximately 10% of peatland C uptake. Synthesis. Our findings show that phototrophic microbes are extremely diverse and abundant in peatlands. While species turnover with environmental conditions, microbial photosynthesis similarly contributed to peatland C uptake at all latitudes. We estimate that phototrophic microbes take up around 75 MT CO2 per year in northern peatlands. This amount roughly equals the magnitude of projected peatland C loss due to climate warming and highlights the importance of phototrophic microbes for the peatland C cycle. © 2021 British Ecological Society","algae; carbon cycle; metabarcoding; microbial diversity; peatland; photosynthesis; phototrophs; primary productivity","carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; community structure; environmental conditions; latitudinal gradient; microbial activity; peatland; photosynthesis; plant community; water availability; Europe; Eukaryota; Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109594947

However, the influence of environmental conditions on the relationship between GPP and SIF is still unclear. In this study, we synthesized GOME-2 SIF and FLUXCOM GPP coupled with climate data to explore the spatial pattern of the GPP-SIF relationship and its sensitivity to climate conditions at global scale during 2007–2018. The slope (GPP/SIF) of the intercept-free linear regression, which contained information about the allocation of light energy for fluorescence and photosynthesis, was used to represent the GPP-SIF relationship. Our study found that the slope and R2 of the GPP-SIF relationship were spatially heterogeneous, with high slope mainly distributed in the tropical regions and boreal regions and the high R2 mainly concentrated in temperate ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere. In climate regimes, we found that the GPP-SIF relationship was jointly constrained by environmental variables and the slope had a significant decreasing trend in climate regions from high mean annual temperature (MAT) and low mean annual photosynthetically active radiation (MAR) to low MAT and high MAR. Furthermore, the slope and mean annual precipitation (MAP) have a positive correlation, which indicated the GPP-SIF relationship was climate-dependent. Environmental stress may destroy the relationship between fluorescence and photosynthesis by increasing non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Our research showed that environmental conditions regulated the light energy distribution for fluorescence and photosynthesis, so accurate estimation of terrestrial ecosystem productivity based on SIF should consider the constraints of climate variables. © 2021 The Authors","Climate-dependent; GPP/SIF; Seasonality; Spatial pattern; The GPP-SIF relationship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109576371

Yet analyses of alternative border carbon adjustment (BCA) policies that carefully model the impact of generation mix, net load distributions, and transmission limits are rare in the literature. With a generation-transmission expansion planning model of Western North America, we compare the impacts of alternative BCA schemes that California's carbon pricing system could implement. These include no BCA, facility (import source)-based deemed emission rate, a facility-neutral and constant (over-time) rate, and a facility-neutral and dynamic rate. Our results suggest that, when compared to no BCA or BCA using facility-based deemed rates, a facility-neutral BCA can improve efficiency by simultaneously lowering market-wide emissions and costs without raising California consumer expenditures. Emissions leakage also declines significantly. The precise value of the deemed rate affects these gains; setting it equal to marginal emission rates external to California is most efficient. We also show that California's carbon pricing encourages more interstate transmission expansion because power imports become more profitable. However, BCAs that cost-effectively lower total regional emissions will dampen those incentives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Border carbon adjustment; California AB32; Carbon policy; Electricity markets; Market efficiency; Power system expansion planning","Carbon; Costs; Efficiency; Electric power transmission; Expansion; Border carbon adjustment; California; California ab32; Carbon policy; Carbon pricing; Economic efficiency; Emissions rates; Market efficiency; Power; Power system expansion planning; Power markets; carbon emission; efficiency measurement; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental policy; power generation; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109542447

In Europe a policy turnaround has been initiated to promote such a transition. At the same time municipalities across Europe with ambitious climate targets seek to capture the community benefits of civic energy. Together, such developments challenge the restrictions imposed by the incumbent energy utility business model. This paper investigates how energy business models can be re-designed to allow for communities to benefit and at the same time ensure that civic energy processes can be run in a predictable, quality-assured manner. To this end civic energy is cast as a process and a generic business model framework is derived from a comprehensive civic energy process model, the Civic Energy Cycle. The ensuing Civic Energy Business Model Framework replaces the single currency of the energy utility business model by catering to diverse civic energy value propositions. The process approach is used to identify the drivers of civic energy processes and explicitly foresees an active role of community stakeholders in shaping such processes. © 2021","Business model innovation; Civic energy; Community benefits; Complex value; Sustainable regions","Energy policy; Business model innovation; Business models; Civic energy; Community benefit; Complex values; Energy; Energy business; Energy process; Energy utilities; Sustainable region; Energy resources; alternative energy; business development; energy use; innovation; stakeholder; sustainable development; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109541541

While most research focuses on a single policy criterion, our comprehensive framework seeks to synthesize insights on five criteria: effectiveness (GHG mitigation), efficiency, equity, political acceptability, and implementation process. Further, we address potential policy mix interactions, and identify critical gaps to guide future research. Although results vary by region, we offer some general findings. First, stringent road pricing can be effective for GHG mitigation in the short- and long-run, especially for passenger vehicles (less so for freight), while also playing a complementary role to vehicle efficiency regulations (mitigating rebound effects). Second, both equity and political acceptability can be improved by careful design of exemptions and usage of revenues – though the ideal design seems to vary considerably by region. Finally, the implementation process is highly important for acceptability, which should include stakeholder consultation, clear communication of benefits, potentially a demonstration and referendum phase, and ideally agreement among political parties. There is much less evidence for ZEV zones, which don't seem necessary for GHG mitigation, though offering ZEV exemptions for road pricing may be an effective design feature. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon tax; Climate policy; Gas tax; GHG mitigation; Policy evaluation; Road pricing; Tolls","Economics; Efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Taxation; Toll highways; Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Fuel tax; Gas tax; GHG mitigation; Implementation process; Policy evaluation; Political acceptability; Road pricing; Toll; Costs; efficiency measurement; environmental policy; future prospect; greenhouse gas; mitigation; party politics; policy analysis; pollution tax; road pricing; stakeholder; targeting; tax system; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109527707

The SOC status and its variability pattern can be studied through spatial interpolation techniques. In the current study we compared deterministic (Inverse Distance Weightage, IDW), geostatistical (spherical and exponential kriging (OK) and Empirical Bayesian Kriging, EBK) and Machine Learning (Random Forest, RF, Support Vector Machine, SVM) method for samples collected at four grid spacings (20, 40, 60 and 80 m) to find out the combination of best interpolation method and sample spacing to produce a variability map for SOC. Geostatistical models with corresponding highest R2 (31.9%), Lin CCC (0.49) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (0.57) performed better than deterministic and machine learning models. A more precise prediction technique of geostatistical methods than deterministic interpolation may be due to differences in weightage calculation technique and a higher biasness in terms of Mean Error associated with IDW as compared to EBK. The presence of higher local uncertainty and lack of auxiliary supporting parameters e.g., crop and nutrient management) made ML (R2 19.4%, 21.7% in case of RF and SVM respectively) to be a poor predictor than EBK. Among the six interpolation methods, EBK was found to be the best interpolation method in each sample grid spacing [31.9% (p &lt; 0.001), 10.5% (p &lt; 0.01), 13.5% (p &lt; 0.01), 10.5% (p &lt; 0.05)]. Better simulation technique of variogram generation through EBK makes it the best fit model among the three geostatistical techniques. A 20 m grid spacing was found to be the best minimum spacing for studying SOC at a small scale as a higher density sampling could better capture the variability pattern of a heterogenous field having moderate autocorrelation. High local variability and lack of covariates have resulted in poor performance of ML as compared to kriging. However, the prediction performance of models can be improved by using covariate data which has a high correlation with soil properties combined with intense sampling in regions of high variability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","EBK; IDW; Inceptisol; Kriging; Machine learning; RF; SVM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109522289

Results showed that the maximum O3 concentrations decreased slightly since 2014. The annual 90th percentile of the daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3 and the “ozone-season” (April–September) MDA8 decreased by 0.32 and 0.19 μg m−3 year−1, respectively. The changes in Beijing contrast the widespread and significant O3 increases in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region in recent years. However, significant positive trends in MDA8-90th and ozone-season MDA8 were observed in 7% and 14% of monitoring sites in Beijing (p &lt; 0.05), most of which are located in urban areas and suburbs close to urban areas. The spatial distribution of high O3 values in Beijing has changed significantly. The areas with high O3 concentrations shifted from the northern suburbs (Changping and Miyun districts) to the northeastern and southwestern suburbs and the east of the central urban area. The ozone-season NO2 and HCHO tropospheric columns showed reductions of 4.2% and 0.4% year−1, respectively, from 2014 to 2019 in Beijing, which suggested that the decrease in NOX emissions was much greater than the decrease in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Such an extremely inappropriate control ratio of ozone precursor NOX/VOCs led to an overall trend of slow declining fluctuations of O3 and an increasing trend of individual sites in Beijing. Obviously, the reduction of VOCs in Beijing is far from sufficient, and the significant decrease of Beijing's O3 concentration can only be achieved by a drastically reduction in VOC emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing China; Emission reductions; MDA8; OMI; Spatiotemporal variation; Surface ozone","Air quality; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Spatial distribution; Troposphere; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Urban growth; Volatile organic compounds; % reductions; Beijing china; Emission reduction; MDA8; NO $-2$; Ozone monitoring instruments; Spatio-temporal variation; Surface ozone; Urban areas; Volatile organic compound emission; Ozone; formaldehyde; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; formaldehyde; ozone; quantitative analysis; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air quality; Article; China; controlled study; human; season; spatiotemporal analysis; trend study; troposphere; urban area; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109521803

Using an average Anaerobic Digestion facility in Ontario, Canada, modelled after real facilities, as a case study, electricity and steel were identified as potential hotspot input materials carrying a disproportionate environmental burden for biogas production. With a system expansion approach, the biogas was subsequently utilized to produce (1) both heat and electricity using a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system, or (2) upgraded to renewable natural gas (also called biomethane) through chemical amine scrubbing, respectively. In comparing the biogas co-generation and upgrading options, the AD-CHP alternative resulted in a lesser environmental load, two times lower when compared to the AD-RNG biomethane recovery option. Furthermore, the avoided burden of producing fossil-based electricity, natural gas, and chemical fertilizer was analyzed and compared against their renewable counterparts. Significant reductions in emissions and in the depletion of fossil fuels were achieved, thus confirming the positive efforts of diverting organic waste from landfills to reduce organic waste disposal impacts and improve the management of organic waste.

Descriptive norms had a stronger effect on energy-saving behaviors in single-person offices than in shared offices. Ascription of responsibility, however, had a stronger effect on energy-saving behaviors in shared offices. The perceived ease of access to building control features significantly influenced energy-saving behaviors of shared-office occupants only. Time availability had no significant effect on energy-saving behaviors of occupants in both single-person and shared offices.

In the present study, we performed femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy on the short-chain polyene compound 2-(all-trans-β-ionylideneetinylidene)-indan-1,3-dione with three conjugated double bonds and two carbonyl groups, denoted as C15Ind in acetone and in n-hexane. The spectroscopic properties of C15Ind both in polar and nonpolar solvents suggests an ICT character based on the observations of the stimulated emission due to the coupled 1Ag-/ICT state. In acetone, an additional excited state was found to be located below the 1Ag-/ICT state. The ultrafast triplet generation via the 1nπ* state was also observed both in acetone and in n-hexane, while the amplitude of the triplet transient absorption of C15Ind was rather small compared with those in retinal and Retinyl-1 reported previously. Thus, an ICT character of carbonyl-containing carotenoids may prevent a triplet generation upon excitation into the optically allowed 1Bu+ (S2) state. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carotenoid; Excited state dynamics; Intramolecular charge transfer; Ultrafast spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109434832

The deviation of the relationship between δD and δ18O in surface soil water from that in precipitation is used to indicate the integrative results of the soil evaporation process, but the distinction between the slope of the soil water evaporation line (SEL) and line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) as individual indicators has not been identified. Furthermore, spatial variability and interaction effects of climate, soil, and vegetation on soil evaporation in arid and semi-arid grasslands remain poorly understood. We established 3 west-to-east sampling transects along with increasing precipitation and decreasing aridity index gradients in grasslands of the Tibetan (TP, 1500 km), Loess (LP, 600 km), and Inner Mongolia (MP, 1200 km) Plateaus. Slope of SEL and weighted mean lc-excess were calculated according to the δD and δ18O in soil water, which was extracted from soils collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 1 m along with soil profiles during the vigorous growing season. We found that lc-excess appeared relatively more robust than slope in representing soil evaporation process because lc-excess was determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage, while slope was regulated only by evaporation fractionation factors. Soil evaporation, as indicated by lc-excess, exhibited decreasing trends from west to east, and was controlled by relative humidity in TP, and by vegetation coverage in LP and MP. Our results highlighted that the soil evaporation process may be more sensitive to climate change in TP, and vegetation restoration in LP and MP. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Grass transect; Lc-excess; Soil evaporation; Soil water evaporation line; Stable isotope","Climate change; Evaporation; Humidity control; Sediments; Vegetation; Evaporation process; Grass transect; Inner Mongolia; Lc-excess; Soil evaporations; Soil water; Soil water evaporation; Soil water evaporation line; Stable isotopes; Surface soil; Soil moisture; acid precipitation; aridity; climate change; evapotranspiration; oxygen isotope; precipitation (chemistry); precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; soil water; soil-vegetation interaction; China; Nei Monggol; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109398003

The main measure to realize automobile lightweight is to adopt parts manufactured by lightweight materials. To connect these lightweight materials, a new technology named flat-rivet clinching process (FRCP) has been developed. In this study, the impact of friction coefficient and specimen material on material flow was investigated utilizing the finite element method (FEM). The FE model was established utilizing DEFORM-2D software. AA5052 was selected as the main specimen material in this study. The equivalent stress and strain distribution, material flow velocity, and material flow direction were analyzed utilizing FEM. The consequences showed that except friction coefficient of the contact region between the upper plate and blank holder, the friction coefficient of other contact surfaces played a crucial role during the material flow. It could affect the formation of mechanical interlocking. Meanwhile, the higher the sheet strength and material flow resistance, the greater the riveting force required by the flat-rivet clinching process (FRCP). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","AA5052; Finite element method (FEM); Flat-rivet clinching process (FRCP); Lightweight material; Material flow behavior","Automobile manufacture; Emission control; Flow velocity; Friction; Rivets; Automobile lightweights; Clinching process; Emission reduction; Equivalent stress; Friction coefficients; Lightweight materials; Mechanical interlocking; Stringent requirement; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109348705

The hydrogen concentration in the films was systematically changed by varying the substrate temperature and the vapor pressure of H2O gas supplied during sputter deposition. The correlation between the PL spectra via bandgap excitation and the degree of oxidization/hydrogenation was investigated by x-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Films deposited at room temperature under H2O partial pressures higher than 10−2 Pa were sufficiently hydroxylated, as confirmed by the appearance of diffractions peaks from Zn(OH)2 coexisting with ZnO(002). Eu3+ emissions were observed after post-annealing in a vacuum or O2 atmosphere. When the H2O pressure was lower than 10−2 Pa, the ZnO:Eu films were so oxygen-deficient as to exhibit a metallic character, which deactivated the Eu3+ emission. Deposition at temperatures above 200 °C reduced the OH and/or H species incorporated in the ZnO films and only a faint Eu3+ emission was observed. The H2O pressure under which a sharp Eu3+ emission could be obtained was between 1.0 and 2.5 × 10−2 Pa if subsequent post-annealing was done in a vacuum. For more oxidized films deposited at 3.5 × 10−2 Pa, reduction by post-annealing in an H2 atmosphere was effective to generate a sharp and intense Eu3+ emission signal through reduction and hydrogenation, confirming that a moderate oxidization/hydrogenation state is a necessary condition. Codoped hydrogen species will facilitate substituting Zn2+ sites with emission-active Eu3+ ions and stabilize them. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Annealing; Energy gap; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogen; II-VI semiconductors; Metallic films; Optical films; Oxide minerals; Photoluminescence; Thin films; Vapor deposition; Zinc oxide; Band-gap excitation; Doped ZnO thin films; Emission signal; Hydrogen concentration; Oxidized films; Oxygen deficient; Post annealing; Substrate temperature; Europium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109212783

In particular, maritime port facilities are typically located near cities or residential areas, thus having a significant direct environmental impact, in terms of air and water quality, as well as noise. The majority of the pollutant emissions in ports comes from cargo ships, and from all the related ports activities carried out by road vehicles. Therefore, a progressive reduction of the use of fossil fuels as a primary energy source for these vehicles and the promotion of cleaner powertrain alternatives is in order. The present study deals with the design of a new propulsion system for a heavy-duty vehicle for port applications. Specifically, this work aims at laying the foundations for the development of a benchmark industrial cargo–handling hydrogen-fueled vehicle to be used in real port operations. To this purpose, an on-field measurement campaign has been conducted to analyze the duty cycle of a commercial Diesel-engine yard truck currently used for terminal ports operations. The vehicle dynamics has been numerically modeled and validated against the acquired data, and the energy and power requirements for a plug-in fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain replacing the Diesel powertrain on the same vehicle have been evaluated. Finally, a preliminary design of the new powertrain and a rule-based energy management strategy have been proposed, and the electric energy and hydrogen consumptions required to achieve the target driving range for roll-on and roll-off operations have been estimated. The results are promising, showing that the hybrid electric vehicle is capable of achieving excellent energy performances, by means of an efficient use of the fuel cell. An overall amount of roughly 12 kg of hydrogen is estimated to be required to accomplish the most demanding port operation, and meet the target of 6 h of continuous operation. Also, the vehicle powertrain ensures an adequate all-electric range, which is between approximately 1 and 2 h depending on the specific port operation. Potentially, the hydrogen-fueled yard truck is expected to lead to several benefits, such as local zero emissions, powertrain noise elimination, reduction of the vehicle maintenance costs, improving of the energy management, and increasing of operational efficiency. © 2021 The Authors","Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Hybrid powertrains; Hydrogen technologies; Sustainable mobility","Climate change; Commercial vehicles; Diesel engines; Economics; Energy conversion; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Secondary batteries; Trucks; Water quality; % reductions; Energy; Fuel cell batteries; Heavy duty; Hydrogen technologies; Maritime transport; Port operations; Ports logistics; Preliminary design; Sustainable mobility; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109199124

The building sector that accounts for over one-third of the total carbon emissions is expected to face a great challenge in helping China achieve this goal. Shenzhen, as a low-carbon pilot city, whether its low-carbon work of urban buildings reaches the target is crucial. An attempt has been made in this study to assess the intensity of carbon emissions and associated reduction efficiency of urban buildings (operation stage) in Shenzhen by using the life cycle assessment method. The results show that the total carbon emissions generated from the buildings' operation stage have increased from 22 million metric tons (Mt) CO2eq in 2005 to 42 (±13%) Mt. CO2eq in 2019. Carbon emissions mainly result from the buildings' electricity use (79%), followed by refrigerant release emissions (12%). The energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction intensity in Shenzhen is at the middle level in China, and there is considerable space for improvement. According to scenario-based analysis, the carbon emission of the buildings sector can probably reach its peak by 2025 with the implementation of suitable policies – 5 years earlier than national target by 2030. Overall, this study makes a systemic analysis of the characteristics of urban buildings energy consumption and carbon emissions reduction, which can provide supportings for justifying the effectiveness of low-carbon activities in Shenzhen and beyond. © 2021","Building; Carbon emissions; Energy consumption; Energy-saving efficiency; Reduction","Buildings; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Building sectors; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Reduction efficiency; Scenario-based analysis; Systemic analysis; Carbon; building; carbon emission; emission control; energy conservation; life cycle analysis; mitigation; policy implementation; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109197952

Coordinated cluster and canonical discriminant analyses of stratified archaeobotanical assemblages from the village of Tell Abu en-Ni'aj, Jordan support a detailed portrait of changing crop management at a sedentary agrarian community during Early Bronze IV, a period marked by widespread mobile pastoralism. Our quantified analyses of carbonized plant remains are augmented with stable isotope composition data for major cultigens to offer an innovative perspective on Early Bronze IV agrarian life in the northern Jordan Valley. Seeds from seven occupation phases spanning the time period from about 2500 to 2200 cal BC indicate increasing primary reliance on Hordeum vulgare (hulled barley), and only modest cultivation of wheat, mostly Triticum dicoccum (emmer) over this time span. Constrained incremental sum of squares (CONISS) cluster analysis and canonical discriminate analysis (CDA) illustrate significant shifts in crop cultivation, and possibly related animal management, including a major transition at about 2375 cal BC. Our analyses further highlight the most important plant taxa that contributed to these shifts. Cultivated crops, wild species and chaff are more ubiquitous in the earlier phases at Tell Abu en-Ni'aj, while percentages of H. vulgare and ubiquities of Lens culinaris (lentil) increase in the later phases. Lower seed densities, weed ubiquities and chaff to cereal ratios suggest more distant crop processing after about 2375 cal BC. Values of Δ13C for the major cereals, which provide a proxy for water availability, indicate dry farming of barley and preferential watering of wheat. This study proposes that a suite of changes occurred between the earlier and later phases at Tell Abu en-Ni'aj, which portray generally diminished, more remote crop production, possibly amid greater drought stress, leading to village abandonment. We illustrate a multi-faceted analytical approach suitable for interpretation of comparable archaeobotanical evidence and inference of agrarian dynamics elsewhere in prehistory. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Archaeobotany; Canonical discriminant analysis; Carbon isotope analysis; Cluster analysis; Southern levant","agricultural practice; archaeology; botany; Bronze Age; canonical analysis; carbon isotope; cluster analysis; crop production; discriminant analysis; isotopic analysis; Jordan Valley; Levant; Mediterranean Region; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Lens culinaris; Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109197137

Numerous studies have identified the emission reduction and economic effects of the ETS, but quantitative evaluations of the ETS for regional carbon equality is rare. Based on provincial panel data and industrial enterprise panel data in China for the 1998–2017 period, this study explores whether China's ETS pilot policy brings the double dividends of green development efficiency and regional carbon equality by using the DID model and Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) index. The results show that the ETS significantly improves green development efficiency and regional carbon equality. The mechanism analysis further reveals that the ETS promotes regional carbon equality by improving green total factor productivity (GTFP) and reducing investments in carbon-intensive industries in the pilot provinces, confirming the Porter hypothesis and investment transfer effect. However, the mediating effect of carbon-intensive firm migration is statistically nonsignificant, which implies that the carbon pollution haven hypothesis may not be the reason for the improvement in regional carbon equality.

Under the actions of wind, waves and other marine forces, oil slicks on the sea surface mix with seawater to form oil-seawater emulsions. Herein, we focus on the spectral radiative properties of seawater-in-oil emulsions in the visible-infrared region. The complex refractive indices of crude oil are precisely measured using the combined ellipsometry-transmission method, after which the radiative properties of seawater droplets embedded in crude oil and seawater-in-oil emulsions obtained using the traditional and improved Lorenz-Mie theory are compared and analyzed to illustrate the effects of the absorption of host medium. The directional-hemispherical emittance and reflectance for seawater-in-oil emulsions are calculated using the Monte Carlo method. Results show that even though the traditional Mie-calculated radiative properties deviate obviously from the improved Lorenz-Mie theory results, directional-hemispherical reflectance and emittance of seawater-in-oil emulsions show relatively small difference. Besides, increasing the droplet volume fraction and film thickness may generally lead to enhanced scattering of seawater droplets, further leading to enhanced light reflection and reduced light emission. With the increase in both droplet size and absorption index of seawater and crude oil, the effects of seawater droplet absorption and oil absorption on overall attenuation of emulsions increase considerably; they may weaken the reflection and strengthen the emission. Obtaining the key radiative parameters of different oil species and oil emulsions will be helpful for promoting the practical application of quantitative optical remote sensing of oil slicks on sea surface. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Complex refractive index; Oil emulsions; Oil spills; Optical properties; Radiative transfer","Crude oil; Demulsification; Drops; Emulsification; Emulsions; Heat radiation; Light scattering; Monte Carlo methods; Ostwald ripening; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Refractive index; Remote sensing; Seawater; Surface waters; Complex refractive index; Emittances; Lorenz-Mie theory; Oil emulsions; Oils slick; Optical-; Property; Radiative properties; Sea surfaces; Visible-infrared region; Oil spills; crude oil; emulsion; oil spill; optical property; radiative transfer; seawater; spectral analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109194243

In this study, we reviewed the scientific literature of the last 30 years to quantify the magnitude of projected changes in ecosystem services provision by Mediterranean forests under IPCC climate change scenarios. We classified the scenarios according to the temperature threshold of 2℃ set by the Paris Agreement (below or above). The review of 78 studies shows that climate change will lead to a general reduction in the provision of regulating services (e.g. carbon storage, regulation of freshwater quantity and quality) and a general increase in the number of fires, burnt areas and generally, an increase in climate-related forest hazards (median + 62% by 2100). Studies using scenarios above the 2℃ threshold projected significantly more negative changes in regulating services than studies using scenarios below this threshold. Main projected trend changes on material services (e.g. wood products), were less clear and depended on (i) whether or not the studies considered the interaction between the rise in temperatures and other drivers (e.g. forest management, CO2 fertilization) and (ii) differences in productivity responses across the tree species evaluated. Overall, the reviewed studies projected significant reductions in range extent and habitat suitability for the most drought-sensitive forest species (e.g. −88% Fagus sylvatica), while the amount of habitat available for more drought-tolerant species will remain stable or increase; however, the magnitude of projected change for these more xeric species was limited when high-end extreme climatic scenarios were considered (above Paris Agreement). Our review highlights the benefits that climate change mitigation (to keep global mean temperature increase &lt;2℃) can bring in terms of service provision and conservation of Mediterranean forests. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate change; ecological modelling; ecosystem services; fires; forecasting; hazards; Mediterranean forests; scenarios","drought; ecosystem service; environmental change; forest dynamics; forest management; global warming; habitat management; international agreement; temperature profile; Mediterranean Region; Fagus sylvatica; climate change; ecosystem; fire; forest; tree; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; Trees",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109184520

We consider three settings for international spillover effects: (i) a small-open-economy framework where international commodity prices remain constant, (ii) a multi-region-trade framework with endogenous terms of trade where only Germany undertakes emission pricing, and (iii) a multi-region-trade framework where all other regions also price CO2 emissions. In all three settings Germany complies to a given domestic CO2 emissions reduction target through economy-wide uniform CO2 emissions pricing. CO2 revenues are recycled lump-sum to households on an equal-per-household basis. We find that the small-open-economy setting in the case of Germany not only overstates overall economic adjustment costs to CO2 emissions pricing, but also understates the degree of progressiveness of CO2 revenue recycling. The reason is that in the multi-region-trade frameworks Germany is able to pass through part of its economic adjustment costs to trading partners via higher export prices. As a consequence, the CO2 prices required to achieve the domestic emissions reduction target are higher, yielding more CO2 revenues that are recycled to households. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Computable general equilibrium; Environmental taxes; Incidence","Costs; Emission control; International trade; Recycling; Adjustment costs; CO$-2$/ emission; Computable general equilibrium; Economic impacts; Emission reduction targets; Environmental taxes; Equilibrium analysis; Incidence; International markets; Market response; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy market; environmental economics; general equilibrium analysis; pollution tax; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109173933

This paper aims to identify the optimal design and pre-feasibility techno-economic analysis of the hybrid grid-independent renewable system for rural electrification. The proposed hybrid system integrates the various renewable energy system configurations to provide continuous power for the electric load demands of Kanakadri palle village, Andhra Pradesh, India. HOMER software is utilized to design the proposed hybrid system, perform optimization, techno-economic analysis, and simulation. Here, six different hybrid system configurations were taken into account to perform a comparative economic analysis. The results obtained shows that one of the hybrid systems, PV/DG/converter/battery system (120 kW-PV modules, 54 kW-DG, 200 number of batteries with 260 Ah ratings, and 50 kW-power converters), is the least economical optimal system based on least net present cost and Levelized cost of energy (COE), highest renewable fraction, and zero unmet electric loads percentage (NPC: $341 280, COE: $0.217, highest renewable fraction: 96.6% and unmet electric loads: 0%). For the site considered, this optimal hybrid system can provide a reliable power supply to the total energy requirements of 332.97 kWh/d and achieve 75.68% carbon emission reduction compared to a diesel generator. Moreover, the comparison of different system configurations was carried out based on economic analysis. This analysis shows that proposed hybrid system can be an appropriate model to provide reliable power at a low generation cost for the village considered in this study and can be recommended for future electrification projects. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","cost of energy; greenhouse gases emission; hybrid grid-independent renewable energy systems; net present cost; photovoltaic system; wind energy system","Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Electric loads; Electric utilities; Emission control; Hybrid systems; Microgrids; Optimal systems; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Carbon emission reductions; Electric load demands; Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); Reliable power supply; Renewable energy systems; System configurations; Techno-Economic analysis; Total energy requirement; Electric power system economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109139386

Based on the results, countries are classified into four categories by comparing a country's TCE and CERP with the average of all BRI countries. The results show that the average TCE of BRI countries is only 0.341, while their average CERP is 0.75, which is tremendous. It also shows that the higher the income levels, the more prone countries are to have a higher TCE. By considering the differences among the countries' environmental factors, TCEs, and the current state or trends of the CERPs, customized low-carbon policies are proposed to increase the TCE and reduce emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Belt and Road Initiative; Carbon efficiency; Differentiated carbon policies; Service trade; Three-stage EBM model; Transportation industry","Emission control; Energy utilization; Roads and streets; Carbon efficiency; Carbon emission reductions; Environmental factors; High energy consumption; Integrated approach; Low-carbon policies; Transportation industry; Transportation system; Carbon; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental factor; estimation method; integrated approach; numerical model; transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109116389

One option proposed is to replace conventional marine fuels with cleaner fuels. This is particularly important for vessels engaged in short-sea shipping and inland waterway transportation because their exhaust gases more negatively affect the local population than long-distance ships do. Hence the aim of this study is to undertake a technical, environmental and economic analysis of alternative fuels to reduce the environmental footprint and lifetime costs of inland waterway transportation. The analysis will focus on Croatia whose existing outdated inland waterway fleet needs to meet the goals of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia. In the study, a life-cycle analysis and life-cycle cost assessment of different alternative fuels will be performed taking into account the operating profiles and technical characteristics of vessels working in Croatia. The potential effects of a carbon tax are also examined in a case study considering carbon emissions reduction targets in Croatia by 2030.

While crop productivity strongly depends on weather conditions during the growing season, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is the main driver of global interannual climate variability and affects crop production in many regions. The ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) impact on corn and soybean yields between 1973 and 2017 was compared in Córdoba Province, Argentina, looking for an early signal to support agricultural activity. The analysis suggests that not only ENSO signal (SOI and SST El Niño 3.4) but also PDO anomaly (PDOA) link better than IOD with productivity for both crops, as well as the Southern Oscillation Index of August and September (SOIas) is a proper yield predictor. An inverse relationship was determined between SOIas and yields anomaly, more spread territorially for soybeans since the linear functions are significant (p &lt; 0.05) in 9 of the 12 administrative areas and, with a slightly lower significance (p &lt; 0.1), in the remaining too. On the other hand, the low R2 values indicate little capacity to explain the yield interannual variability from the SOIas signal that for corn, has a departmental range between 2 % and 19 % and, for soybeans, slightly higher between 7 % and 24 %. While the mean difference test of yield anomaly between different ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña and Neutral) supports the more general indifference of both extreme phases with the neutral cases, it reaches a significant character in 8 departments when the cold phase is compared with the warm. The seasonal rainfall regime has also a reduced capacity to explain productive variability. However, this information is useful to realize that both the wettest (El Niño) and the driest years (La Niña) fail to differentiate from those with normal rainfall. This confusion was verified by a combinatory frequency analysis of rainfall and productivity data related to the ENSO phases. Because ENSO allows anticipating the rainfall condition and the productive potential of the main rain-fed crops in Córdoba, Argentina, it constitutes appropriate information to reduce uncertainty and the risk level in agricultural production. Therefore, although the ENSO predictive capacity is limited and more knowledge about the influence of other climatic variability sources like PDO is needed, its incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms to the basis of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Drought; El Niño 3.4; IOD; PDO; SOI; SST","alternative agriculture; crop yield; early warning system; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; food security; Indian Ocean Dipole; maize; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; rainfall; soybean; Argentina; Indian Ocean; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109085990

Based on a panel dataset of 30 provinces in China from 1999 to 2017, this paper engages in threshold model and mediation analysis to examine the thresholds of economic agglomeration for environmental regulation to take effect and the influencing paths of environmental regulation at different agglomeration levels. The economic agglomeration degree is measured by the economic density of the built-up area. The threshold test recognizes two thresholds of economic density, which are 0.3 CNY billion/km2 and 1.7 CNY/km2. Only when economic density exceeds the thresholds, can environmental regulation significantly reduce industrial emission intensity and emission density, respectively. At the first threshold, environmental regulation takes effect mainly through improving local industrial structure; at the second threshold, environmental regulation takes effect mainly through downsizing the scale of polluting industries. The policy enlightenment provided by this article is to formulate differentiated environmental governance strategies according to local conditions and the characteristics of the development stage of each region. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,"abatement cost; agglomeration; compliance; data set; economic development; panel data; performance assessment; regulatory framework; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109080803

Cumulative methane emissions over 3 weeks were found to be almost 12 times higher from composting digested food waste than from raw food waste suggesting that the microbial community transferred from the anaerobic digestion to the compost process enhanced these emissions. Cumulative nitrous oxide emissions were also higher when composting solid digestate was compared to composting raw food waste, but the global warming potential was mostly driven by the impact of methane emissions.

However, transportation systems can also have detrimental impacts on health and equity, including through increased air pollution and its unequal social distribution. Aims: This study focuses on estimating air quality and equity impacts of an ongoing large-scale metropolitan transportation program (known as “Tampa Bay Next”). Our objective was to characterize and quantify the air pollution levels and population exposures resulting from an interstate freeway expansion planned under Tampa Bay Next, which includes added toll lanes. Methods: We estimated changes in individual human exposures to oxides of nitrogen (NOx) due to the proposed freeway changes, using an integrated suite of high-resolution models for travel demand, emissions, pollutant dispersion, and exposure. Inequity in the distribution of exposures among racioethnic and income groups was also estimated using a few measures of inequality (the subgroup inequality index (SII), the comparative environmental risk index, and the toxic demographic quotient index). Findings: The planned freeway expansion was estimated to slightly decrease the daily NOx emissions (by 5.6 mg/m, p = 4×10−16), ambient concentrations (by 0.02 μg/m3, p = 2×10−4), and individual exposures (by 0.2 μg/m3, p = 2.2×10−16) on average, while increasing exposure densities during peak periods in areas surrounding downtown Tampa. Group-average exposures also decreased for all population subgroups under the planned expansion scenario. However, disparities in exposure increased for the black (ΔSII = 1.3×10−3 for the 90th percentile exposure level) and the below-poverty (ΔSII = 4.6×10−3) groups. Conclusions: Results suggest that a detailed analysis of exposures may be needed to ensure large-scale transportation improvement programs reduce inequity, even when average impacts on air quality and exposures are positive or neutral. © 2021 The Authors","Environmental inequality; Road expansion; Toll lanes; Traffic-related air pollution; Urban design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109045934

This mineral potential continues to be revealed day by day; but unfortunately, they are generally underutilized. The detailed mechanisms of marine sedimentary phosphates origin are still imperfectly known. Our study aims to reconstitute the depositional environment of phosphorites of El Kouif locality NE of Algeria. Our method used an extensive sequential analysis, Microscopic Petrography, X-ray diffractometry, and geochemical analysis. Cross-sections carried out on the outcrops of the El Kouif city, have shown a sub-tabular formation containing almost eight layers of phosphorites. The sequential analysis revealed that the phosphatic series have taken place in a reduced negative mega-sequence. Petrographic observations have shown phosphatic intraclasts bearer of the organic matter at various rates. XRD of whole-rock powder has confirmed the presence of apatite minerals, carbonates quartz, clays, sulfides, and gypsum. The geochemical trend has indicated a high fluctuating content of P2O5. The dispersion pattern, correlation coefficient, and mutual relationship of significant major oxides, represented by plotted diagrams; showed that SiO2, CO2, MgO, are antipathetically related to P2O5. The geochemical behavior between P2O5 contents and of CaO, H2O, Na2O, SO3 contents have shown a positive relationship. The richness of the phosphatic rocks in Apatite is autonomous of the depth in the Tebessa basin. The results of the chemical analysis from purified grains were used to calculate the structural formulas for apatite. This non-stoichiometric apatite presented significant anionic substitutions affecting up to 24% of the sites. The higher values of CO2 have obviously resulted in the richness of organic substance, the notable presence of sulfides minerals, indicated through the high concentration of SO3, and the lower concentration of Na suggested that the reducing conditions of the basin were prevailing at the time of phosphatic formation in a shallow marine environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chemical analysis; Paleocene–Eocene; Phosphorites; Sequential analysis; Structural formula; XRD","depositional environment; marine sediment; phosphorite; semiarid region; sequential extraction; stoichiometry; trend analysis; X-ray diffraction; Algeria; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109016333

In much of the world, laboratory-based measures of soil C are expensive and logistically challenging, whereas map-based predictions generated at the continental scale (e.g., African Soil Information Service [AfSIS]; www.soilgrids.org) may be unreliable at the management-relevant, policy-relevant, field, and regional scales. We test whether an USD 350, open source, field portable reflectometer can provide site-specific estimates of soil C status, and also predict whether a crop will respond to fertilizer across 1,155 sites in central and southern Malawi based on an established threshold of 9.4 g C kg−1 soil. When compared with soil C measured by combustion, the scanner calibrated with covariates of field-estimable texture class and slope class provides unbiased (0.42 ± 0.44 g C kg−1 soil; p =.06), precise (R2 =.57), and actionable (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.88) data at the field scale, including at unmeasured locations (relative prediction error 19–23%) and at the village scale. The reflectometer outperformed predictions from the continental-scale AfSIS database, which were neither precise (R2 =.044) nor actionable (AUC = 0.63) at the field scale, and underestimated soil C in the region by 2.5 ± 0.5 g C kg−1 soil (p &lt;.001).

In fact, synthesis of low-cost electrocatalysts in an environmentally benign process is the need of the hour. Bioactive compounds including polyphenols, reducing sugars, and ascorbic acid (AA) present in different plant organs are proven competent in reducing metal ions to their lower or zero oxidation states. The present study focuses on the synthesis of Cu2O NPs using the bioactive compounds present in Sechium edule fruit. The mechanistic pathways for the understanding of the formation of the face-centred cubic Cu2O NPs (37.5−42 nm) and metal-organic (intermediates) ligand leading to the development of its stabilizing cap are investigated in details. Cu2O NPs were decorated on the Toray carbon paper electrode. The modified electrodes could decrease the charge transfer resistance by 50 folds and catalyze the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOO‾, a sole liquid product in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte with a faradaic efficiency of 65.3–66.6 % within 60 min as the existence of predominant Cu2O (111) NPs could be responsible for selective formation of formate. Nevertheless, Cu2O underwent oxidation to CuO after 100 voltammetric cycles which was resulted in declining CO2 reduction reaction rate.

Objective: We describe a collaborative project to establish the Texas Flood Registry to track the health and housing impacts of major flooding events. Methods: Those who enroll in the registry answer retrospective questions regarding the impact of storms on their health and housing status. We recruit both those who did and did not flood during storm events to enable key comparisons. We leverage partnerships with multiple local health departments, community groups, and media outlets to recruit broadly. We performed a preliminary analysis using multivariable logistic regression and a binomial Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial model. Results: We find that those whose homes flooded, or who came into direct skin contact with flood water, are more likely to experience a series of self-reported health effects. Median household income is inversely related to adverse health effects, and spatial analysis provides important insights within the modeling approach. Significance: Global climate change is likely to increase the number and intensity of rainfall events, resulting in additional health burdens. Population-level data on the health and housing impacts of major flooding events is imperative in preparing for our planet’s future. © 2021, The Author(s).","Air pollution, Climate change, Geospatial Analyses","Bayes theorem; flooding; human; public health; register; retrospective study; Texas; Bayes Theorem; Floods; Humans; Public Health; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108832709

In doing so, it distinguishes between the stringency in demand-pull and the stringency in technology-push policy instruments. The analysis relies upon an original dataset, with data on patents and co-patents in climate change and mitigation technologies over the period 1995–2014, with a focus on technologies related to energy generation, transmission or distribution. The results show that the distance in the stringency of environmental policy between countries hinders the intensity of technological collaborations in energy-related technologies and this occurs specifically with reference to demand-pull policy instruments. We also find that while the availability of local technological capabilities positively affects the intensity of international collaborations, if two countries are distant in terms of technological development, the co-patenting activity is hindered. Finally, BRIICS countries display a lower ability to participate in international co-patenting activity, particularly so in collaboration with other BRIICS countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Co-patenting; Energy-related technologies; EPS; Stringency of environmental regulation; Technological collaborations","Climate change; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Co-patenting; Energy; Energy-related technology; Environmental policy; EPS; International collaborations; Patenting activities; Policy instruments; Stringency of environmental regulation; Technological collaboration; Patents and inventions; climate change; environmental policy; intellectual property rights; OECD; regulatory framework; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108701389

In the Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam, the combined effects of climate change and sea level rise (SLR) threaten coastal mangrove forest wetlands, while inland Melaleuca forest wetlands are affected by regional changes in climate. Hence, it is essential to understand the impacts of climate change and SLR on these wetlands, particularly on the dominant species, which are integral to the structure and function of each wetland type. However, future climate suitability for wetland species is not yet well documented and well researched for the region. Therefore, this study examines the potential impacts of climate change and SLR on the three dominant species of these wetland types, Avicennia alba (A. alba) and Rhizophora apiculata (R. apiculata) in coastal mangrove forest wetlands and Melaleuca cajuputi (M. cajuputi) in inland Melaleuca forest wetlands, utilizing an ensemble modelling approach. The species occurrence points, bioclimatic and eco-physiological variables were used to model habitat suitability for the three species under current and future climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. The projected reduction in habitat suitability of A. alba, R. apiculata, and M. cajuputi by mean values of 27.9%, 28.7% and 30.0%, respectively by the year 2070 indicates the vulnerability of the wetland species to climate change impacts. Increases in temperature, and in seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature, and SLR were key driving factors responsible for the losses of suitable habitat. Our findings provide useful information and data sources for development of plans and strategies to protect and conserve the wetlands from future climate change impacts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Ensemble modelling; Habitat suitability; Mekong Delta; Species distribution model; Vietnam; Wetland species","bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; dominance; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; ecosystem structure; mangrove; satellite laser ranging; sea level change; seasonal variation; species occurrence; wetland; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Avicennia alba; Melaleuca; Melaleuca cajuputi; Rhizophora apiculata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108660782

However, spatiotemporal variations of N deposition levels and major sources remain unclear in many regions, which hinders making strategies of emission mitigation and evaluating effects of elevated N deposition. By investigating moss N contents and δ15N values in southwestern (SW) China in 1954–1964, 1970–1994, and 2005–2015, we reconstructed fluxes and source contributions of atmospheric ammonium ((Formula presented.)) and nitrate ((Formula presented.)) deposition and evaluated their historical changes. For urban and non-urban sites, averaged moss N contents did not differ between 1954–1964 and 1970–1994 (1.2%–1.3%) but increased distinctly in 2005–2015 (1.6%–2.3%), and averaged moss δ15N values decreased from +0.4‰ to +3.3‰ in 1954–1964 to −1.9‰ to −0.7‰ in 1974–1990, and to −4.8‰ to −3.6‰ in 2005–2015. Based on quantitative estimations, N deposition levels from the 1950s to the 2000s did not change in the earlier 20 years but were elevated substantially in the later 30 years. Moreover, the elevation of (Formula presented.) deposition (by 12.2 kg-N/ha/year at urban sites and 4.6 kg-N/ha/year at non-urban sties) was higher than that of (Formula presented.) deposition (by 6.0 and 2.9 kg-N/ha/year, respectively) in the later 30 years. This caused a shifted dominance from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) in N deposition. Based on isotope source apportionments, contributions of combustion-related NH3 sources (vehicle exhausts, coal combustion, and biomass burning) to the elevation of (Formula presented.) deposition were two times higher than volatilization NH3 sources (wastes and fertilizers) in the later 30 years. Meanwhile, non-fossil fuel NOx sources (biomass burning, microbial N cycles) contributed generally more than fossil fuel NOx sources (vehicle exhausts and coal combustion) to the elevation of (Formula presented.) deposition. These results revealed significant contributions of combustion-related NH3 and non-fossil fuel NOx emissions to the historical elevation of N deposition in SW China, which is useful for emission mitigation and ecological effect evaluation of atmospheric N loading. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ammonia; ammonium; atmospheric nitrogen deposition; bioindication; environmental changes; moss; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; nitrogen stable isotope; source apportionment","ammonia; ammonium; atmospheric deposition; bioindicator; combustion; environmental change; moss; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; source apportionment; stable isotope; China; nitrogen; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; season; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108601559

Given the intermittency of the energy supply from renewables, it is important to increase flexibility in the system to respond to the imbalances between energy demand and supply. Several flexibility options such as power storage and energy integration are currently in use, mostly at small scales. The increased energy supply from renewables and the flexibility solutions can influence the production planning of existing thermal energy conversion plants. In this study, integration of energy technologies including a hydrotreated pyrolysis oil production integrated with existing CHP plants is investigated as a flexibility solution. The system interacts with potential power generation from rooftop PV systems integrated with power-to-hydrogen storage. A cost-optimization model is developed using MILP method. The study focuses on the system flexibility and operational strategy of the existing CHP plants considering market trends, climate changes, and future energy developments with increased penetration of heat pumps and electric vehicles but less fossil fuels use. The results indicate that the suggested integrated system can increase the local energy supply by 33 GWh. Moreover, the power-to-hydrogen storage and onsite hydrogen use can increase the share of renewables in energy supply by 6%. Optimization of the developed scenarios for future energy-related changes indicates that the market trends could significantly reduce the performance of the system by 21% but increase the penetration of renewables in the system by 8%.

The purpose of the study is to improve the practical tools for calculating and developing strategies for the development of environmental responsibility of industrial enterprises. Methods: In the study, tools for assessing the level of environmental initiative of an industrial enterprise as an integrated indicator of environmental initiative are suggested. It is expressed as the arithmetic mean of ten factors of environmentally proactive behavior of industrial enterprises. To achieve the objectives of the study, methods of criterion-qualitative assessment are suggested, such as expert assessment and survey. The assessment system includes ten factors rated on a 10-point scale and weighted by significance. The integrated indicator of the environmental initiative acquires values within, is a stimulant of environmental responsibility. FINDINGS: One justified a scientific and methodological approach to assessing the level of environmental responsibility or the industrial enterprise, including calculation of the corresponding taxonomic indicator with consideration of the quantitative factors of its environmental responsibility and the qualitative and quantitative factors of environmental initiative. This enables the possibility to assess the relevant state of environmental responsibility and determine the volumes for further correction of the ecological strategy for the development of the industrial enterprise. Conclusion: As a conclusion, practical recommendations are made for the implementation of organizational and economic support of environmental responsibility in the development strategy of an industrial enterprise taking into account the impact of its environmental initiative and environmental duty. The level of environmental responsibility of industrial enterprises taken into account when developing recommendations on adjustment of their environmental strategy of development is determined, which as a whole allowed to form organizational and economic support for environmental responsibility of the enterprises under study. Thus, an enterprise, which only ensures compliance with environmental emission standards (compensation strategy or sufficiency strategy) cannot be characterized by a high level of environmental responsibility. To ensure a high level of environmental responsibility, an industrial enterprise must rely on a proactive strategy or a strategy for sustainable use of nature. ©2021 GJESM.

We also assess the potential environmental contribution of the forests to avoid carbon emissions from fossil fuels replaced with fuelwood. Methods involve randomly surveying a total of 176 homestead forests and relevant households of the study area at three different hill altitudes: low, medium and high. Results show a total of 71 tree and bamboo species of specific or multipurpose value, representing a rich reservoir of tree floral composition and diversity in the homestead forests. The study finds an even distribution of species in the forests with an evenness index of 0.91. The higher tree species diversity and tree density per homestead forest are ascribed to higher literacy, livelihood, and experience (age of respondents) of the households in mid-hills compared to the households of the other two hilly altitudes. The harvests and sales of fuelwood, timber, and bamboo in diverse mid-hill homestead forests are higher compared to the other hills, significantly contributing to the total income of the households. Data analysis also shows that there is a potential of avoiding fossil fuel emissions of 0.22 Mg CO2 e HH−1 a−1 by using fuelwood collected from the forests at the household level.

This function contemplates the sum of two contributions: one of nitric acid and another that includes sulfuric acid and climatic parameters. The multipollutant function is suitable to apply in areas without the strong influence of chlorides and tropical and subtropical climates, comparable to the Mexico City Metropolitan area. Findings: The results showed that spatial and temporal estimation of corrosion rates in grams per square meter of zinc was made for 2015-2019, using data modeling in a geographic information system. The maps of corrosion rates allowed us to visualize that, in general, the “southwest” zone has the most significant effects and that the lowest corrosion rates were presented in 2019 as an outcome of the implementation of air quality programs. Furthermore, a contribution of nitric acid up to 32% to the zinc corrosion rate was estimated. Conclusion: The construction of corrosion rate maps provides a spatial and temporal estimate that allows visualizing areas where zinc materials are at risk corrosion due to the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants and climatic parameters. Likewise, it can represent a decision-making tool for the implementation of atmospheric corrosion studies of materials. ©2021 The author(s).

However, we lack a predictive understanding of how climate change alters interactions between plants and endophytes, critical microbial mediators of plant physiology and ecology. We leveraged the SoyFACE facility to examine how elevated [CO2] affected soybean (Glycine max) leaf endophyte communities in the field. Endophyte community composition changed under elevated [CO2], including a decrease in the abundance of a common endophyte, Methylobacterium sp. Moreover, Methylobacterium abundance was negatively correlated with co-occurring fungal endophytes. We then assessed how Methylobacterium affected the growth of co-occurring endophytic fungi in vitro. Methylobacterium antagonized most co-occurring fungal endophytes in vitro, particularly when it was more established in culture before fungal introduction. Variation in fungal response to Methylobacterium within a single fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was comparable to inter-OTU variation. Finally, fungi isolated from elevated vs. ambient [CO2] plots differed in colony growth and response to Methylobacterium, suggesting that increasing [CO2] may affect fungal traits and interactions within the microbiome. By combining in situ and in vitro studies, we show that elevated [CO2] decreases the abundance of a common bacterial endophyte that interacts strongly with co-occurring fungal endophytes. We suggest that endophyte responses to global climate change will have important but largely unexplored implications for both agricultural and natural systems. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","endophytes; FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment); fungi; Glycine max (soybean); in vitro assays; Methylobacterium; microbiome","bacterium; bioassay; biome; carbon dioxide; climate change; community composition; community response; endophyte; enrichment; fungus; leaf; soybean; Bacteria (microorganisms); Glycine max; Methylobacterium; Methylobacterium sp.; carbon dioxide; endophyte; fungus; plant leaf; soybean; Carbon Dioxide; Endophytes; Fungi; Plant Leaves; Soybeans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108446970

This study investigated the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and yield of maize cropland under different irrigation treatments to determine the optimal irrigation treatment at different maize growth stages. Different degrees of water deficit irrigation were carried out in four fields: full irrigation, 100% evapotranspiration (ET); moderate deficit irrigation, 65% ET; and severe deficit irrigation, 40% ET. Automated static and dynamic chambers were used to measure CO2 fluxes. We found that NEE showed a “V” -shaped trend during the day and slowly declined at night. The light response parameters were calculated using the rectangular hyperbola model, and the leaf area index accounted for 85% of the light use efficiency. In the late vegetative stage, severe deficit irrigation led to a reduction in CO2 emissions but significantly reduced the crop growth rate (p &lt; 0.05). In the reproductive stage, full irrigation not only reduced CO2 emissions but also significantly increased the crop growth rate. In the maturation stage, moderate deficit irrigation reduced CO2 emissions, and the crop growth rate decreased compared with full irrigation, but the decrease was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Compared with full irrigation throughout the growth period, full irrigation in the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and reproductive stages both increased the maize carbon sink capacity and light use efficiency at higher leaf area index, and the harvest index did not decrease significantly. However, inadequate irrigation in the reproductive stage or severe deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and maturation stages significantly reduced the maize harvest index. Thus, full irrigation during the reproductive stage, and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages were the optimal irrigation strategies for saving water, reducing CO2 emissions and ensuring a satisfactory maize yield. © 2021","Chamber; Different irrigation treatments; Maize; Net ecosystem CO2 exchange; Yield","Crops; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Growth rate; Irrigation; Plants (botany); Chamber; CO$-2$/ emission; Deficit irrigation; Different irrigation treatment; Full irrigations; Irrigation treatments; Maize; Net ecosystem CO2 exchange; Reproductive stage; Yield; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; crop plant; crop yield; diurnal variation; evapotranspiration; growth rate; leaf area index; light use efficiency; maize; seasonal variation; semiarid region; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108445586

Many places around the world have addressed these issues by initiating a regional approach for environmental management. While such strategies are often asserted to positively influence localities' environmental governance capacity, empirical evidence for these claims is thin. This study explores the association between regional integration plans and the involved localities' environmental management capacity using the valuable but understudied case of China's national-level city clusters. It constructs novel measures to assess 137 Chinese cities' actual performance in air pollution mitigation and applies structural equation modeling tools to analyze whether cities' capacity in environmental enforcement and compliance is different inside and outside of the major urban agglomerations. Results show that enforcement activities are done differently in these two studied groups, and differences in cities' enforcement-compliance capacity better explain the differences in the un-clustered cities' average air quality. Moreover, this study shows that the two studied groups face different capacity-building opportunities in environmental enforcement and compliance. These opportunities mainly exist in areas such as environmental impact assessment of new construction projects, supervisory monitoring of nationally monitored polluters, and spot-check on daily polluters. Our study is the first to empirically evaluate Chinese cities' capacity in environmental enforcement and compliance with reference to both the procedural outcomes and the environmental outcomes. Our results have important managerial implications for local environmental protection bureaus, major industrial polluters, and policy makers who are involved in the design and implementation of China's urban agglomeration development plans. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity building; China's air pollution control; Environmental enforcement and compliance; Performance evaluation; Regional environmental management; Structural equation modeling","Agglomeration; Air pollution control; Air quality; Compliance control; Environmental impact assessments; Regulatory compliance; Capacity building; China air pollution control; Chinese cities; Environmental compliance; Environmental enforcement; Performances evaluation; Regional environmental management; Structural equation models; Urban agglomerations; Urban cities; Environmental management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108403278

Across the globe, urban parks are designed and managed in a similar way, resulting in visually pleasing expansions of lawn interspersed with individually planted trees of varying appearances and functional traits. These large urban greenspaces have the capacity to provide various ecosystem services, including those associated with soil physicochemical properties. Our aim was to explore whether soil properties in urban parks diverge underneath vegetation producing labile or recalcitrant litter, and whether the impact is affected by climatic zone (from a boreal to temperate to tropical city). We also compared these properties to those in (semi)natural forests outside the cities to assess the influence of urbanization on plant-trait effects. We showed that vegetation type affected percentage soil organic matter (OM), total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), but inconsistently across climatic zones. Plant-trait effects were particularly weak in old parks in the boreal and temperate zones, whereas in young parks in these zones, soils underneath the two tree types accumulated significantly more OM, C and N compared to lawns. Within climatic zones, anthropogenic drivers dominated natural ones, with consistently lower values of organic-matter-related soil properties under trees producing labile or recalcitrant litter in parks compared to forests. The dominating effect of urbanization is also reflected in its ability to homogenize soil properties in parks across the three cities, especially in lawn soils and soils under trees irrespective of functional trait. Our study demonstrates that soil functions that relate to carbon and nitrogen dynamics—even in old urban greenspaces where plant–soil interactions have a long history—clearly diverged from those in natural ecosystems, implying a long-lasting influence of anthropogenic drivers on soil ecosystem services. © 2021 The Authors.

Although states and nations address their unique priorities using plant regulations, these regulations are most likely to reduce invasive plant introduction and spread if they are consistently enacted across political borders and proactively restrict spread early in the invasion process. Further, a unified regulatory landscape is particularly important given the imminent range infilling and large-scale climate-driven range shifts of invasive species. In the United States, federal and state regulations restrict the introduction and spread of several hundred invasive and noxious plant taxa in an effort to reduce their negative impacts. Using plant regulations for the lower 48 United States, we assessed consistency among regulated taxa based on similarities in adjacent states’ regulatory lists. We assessed proactivity by comparing regulatory lists to plants’ current and potential distributions given occurrence records and species distribution models under climate change. States regulate from 0 to 162 plant taxa, with an average of only 16.8% overlap of regulated taxa between adjacent states. Up to 137 plants may be present but unregulated in a state, and only 110 of 553 listed taxa were regulated in one or more states where they were not yet present. However, 36 states listed at least one taxon proactively (regulated but not present in the state). Of the 48 proactively listed taxa with species distribution models, we identified 41 cases (38 species in 21 states) where listing was ‘climate proactive’ (regulated, not present and where climate could be suitable for establishment by mid-century). Policy implications. US plant regulatory lists were inconsistent across borders and reactive to climate change. However, most states regulate at least one plant taxa prior to its introduction, suggesting that a more proactive approach is possible under existing regulations. Coordination across borders is imperative given gaps in regional defences against invasion and projected invasive plant range shifts under climate change. We suggest that subnational, national and international governing bodies evaluate their plant regulatory lists for consistency and proactivity, as it is paramount for preventing the next wave of plant invasions. © 2021 British Ecological Society","climate change; invasive species; noxious weeds; plant regulatory lists; plants; policy; proactive management","climate change; invasive species; landscape structure; plant; population distribution; prioritization; regulatory framework; strategic approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108353576

A promising strategy for improving both ORR performance and mass diffusion simultaneously is to build carbon-based catalysts with ORR-active chemical dopants and 3D interconnected porosity. Herein, a 3D nanoporous N-doped carbon with bicontinuous porosity and interconnected open-pore channels is reported, which is prepared by a polyaniline-assisted template method. The polyaniline can efficiently inhibit the surface diffusion-caused template coarsening, achieving a small pore size of 35 nm. The small porous morphology gives rise to a high N-dopant concentration up to 7.20 at.%, which in turn exhibits a commercial Pt/C-comparable ORR performance together with satisfied durability in alkaline media. Using these nanoporous carbon catalysts as air electrodes, an all-solid-state flexible Al-air battery is assembled with the measured maximum power density reaching 130.5 mW cm−2, as compared to 106.2 mW cm−2 when the commercial Pt/C standard is used.

However, the interactions and effects of multiple stressors (e.g., nutrient enrichment, climate warming, altered wind and precipitation) acting over different spatial and temporal scales are often complex and remain controversial. Here, we reconstructed one-century dynamics of eutrophication and primary producer communities in algal-dominated and macrophyte-dominated zones of a large shallow lake (Taihu, China), by integrating sedimentary photosynthetic pigments and geochemical records with water monitoring and historical archives. We aimed to explore the long-term underlying mechanisms of the responses of water quality and lake biota to multiple environmental perturbations. We found that water quality degradation and algal community modification showed similar trends but distinct timings and trajectories in contrasting ecological zones. Onset and intensity of eutrophication in north Meiliang Bay (since the 1950s) exceeded far beyond that of macrophyte-dominated Eastern Taihu (~1990s). Anthropogenic nutrients overtook past climatic control on production and composition of phototrophic assemblages. More importantly, lake phytoplankton responded markedly to climate warming, decreasing wind speed, and extreme weathers after cultural eutrophication. Synergistic interactions of nutrients and climate on lake ecosystems became increasingly significant in promoting harmful algal blooms (HABs) dominated by Microcystis, close to the hyper-eutrophic north lake zones. The asynchronous limnological and ecological responses also indicated the modulating roles of lake ecological regime and catchment hydrogeomorphic characteristic. Collectively, our findings suggest that mitigation of eutrophication and HABs calls for a triple management strategy integrating anthropogenic nutrients, climate change, and lake-catchment setting. © 2021 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.",,"algal community; catchment; climate change; ecosystem dynamics; nutrient enrichment; phytoplankton; water quality; China; Jiangsu; Meiliang Bay; Taihu; Microcystis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108315422

Soil microorganisms predominate in incorporating root-derived C and subsequently transfer it to higher trophic levels. However, variation in microbial community structure between cropping systems and its consequences for the incorporation of root-derived C into soil microbivores remain unclear. In the present study, we used 13CO2 to pulse label a crop monoculture (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L.), a mixed grass community (dominated by Lolium perenne L. mixed with clover Trifolium repens L.), and a young tree plantation (willow, Salix schwerinii E.L. Wolf and Salix viminalis L.). During 28 days, we traced the incorporation of root-derived 13C into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of soil microorganisms and neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFAs) of five Collembola species belonging to three functional groups: epedaphic (surface-dwelling), hemiedaphic (litter-dwelling), and euedaphic (soil-dwelling). The contribution of bacterial and fungal channels to the incorporation of root-derived C into Collembola varied considerably between cropping systems. Collembola incorporated more 13C from the bacterial channel in rape than in grass and willow, where fungi were the major C source. This corresponded to a similarly higher 13C incorporation into bacterial marker PLFAs in rape compared to grass and willow. By contrast, while the proportion of bacterial and fungal biomarkers in Collembola NLFAs was related to the 13C incorporation into microbial PLFAs, it did not correlate with the proportion of microbial PLFAs in the different cropping systems. This suggests that Collembola rely on specific microbial pools, presumably related to recent plant inputs. Within the same cropping system, hemiedaphic species incorporated more root-derived 13C from the bacterial channel compared to euedaphic and epedaphic species. The results demonstrate the remarkable importance of cropping system for the flux of root C into microorganisms and microbivore soil invertebrates. Changes in root C flux into bacterial and fungal resources among cropping systems resulted in differential utilization of these resources by soil microbivores, suggesting that in particular microorganisms fueled by rhizodeposits are vital resources for the nutrition of higher trophic levels in soil food webs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","13C labeling; Agroforestry; Bacterial energy channel; Collembola; Fungal energy channel; NLFAs","Bacteria; Carbon; Ecology; Forestry; Fungi; Housing; Oilseeds; Phospholipids; Soils; $+13$/C; 13-C labeling; Agroforestry; Bacterial energy channel; Collembola; Cropping systems; Fungal energy channel; Neutral lipid fatty acid; Phospholipid fatty acids; Rhizodeposits; Fatty acids; arthropod; bacterium; carbon flux; community structure; cropping practice; fungus; microbial community; root system; soil microorganism; trophic level; Bacteria (microorganisms); Brassica napus; Collembola; Invertebrata; Lolium perenne; Salix schwerinii; Salix viminalis; Trifolium; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108313695

Among different bioenergy applications, advanced liquid biofuels produced through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste biomass have gained interest as promising drop-in alternatives to fossil fuels. However, there is lack of studies in literature that evaluate the potential of HTL as negative emission technology in the context of BECCS and present detailed process design of such an implementation for different types of biomass. In this paper, we perform carbon capture modeling based on state-of-art experimental data on HTL of waste lignocellulosic and urban biomasses by means of physical absorption via the Selexol™ process. The process model is utilized for developing a techno-economic analysis that highlights key parameters to optimize CO2 capture cost efficiency. The results indicate that the purity of the CO2 product fulfils the requirements for geological storage in all cases studied, and is on-spec for pipeline transportation when the composition of C2+ hydrocarbons and H2S in the HTL gas are kept below 4 and 1 mol % respectively, or by the implementation of two absorption steps. For the standard process evaluated, the estimated cost of the captured CO2 is between 40 and 53 EUR/tonne, which is in the range of the carbon price expected within this decade in the EU emission trading system, given the announced cap reductions until 2030 and the targets set by the European Green Deal. © 2021 The Authors","BECCS; Carbon capture; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Physical absorption; Selexol™","Biofuels; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Gas absorption; Global warming; Hydrogen sulfide; Lignocellulosic biomass; Sewage sludge; Emission technology; Energy transitions; Geological storage; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Physical absorption; Pipe-line transportations; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economic evaluation; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108271344

Realizing negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will require technologies like anaerobic digestion to recover biomethane from organic biomass. As the world's main grain-producing country, China has abundant crop residues, &gt;85% of which were utilized as fertilizer, fodder, industrial material, biofuel, and base material in 2019. However, the potential contribution of crop residues to energy and reduced GHG emissions following anaerobic digestion have been scarcely evaluated. Based on crop yield and the field residue index, the annual quantity of crop residues in China from 2000 to 2019 was estimated. The annual crop residue yield increased between 2003 and 2014, and then remained constant at ~970 × 106 t/a, with an estimated 495 × 106 t/a being available for biomethane production. This corresponded to a potential biomethane yield of 82.25 × 109 m3/a, which could have met 29.2% of the annual natural gas consumption and 2.25% of the annual energy consumption in China in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated potential GHG emission reduction was 197 × 106 t/a (CO2 equivalent), representing ~2% of China's GHG emissions in 2019. Nevertheless, to reach the expected goal, some crucial technical and equipment-oriented research and development should be promoted to adapt to the characteristics of China's crop residues and regional environment. Moreover, governmental support policies on subsidies would be required for the development of the biomethane industry, which should prioritize northern regions with relatively high quantities of crop residues. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biomethane policy; Crop residual resource; Greenhouse gas emission; Renewable energy","Agricultural wastes; Anaerobic digestion; Carbon; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Anaerobics; Biomethane; Biomethane policy; Carbon neutralities; Chinese Government; Crop residual resource; Crop residue; Greenhouse gas emissions; Organics; Renewable energies; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108251002

We analysed water and sediments at six geothermal pools from the rhyolitic Kerlingarfjöll and basaltic Kverkfjöll volcanoes in Iceland, to investigate the localised controls on the habitability of these systems in terms of microbial community function. Our results show that host lithology plays a minor role in pool geochemistry and authigenic mineralogy, with the system geochemistry primarily controlled by deep volcanic processes. We find that by dictating pool water pH and redox conditions, deep volcanic processes are the primary control on microbial community structure and function, with water input from the proximal glacier acting as a secondary control by regulating pool temperatures. Kerlingarfjöll pools have reduced, circum-neutral CO2-rich waters with authigenic calcite-, pyrite- and kaolinite-bearing sediments. The dominant metabolisms inferred from community profiles obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are methanogenesis, respiration of sulphate and sulphur (S0) oxidation. In contrast, Kverkfjöll pools have oxidised, acidic (pH &lt; 3) waters with high concentrations of SO42- and high argillic alteration, resulting in Al-phyllosilicate-rich sediments. The prevailing metabolisms here are iron oxidation, sulphur oxidation and nitrification. Where analogous ice-fed hydrothermal systems existed on early Mars, similar volcanic processes would likely have controlled localised metabolic potential and thus habitability. Moreover, such systems offer several habitability advantages, including a localised source of metabolic redox pairs for chemolithotrophic microorganisms and accessible trace metals.

Herein, we have scientifically transformed blue denim textile waste into two different forms of nanocarbons to assemble dual carbon potassium-ion hybrid capacitor (KIHC). The unique composition of indigo and sulphur dyes in blue jeans enables to produce multi-heteroatom (nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen) doped hard carbon (MHC) with large interlayer spacing (0.41 nm) in a single step. An in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveal that the charge stored in disordered and large interlayer spaced graphitic structure enable fast kinetics for efficient potassium-ion transportation. Coupling with an activated carbon foam (ACF)-based cathode, a full cell of potassium-ion capacitor successfully delivers a high energy density of 181 Wh kg−1 at 70.4 W kg−1 and 61.8 Wh kg−1 at 4000 W kg−1, as well as an long lifespan of 5000 cycles with over 89% of capacity retention.

A key example of this is the Red Sea, a biodiversity hotspot subjected to increasing local human pressures. While some marine-protected areas (MPAs) were placed to alleviate these stressors, it is unclear whether these MPAs are managed or enforced, thus providing limited protection. Yet, most importantly, MPAs in the Red Sea were not designed using climate considerations, likely diminishing their effectiveness against global stressors. Here, we propose to tailor the design of MPAs in the Red Sea by integrating approaches to enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation. First, including coral bleaching susceptibility could produce a more resilient network of MPAs by safeguarding reefs from different thermal regions that vary in spatiotemporal bleaching responses, reducing the risk that all protected reefs will bleach simultaneously. Second, preserving the basin-wide genetic connectivity patterns that are assisted by mesoscale eddies could further ensure recovery of sensitive populations and maintain species potential to adapt to environmental changes. Finally, protecting mangrove forests in the northern and southern Red Sea that act as major carbon sinks could help offset greenhouse gas emissions. If implemented with multinational cooperation and concerted effort among stakeholders, our portfolio of climate-tailored approaches may help build a network of MPAs in the Red Sea that protects more effectively its coastal resources against escalating coastal development and climate instability. Beyond the Red Sea, we anticipate this study to serve as an example of how to improve the utility of tropical MPAs as climate-informed conservation tools. © 2021 The Authors.

Plant accession classification and selection helps in identification of plants tolerant to local climatic conditions. Over the past few years, convolutional neural network (CNN) models were predominantly used for classification of plants and plant diseases from static plant images using spatial features. In this paper, we introduce three different methods namely 3-dimensional (3-D) CNN, CNN with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) layers and vision transformer that use temporal information along with spatial information for plant accession classification. We have used publicly available Arabidopsis plant accession classification dataset to test the performance of these methods. Time series color images of four different plant accessions of Arabidopsis are given as input to the neural network model which in turn identifies plant accession. All the three methods outperform the existing methods available in the literature in terms of average accession classification accuracy. Vision transformer achieves highest classification accuracy of 98.59% at the cost of very large number of trainable parameters as compared to the other two methods. On the other hand, CNN-ConvLSTM achieves comparable accuracy of 97.97% with very less trainable parameters as compared to vision transformer. In future, these models can also be used to identify unknown plant accessions and predict plant growth signatures in different climatic conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","3-D CNN; Arabidopsis accession classification; Convolutional LSTM; Plant phenotyping; Spatio-temporal networks; Vision transformer","accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; classification; climate conditions; data set; herb; image analysis; image classification; spatiotemporal analysis; Arabidopsis; unidentified plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108166107

However, there is uncertainty about how the global SOC cycle will respond to future climate change. In order to assess changes in SOC storage, basing on the historical weather data and field observations (1951–2018), the study used the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to simulate future SOC storage in an arid oasis under three representational concentration paths (RCPs): RCP2.6, low-end path; RCP4.5, middle stable path; and RCP8.5, high-end path) for the period from 2018 to 2086. Farmland soil in the Yanqi Basin in northern China was divided into grid units using ArcGIS, and then kriging interpolation was used to extract the mean value of the 200 grid units to calculate regional changes in SOC storage. The model indicated that more than 92.75 % of the measured results accurately simulated the SOC storage in Yanqi Basin cropland. The measured SOC storage in the Yanqi Basin was 1.32 Tg C in 2018. The range of SOC density was 653.27–5527.04 kg C/hm2 under the historical climate scenario, and 1863.99–4581.16 kg C/hm2, 2372.74–6910.15 kg C/hm2, and 623.656–5431.95 kg C/hm2 under the RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The simulation results show that, compared with the SOC stock in 2018, the SOC stocks in the oasis area in the future will show a rapid decline under the historical climate scenario (7.6 % decrease) as well as in the RCP 2.6 (3% decrease), RCP 4.5 (9.17 % decrease), and RCP 8.5 (16 % decrease) scenarios. These results indicate that organic carbon outputs and density will decrease faster under high emissions and more slowly under low emissions. This study provides supporting data and a scientific basis for increasing soil organic carbon in cropland and for the management of oasis soil to mitigate the effects of future climate change. © 2021","Climate change scenarios; Cropland; DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC); Representational concentration paths (RCPs); Soil organic carbon storage","Climate change; Denitrification; Digital storage; Information management; Interpolation; Organic carbon; Climate change scenarios; Cropland; Denitrification-decomposition; Future climate; Northern China; Representational concentration path; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Soil organic carbon storages; Yanqi basin; Soils; agricultural land; agricultural soil; ArcGIS; carbon sequestration; climate change; denitrification; interpolation; kriging; oasis; organic carbon; scenario analysis; simulation; soil carbon; China; Xinjiang Uygur; Yanqi Basin; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108153906

Some of these have been developed as fungicides or pesticides, and species-specific Q-site inhibitors may be useful against human pathogens. We report structures of chicken Complex II with six different Q-site inhibitors bound, at resolutions 2.0–2.4 Å. These structures show the common interactions between the inhibitors and their binding site. In every case a carbonyl or hydroxyl oxygen of the inhibitor is H-bonded to Tyr58 in subunit SdhD and Trp173 in subunit SdhB. Two of the inhibitors H-bond Ser39 in subunit SdhC directly, while two others do so via a water molecule. There is a distinct cavity that accepts the 2-substituent of the carboxylate ring in flutolanil and related inhibitors. A hydrophobic “tail pocket” opens to receive a side-chain of intermediate-length inhibitors. Shorter inhibitors fit entirely within the main binding cleft, while the long hydrophobic side chains of ferulenol and atpenin A5 protrude out of the cleft into the bulk lipid region, as presumably does that of ubiquinone. Comparison of mitochondrial and Escherichia coli Complex II shows a rotation of the membrane-anchor subunits by 7° relative to the iron‑sulfur protein. This rotation alters the geometry of the Q-site and the H-bonding pattern of SdhB:His216 and SdhD:Asp57. This conformational difference, rather than any active-site mutation, may be responsible for the different inhibitor sensitivity of the bacterial enzyme. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Active site; Ligand binding; Membrane protein; Oxidoreductase; Protein structure; Succinate-quinone reductase; Ubiquinone; X-ray crystallography","atpenin a5; bacterial enzyme; boscalid; carbonyl derivative; carboxin; ferulenol; fluopyram; flutolanil; hydroxyl group; iron sulfur protein; penthiopyrad; quinone derivative; succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinone; unclassified drug; benzoquinone derivative; multienzyme complex; quinone derivative; succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinone; Article; binding site; chicken; comparative study; crystallography; enzyme active site; Escherichia coli; human; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; nonhuman; amino acid sequence; animal; binding site; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; pig; sequence alignment; site directed mutagenesis; ultrastructure; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Benzoquinones; Binding Sites; Chickens; Electron Transport Complex II; Multienzyme Complexes; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Quinones; Sequence Alignment; Sus scrofa; Ubiquinone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108116084

Olive grove cultivation is tending to intensify from traditional low-density to intensive and high-density cropping systems, which might result in higher environmental impacts. The aim of this study is to estimate the environmental impacts, carbon (C) footprint and carbon balance of producing virgin origin olive oil in Spain from four traditional rainfed, four irrigated, and three intensive olive farms, including the processing phase. Environmental impacts of producing 1 kg of unpacked virgin olive oil at the farm and industrial phases were quantified with the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool and a ""cradle-to-gate” approach using data from surveys at these farms and 12 olive oil mills. On average, the farming phase accounted for 76.3% of the EIs. Therefore, to reduce the impact of the virgin olive oils production, most of the efforts should be made especially in the farming phase. Despite the high variability between seasons and between independent replicates of the same farming system, intensive farming had significant higher impacts on most environmental impact categories than traditional rainfed farming, mainly due to the application of nitrogen fertilizer, plant protection products and herbicides. In terms of climate change, the environmental impact of the functional unit is in the ranges of 1.80–2.41, 1.59–2.78 and 2.28–3.26 kg of CO2 eq. for traditional rainfed, irrigated and intensive, respectively. C footprint was negative and averaged −5.5, −4.3 and −2.7 kg CO2 eq. Olive groves are efficient atmospheric CO2 sinks mainly by fixing CO2 into permanent and non-permanent trees structures. The lower intensification of the traditional rainfed groves contributed more in mitigating the increase of atmospheric CO2.

The results are as follows: (1) The overall level of energy efficiency in China is relatively low, and the average efficiency level from 2007 to 2019 is 0.568. Among them, Beijing is the highest, at 1.261, and Xinjiang is the lowest, at only 0.205. The energy efficiency of the eastern region is the highest in China: the average is 0.812. The central region is lower than the national average, with the value of 0.534. The lowest energy efficiency is in the western region, which is only 0.349. It can be seen that there are significant differences in regional energy efficiency, and from west to east has increased. (2) The Theil coefficient increased before 2012 and began to show a downward trend in 2013. The difference in the eastern region maintained the smallest downward trend among the three regions. The difference in the central region fluctuated and increased before 2011, and dropped sharply after 2012. In the western region, the coefficient is relatively stable and has not changed significantly. (3) Differences within and between regions in China show an overall downward trend.

In this perspective, the city of Burdur is selected as the target to implement the designated solar energy policy targets. With this paper, nationwide official targets are evaluated for a city level by calculating long-term effects and costs to the system. A total of 5000 MW of solar energy utilization target of Turkey has been reduced to the urban level for Burdur, depending on its share of solar energy, and then applied as an alternative scenario on the energy model developed for this analysis.

Abstract: Improving yield and yield-related traits are key goals in wheat breeding program. The integration of accumulated wheat genetic resources provides an opportunity to uncover important genomic regions and candidate genes that affect wheat yield. Here, a comprehensive meta-QTL analysis was conducted on 2230 QTL of yield-related traits obtained from 119 QTL studies. These QTL were refined into 145 meta-QTL (MQTL), and 89 MQTL were verified by GWAS with different natural populations. The average confidence interval (CI) of these MQTL was 2.92 times less than that of the initial QTL. Furthermore, 76 core MQTL regions with a physical distance less than 25 Mb were detected. Based on the homology analysis and expression patterns, 237 candidate genes in the MQTL involved in photoperiod response, grain development, multiple plant growth regulator pathways, carbon and nitrogen metabolism and spike and flower organ development were determined. A novel candidate gene TaKAO-4A was confirmed to be significantly associated with grain size, and a CAPS marker was developed based on its dominant haplotype. In summary, this study clarified a method based on the integration of meta-QTL, GWAS and homology comparison to reveal the genomic regions and candidate genes that affect important yield-related traits in wheat. This work will help to lay a foundation for the identification, transfer and aggregation of these important QTL or candidate genes in wheat high-yield breeding. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Grain (agricultural product); Growth kinetics; LSI circuits; Carbon and nitrogen; Confidence interval; Expression patterns; Genome-wide association studies; Grain development; Natural population; Organ development; Plant growth regulators; Genes; plant protein; chromosomal mapping; food grain; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome-wide association study; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phenotype; plant breeding; plant chromosome; plant genome; procedures; quantitative trait locus; wheat; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Edible Grain; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Proteins; Quantitative Trait Loci; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108104620

Controlled-environment agriculture, in particular indoor vertical farming, is developing as part of this trend, to ensure a year-round supply of healthy food and protection from extreme weather events. However, high energy consumption is a major concern that could greatly impact the environmental sustainability of high-tech farms. Addressing the lack of comprehensive comparisons between different controlled-environment agriculture systems on a consistent basis, this work investigates the favourability of indoor vertical farms (i.e. plant factories) over modern ventilated open and closed greenhouses from an energy intensity perspective. This was based on a flexible yield-energy model incorporating detailed air conditioning system dynamics, which was developed to evaluate the influence of outside climate conditions on energy consumption and vegetable yield. The model was used to optimise the climate control strategy and to minimise hourly specific energy consumption for multiple systems, parameter settings, and locations. The hourly model performance is demonstrated for Stockholm, which indicates that advanced climate control allows for very low-energy operations in summer compared to winter. The results show a strong parametric sensitivity for the thermal transmittance of the cover, the target light intensity and the crop climate preference in all three systems, as well as the efficiency of lighting and water cooling for plant factories. Considering the yearly average for multiple locations, open greenhouses were substantially more energy-efficient than plant factories in all ten locations (from −45% in Reykjavík to −94% in Gauteng). The option to ventilate a greenhouse (open vs closed) had the greatest positive effect on specific energy consumption in less extreme climates (from −36% in Massachusetts to −83% in Gauteng) but increased water consumption considerably (from an average of ~2 l/kg to 26 l/kg). Although local availability of land and water plays a significant role in the choice between growing systems, the results imply that high-tech ventilated greenhouses perform significantly better than vertical farms from an energy perspective in most inhabited regions of the planet. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate control; Controlled-environment-agriculture; Multivariate optimisation; Specific energy; Vegetable supply; Vertical farming","Air conditioning; Climate models; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Location; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Vegetables; Ventilation; Climatic conditions; Controlled environment agricultures; Energy optimization; High tech; Multivariate optimization; Plant factory; Specific energy; Specific energy consumption; Vegetable supply; Vertical farming; Greenhouses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108094993

The economic cost might become uncontrollable if radical policy changes are not implemented soon. Particulate matter emission is mostly attributed to road transport and power generation worldwide. This paper examines the state and adequacy of fuel and vehicle standards prevalent across the African continent. Experimental emissions tests were conducted on 200 vehicles each in Rwanda and Ghana to ascertain compliance to local and international standards. The result showed that even some new vehicles failed the emission tests while almost all the diesel cars tested in both countries failed the international standard. It was discovered that only five African countries have emission standards, most of which were not being implemented. The results also show that while there are approximately 72 million vehicles in use in Africa, only seven countries are responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in Africa is growing at a rate of 7% annually. Poor fuel quality, aging vehicle fleet, and lack of mandatory roadworthy emission tests were to blame for the deteriorating transport emissions. More than 50% of African countries have fuel quality worse than European fuel quality predating 1992. The study recommended the UK's emission standard for the annual in-service emission testing and Euro 4 standards for both fuel and new vehicle standards. © 2021 The Author(s)","Africa; Emissions; Fuel standard; Roadworthiness; Vehicle standard; Vehicles in use",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108093921

In this study, a water resources management modelling framework of regional water use sectors was established by combining the water resources value theory with the uncertainty theory. The water resources value of different water use sectors was calculated through Cobb-Douglas (C-D) production function and emergy theory to estimate the benefits of water resources accurately. On this basis, a chance-constrained possibilistic mean-variance multi-objective programming (CPMMP) model was established by integrating the classical mean-variance model based on investment portfolio, chance-constrained programming (CCP), possibilistic mean and variance of fuzzy number with multi-objective programming framework. This model can not only deal with the risks of inaccurate water-supply prediction and the fluctuating water supply benefits but also achieve compromise resources consumption, and environmental protection under uncertainty. Taking Shiyang River Basin as an example, the validity of the proposed framework and solution method were verified under different hydrological years, 60%WSB (best water supply benefits) and 90%WSB scenarios. The calculated average water resources value in agricultural, industrial and domestic were 1.92, 109.67 and 20.71 CNY/m3 respectively, and the standard deviation were 0.21, 15.68, 2.60 CNY/m3 respectively. The variability of water resources value in industrial sector were far greater than those in agricultural and domestic sectors. These fluctuations of water resources should be paid attention to in the water resources allocation. The established CPMMP model can effectively reduce the system risks, net carbon emissions and energy consumption under the premise that the system benefits are equivalent to the status quo. Optimal results can provide decision makers energy-saving and emission-reducing water resource management strategies, which are conducive to the sustainable development of the system. Besides, the established framework can also provide a scientific basis and technical support for other resource management in other regions. © 2021","Risks control; Uncertainty; Water allocation optimization; Water resources value; Water-energy nexus","Agriculture; Computer programming; Decision making; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fuzzy sets; Investments; Planning; Resource allocation; Risk management; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Water management; Water supply; Mean variance; Multi-objectives programming; Possibilistic mean; Risks controls; Uncertainty; Water allocation optimization; Water resource value; Water-energy nexus; Waters resources; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108093182

For improving the rainfed crop yields in the drought-prone environments, understanding the seasonal patterns of drought events in the target environments is crucial. This study applies the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) crop model to interpret drought stress impact on a check genotype (early-maturity genotype) and mid- and late-maturity genotypes in 69 sites and 16 climate classes with climate data from over 37 years representing the rainfed wheat agro-ecosystems in Iran. Four drought patterns were recognized across the 16 regions. Water stress was dominant during grain filling (41 %) and around flowering (56 %) in studying regions. This stress varied over different genotypes and climate classes. Furthermore, results showed that under current management practices and using the check genotype, about half of the regions in the rainfed wheat agro-ecosystems of Iran (∼1.7 million ha) are frequently subject to severe drought patterns (50 %) resulting in a loss of grain yield of ∼2 t ha−1. Replacing a common genotype with an extra early-maturity genotype, however, reduced by 44 % the occurrence of severe drought patterns which simultaneously increased the occurrence of light-moderate drought stress (i.e. DP1 and DP2) in the warm regions. In general, planting the extra early-maturity genotype had the advantage of producing higher yields in the driest regions. Sowing this genotype reduced the variability in grain yield and the frequency of severe drought patterns in the warm regions. On the contrary, in rainy and cold regions, the best-yielding genotypes were those with a longer growth period. Therefore, in rainy and cold regions with light-moderate stress conditions, the breeders should focus on early-maturity and mid-maturity genotypes. Besides, it is suggested that the late-maturity genotype should be used in rainy regions with a reduced risk of drought stress. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM crop model; Climate classes; Clustering; Plant breeding; Simulation; Virtual genotype","agricultural production; climate change; drought stress; genotype; risk assessment; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; wheat; Iran; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108061435

However, the transition to renewable energy is impossible without massive public renewable energy research and development budgets (RRDD) along with sustained state and federal policies. RRDD in the US showed significant fluctuations over the last three decades and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) was also highly volatile. Based on this backdrop, this study examined the asymmetric impact of RRDD and EPU on CO2 emissions in the US, accounting for structural breaks in data, and controlling for economic growth and FDI. Keeping in view the overwhelming reliance on linear methods in previous studies, both symmetric and asymmetric ARDL approaches are employed for cointegration and long-run results on quarterly data over the period 1985 to 2017. The outcomes from symmetric and asymmetric cointegration tests unfolded only asymmetric cointegration among variables. The long-run findings unveil that a positive change in EPU mitigates emissions but a dominant reduction in CO2 emissions comes from a negative change in EPU. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce EPU to achieve a considerable long-term reduction in CO2 emissions. Surprisingly, positive and negative changes in RRDD do not affect CO2 emissions. Hence, the study could not find any significant reduction in CO2 emissions associated with RRDD, implying that renewable energy technology budgets are not sufficient enough to reduce pollutant emissions. The evidence also confirms that the EKC hypothesis is valid in the US considering RRDD, EPU, and FDI in the model. Finally, the study suggests a significant uplift in RRDD and fiscal policies with more subsidies and tax benefits for the growth of renewable energy sector. Also, stability in the environmental policies, regardless of the economic condition, is necessary to achieve long-term environmental benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Economic policy uncertainty; Renewable energy RD&D budgets","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; % reductions; CO$-2$/ emission; Economic growths; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energy RD&D budget; Renewable energy technologies; Research-and-development budget; Uncertainty; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108008673

Through incorporating three programming methods (interval linear programming, chance-constrained programming, and mixed-integer programming) in an optimization framework, the CCSS model could effectively deal with multiple uncertainties expressed as probability distribution and intervals in constraints and objectives. Since locations of retired coal-fired power stations have been proposed as new sites for small modular reactor (SMR), this model could provide the construction planning for SMR in terms of its sizes and sites. Various solutions to power generation and capacity expansion with different risk levels were obtained under the objective of minimal system costs. Results are helpful for identifying optimized strategies to increase the proportion of renewable energy under emission constraints. In addition, model without introducing the technology of SMR has been comprehensively compared with the CCSS model to recognise the effects of SMR on system costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Results indicate that the CCSS model is effective for supporting long-term clean and renewable energy utilization as well as emission reduction policy formulation in Saskatchewan. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chance-constrained programming; Electric power systems; GHG emission mitigation; Multiple uncertainties; Optimization; SMR siting","Computer programming; Constrained optimization; Electric power system planning; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Linear programming; Probability distributions; Renewable energy resources; Chance-constrained; Chance-constrained programming; Electric power; GHG emission mitigation; Multiple uncertainty; Optimisations; Saskatchewan; Siting models; Small modular reactor siting; Small modular reactors; Small nuclear reactors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107973007

Rapid growing energy and mineral products under this program might release increasing carbon emissions, causing climate and environmental consequences in northwestern China, which seems to be overlooked before. Here, a multiregional input-output analysis (MRIO) was conducted to investigate the temporal and spatial changes in black carbon (BC) emissions embodied in west-east energy and mineral product transmission from 2007 to 2012. Results were used to estimate BC's climate and environmental impact on China, focusing on northwestern China. The results show that BC emission flow patterns have been altered dramatically in China's domestic trade from 2007 through 2012. By 2012, 48%–77% of the consumption-based BC emissions from well-developed Beijing-Tianjin metropolises, East Coast, and South Coast regions were outsourced to other, primarily less-developed regions, of which northwestern China was the largest net BC emission outflow region at 48.8 Gg. The BC radiative forcing over China embodied in the west-east energy transmission was quantified using a compact Earth system model OSCAR. Model estimation shows that more than 30% of BC radiative forcing in northwestern China was related to the consumption from other regions across China. Central and eastern China were two significant contributors to the BC radiative forcing in northwestern China. Severe BC environmental inequality embodied in interprovincial trade was also identified in northwestern and central China provinces among 30 Chinese provinces. Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in northwestern China experienced the most prominent climate and environmental losses via trade with well-developed provinces. These results provide references to alleviate trade-related pollution and climate impacts and to promote BC environmental equality in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BC environmental equality; Black carbon; Climate forcing; Energy trade; Virtual emission flow","Carbon; Environmental impact; Mineral resources; Minerals; Black carbon; Black carbon emission; Black carbon environmental equality; Climate forcings; Energy products; Energy trade; Mineral products; Northwestern China; Radiative forcings; Virtual emission flow; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107968489

Results suggest the generation of a vicious cycle of clean generation and dirty generation, enhanced by a positive feedback with climate change impacts. This cycle is triggered by the tradeoffs between environmental protection policies and the socioeconomic pressure for energy production, embedded in an energy production matrix that prioritizes fossil fuel-based production as responses to peak energy demand. The climate projections were generated by the Eta Regional Climate Model from the National Institute for Space Research. They were forced by the atmospheric simulations of the Interdisciplinary Climate Research Model (MIROC5) and the Hadley Center Global Environmental Model (HadGEM2-ES) under the RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The MHD-INPE Distributed Hydrological Model was used to generate streamflow projections. Environmental impacts were assessed by accounting for carbon stock and sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy cost. Climate projections indicated reduced precipitation and increased temperature. The streamflow will present progressively reductions of the flow volume until the end of the century, which undermines the plant's ability to ensure firm energy and induce thermal plants' activation to supply the demand. This activation will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in the price of energy, which may lower the benefits in carbon stock associated with a run-of-river hydropower plant and negatively influence the reduction commitments assumed by Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Amazonia; Climate change; Energy; Run-of-river plants; Sustainability","Carbon; Chemical activation; Climate change; Climate models; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Rivers; Stream flow; % reductions; Amazonia; Carbon stocks; Climate change potentials; Climate projection; Energy; Energy productions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Run of rivers; Run-of-river plant; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107959740

The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Sorghum model was used to simulate the impact of climate change on sorghum yield for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and for three future periods including the 2025s (2010–2039), 2055s (2040–2069), and 2085s (2070–2099). The Agricultural Model Improvement and Inter-comparison Project (AgMIP) framework was used to select five representative GCMs for hot/dry, cool/dry, middle, hot/wet, and cool/wet climate scenarios. Two climate change adaptation practices including supplemental irrigation at two levels (deficit and full) to the current rainfed production system and shifting planting dates were evaluated. The CSM-CERES-Sorghum model was calibrated and evaluated using eight years of experimental data from Meisso, eastern Ethiopia. The model was then run for Kobo and Meisso under different climate change and crop management scenarios. Based on model evaluation results, the model performed well for simulating sorghum yield (R2 = 0.99), anthesis (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.3), and maturity (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 4.4). The results showed that the average temperature for Kobo and Meisso is expected to increase by up to 6 °C under RCP8.5 in 2085. For the rainfed production systems without adaptation practices, drought stress is projected to intensify during anthesis, which was reflected by projected yield reductions by up 2 t ha−1 for the two sites. Full irrigation was effective in reducing moisture stress and, thereby, increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 t ha−1 for Kobo and 2 t ha−1 for Meisso. On average, full irrigation resulted in a 1 t ha−1 yield increase compared with deficit irrigation. Early planting dates also resulted in an increase in yield compared to the baseline planting dates, especially when combined with supplemental irrigation, although late planting was consistently disadvantageous even with supplemental irrigation. This study highlighted that the CSM-CERES-Sorghum model can be effectively used to simulate climate change effects on sorghum yield and evaluate different climate change adaptation practices. The outcomes of this study can also help to implement management decisions towards climate change adaptation for the current subsistence and fragile rainfed crop production system in Ethiopia and similar ecoregions across the globe. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop modeling; DSSAT; Ethiopia; Moisture stress; Small-holder farming","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Decision support systems; Irrigation; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Climate change adaptation; Crop model; Cropping systems; Decision support system for agrotechnology transfer; Ethiopia; Moisture stress; Planting date; Production system; Rainfed; Small-holder farming; Crops; adaptive management; climate change; crop production; crop yield; drought stress; food production; irrigation system; rainfed agriculture; sorghum; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107949365

Denmark has set ambitious targets to lower its territorial carbon emissions in the next decades. In 2019, the Danish Agriculture and Food Council announced a strategy to make Denmark's food production systems climate-neutral by 2050. Therefore, detailed information concerning Denmark's food consumption's environmental impacts is required to implement effective climate mitigation and resource conservation policies that lead to positive local to global results. Using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output (EE MRIO) analysis and the EXIOBASE v3.4 database, we evaluate Denmark's global food-related consumption-based (CB) greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and resource (land and water use) accounts from 1995 to 2014. Although Denmark's CB food-related blue water use remained relatively stable during the studied period, its food-related CB GHG emissions (excluding land-use change emissions) decreased continuously by 30%. Also, Denmark's cropland and grassland footprints for food declined by 16% (3555 km2) and 27% (621 km2), respectively. Almost two-fifths of Denmark's food consumption was produced abroad in 2014, corresponding to 51% of Denmark's food-related CB GHG emissions and land use apiece and 84% of its food-related blue water use. Whereas animal-based foods accounted for the largest share of Denmark's food-related CB GHG emissions, plant-based diets were responsible for the bulk of Denmark's CB land and blue water use. Dietary changes towards plant-based foods are essential to mitigating Denmark's food-related climate impacts. We recommend that Denmark transfers its sustainable food production technologies to its pollution-and-resource intensive food-exporting trade partners to enhance global climate change mitigation and resource use efficiency. © 2021","EXIOBASE; Food products; GHG and Resource footprints; Life-cycle assessment; Multi-regional input-output analysis","Biodiversity; Commerce; Environmental impact; Food supply; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Natural resources; Blue water; Denmark; EXIOBASE; Food consumption; Food production; Greenhouse gas emission and resource footprint; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Multi-regional input-output analyse; Water use; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107946590

The carbon storage capacity of tropical forest ecosystems is declining gradually in recent years. But studies regarding the multiple drivers of tree and soil carbon in the tropical forest ecosystems are scarce. Our study aims to quantify the tree and soil carbon storage capacity and to explore how these carbon storages are associated with both biotic (stand structure, anthropogenic disturbance) and abiotic drivers (climate, topography, and soil) simultaneously in tropical forest ecosystems. The present study was conducted in two forest-protected areas of Bangladesh, namely- Satchari National Park (SNP), and Khadimnagar National Park (KNP). Results showed that tree carbon stock was 72.9 t ha−1 and 58.2 t ha−1 in SNP and KNP, respectively. Besides, soil carbon was 77.1 t ha−1 in SNP and 130.5 t ha−1 in KNP. We found that tree carbon was positively correlated with all stand structure parameters. However, soil carbon was negatively correlated with tree richness, height, and basal area. Anthropogenic disturbance had a negative correlation with tree carbon and a positive correlation with soil carbon stock. No significant correlation was observed between tree carbon and local climatic parameters. But soil carbon had a positive correlation with annual precipitation and a negative correlation with annual mean temperature. Furthermore, tree carbon was positively associated with elevation and slope whereas soil carbon was negatively associated with elevation. Tree carbon was negatively correlated with silt% but positively with sand%. Conversely, soil carbon showed significant positive associations with soil moisture, bulk density, soil pH, and soil silt%. Our study provides a comprehensive insight on the understandings of key drivers of tree and soil carbon storage in the tropical forest ecosystem of Bangladesh. We concluded that anthropogenic disturbance and stand characteristics regulate tree carbon stock while soil carbon is mainly associated with local climate and soil properties in the studied tropical forest ecosystems. © 2021","Anthropogenic disturbance; Carbon sequestration; Climate; Ecosystem services; Soil properties; Tropical forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107940993

Among these, fungi are highly diverse and are known to contribute to plant health, leaf senescence and early decomposition. However, patterns and drivers of the seasonal dynamics of foliar fungal communities are poorly understood. We used a multifactorial experiment to investigate the influence of warming and tree genotype on the foliar fungal community on the pedunculate oak Quercus robur across one growing season. Fungal species richness increased, evenness tended to decrease, and community composition strongly shifted during the growing season. Yeasts increased in relative abundance as the season progressed, while putative fungal pathogens decreased. Warming decreased species richness, reduced evenness and changed community composition, especially at the end of the growing season. Warming also negatively affected putative fungal pathogens. We only detected a minor imprint of tree genotype and warming × genotype interactions on species richness and community composition. Overall, our findings demonstrate that warming plays a larger role than plant genotype in shaping the seasonal dynamics of the foliar fungal community on oak. These warming-induced shifts in the foliar fungal community may have a pronounced impact on plant health, plant–fungal interactions and ecosystem functions. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation","climate warming; community composition; foliar fungal community; host genotype; Quercus robur; seasonal dynamics; warming × genotype interaction","community composition; ecosystem function; fungus; genotype; relative abundance; senescence; species richness; warming; Quercus robur; ecosystem; genetics; genotype; mycobiome; oak; season; Ecosystem; Genotype; Mycobiome; Quercus; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107933376

Wave energy converters harvest energy from waves and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This research covers major aspects of the wave energy field including converters and installation-locations, and proposes a Decision-Making Process to identify optimum converter-location pairs for wave energy harvesting. This Process is based on the wave energy converter Selection-Guideline arising from essential features, and the synthesis of previous works so far focused on pinched-point locations. This Process yields a single map, denoting hotspot-areas for energy harvesting, and thereby wave-farm installations, based on multiple input information from the converters (including performance and installation depth), wave climate, resource availability and sustainability, area accessibility, restricted areas, power grid locations, population density, and energy demand, alongside local geographic features including touristic areas. Different spatial-resolution models along the Southeast Australian shelves, and thirty converters showed a high spatial-variation of the pairs nearshore. Devices with high maximum rated power are often, but not necessarily, the best for a given zone. Moreover, this Process is completed by the Energy Demand-Response Index that enables the division and ranking of the area into zones regarding the pairs’ energy response to the energy demand at a reference-point such as a grid station. This research also shows that wave direction can significantly impact energy-production estimations. This Process can be applied to other zones worldwide and has the flexibility to include features that may not have been covered here. © 2021","Australia Eastern coast; Decision-making process (DMP); Energy demand-response index (EDRI); Marine renewable energy (MRE); Site selection; Wave energy converter (WEC); Wave energy farm (WEF); WEC selection; WEC Selection-guideline (WEC SG); WEC-Location pairing (WLP)","Beaches; Decision making; Electric power transmission networks; Energy harvesting; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Location; Population statistics; Site selection; Australia eastern coast; Decision-making process; Energy demand-response index; Marine renewable energy; Wave energy converter; Wave energy converter selection; Wave energy converter selection-guideline; Wave energy converter-location pairing; Wave energy converters; Wave energy farm; Wave energy conversion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107916812

This paper focuses on analysing good practice examples on energy renovations at district scale. The paper adapts a qualitative research methodology in four phases, including the multi-perspective analysis of nine exemplary renovation projects in six European countries, including identification of drivers and barriers of different stakeholders. It is found that the drivers for a district renovation are not restricted to energy savings, but typically also include improving the overall quality of life as well as the image and economic value of a district. Moreover, the need for financial models that can alleviate split-incentive problems between investors and resident organizations is identified. Barriers for carrying out a district renovation include that there is a need to comply with energy standards, that the renovation scope had to be limited to avoid a noticeable rent increase and that resettling of tenants during the renovation is often not possible. Lessons learned include that good communication amongst the different stakeholders, especially with residents, plays a key role for the success of the project. Furthermore, a strong leadership is needed to coordinate activities due to the great number of stakeholders. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Balancing energy efficiency and renewable energy; Building renovation; Case studies; Cost-effective renovation; District level","Balancing; Energy efficiency; Image enhancement; Intelligent buildings; Renewable energy resources; Zero energy buildings; Balancing energy efficiency and renewable energy; Building renovation; Case-studies; CO$-2$/ emission; Cost-effective renovation; District level; Economy of scale; Energy; Good practices; Renewable energy source; Cost effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107864826

This energy can be exploited through open and closed shallow geothermal systems (SGS), and their performances greatly depend on the ground/groundwater temperature, which can be affected by both natural and anthropogenic phenomena. The present study proposes an approach to characterize aquifers affected by high SGS exploitation (not simulated in this work). Characterization of the potential hydro/thermogeological natural state is necessary to understand the regional flow and heat transport, and to identify local thermal anomalies. Passive microseismic and groundwater monitoring were used to assess the shape and thermal status of the aquifer; numerical modeling in both steady-state and transient conditions allowed understanding of the flow and heat transport patterns. Two significant thermal anomalies were detected in a fluvio-glacial aquifer in southern Switzerland, one created by river water exfiltration and one of anthropogenic nature. A favorable time lag of 110 days between river and groundwater temperature and an urban hot plume produced by underground structures were observed. These thermal anomalies greatly affect the local thermal status of the aquifer and consequently the design and efficiency of current and future SGS. Results show that the correct characterization of the natural thermo-hydrogeological status of an aquifer is a fundamental basis for determining the impact of boundary conditions and to provide initial conditions required to perform reliable local thermal sustainability assessments, especially where high SGS exploitation occurs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Numerical modelling; Potential natural state; Shallow geothermal systems; Switzerland; Thermal conditions","aquifer; exploitation; geothermal energy; heat flow; hydrogeology; numerical model; pump; seismicity; steady-state equilibrium; temperature anomaly; urban area; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107860495

However, the growing concerns over the environmental impacts and carbon footprints of cement production have inspired the waste managers and policymakers to develop and support more sustainable binders for S/S. The present study aims at exploring the potential of waste-derived geopolymers to be used in the treatment of hazardous wastes generated from industrial operations using S/S technology with a special focus on Indian waste management scenario. The present study presents a literature review on the use of certain kinds of industrial waste as the so-called “green binders” by combining sodium silicate and alkalis such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide by the process of geopolymerization. Such green binders are typically fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), rice husk ash, kaolin and metakaolin, which has better environmental acceptance and considered as more sustainable when compared with convention binders. The binder materials can potentially be used as an alternative to cement, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in cement production and reduce the energy requirement in the cement industry (minimization of carbon footprints). Additionally, the ashes produced from the coal-fired thermal power plant and other industries should be put to gainful use, and thereby, costs for treatment and disposal of waste can be minimized. Various studies have been reported in the literature that fly ash-based geopolymers can be effectively employed to immobilize heavy metals in industrial sludges and incinerator ashes containing Pb, Ni, Zn Mn, and Cr, because geopolymers create chemical bonds, thereby causes physical encapsulation. It is hoped that this green binder would minimize not only the environmental burden of fly ash generated from the thermal power plants in India but also produce the so-called refuse-derived green construction products. Reportedly, out of the total of 9.44 million tonnes of hazardous waste generated per year in India, nearly 38% is landfillable waste. The landfillable waste needs to be treated before its final disposal into the secured landfills to immobilize the hazardous contaminants and remove the moisture. For this purpose, according to the estimates made in this study, nearly 897,000 tonnes of cement is needed for S/S of hazardous waste which can be saved by replacing it with sustainable binders called geopolymers. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Fly ash; Geopolymers; Hazardous waste; Solidification and stabilization; Treatment","Binders; Blast furnaces; Bond strength (chemical); Carbon footprint; Cements; Coal ash; Coal industry; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Geopolymers; Green manufacturing; Greenhouse gases; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Heavy metals; Industrial waste treatment; Inorganic polymers; Potassium hydroxide; Silicates; Slags; Sodium hydroxide; Solidification; Sustainable development; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste disposal; Best demonstrated available technologies; Coal fired thermal power plants; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Hazardous contaminants; Industrial operations; Solidification/stabilization; Treatment and disposal; United States environmental protection agency; Cement industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107811622

International efforts to address these challenges include the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda. Further, some countries are refocusing their ocean programs to align with blue economy strategies globally. We look to Canada, an ocean nation developing a blue economy strategy, to examine the climate-responsiveness of their oceans policies. First, we identify climate change impacts on ecosystem services affecting each of Canada's coasts through a document scan. Then, through a structured policy analysis, we examine whether Canadian fisheries and oceans policy are responsive to these impacts. Finally, we discuss how current policies do or do not address climate impacts on oceans and coasts in Canada, and how this focus, or lack thereof, will have an outsized impact on certain ocean sectors (e.g., inshore fisheries). Our findings show a policy landscape largely dependent on climate change action promoted in a few broad federal initiatives, with oceans-related climate action operating through area-based conservation measures and research and monitoring initiatives. We conclude with recommendations for Canada and similar ocean states to integrate climate and ocean policies across federal departments and ocean sectors by centering vulnerable coastal users in policy formulation. Given Canada's rapid development of a blue economy strategy as a new governing framework for oceans policy, we recommend the strategy be guided by long-term sustainability goals that prioritize environmental and social sustainability over short-term economic growth. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blue economy; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Policy integration","climate change; economic growth; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental management; fishery policy; marine policy; policy analysis; policy approach; policy implementation; strategic approach; sustainable development; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107804997

The production process of bricks is not environment-friendly. In this study, the potential of waste induction furnace slag (IFS) as a replacement of brick aggregate was investigated. The effects of replacing crushed brick aggregate by IFS aggregate on properties of concrete were studied, for varying mix design parameters including W/C ratio (0.45 and 0.50), cement content (340, 375, and 400 kg/m3), and fine aggregate to total aggregate volume ratio (0.40, 0.44, and 0.48). Concrete mechanical properties were assessed using conventional means and ultrasonic pulse velocity through concrete was measured. Aggregate-matrix interfaces were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results indicate that any replacement of brick aggregate by IFS enhances concrete mechanical performance and workability compared to 100% brick aggregate concrete, while the best mechanical performance is achieved at 50% replacement. Relationships between different hardened-state properties of concrete have been proposed for 0%, 50%, and 100% replacements. A 35% reduction in the CO2 footprint of concrete can be achieved by fully replacing brick aggregate with IFS, with at least a 30% reduction in cost. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Brick aggregate; CO2 footprint; Induction furnace slag; Ultrasonic pulse velocity; Waste","Brick; Concrete aggregates; Concrete products; Electric furnaces; Induction heating; Scanning electron microscopy; Slags; Coarse aggregates; Concrete mechanical property; Environment friendly; Mechanical performance; Production process; Properties of concretes; Sustainable concretes; Ultrasonic pulse velocity; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107802165

Understanding the thermal behaviour of different urban surface parameters (USPs) at large spatial scales is essential for strategic heat mitigation. This study evaluates USPs from several perspectives to assess their comparative effectiveness as heat mitigation strategies. The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) is used to simulate the urban climate of Melbourne for summer 2019 – Australia's warmest year. Fifty-two simulations are tested to represent changes in USPs as in vegetation type, built-cover ratio, building height, green roofs and cool roofs. The results of each simulation are compared with the baseline in terms of heat indices. Roofs with high albedos are found to be the best heat mitigation for reducing daytime temperatures (0.85 albedo; −1.29 °C) while green roofs show the best nighttime efficacy (100 %, −1.15 °C). Vegetation ratio, green and cool roofs show near-linear negative relationships with heat. Cooling is found to be more effective with trees when distributed in both canyon and urban parks than only planted in street canyon. These findings underscore the significance of USP characteristics in heat mitigation that can inform strategic urban planning with spatial arrangements of green infrastructure. © 2021","Albedo; Effectiveness; Heat indices; Surface parameters; TAPM-UCLEM; Urban vegetation","Climate models; Roofs; Solar radiation; Albedo; Cool roofs; Effectiveness; Green roof; Heat indices; Mitigation strategy; Surface parameter; The air pollution model-UCLEM; Urban surfaces; Urban vegetation; Vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107801947

In this research, the main parts of the Allam cycle, including the combustion chamber, air separation unit, heat exchanger and cooling tower, have been simulated in Thermoflow software. This cycle is based on combustion using pure oxygen instead of ambient air and the working fluid of this cycle is carbon dioxide. According to the results of the validation part of the initial simulation, the efficiency of the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle with three cooling stages in the compression part (in non-optimal and initial state) is 54%, which is approximately 4% of the cycle efficiency. By reducing the inlet fluid pressure to the pump from 75.38 to 73.43 bar, the cycle efficiency increases from 53.9 to 54. According to the second part of the results, which shows the effect of combustion chamber temperature (in the range of 800–1300 °C) on cycle performance, by increasing the combustion chamber temperature from 800 to 1200 °C, the cycle efficiency increases from 44.61 to 61.38. Also, the highest efficiency of the Brayton cycle is obtained in the pressure ratio of 20, which is approximately equal to 38% for the cycle with real specifications, while the highest efficiency is obtained in the Allam cycle with a pressure ratio of 10, which is about 55%. Therefore, in addition to being able to absorb 100% of carbon dioxide, the Allam cycle has a much higher efficiency than the Brayton cycle. © 2021, Islamic Azad University.","Brayton cycle; Carbon dioxide; Gas turbine; Pressure ratio; The Allam cycle","Air; Brayton cycle; Combustion chambers; Efficiency; Supercritical fluid extraction; Working fluids; Air separation unit; Chamber temperature; Cycle efficiency; Cycle performance; Fluid pressures; Higher efficiency; Reducing emissions; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107787662

Here, we developed a theoretical ecosystem carbon cycle model combined with forest inventory data and measurements to evaluate pluriannual typhoon response of East Monsoon subtropical forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics in Tiantong mountain (29°48′N, 121°47′E). We focused on the relationships between typhoon regime and ecosystem carbon storage dynamics, and forest resistance and resilience to typhoon disturbances. We showed that the disturbed plant biomass contributed to the reduced forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity. The modeling analyses underscored the critical role of biomass turnover time in forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity. The soil organic matter was highly stable under severe typhoons while the resistance of biomass and litter carbon amounts to increasingly severe typhoons decreased.

Although railway vehicles are typically the most eco-friendly transportation system, since commonly their primary energy source is electricity, they can still gain benefits from hybrid technologies, as many lines worldwide are not electrified. In fact, hybrid solutions allow ICE-powered (internal combustion engine) railway vehicles, such as diesel multiple units (DMUs), to operate in full-electric mode even when the track lacks electrification. The possibility to switch to full electric mode is of paramount importance when the vehicle runs on urban or underground track sections, where low or zero emission levels are required. We conduct the feasibility study of hybridization of an existing DMU vehicle, designed by Blue Engineering S.r.l., running on the Aosta–Torino Italian railway line, which includes a non-electrified urban track section and an electrified underground section. The hybridization is obtained by replacing one of the diesel generators installed on the original vehicle with a battery pack, which ensures the vehicle to operate in full-electric mode to complete its mission profile. The hybridization is also exploited to implement a regenerative braking strategy, which allows an increase in the energetical efficiency of the vehicle up to 18%. This work shows the sizing of the battery pack based on dynamic simulations performed on the Turin underground track section, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the hybridization process. © 2021, The Author(s).","Diesel multiple unit; Energy saving; Hybrid railway vehicle; Lithium battery; Regenerative braking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107774093

However, abiotic and biotic mechanisms are involved in stabilization (e.g., by adsorption and/or co-precipitation) and decomposition (e.g., by shifting the microbial community) of paddy soil rich in iron oxides remains poorly understood. We examined the mineralization and stabilization of maize-straw-derived C (δ13C = 5000‰), soil priming effects (PE), and soil microbial community structure in four paddy soils, along with Fe oxide concentrations gradient ranging from 13.7 to 55.8 g kg−1 soil (Fe-13, Fe-25, Fe-42, and Fe-55). The paddy soil with the highest Fe content (Fe-55) stabilized 20.5 mg 13C kg−1 soil of the maize-straw-derived C, being significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than Fe-13 (5 mg 13C kg−1 soil). The high C:Fe molar ratio of Fe-55 suggests the main pathway of stabilizing the maize-straw-derived C via co-precipitation as Fe-OM. Larger stabilization in Fe-55 led to less CO2 emission from maize and SOM, e.g., Fe-55 had 12–16% lower straw mineralization and 8–11% lower PE than Fe-13 during the first 7 days of incubation. Random forest analysis further revealed that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria (the keystone species, i.e., Gaiella) gave the largest contribution to maize-straw mineralization and PE, while microbial diversity and some microorganisms featured with filamentous hyphae contributed to C stabilization. This study confirmed that the concentration of Fe oxide in paddy soils plays a central role in C sequestration via biotic and abiotic processes, including i) modulation of microbial community diversity and composition, especially the abundance of fungi and Actinobacteria, and ii) physicochemical stabilization of maize-straw-derived C through the formation of Fe-OM complexes via co-precipitation. © 2021","13C labeled Straw; C accumulation; Co-occurrence network; Fe-OM complexes; Microbial community; O2PLS analysis; Priming effects","Complex networks; Coprecipitation; Decision trees; Iron oxides; Microorganisms; Mineralogy; Molar ratio; Organic carbon; Stabilization; 13C labeled straw; C accumulation; Co-occurrence networks; Fe-OM complex; Maize straw; Microbial communities; Mineralisation; O2PLS analyse; Paddy soils; Priming effects; Soils; abiotic factor; agricultural soil; biotic factor; community structure; iron oxide; microbial community; mineralization; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil stabilization; Actinobacteria; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107765503

Although climate scientists would like to be as precise as possible, policymakers with different attitudes towards climate change will always choose the result that matches their own value judgments. This paper discusses the impact of climate change attitudes on optimal mitigation in 15 regions. The climate change attitude is refined by a meta-analysis of 27 climate damage estimations and distilled into five damage functions. The optimal mitigation is calculated using the non-cooperative scenario of the regional integrated model of climate economy (RICE). The results show that the optimal mitigation paths in developing countries are more sensitive to climate change attitudes than they are in developed countries. In 2100, the range of optimal emissions represents 20% of the average optimal emissions by developing countries, which is twice the value of average optimal emissions by developed countries. The average social carbon cost in developing countries is 20 times higher than that in developed countries. This large uncertainty may be the combined result of high shadow prices of capital and large quantities of future emissions in these developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate damage; IAMs; Impact assessment; Political attitudes","Climate models; Damage detection; Developing countries; Economics; Risk assessment; Climate damage; Climate scientists; Developed countries; Divergents; IAM; Impact assessments; Mitigation strategy; Optimal mitigation; Political attitude; Risk valuation; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107754116

We estimated the multi-year isoprenoid emissions from natural vegetation in Shandong Province at a spatial resolution of 4 km × 4 km using the MEGAN2.1 model. A new vegetation classification with 23 plant species/types was developed, and emission factors were determined based on the most detailed and localized investigation and statistics. Isoprene, monoterpene, and sesquiterpene emissions in 2018 were 325.6, 18.2, and 7.9 Gg (mass of carbon), respectively. β-Pinene, α-pinene, ocimene, farnescene, and caryophyllene were the dominant monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Broadleaf trees contributed the most to total emissions, particularly poplar, which had the highest emission rates. Wheat also had higher emissions owing to its large coverage. Isoprenoid emissions displayed an inverted “U” pattern when plotted against the months and peaked in summer. Emissions were concentrated in the western and southeastern areas with emission intensities of >10 ton/grid, including Dezhou, Liaocheng, and Rizhao cities. During 1981–2018, isoprenoid emissions experienced a rapid increase from 12.0 to 351.7 Gg, at a rate of 11.20 Gg/yr. Isoprene had the highest enhancement rate of 10.72 Gg/yr. The most rapid increase was observed in the northwestern cities Dezhou and Liaocheng, and the southeastern cities Rizhao, at an average rate of >100 kg/yr, even >500 kg/yr in some areas.

These results would enable the improvement of the ventilation system, thereby decreasing the health risks of the occupants. The ventilation flow fields are studied through numerical results which are validated with experimental Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements in a reduced-scale mock-up. The equivalence between the reduced scale experimental and the full-scale numerical results is obtained through a Reynolds-number based similitude criteria. This enabled the authors to validate the isothermal airflow in the full-scale numerical model with the experimental results of the water flow in the reduced-scale mock-up. Normalized numerical and experimental velocity profiles have been superposed and were found to be in good agreement. Both numerical and experimental models highlight a stagnation region in the centre of the CQ volume leading to a ventilation deficit of the astronaut's breathing zone. The results indicate that this stagnant region is a reason for the excess CO2 accumulation in the CQ, despite the high ventilation rate (&gt;45 hourly air exchanges). To the author's best knowledge this is the first numerical study of the CQ ventilation system validated with reduced-scale experimental modelling. The paper's findings have implications in building air quality studies, suggesting that targeted ventilation is preferable to raw increased in flow rates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Fan operating curve; ISS ventilation; PIV measurements; Similitude study","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Flow of water; Health risks; Reynolds number; Space stations; Ventilation; Fan operating curve; International space station ventilation; International Space stations; Mock up; Numerical and experimental study; Numerical results; Particle image velocimetry measurement; Reduced scale; Similitude study; Ventilation systems; Velocity measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107707943

In an exploratory study conducted with German farmers, we examine the adoption-decision process for a comprehensive farm sustainability management standard. The standard is rooted in scientific assessment systems and aims to achieve higher levels of sustainability in all farm production processes. Despite the growing political interest and increasing consumer demand for sustainable food, no such sustainability standard has as yet become established in Germany. Using a Delphi process, we analysed the main hindrances to its wider acceptance. Linking our results to the pre-decision stages of Rogers' innovation-decision model, we find that there is both a lack of any relative advantage of a sustainability standard and a lack of communication of the benefits, such as optimised processes and possible economic improvements. We also analysed both the importance and the optimal configuration of the various elements that make up the standard. Besides the obvious desire for higher product prices, the data basis underlying the sustainability assessment is identified as the most important factor of an optimised standard. Technical user support is another aspect of great concern to the farmers questioned, whereas the threshold values for farming regulation given in the standard appear to be of less significance to them. According to those surveyed, a standard would need to display a high level of compatibility with existing farm management practices, it must not be too complex, and it would need to promote its advantages so as to overcome its lack of trialability. Agricultural sustainability management could play a role in achieving the national emission and biodiversity targets of European member states, but only if they are accepted by a majority of practitioners. However, current German management standards need to undergo further development if they are to meet the needs of practitioners. Our findings can help all member states to structure their agricultural policies and promote the use of farm sustainability management. Further research should aim to improve standards and tools of agricultural sustainability management and render them compatible with EU funding policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Delphi study; Expectation and acceptance; Farm sustainability standard; Innovation-decision process; Process improvement; Standard design elements","Common Agricultural Policy; decision analysis; Delphi analysis; European Union; farmers attitude; innovation; preference behavior; sustainability; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107707765

Considering the spatial interactions between county scale and prefectural scale divisions and spatial spillover effects, this study employed a hierarchical spatial autoregressive model to investigate the impact of land urbanization on CO2 emissions in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) during 1995–2015. The results showed that CO2 emissions exhibited spatial clustering across the counties and prefectural cities in the YRD region. The prefectural cities with the High-High type were mainly concentrated in Shanghai, Suzhou and Nantong during 1995–2015, indicating that they were the main areas that required CO2 emissions reduction. Land urbanization has a positive effect on CO2 emissions; there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between land urbanization and CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions presented spatiotemporal variations between the county and prefectural scales in the YRD region. The spatial interactions between county scale and prefectural scale suggest that local governments should integrate their neighboring governments (higher and lower governments) to reduce CO2 emissions in the YRD. The population, GDP per capita, carbon intensity, and spatial factor also played a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions.

The International Maritime Organization predicts that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation will be increasing significantly until 2050, driven by the growth in global maritime trade. Managing logistics distribution routes is considered a possible approach for controlling GHG emissions. This study aims to implement a green logistics concept in the logistics distribution of petroleum products—gasoline, kerosene, and diesel—in eastern Indonesia, whose supply sources are refineries located in Balikpapan and Kasim. A multi-objective approach is used to implement the green logistics concept. Multi-objective optimization is conducted using the AIMMS software to optimize a logistics system consisting of a multi-depot, multi-product, and heterogeneous fleet. The optimization is performed to determine the best logistics route and the amount of products delivered using certain types of fleets to minimize transportation cost and GHG emissions using constant speed. In addition, this study also investigates the effect of variable speed on cost and CO2 emissions. For the constant speed case, the distribution routes obtained for the minimizing cost scenario tends to maximize the utilization of transit terminals while in the minimizing emissions scenario tends to deliver directly to the distribution centers, so the route decision in multi-objective optimization scenario is combination of the two. The multi-objective optimization results an 11% cost reduction and a 17% GHG emission reduction compared with the current values. The comparison between constant and variable speed reveals that the variable speed is preferred to constant speed as it gives lower emissions with slight changes in cost. © 2021 The Authors","GHG emissions; Green logistic; Optimization; Petroleum product; Transportation cost",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107697184

With economy and population growth, the rapid expansion of human activities at these high-altitude regions is expected. However, the research on diesel engine combustion and emissions under low intake pressure conditions are limited, especially when alcohol-diesel mixtures are used as fuel. In this work, the combustion and emission characteristics of a common-rail diesel engine fueled with diesel, butanol-diesel and hexanol-diesel mixtures under low intake pressure conditions were investigated. Mixtures were prepared with two blend ratios, which were 20% and 40% by volume. Experiments were conducted under five different intake pressures (1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 atm) and two engine loads (0.45 MPa and 0.55 MPa IMEP). The combustion characteristics and engine performance were analyzed using measurements of in-cylinder pressure, HRR, ignition delay, combustion duration, ISFC and ITE. NOx, soot, CO, and HC emissions under different operating conditions were also measured and discussed. Results revealed lower intake pressure led to higher ISFC and lower ITE. Soot and CO emissions increased significantly once intake pressure dropped below 0.8 atm, while NOx emissions decreased with intake pressure reduction. Under the same conditions, adding renewable alcohol extended the ignition delay and reduced the combustion duration. These effects were more pronounced for combustion of butanol-diesel mixtures than combustion of hexanol-diesel mixtures. Combustion of hexanol-diesel mixture with 20% blend ratio (H20) had similar or lower ISFC and higher ITE than diesel combustion when intake pressure was lower than 1 atm due to its fuel oxygen content and similar fuel properties as diesel. The engine fueled with H20 could still operate under intake pressure of 0.6 atm and engine load of 0.45 MPa IMEP, but the engine misfired when other fuels were used. In terms of emission characteristics, adding alcohol significantly reduced soot and CO emissions, especially when intake pressure was below 1 atm. However, combustion of alcohol-diesel mixtures produced more NOx emissions than diesel combustion under the same conditions. © 2021","Butanol; Combustion; Diesel; Emission; Hexanol; Low intake pressure","Butenes; Diesel engines; Ignition; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Population statistics; Sea level; Soot; CO emissions; Combustion characteristics; Emission; Emission characteristics; Hexanol; Intake pressure; Low intake pressure; NOx emissions; Pressure conditions; Soot emissions; Alcohols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107694999

Major and trace element analyses reveal that the host granite is defined by high silica (SiO2 = 71.56 to 75.25%) and alkali (Na2O + K2O = 6.91 to 7.88%) contents and has typical I-type characteristics. Zircons derived from the pluton yield U–Pb ages of 133.2 ± 1.1 Ma, indicating an early Cretaceous magmatic event in the EQMB. The εHf (t) values and TDM2 ages range from − 15.1 to − 11.2 and from 2.1 to 1.9 Ga, respectively, suggesting that the granite mainly originated from the lower crust melting with the involvement of mantle components. The mineralization process can be divided into three stages: (1) quartz + K-feldspar + pyrite + molybdenite; (2) quartz + pyrite + molybdenite; and (3) quartz + calcite veins. Three different types of fluid inclusions (FIs) are present in quartz veins: NaCl–H2O (W-type), CO2–H2O (C-type), and daughter mineral-bearing (S-type). Hematite is recognized as a daughter mineral in S-type inclusions of stage 1, whereas the daughter sulfide and reducing CH4 gases can be observed in the stage 2 quartz, suggesting that the ore-forming fluids were initially oxidizing and then evolved to more reducing conditions. The FIs in stages 1 mainly display Th above 428 °C with salinities up to 57.62 wt% NaCl eqv; in stage 2, the FIs display Th of 132–423 °C and salinities of 3.23–50.03 wt% NaCl eqv; in stage 3, the FIs homogenized in the range of 117–247 °C with low salinities of 2.74–8.95 wt% NaCl eqv. The coexisting W-, S- and/or C-type inclusions homogenized at similar temperatures, but contain different salinities during stages 1 and 2, suggesting that the fluids boiled during both stages. Our study reveals that the ore-forming fluids are magmatic in origin. These high-temperature magmatic fluids gradually evolved from high salinities and high CO2 contents to a mixture of magmatic and meteoric water with lower temperature, lower salinity, and lower CO2 content. The precipitation of Mo mainly resulted from the decreasing temperature and salinity. Additionally, the changes in pH and CO2 content due to boiling and the water–rock reaction could have contributed toward the precipitation of Mo. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Fluid inclusions; H–O isotopes; Precipitation of Mo; Shiyaogou Mo deposit; Zircon Lu–Hf isotopes","Calcite; Deposits; Feldspar; Geochronology; Granite; Hematite; Mineralogy; Molybdenum; Molybdenum compounds; Molybdenum deposits; Pyrites; Quartz; Sodium chloride; Sulfur compounds; Trace elements; Zircon; Daughter mineral; East qinling; Fluid inclusion; H–O isotope; Low salinity; Metallogenic belt; Ore-forming fluid; Precipitation of mo; Shiyaogou mo deposit; Zircon lu–hf isotope; Isotopes; fluid inclusion; geochemistry; geochronology; granite; isotopic composition; mineralization; molybdenum; ore deposit; ore-forming fluid; petrogenesis; porphyry; precipitation (chemistry); uranium-lead dating; China; Henan; Luanchuan; Qinling Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107688265

The recently published Life-LCA method adapts life cycle assessment to analyse human beings and quantifies their impacts. This method is applied for the first time in this case study to provide insights and remaining challenges. Methods: The environmental impacts caused by the life cycle of a middle-aged German man (“Dirk”) were determined by the Life-LCA method from his birth until his current age (0–49 years). To determine and quantify reduction options, a current 1-year period was analysed in detail by a baseline scenario of his current consumption and an optimized scenario after changing his consumption patterns. The environmental impact assessment included global warming (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), and photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCP). Results and discussion: Dirk has emitted 1,140 t CO2-eq., 4.48 t SO2-eq., 1.69 t PO4-eq., and 0.537 t C2H4-eq. emissions over his current lifetime. Transportation dominated all considered impact categories (40 up to 55%). Energy and water consumption is the second most significant product category for GWP (39%). Food products, with 10%, are the third biggest contributor to GWP, but contribute rather significantly to the impact categories AP (34%), EP (42%), and POCP (20%). The optimized scenario analysis revealed significant reductions for all studied impacts in the range of 60–65%. CO2-eq. emissions were reduced from 28 to 10 t/a. The remaining challenges include data collection for childhood, gaps and inconsistencies of existing data for consumer goods, the allocation between product users, and depreciation of long-living products. Conclusion: The first Life-LCA case study confirmed the applicability of the Life-LCA method. It showed that the Life-LCA approach allows for tracking individual consumption patterns of a human being. The impacts of behavioural changes were quantified, and significant reduction potentials of the environmental impacts were revealed. Additional case studies on people of different age, region, culture, and lifestyle are needed for further insights and methodological refinements. © 2021, The Author(s).","Environmental awareness; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life-LCA; Personal environmental footprint; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable lifestyles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107687517

The biogeography of soil fungi has attracted much attention in recent years; however, the seasonal patterns of soil fungal community structure and diversity along altitudinal gradients under the unique climatic conditions at high latitudes remain unclear, which limits our insight into soil microbial interactions and the mechanisms of community assembly. In this study, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in soil fungal communities along an altitudinal gradient (from 750 m to 1420 m) on Oakley Mountain in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. Altitude had significant impacts on the relative abundances of the dominant phyla and classes of soil fungi, and the interaction of altitude and season significantly affected the relative abundances of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The number of soil fungal taxa and Faith's phylogenetic diversity index tended to monotonically decline with increasing elevation. Soil moisture, soil temperature and pH were the main factors affecting fungal community structure in May, July and September, respectively. The soil dissolved organic carbon content significantly shaped the soil fungal community composition along the altitudinal gradient throughout the growing season. Compared to that in May and July, the soil fungal network in September had more nodes and links, a higher average degree and a higher average clustering coefficient. The nine module nodes in the co-occurrence network were all Ascomycota taxa, and the identities of the keystone taxa of soil fungi in the network showed obvious seasonality. Our results demonstrated that altitude has stronger effects than season on soil fungal community structure and diversity at high latitudes. In addition, the co-occurrence network of soil fungi exhibited obvious seasonal succession, which indicated that the keystone taxa of soil fungi exhibit niche differentiation among seasons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Altitude; Co-occurrence network; Cold temperate zone; Fungal biogeography; Illumina MiSeq sequencing; Season","altitude; community composition; community structure; diversity index; fungus; seasonal variation; soil microorganism; soil temperature; species diversity; species occurrence; temperate environment; Da Hinggan Mountains; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107681729

Due to the growing political and social drive to address its impacts, monitoring and mitigating climate change is a priority in marine policy in the UK. Cetaceans have been proposed as informative sentinel species for monitoring ocean health. Here, strandings data from four UK cetacean species were assessed for their use as a tool to aid policy makers monitoring climate change in marine environments. Data on stranded cetaceans were collected from 1990 to 2018 and differences in the proportions of stranded cold water adapted and warm water adapted species assessed using Generalised Linear Models (GLM), with 6-year periods and four regions of the UK included as explanatory variables. This modelling approach showed an increase in the proportion of stranded warm water adapted species over time across the UK and that differences in proportion of strandings between cold water and warm water adapted species can be detected between regions and 6-year periods, chosen as metrics to coordinate with reporting cycles for policy assessment needs. As such, these results show the potential for utilising strandings data to identify changing oceanic trends at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales for policy reporting in the UK. However, development of these analyses with a more detailed examination of these data at a finer resolution, incorporating other data sources, such as distribution trends and dietary stable isotope data, may be required before it is applicable as an indicator for trends in changes in climate. © 2021","Cetacean; Climate change; Indicators; Monitoring; Policy; Stranding","bioindicator; cetacean; climate change; cold water; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; marine environment; marine policy; warm water; United Kingdom; Cetacea; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107678000

The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the uptake of certain environmental CAP funds and to describe the factors behind the spatial differentiation of the uptake of these funds. Both natural and non-natural conditions are taken into account. The analysis is conducted for Poland, a country engaged in reform of the agricultural economy, which has sizeable areas of habitats of high value for nature and which represents a region of Europe in need of special public support for environmental improvement. The research procedure consisted of the following four main stages: (1) spatial delimitation of grasslands (taking into account their territorial rank and quality) and (2) the level of utilisation of funds under specific Agri-Environmental and Climate Schemes (AECSs), (3) determining the relationships – types and (4) identifying the causes of disproportions, taking into account selected non-natural conditions. Apart from indicator methods, use is made of spatial typology and spatial autocorrelation methods (global and local Moran I coefficients). The results of the analysis show the decisive influence of natural and environmental conditions on the amount of funds expended through AECSs. However, the study has also identified situations where non-natural factors come to the fore. Among the non-natural conditions, a key role is played by historical factors. The study has identified areas with untapped environmental potential and those where environmental farming measures are underutilised given the environmental potential of those areas. The situation described is detrimental to the effectiveness of support, which is contrary to CAP principles. The findings are important in the context of monitoring and evaluating the EU's agricultural policies, which should take more account of the characteristics of the individual countries, including their natural regional and local specificities. © 2021","Agri-environment schemes; Environmentally-friendly agriculture; EU financial instruments; Multifunctional development; Valuable natural habitats","agricultural economics; agricultural land; agricultural management; biodiversity; Common Agricultural Policy; environmental conditions; European Union; Poland [Central Europe]; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107677236

However, it was unknown whether there was an association with cancer hospitalizations. Methods: Data on cancer hospitalizations and annual PM2.5 concentrations were collected from 1,814 Brazilian cities during 2002–2015. A difference-in-difference approach with quasi-Poisson regression was applied to examine State-specific associations. The State-specific associations were pooled at a national level using random-effect meta-analyses. PM2.5 attributable burden were estimated for cancer hospitalization admissions, inpatient days and costs. Results: We included 5,102,358 cancer hospitalizations (53.8% female). The mean annual concentration of PM2.5 was 7.0 μg/m3 (standard deviation: 4.0 μg/m3). With each 1 μg/m3 increase in two-year-average (current year and previous one year) concentrations of PM2.5, the relative risks (RR) of hospitalization were 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.07) for all-site cancers from 2002 to 2015 without sex and age differences. We estimated that 33.82% (95%CI: 14.97% to 47.84%) of total cancer hospitalizations could be attributed to PM2.5 exposure in Brazil during the study time. For every 100,000 population, 1,190 (95%CI: 527 to 1,836) cancer hospitalizations, 8,191 (95%CI: 3,627 to 11,587) inpatient days and US$788,775 (95%CI: $349,272 to $1,115,825) cost were attributable to PM2.5 exposure. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 was positively associated with hospitalization for many cancer types in Brazil. Inpatient days and cost would be saved if the annual PM2.5 exposure was reduced. © 2021","Cancer; Cancer burden; Hospitalization; Particulate matter","Hospitals; Random processes; Cancer burden; Confidence interval; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Long term exposure; National level; Particulate Matter; PM$-2.5$; Poisson regression; Random effects; Diseases; cancer; disease incidence; health risk; hospital sector; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; adult; article; Brazil; city; female; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; long term exposure; male; meta analysis; PM2.5 exposure; risk factor; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; Brazil; environmental exposure; hospitalization; neoplasm; particulate matter; Brazil; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Brazil; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107669544

Although assessments increasingly consider the demand for the ecosystem services that UGI provides, they tend to only map the spatial pattern of pressures such as heat, or air pollution, and lack a wider understanding of where the beneficiaries are located and who will benefit most. We assess UGI in five cities from four continents with contrasting climate, socio-political context, and size. For three example services (air pollution removal, heat mitigation, accessible greenspace), we run an assessment that takes into account spatial patterns in the socio-economic demand for ecosystem services and develops metrics that reflect local context, drawing on the principles of vulnerability assessment. Despite similar overall levels of UGI (from 35 to 50% of urban footprint), the amount of service provided differs substantially between cities. Aggregate cooling ranged from 0.44 °C (Leicester) to 0.98 °C (Medellin), while pollution removal ranged from 488 kg PM2.5/yr (Zomba) to 48,400 kg PM2.5/yr (Dhaka). Percentage population with access to nearby greenspace ranged from 82% (Dhaka) to 100% (Zomba). The spatial patterns of pressure, of ecosystem service, and of maximum benefit within a city do not necessarily match, and this has implications for planning optimum locations for UGI in cities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Natural capital; Nature-based solutions (NBS); Urban green and blue space; Urban planning","Air pollution; Economics; Ecosystems; Ecosystem services; Green spaces; Local conditions; Local contexts; Natural capital; Nature-based solution; PM$-2.5$; Pollution removal; Spatial patterns; Urban green and blue space; Urban planning; demand analysis; ecosystem service; greenspace; mapping; spatial variation; urban planning; vulnerability; article; city planning; climate; cooling; drawing; ecosystem; heat; human; human experiment; particulate matter 2.5; Antioquia [Colombia]; Bangladesh; Colombia; Dhaka [Bangladesh]; Dhaka [Dhaka (ADS)]; England; Leicester [England]; Leicester [Leicester (ADS)]; Malawi; Medellin; United Kingdom; Zomba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107667242

Within this context, there has been growing interest in building community resilience to shocks and stressors and as a forward-looking process. Yet while there has been extensive attention to conceptual aspects, there has been much less on how this can be achieved in practice. This research worked with three communities in Scotland (UK) regularly exposed to flooding and other integrated challenges to learn from action about community resilience building. A carefully developed four-tiered transdisciplinary approach was applied that included: relationship-building; enhancing capacities to work with interconnections; enabling processes; and supportive action-oriented research. The findings of the analysis of the system dynamics that were occurring during the resilience-building process highlight that it is a complex and messy social process. Yet, it also shows that if quality and sufficient quantity of support and time to help surface and deliberate on underlying assumptions about communities and change is provided, it can be possible to stimulate emergence of beneficial reinforcing social dynamics that begin to support collaborative and systemic action. To further advance know how about resilience building, much greater focus will be needed on the ‘how’ of resilience. This, in turn, will require new framings of, and approaches for, community resilience and new framings of research, knowledge and knowing. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Action research; Capacity; Community development; Regenerative cultures; Resilience building; Social dynamics; Systems; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107666122

Many of these issues can be addressed via the implementation of local community-based sustainable energy generation technologies such as biomass driven combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The current research investigates the technical, economic, socio-economic, and environmental impacts of implementing biomass driven CHP plants as the primary energy source in both remote (off-grid) and rural (grid-connected) community energy systems that comprise a district heating grid. The MoCreebec Eeyoud community located in Northern Ontario, Canada, is used as the case study in the analysis. Results show that biomass driven CHP grids are an economically attractive alternative for both remote and rural energy systems. Biomass driven CHP grids are shown to be up to 42% less costly than conventional diesel power generation systems in remote community settings. Similarly, remote biomass driven CHP grids are shown to be up to 66% less costly than rural energy systems when electrical transmission grid extension lengths exceed 100 km. Biomass driven CHP grids can also drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower carbon tax payments, generate local economic employment, and increase energy autonomy. Although the findings of this study are specific to the community under investigation, the research methodology and insights gained are generalizable to remote and rural communities located across Canada and abroad. © 2021","Biomass; Biomass gasification; Biomass organic rankine cycle; Combined heat and power; District heating; Remote and rural communities","Cogeneration plants; District heating; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy security; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Rankine cycle; Biomass Gasification; Biomass organic rankine cycle; Combined-Heat and Power; Energy; Energy systems; Heat and power plants; Power grids; Remote communities; Rural community; Rural energy; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107662788

The research on the coordinated development of pollutant and carbon emission reduction in transport industry is helpful to the realization of urban pollutant prevention and carbon emission reduction, especially in big cities. Thus, a multi-period bottom-up vehicle development mathematical model is proposed to analyze the technology development path, emission path and energy structure adjustment path, and the synergistic benefits of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction under a expected air pollution emission standard. Four pollutants, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), generated from the vehicle are considered in this model. Then, the proposed model is used to analyze the related vehicle structure and energy consumption under the expected emission standards for Beijing during 2020 and 2035. The technology development path, emission path and energy structure adjustment path are examined, and the synergistic benefits of CO2 emission reduction are also studied. Some important implication are found as follows: (1) Even with the goal of environmental pollution control only, new energy vehicles will have an explosive growth period, starting from about 2025. (2) Strict air pollution emission policies do not always lead to the rapid development of new energy vehicles before 2025. (3) The four main pollutants show different levels of synergistic effect among which CO on HC and NOx on PM are obvious, respectively. (4) Even under the control of the air pollution policy, the synergistic effect to CO2 emission reduction is also obvious. Compared to the baseline case, the reduction benefit from the MILD and STRICT environmental policies are 30 and 70 million yuan, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution control policy; Bottom-up optimization model; Carbon co-benefit; Urban development plan","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Nitrogen oxides; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Air pollution control policy; Bottom-up optimization model; Carbon co-benefit; Carbon emissions reductions; Development path; Emission energies; Emission path; Emission reduction; Technology development; Urban development plan; Urban growth; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; carbon emission; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution control; source apportionment; traffic emission; transportation system; urban development; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; energy consumption; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental policy; human; motor vehicle; particulate matter; process technology; structure analysis; traffic and transport; urban area; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107648815

Current low-energy building design concepts have decreased energy demand mainly by improving the thermal performance. The Korean government has continuously reinforced thermal performance by region and wall. Multifamily high-rise buildings (MFHRBs), a representative residential building type in Korea, have a powerful air-driving force caused by wind and stack interactions in winter. The weather-driven airflow produces (1) outdoor air infiltration across the envelope and (2) interzonal airflow from household entrance doors adjacent to unconditioned corridors. The two factors should be considered depending on weather conditions and airtightness for main airflow paths (such as envelope and household entrance doors) in the total heating energy demand. Nevertheless, airtightness is still not proposed according to regional weather conditions and airflow paths, as has been done for the exterior thermal performance. This study provides information about how and how much airtightness should be determined for MFHRBs to achieve low-energy buildings or to meet existing or new building energy demand standards. The leakage areas for the household envelope and entrance door are suggested by region in Korea for the different satisfaction levels of the passive-house energy demand standard (15 kWh/m2·year). The suggested leakage areas show the uncertainty of the dwelling airtightness metric (such as ACH50) adopted internationally for the energy demand standard. Moreover, the existing limit (0.6 ACH50) is suitable for southern regions but required to be lower elsewhere, especially in the central regions of Korea. © 2021","Heating energy demand; Infiltration; Leakage area; Multifamily high-rise buildings; Passive house","Architectural design; Energy management; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Housing; Infiltration; Airtightness; Building energy demands; Energy demands; Heating energy; Heating energy demand; Leakage area; Low energy buildings; Multifamily high-rise building; Passive house; Thermal Performance; Tall buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107639624

However, the effect of electric field intensity on microbial community changes and metabolic function prediction during the alleviation of ammonia inhibition are still missing. The results of the current study represented that the improvement of ammonia removal (20.6%) and methane production (14.6%) could both be achieved at 0.2 V while higher voltages led to reductions of methane production (more than 48.9%) compared with the control. Moreover, hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanobacterium) seemed to be more robust to high voltages compared with aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosaeta). Additionally, bacteria for hydrolysis and acidogenesis (Rikenellaceae and Soehngenia) were found vulnerable to external electric field intensity.

The analyzed ECLSS includes an In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) reactor for oxygen resupply and a Regenerative Fuel Cell System (RFCS) as power supply during shadow phases. The co-dependencies and interactions between the ECLSS sub-systems themselves and with the environment are incorporated to achieve a holistic system analysis. We used a fixed ECLSS configuration based on the current NASA plans for a Moon base ECLSS with a fixed function-to-subsystem allocation. The performed trade-offs are then restricted within the design space, to e.g. resize tanks and individual subsystems instead of considering other possible subsystems. We chose this approach because the aim of this paper is to perform an in-depth system analysis of all related subsystems and their interaction with the environment instead of a top-level trade-off. The first step is the selection of a suitable landing site and the dynamic simulation of its lighting conditions over the investigated period of 1 year. We use a slope map with a resolution of 120 m per pixel, a Permanently Shaded Region (PSR) map with a resolution of 240 m per pixel and a digital elevation model with a resolution of 240 m per point, which is interpolated from a source with a resolution of 60 m per pixel and meshed with triangles by the Thermal Moon Simulator (TherMoS) tool in order to calculate illumination values. The requirements chosen for the candidate landing sites are a slope of less than 5° over a diameter of at least 1 km and having both a PSR and a Peak of Light (POL) in less than 10 km distance. We discuss the four most promising candidate sites in this paper and calculate initial energy storage system estimates to select two landing sites for further analysis. We derive a reaction kinetics model for the ilmenite hydrogen reduction ISRU process from literature data and incorporate it into a dynamic model with simulated lighting and thermal conditions to calculate heat losses to the environment and the required electrical energy for its operation. In addition, we use the derived model to analyze and compare different design options of the ISRU reactor with an Equivalent System Mass (ESM) based optimization approach to identify the optimal operating conditions. Using this approach, we found operating temperatures above 1150 K resulted in higher ESM values for the reactor than lower temperatures. For the Moon base, we combine an ISS ECLSS model and the ISRU reactor model. The state-of-the-art urine and water processing technologies achieve recovery rates of up to 98%. Hence, we expect the overall ECLSS including the ISRU reactor to have a water surplus when combined with a Sabatier reactor to process metabolic CO2 from the crew into methane and water. Therefore, the Sabatier reactor combined with an electrolyzer can potentially generate methane and oxygen as fuel for resupply missions. The system can achieve a theoretic fuel production of 4100 kg per year using this approach. Although the dynamic analysis showed that only 2588 kg could be produced per year because of the lean operating conditions of the Sabatier and its efficiency of below 100%. The produced oxygen and methane could reduce operating costs for the base by reducing the required fuel resupply. Based on the power demands of the other subsystems and the available solar power and shadow duration at the selected landing site, we dimensioned the RFCS and estimate the required mass for it to 19,500 kg. Which is less than half the mass required if lithium batteries are used. The overall system requires resupply of approximately 6580 kg per year for a crew of six. The dynamic analysis of the system showed that the initial mostly steady state sizing approach can be optimized and relevant system parameters can be reduced by more than 15%. © 2021 IAA","ECLSS; Human spaceflight; Ilmenite reduction; ISRU; Landing site selection; Life support; LSS; Lunar south pole; Moon base; Thermal moon simulator; TherMoS; V-HAB; Virtual habitat","Digital storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Environmental management; Landing; Lighting; Moon; NASA; Solar power generation; Systems analysis; Environmental control and life support system; Human spaceflights; Ilmenite reduction; In-situ resource utilizations; Landing site selection; Life supports; LSS; Lunar south pole; Thermal moon simulator; V-HAB; Virtual habitat; Reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107626813

These urban risks could significantly influence public culture and might even lead to aggressive driving styles. A practical approach comprising of model estimation and real-world measurements is applied here to discuss the role of urban development and public culture in the driving behavior and vehicle emissions in an unsustainable urbanized city, i.e. Isfahan, Iran. Over 60,000 speed-time data were collected from the streets for several time slices to develop the ISFahan Driving Cycle (ISFDC). ISFDC is assessed against the DCs of foreign countries and other Iranian cities to discuss the contribution of the studied factors to driving behavior. ISFDC is then entered into the IVE model to estimate the exhaust emission factors (EFs) under real-urban conditions, while IVE is primarily adjusted to the real-world experiments. Also, several emission mitigation scenarios that are likely to mitigate vehicular emissions are evaluated. Results show that ISFDC is already unique around the world, but unsustainable urbanization in terms of poor urban development and aggressive actions/reactions plays a vital role in the driving behavior of Iranian drivers. Unsustainable urbanization causes the CO and NOx EFs of Isfahan vehicles to be 40 and 25.47 % higher than those in Tehran, and 60 and 57 % higher than those in Beijing, respectively. Among the studied EFs, CO EF is more affected by the level of urban development. Ammonia, Formaldehydes, and Benzene are consecutively ranked as the major toxic gases in the Isfahan vehicle exhausts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Driving behavior; Onboard experiments; Unsustainable urbanization; Urban development; Vehicle emissions","Ammonia; Vehicles; Driving behaviour; Driving cycle; Emission factors; Isfahan; Onboard experiment; Unsustainable urbanization; Urban development; Urban risk; Vehicle emission; Vehicular emission; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107588019

Regional transport administrators, under pressure by governments to introduce zero-emission buses, require analytical tools for identifying optimal solutions. In literature, few models combine location analysis, least cost planning, and emission assessment, taking into account multiple technologies which might achieve emission reduction goals. In this paper, an existing optimal location model for electric urban transport is adapted to match the needs of regional transport. The model, which aims to evaluate well-to-wheel carbon emissions as well as airborne emissions of NOx and PM10, is applied to a real case study of a regional bus transport service in North Eastern Italy. The optimization has identified electric buses with relatively small (60 kWh) batteries as the best compromise for reducing carbon equivalent emissions; however, under current economic conditions in Italy, the life cycle cost of such vehicles is still much higher than those of Euro VI diesel buses. In this context, our model helps in identifying ways to minimize infrastructure costs and to efficiently allocate expensive resources such as electric buses to the routes where the maximum environmental benefit can be achieved. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bus transport; CNG buses; Electric buses; Extended well-to-wheel analysis; Location analysis; Recharging infrastructure","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Life cycle; Urban transportation; Carbon equivalent emission; Environmental benefits; Infrastructure costs; Least cost planning; Multiple technology; Optimization modeling; Public transport service; Sustainable transport; Bus transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107580002

We comprehensively described air pollution during and after the lockdown periods in 2020 compared with 2018–2019, and estimated the mortality burden indicated by the number of deaths and years of life lost (YLL) related to the air pollution changes. The mean air quality index (AQI), PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO concentrations during the lockdown across China declined by 18.2 (21.2%), 27.0 μg/m3 (28.9%), 10.5 μg/m3 (18.3%), 8.4 μg/m3 (44.2%), 13.1 μg/m3 (38.8%), and 0.3 mg/m3 (27.3%) respectively, when compared to the same periods during 2018–2019. We observed an increase in O3 concentration during the lockdown by 5.5 μg/m3 (10.4%), and a slight decrease after the lockdown by 3.4 μg/m3 (4.4%). As a result, there were 51.3 (95%CI: 32.2, 70.1) thousand fewer premature deaths (16.2 thousand during and 35.1 thousand after the lockdown), and 1066.8 (95%CI: 668.7, 1456.8) thousand fewer YLLs (343.3 thousand during and 723.5 thousand after the lockdown) than these in 2018–2019. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown has caused substantial decreases in air pollutants except for O3, and that substantial human health benefits can be achieved when strict control measures for air pollution are taken to reduce emissions from vehicles and industries. Stricter tailored policy solutions of air pollution are urgently needed in China and other countries, especially in well-developed industrial regions, such as upgrading industry structure and promoting green transportation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollutants; Air quality index; COVID-19 lockdown; Mortality; Years of life lost","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; health impact; maternal mortality; mortality; pollution exposure; spatiotemporal analysis; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental exposure; environmental policy; funding; global disease burden; groups by age; health hazard; human; mortality; mortality rate; national lockdown; population size; risk reduction; air pollution; analysis; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; pandemic; particulate matter; toxicity; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107574724

However, the OER involves a complex four-electron process and suffers from intrinsically sluggish kinetics, which greatly impairs the efficiency of electrochemical systems. In addition, state-of-the-art RuO2-based OER electrocatalysts are too expensive and scarce for practical applications. The development of highly active, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts that can improve OER performance (activity and durability) is of significant importance in realizing the widespread application of these advanced technologies. To date, considerable progress has been made in the development of alternative, noble metal-free OER electrocatalysts. Among these alternative catalysts, transition metal compounds have received particular attention and have shown activities comparable to or even higher than those of their precious metal counterparts. In contrast to many other electrocatalysts, such as carbon-based materials, transition metal compounds often exhibit a surface reconstruction phenomenon that is accompanied by the transformation of valence states during electrochemical OER processes. This surface reconstruction results in changes to the true active sites and an improvement or reduction in OER catalytic performance. Therefore, understanding the self-reconstruction process and precisely identifying the true active sites on electrocatalyst surfaces will help us to finely tune the properties and activities of OER catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent progress made in understanding the surface reconstruction phenomena of various transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts, focusing on uncovering the correlations among structure, surface reconstruction and intrinsic activity. Recent advances in OER electrocatalysts that exhibit a surface self-reconstruction capability are also discussed. We identify possible challenges and perspectives for the development of OER electrocatalysts based on surface reconstruction. We hope this review will provide readers with some guidance on the rational design of catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.

In anoxic environments, nitrogen loss is attributed to autotropic anammox and heterotrophic denitrification, while, the main reduction pathway that recycles NO3− to NH4+ is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia. However, our knowledge of the global nitrogen cycle was limited until the discovery of an alternative anoxic process that involves the use of redox metals as catalysts. For example, the anoxic marine sediments comprise different microbial communities that depend on metal oxides/oxyhydroxides of Fe (FeOx) and Mn (MnOx) for respiration. These alternate pathways comprise anoxic oxidation of NH4+ to NO2−, NO3−, and N2 using FeOx/MnOx as electron acceptors. Interestingly, successive reduction of the produced NO2−and NO3− is linked to re-oxidation of Fe2+/Mn2+ leading to efficient nitrogen removal and replenishing of Fe3+/Mn4+, which provide oxide surfaces (electron acceptors) for continuing cycles of NH4+ oxidation. Thus, this new pathway plays a vital role in the oceanic nitrogen cycle. The biochemical pathways are short-circuited and the requirement of oxygen and organic carbon reduces greatly due to the coupling of Fe/Mn redox cycles with simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. Here, we give a brief review on the nitrogen cycle, prevalent nitrogen removal techniques and recapitulate our current understanding of metal oxide-mediated nitrogen cycle in various ecosystems, the role and mechanism of microbial interactions, and the factors affecting the process. Further, the recent advances in experiments to achieve the application of this process in real wastewater treatment and future research prospects are discussed.

Using long-term data from three experiments in a mesic grassland (ranging from 17 to 34 yr of data), we tested how the effects of species richness and nitrogen addition on community-level plant productivity changed as a function of annual fluctuations in water availability using growing season precipitation and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). While results varied across experiments, our findings demonstrate that water availability can magnify the positive effects of both biodiversity and nitrogen addition on productivity. These results suggest that productivity responses to anthropogenic species diversity loss and increasing nitrogen deposition could depend on precipitation regimes, highlighting the importance of testing interactions between multiple global change drivers. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America","biodiversity–ecosystem-functioning relationship; global change; nitrogen fertilization; nutrient addition; plant biomass; precipitation; species richness; SPEI","biodiversity; evapotranspiration; global change; grassland; growing season; nitrogen; species diversity; species richness; water availability; nitrogen; water; biodiversity; biomass; ecosystem; grassland; Biodiversity; Biomass; Ecosystem; Grassland; Nitrogen; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107487279

Rodents are diverse and important consumers in drylands, regions defined by the scarcity of water that cover 45% of Earth's land surface and face increasingly drier and more variable climates. We analyzed abundance data for 22 rodent species across grassland, shrubland, ecotone, and woodland ecosystems in the southwestern USA. Two time series (1995–2006 and 2004–2013) coincided with phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which influences drought in southwestern North America. Regionally, rodent species diversity declined 20%–35%, with greater losses during the later time period. Abundance also declined regionally, but only during 2004–2013, with losses of 5% of animals captured. During the first time series (wetter climate), plant productivity outranked climate variables as the best regional predictor of rodent abundance for 70% of taxa, whereas during the second period (drier climate), climate best explained variation in abundance for 60% of taxa. Temporal dynamics in diversity and abundance differed spatially among ecosystems, with the largest declines in woodlands and shrublands of central New Mexico and Colorado. Which species were winners or losers under increasing drought and amplified interannual variability in drought depended on ecosystem type and the phase of the PDO. Fewer taxa were significant winners (18%) than losers (30%) under drought, but the identities of winners and losers differed among ecosystems for 70% of taxa. Our results suggest that the sensitivities of rodent species to climate contributed to regional declines in diversity and abundance during 1995–2013. Whether these changes portend future declines in drought-sensitive consumers in the southwestern USA will depend on the climate during the next major PDO cycle. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biodiversity; climate change; Dipodomys; Onychomys; Peromyscus; small mammal; Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index","abundance; biodiversity; climate change; diversity index; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; regional climate; rodent; Colorado; New Mexico; United States; Dipodomys; Mammalia; Onychomys; Peromyscus; Rodentia; animal; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; North America; rodent; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; North America; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107420098

The Maritimes, Central Canada, and the Prairies reference dairy farms averaged 63, 71, 144 mature cows per herd and 135, 95, 255 ha of land, respectively. Using N-CyCLES, a whole-farm linear program model, dairy rations were balanced for (1) MP, based on National Research Council (NRC) requirements (MP_2001); (2) MP plus Lys and Met, based on NRC (AA_2001); (3) MP (MP_Rev); or (4) for His, Lys, and Met (AA_Rev), both based on a revised factorial approach revisiting both supply and requirements of MP and EAA. Energy was balanced to meet requirements based on NRC (2001). Assuming the requirements were met within each approach, it was considered that milk yield and composition were not affected by the type of formulation. Given the assumptions of the study, when compared with MP_2001 formulation, balancing dairy rations using the AA_Rev approach reduced calculated farm N balance by 3.8%, on average from 12.71 to 12.24 g/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk; it also enhanced farm net income by 4.5%, from 19.00 to 19.70 $CAN/100 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk, by reducing inclusion of protein concentrate in dairy rations. Calculated animal N efficiency was on average 4.3% higher with AA_Rev than with MP_2001 for mid-lactation cows. This gain in N efficiency would result in a reduction in N2O emission by manure, contributing to a partial decrease of total greenhouse gas emission by 1.7%, through a reduction of N excreted in manure. With the AA_2001 formulation, farm N balance was 1% higher than with MP_2001 formulation while reducing farm net income by 6.4%, due to the need to purchase rumen-protected AA, with no effect on total greenhouse gas emission. Both MP formulations lead to fairly similar outputs. The AA_Rev formulation also indicated that His might be a co-limiting AA with Met in dairy rations balanced with ingredients usually included in Canadian dairy rations. Given the assumptions of the study, balancing dairy rations for 3 EAA (His, Lys, and Met) rather than MP, has some potential positive effects on Canadian dairy farms by increasing net incomes through a reduction of crude protein supply, leading to a decreased environmental effect. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association","greenhouse gas; linear programing; N balance; whole-farm model","amino acid; milk protein; agricultural land; animal; bovine; Canada; diet; female; lactation; milk; protein intake; Amino Acids; Animals; Canada; Cattle; Diet; Dietary Proteins; Farms; Female; Lactation; Milk; Milk Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107387711

Optic disc edema is a common sign of SANS. The origin and effects of SANS are not understood as signs of SANS have not manifested in previous spaceflight analog studies. In the current spaceflight analog study, 11 subjects underwent 30 days of strict head down-tilt bed rest in elevated ambient carbon dioxide (HDBR+CO2). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we acquired resting-state fMRI data at 6 time points: before (2), during (2), and after (2) the HDBR+CO2 intervention. Five participants developed optic disc edema during the intervention (SANS subgroup) and 6 did not (NoSANS group). This occurrence allowed us to explore whether development of signs of SANS during the spaceflight analog impacted resting-state functional connectivity during HDBR+CO2. In light of previous work identifying genetic and biochemical predictors of SANS, we further assessed whether the SANS and NoSANS subgroups exhibited differential patterns of resting-state functional connectivity prior to the HDBR+CO2 intervention. We found that the SANS and NoSANS subgroups exhibited distinct patterns of resting-state functional connectivity changes during HDBR+CO2 within visual and vestibular-related brain networks. The SANS and NoSANS subgroups also exhibited different resting-state functional connectivity prior to HDBR+CO2 within a visual cortical network and within a large-scale network of brain areas involved in multisensory integration. We further present associations between functional connectivity within the identified networks and previously identified genetic and biochemical predictors of SANS. Subgroup differences in resting-state functional connectivity changes may reflect differential patterns of visual and vestibular reweighting as optic disc edema develops during the spaceflight analog.

The quantitative characterization of VOCs derived from heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) at a high spatiotemporal resolution is an important prerequisite of atmospheric quality management. However, there is little knowledge about VOC emission characteristics and accurate control policies of HDDTs owing to limited fine-grained traffic activity data. To fill this gap, this research aims to construct a link-level and hourly-based VOC emission inventory of HDDTs by combining fine-grained trajectory data, detailed vehicle specification information, localized emission factors, and underlying geographic information. The emission reduction potentials of different emission control scenarios were also evaluated. The research was conducted in Hebei Province, a predominant heavy industrial province in China. The results demonstrated that HDDTs with China 3 and below emission standards contributed to 74.85% of the HDDT generated VOC emissions, although they only accounted for 25.43% of the HDDTs operating on the road networks. The VOC emission characteristics of HDDTs were further explored at various temporal and spatial scales. Temporally, the difference between the maximum and minimum hourly VOC emissions reached 29.19%, and daily emission changes were considerably affected by holidays. Spatially, road segments with higher emission intensities and statistically significant emission hot spots were primarily distributed in intercity highways and national freeways, reflecting the contribution of high freight activity to the VOC emissions. Emission control scenario simulations demonstrated that improving HDDT emission standards can reduce VOC emissions by up to 80.06%. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of VOC emissions from HDDTs and the effectiveness of emission reduction measures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy-duty diesel truck; Scenario analysis; Spatiotemporal pattern; Volatile organic compound emission","volatile organic compound; volatile organic compound; emission control; emission inventory; spatiotemporal analysis; transport vehicle; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; Article; China; data integration; diesel engine; exhaust gas; highway; leisure; motor vehicle; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; motor vehicle; China; Hebei; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107357655

With the panel data of agricultural production of mainland China from 2000 to 2017, this study investigates the role of AGPTs adoption rates in improving low-carbon efficiency by adopting a random-effects panel Tobit model. Results indicate that average adoption rates of AGPTs are less than 20% and unbalanced adoptions vary between the main and non-main grain-producing areas, as well as the northern and southern main grain-producing areas. Furthermore, AGPTs adoption reduces low-carbon efficiency at nationwide and main grain-producing areas. In the northern main grain-producing areas, water-saving irrigation and no-tillage seeding reduce low-carbon efficiency, while mechanized returning straw crushing promotes it. In the southern main grain-producing areas, deep tillage with fertilizer application and no-tillage seeding decrease low-carbon efficiency, while mechanized deep ploughing and scarification increases it. We also find that AGPTs can promote low-carbon efficiency through comprehensive mechanization level and mechanical input density. To improve low-carbon efficiency, we suggest that the improvement and diffusion of applicable AGPTs should be adapted to the local production conditions, and the agricultural machinery service, research and development system should be improved as well. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural mechanization; Carbon emissions; Green production technologies; Regional heterogeneity","carbon; water; carbon; fertilizer; agricultural production; agricultural technology; emission control; green economy; irrigation system; panel data; seeding; straw; technology adoption; agricultural worker; agriculture; Article; China; diffusion; fertilizer application; grain; green chemistry; irrigation (agriculture); no tillage; plowing; food grain; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Edible Grain; Fertilizers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107308917

Nevertheless, it remains an outstanding challenge for numerical urban models to disentangle and quantify the complex interplay between heat and carbon dynamics. In this study, we used a newly developed coupled urban canopy-carbon dynamics model to investigate the environmental co-benefits for mitigating urban heat stress as well as the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. In particular, we evaluated the impact of specific components of urban greening, viz. fraction of the urban lawn, bare soil, tree coverage, and irrigation on heat and carbon fluxes in the built environment. The results of numerical simulations show that the expansion of urban green space, in general, leads to environmental cooling and reduced CO2 emission, albeit the efficacy varies for different vegetation types. In addition, adequate irrigation is essential to effect plant physiological functions for cooling and CO2 uptake, whereas further improvement becomes marginal with excessive irrigation. The findings of this study, along with its implications on environmental management, will help to promote sustainable urban development strategies for achieving desirable environmental co-benefits for urban residents and practitioners. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Environmental co-benefit; Irrigation; Mitigation strategies; Urban greening; Urban vegetation","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; greenspace; heating; urban development; urban ecosystem; air quality; Article; built environment; canopy; carbon dynamics; carbon fixation; carbon footprint; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental temperature; grass; heat stress; landscape; simulation; soil; soil respiration; tree; urban area; urban greening; vegetation; air pollution; carbon cycle; plant; Air Pollution; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107307056

In subtropical climate areas, the performance of bioretention cell under condition of low infiltration underlying soil and heavy storms is still poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the effects of low infiltration underlying soil and precipitation characteristics on the hydraulic performance of a bioretention cell using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The hydraulic performance of a bioretention cell were investigated under a Typical year rainfall event (P(total) (total precipitation) = 1299.2 mm) and seven heavy storms (i.e., Ptotal range from 53.1 mm to 287.3 mm), at different SF(i) (seepage rates of the underlying soil) (i.e., range from 2.5 mm/h to 15 mm/h). Then, sensitivity of the optimal design to the different design parameters, including the hydraulic conductivity of soil medium layer and the berm height of surface layer, was examined. The results show that the increase in SF(i) was effective in increasing the ARVR(i) (annual runoff volume reduction) and RVR(i) (runoff volume reduction), while little effective in increasing PFR(i) (peak flow reduction). Moreover, the ARVR(i) could meet the designed goal of 70% when the SF(i) was more than 7.5 mm/h. For RVR(i), the key variable of precipitation characteristic changes from Ptotal to P4h(max) (maximum precipitation in 4 h) as SF(i) increases, while P4h(max) remains as the key variable for PFR(i) all the time. The sensitivity studies demonstrate that the hydraulic conductivity is more effective in increasing PFR(i) than the berm height. For the bioretention cell under condition of low infiltration underlying soil and heavy storms, in order to simultaneously achieve expected reduction goal of both peak flow and runoff volume, and make the best comprehensive performance of bioretention cell, it requires not only a maintenance action to increase the hydraulic conductivity of soil medium layer, but also a drain pipe to be added in the storage layer, and meanwhile other LID practices should be combined. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bioretention; Peak flow reduction; Runoff volume reduction; Subtropical climate; Underlying soil infiltration","rain; hydraulic conductivity; peak flow; permeability; precipitation (climatology); runoff; subtropical convergence; subtropical region; urban area; Article; bioretention cell; China; climate; climate change; correlation analysis; hydraulic conductivity; precipitation; runoff; soil infiltration; soil water content; storage; storm (weather); Storm Water Management Model; subtropical climate; water flow; city; hydrology; permeability; soil; water flow; China; Porifera; China; Cities; Hydrology; Permeability; Rain; Soil; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107302912

The pandemic is likely to trigger permanent long-term impacts on the transport sector in the post-COVID world. While a post-COVID “new normal” will be likely to incur negative consequences, it may provide an opportunity to move toward a more sustainable transport sector. This paper is aimed at developing an urban economic model with an energy focus to depict the dynamics of travel demand, energy consumption, and emissions in the post-COVID world. A set of scenarios was created according to model assumptions regarding lifestyle changes and policy interventions accompanied by the expected post-COVID new normal, to explore long-term pathways toward a deep decarbonization of the transport sector. Scenario simulations demonstrated that working from home, online shopping, and a bike-friendly infrastructure will contribute to a reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, whereas a significant shift from bus to car transport and the decreasing use of car-sharing services will adversely affect CO2 emission reductions. The arrival of the post-COVID world may contribute to an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2060, while the maximum reduction potential could be as high as 44%. Supporting policies and strategies for encouraging remote work and online shopping as well as for promoting safe public transport, active transport, and carpooling services are needed to strongly decarbonize the transport sector in the post-COVID world. Moreover, population distribution and urban structure may also be influenced by the arrival of the post-COVID new normal, which warrant further attention for urban planning. © 2021 The Authors","Decarbonization; New normal; Pathway; Post-COVID; Transport sector; Urban economic model","carbon emission; COVID-19; energy use; pandemic; public transport; service sector; transportation planning; travel behavior; urban economy; urban planning; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107295968

The implementation of a market-based emission trading scheme offers a wider range of strategic choices and greater flexibility for building owners to reduce carbon emissions, but few of them are enthusiastic and actively engaged. To address the problem, this study explores how governments can effectively guide the carbon mitigation actions of building owners under an emission trading scheme (ETS) by continually adjusting and optimizing their regulation strategies. First, an extended evolutionary game model is built, considering the synergistic effect of multiple regulation policies, to theoretically depict the long-term interactive, extensive correlative, and dynamic feedback relationship between the government and building owners. Second, taking advantage of system dynamics as a policy laboratory, a scenario cultivation and simulation analysis is conducted to fully investigate the implementation effects of different regulation strategies based on the behavioral responses of building owners under different scenarios. The city of Shenzhen is a pioneer in covering the building sector in its carbon trading scheme in China, and its hotels above four stars are selected as the realistic setting for the simulation analysis. The results demonstrate that under the emission trading scheme, compared with increasing levels of carbon monitoring and non-financial incentives for building owners, intervention measures, including penalties, subsidies, and public scrutiny, are more efficient and important for the government. These findings provide important theoretical guidance and practical implications for the government to further adjust and optimize its carbon regulation strategies for the building sector. © 2021","Building sector; Carbon emissions reduction; Emission trading scheme; Evolutionary game model; Simulation analysis","Carbon; Emission control; Public policy; Behavioral response; Emission trading scheme; Evolutionary game models; Financial incentives; Global carbon emission; Implementation effects; Intervention measures; Simulation analysis; Buildings; carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; game theory; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107294630

While undergoing rapid development, countries worldwide aim to solve the problems involved in high energy consumption. Taking China as an example, this paper studies the main factors of carbon emissions in the transport sector and analyses the decoupling states between carbon emission and economic growth, making energy efficiency policies accordingly. In order to better demonstrate the dependence of the economy on the carbon emissions in China's transportation industry comprehensively, combined with the C–D production function, this paper develops the decomposition and decoupling technology based on the LMDI approach. Additionally, it quantifies seven effects: energy emission intensity effect, energy structure effect, energy intensity effect, transportation intensity effect, technology state effect, labor input effect and capital input effect. The results show three major points: (1) From 2001 to 2018, the cumulative carbon emissions of China's transportation industry increased by 633.46 million tons, in which the capital input effect is the key factor driving carbon emissions, accounting for 157.70% of the total cumulative increased emissions, followed by energy structure effect at 10.39%. The labor input effect accounted for the smallest proportion at 2.26%. In this case, the technology state effect is the primary factor in restraining carbon emissions. During the study period, it reduced carbon emissions by 292.27 million tons, accounting for 46.14%. To a certain extent, energy intensity effect, transportation intensity effect and energy emission intensity inhibited carbon emissions, representing 16.67%, 5.32% and 2.22%, respectively. (2) During the research period, two decoupling states existed between carbon emissions and economic growth in China's transportation industry, specifically weak decoupling and expansive coupling. (3) The analysis of decomposition and decoupling state of influencing factors of carbon emissions shows that, on the one hand, factors promoting carbon emissions (capital input effect, energy structure effect and labor input effect) hinder the decoupling process.

For the microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) as a ratio parameter of C allocated to anabolism over total metabolised C, the effects of sample pre-treatment are unpredictable because the underlying parameters of microbial metabolism may be affected differently. In treatment or land use comparisons, it is important to know whether soils are affected in a similar way by pre-treatment. Based on five different paired sites (each with cropland and forest), the effects of six common pre-treatments were evaluated on 18O-CUE and associated parameters, i.e. respiration rate, soil microbial biomass C, total DNA extracted, and estimated abundances of fungi, bacteria and archaea. The six common pre-treatments were: (i) immediate analysis of field-fresh soil samples, and analysis following 14 d pre-incubation of soil samples that were (ii) field-fresh, (iii) air-dried, (iv) oven-dried (40 °C), (v) frozen at −20 °C and (vi) frozen in-situ (dry ice and subsequently liquid N2). The experiment revealed two main findings. The first was that pre-incubation of 14 d had the most pronounced effect and reduced microbial respiration rate, growth rate and microbial biomass C by between 28% and 63% on average compared with field-fresh samples, suggesting an impact of the reduction in readily available substrates on microbial activity. The second finding was that even after 14 days of pre-incubation, drying &amp; rewetting caused an increase in the microbial respiration rate in forest soil samples of 64 ± 53% (air-drying) and 86 ± 65% (oven-drying), known as the Birch effect. However, CUE as a ratio parameter was found to be unaffected by sample pre-treatment, with only minor changes after 14 d of pre-incubation. Pre-treatment (including pre-incubation) affected cropland and forest samples similarly, with one exception: the estimated abundance of fungi increased only with drying &amp; rewetting in forest soils. This suggests that dried cropland soils could potentially yield appropriate community data, while forest soils respond to soil drying in a more complex way. It was concluded that CUE values can be derived from soil samples regardless of whether they were dried &amp; rewetted, frozen &amp; thawed, or stored fresh. © 2021 The Author(s)","18O-labelling; Birch effect; Carbon use efficiency; Drying & rewetting; Freezing & thawing; Pre-incubation","Ecology; Efficiency; Forestry; Fungi; Land use; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Ovens; Soil surveys; Soils; 18O-labeling; Birch effect; Carbon use efficiencies; Drying-rewetting; Freezing/thawing; Pre-incubation; Pre-treatments; Respiration rate; Sample pretreatment; Soil sample; Drying; abundance estimation; forest soil; fungus; growth rate; land use; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; soil microorganism; Archaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107264016

Therefore, there is growing interest in understanding these concurrent extremes. In many applications, not only the frequency but also the magnitude of concurrent extremes are of interest. One way to approach this problem is to study the distribution of one climate variable given that another is extreme. In this work we develop a statistical framework for estimating bivariate concurrent extremes via a conditional approach, where univariate extreme value modeling is combined with dependence modeling of the conditional tail distribution using techniques from quantile regression and extreme value analysis to quantify concurrent extremes. We focus on the distribution of daily wind speed conditioned on daily precipitation taking its seasonal maximum. The Canadian Regional Climate Model large ensemble is used to assess the performance of the proposed framework both via a simulation study with specified dependence structure and via an analysis of the climate model-simulated dependence structure. © 2021","Concurrent wind and precipitation extremes; Conditional extreme value model; Large climate ensembles; Quantile regression","abundance estimation; climate variation; ensemble forecasting; estimation method; extreme event; modeling; precipitation (climatology); wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107260337

Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remains unclear. Methods: We explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI, particulate matter at 2.5 μm or PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. We use confirmed cases of infection from 1,287 districts and mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the bivariate correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We explored district cases within the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. Results: Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green vegetation cover, as a socioeconomic proxy, are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. Case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. Conclusions: Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals below the age of 30. We conclude that environmental and climatic factors do play a significant role in the transmission and case fatality rates in Peru, however further study is required to see if these relationships are maintained over time. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","age groups; air quality; COVID-19; elevation; gender; solar radiation","nitrogen dioxide; adolescent; adult; aged; air quality; Article; biogeographic region; case fatality rate; child; climate; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental exposure; environmental factor; female; gender; groups by age; human; infant; infection rate; major clinical study; male; particulate matter 2.5; Peru; population density; precipitation; rain forest; seashore; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social status; solar radiation; temperature; vapor pressure; vegetation; virus transmission; water vapor; wind; air pollution; climate; environment; epidemiology; mortality; socioeconomics; statistical model; weather; Air Pollution; Climate; COVID-19; Environment; Humans; Linear Models; Peru; SARS-CoV-2; Socioeconomic Factors; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107229088

Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we predicted changes in taxon-specific distribution under future scenarios of climate, land use and human populations for (1) areas outside protected areas (PAs) only (assuming complete management effectiveness of PAs), (2) the entire study region and (3) interspecies range overlap. Location: Tropical Africa. Methods: We compiled occurrence data (n = 5,203) on African apes from the IUCN A.P.E.S. database and extracted relevant climate-, habitat- and human-related predictors representing current and future (2050) conditions to predict taxon-specific range change under a best- and a worst-case scenario, using ensemble forecasting. Results: The predictive performance of the models varied across taxa. Synergistic interactions between predictors are shaping African ape distribution, particularly human-related variables. On average across taxa, a range decline of 50% is expected outside PAs under the best scenario if no dispersal occurs (61% in worst scenario). Otherwise, an 85% range reduction is predicted to occur across study regions (94% worst). However, range gains are predicted outside PAs if dispersal occurs (52% best, 21% worst), with a slight increase in gains expected across study regions (66% best, 24% worst). Moreover, more than half of range losses and gains are predicted to occur outside PAs where interspecific ranges overlap. Main Conclusions: Massive range decline is expected by 2050, but range gain is uncertain as African apes will not be able to occupy these new areas immediately due to their limited dispersal capacity, migration lag and ecological constraints. Given that most future range changes are predicted outside PAs, Africa's current PA network is likely to be insufficient for preserving suitable habitats and maintaining connected ape populations. Thus, conservation planners urgently need to integrate land use planning and climate change mitigation measures at all decision-making levels both in range countries and abroad. © 2021 The Authors.

However, the spatial variation of stomatal traits on different sides of the leaves’ epidermis and their response to environmental changes remain unclear. Here, we measured stomatal density (SD), stomatal size (SS), and stomatal relative area (SRA) on both leaf surfaces of 181 plant species across an environmental gradient on the Loess Plateau. We calculated the proportion of stomatal traits between different epidermis surfaces of the leaves (abaxial and adaxial) and measured the total SD (SDtot), total SS (SStot), and total SRA (SRAtot) of the leaves as a whole. The SDtot, SStot, and SRAtot showed a log-normal distribution, differing across grassland types and plant functional groups, with a range of 22.57–890.09 stomata mm−2, 84.61–2022.81 μm2, and 0.51–43.71%, respectively. The SDtot, SStot, and SRAtot differed significantly between different grassland types. Meadow plants had larger SDtot, desert plants had larger SStot, and typical grassland plants had relatively larger SRAtot. The abaxial SD and SRA of the woody plants were significantly higher than those of herbaceous plants, but no significant differences were observed at the adaxial surface or for the overall leaf. A higher SDtot was correlated with a larger stomatal density ratio (R.SD) and smaller stomatal size ratio (R.SS).

In Navarre, North of Spain, ongoing adaptive management practices were identified and promoted in the framework of a regional adaptation strategy. Most include practices aiming to increase topsoil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural land. In this work, the effectiveness of these practices (conservation agriculture, crop rotations, additions of organic matter, irrigation, and controlled grazing management) was assessed by means of monitoring SOC in a network of 159 agricultural fields across the region. These fields were selected across bioclimatic zones, where soil vulnerabilities and land-uses were previously assessed, to represent the most widespread conditions in the region. A sampling protocol designed to compare SOC stocks in plots with equal soil conditions within each zone, and with or without adaptive practices, allowed the determination of their effect size (measured as response ratios, RR). Exogenous organic matter addition was the most effective practice for SOC storage (RR 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.25–1.37]) across the region. Controlled grazing also resulted in net SOC gains (RR CI [1.13–1.42]) in temperate and semiarid grasslands. Conservation agriculture seemed to be more effective in the driest zone (RR CI [1.30–1.53]) than in the more humid ones (RR CI [0.98–1.21]). Irrigation also displayed a net positive effect (RR CI [1.17–1.34]), modulated by irrigated crop management, whereas crop rotations had an overall negative impact vs. monoculture (RR CI [0.84–0.96]), likely by their interaction with irrigation. These results confirm the variability in SOC responses to changes in management, and SOC as an indicator for assessing regional adaptation practices, although other biophysical, agronomic, and socio-economic factors also need to be accounted for. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","4per1000; Adaptation; Regional approach; Response ratio; Soil organic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107151052

An increasing focus on quantifying urban emissions of GHGs from policy makers has begun to spur new research into how best to use this unique and very high resolution data set. While, historically, this line of research has been the domain of limited domain mesoscale and regional models, an increasing understanding and respect for boundary inflow uncertainty and bias has led people to search for an alternative modeling framework that both characterizes high frequency variability of CO2 in space and time as well as honor mass conservation requirements globally and be seamless with respect to boundaries. To monitor local anthropogenic emissions from space, the influence of atmospheric signals originating from outside the local area of interest needs to be quantified. In our first step towards building a comprehensive multi-scale CO2 inversion system, we use free running simulations of the Ocean Land Atmosphere Model (OLAM), a variable-resolution general circulation model, to explore the signal-to-noise statistics of anthropogenic urban emissions of CO2 versus the background inflow for approximately 40 of the largest cities across the globe. We show that signal-to-noise levels are much better in winter time than summer but also that the winter biological inflow is far from negligible, suggesting that the commonly held assumption that biology can be ignored in winter time urban emission estimates is probably incorrect. Simulated pressure-weighted column average CO2 (XCO2) is also used to evaluate the ability of fixed location XCO2 measurements to provide background inflow estimates. Results show why Los Angeles, a heavily instrumented and studied urban center, is likely one of the easiest cities to observe globally from space, despite its relatively complex meteorology. Lastly, we discuss challenges and possible research paths forward to continue to advance the notion of multi-scale global CO2 flux inversion systems capable of simultaneously optimizing local urban emissions and large-scale CO2 transport patterns. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon; CO2; High-resolution; Transport; Urban","anthropogenic effect; biogenic emission; carbon budget; data set; general circulation model; greenhouse gas; numerical model; OCO; policy making; pollutant source; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; signal-to-noise ratio; spectral resolution; urban pollution; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107142487

This paper presents and analyses the impact of a bi-objective strategy to optimise the capacity of the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) of REC prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) generators. The optimisation problem is solved through a custom implementation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and has two contrasting objectives: maximising the self-sufficiency of the REC from the main grid, while minimising the BESS capacity of all REC members. A key novelty of this study is the prosumer-driven perspective, which allows to exclude the REC members who do not want to install a BESS through a linear optimisation constraint. Moreover, the proposed approach ensures that probabilities of over- or under-voltages are compliant with the limits specified by Distribution System Operators (DSOs). Such probabilities, as well as the line and BESS losses, are estimated within the optimisation loop through grid-level simulations performed in OpenDSS. Both a standard peer-to-grid (P2G) and a more REC-oriented peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing policy are analysed and their performance is assessed in different seasons and considering both the current energy demand and a possible future scenario, in which electrical heat pumps are widely used. The results of a case study based on a modified version of the IEEE 906-bus European Low Voltage distribution grid show that a if the total BESS capacity assigned to all REC prosumers exceeds a given threshold value, the benefits for the REC become minor. Assuming to choose the optimal BESS capacity solutions corresponding to the threshold value in the summer season (i.e., when PV and BESSs are most exploited), the overall energy losses are reduced roughly by 20%–40% for both P2G and P2P battery controls. The CO2 emissions instead, are reduced by 10% to 50% with the P2P policy having a slight edge over the P2G one. The P2P energy sharing policy spreads the economic benefits of energy savings more evenly among REC members, and the return on investment is generally higher if the electricity demand increases. © 2021 The Authors","Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS); Battery sizing; Energy communities; Energy sharing; Genetic algorithm","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Linear programming; Probability distributions; Voltage distribution measurement; Battery energy storage system; Battery energy storage systems; Battery sizing; CO$-2$/ emission; Energy community; Energy sharings; Prosumer; Renewable energy community; System Capacity; Threshold-value; Battery storage; alternative energy; carbon emission; electricity; energy storage; fuel cell; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107141321

The application of digital water metering (DWM) to properties has had a demonstrable impact on water savings at the property and network levels, on efficiencies within water utilities, as well as on improvements to customer satisfaction scores. Gathering and processing near-real-time water usage data is very important for both end-users and utilities, as well as demand and supply management planning. The potential contribution of DWM to the three pillars of water sustainability (environmental, economic development and social equity) is often overlooked. In Australia and other jurisdictions water utilities are facing up to the challenge of climate change. However, business cases promoting DWM are often unsuccessful because the benefit side falls short of the cost side. This study sought to identify possible DWM benefits not previously considered through an extensive review of academic and industry literature, and then to view those benefits through the lens of sustainability. The 77 identified benefits of DWM were catalogued and a taxonomy was created. The study elicited the opinions of experts, before quantifying them, thus identifying two distinct contexts of benefit value; subsequently, it surveyed the views of customers and developed a stochastic model of benefit value. The model, named DWM360, was applied to the project data of a large metropolitan water utility in Australia to model their DWM proposal for cost savings, contribution to sustainability and uplift in customer satisfaction. This paper presents a novel focus on how the benefits of DWM assist water sustainability. It considers differing social norms that impact consumer acceptance of changes in metering and water charges. The study will be of interest to researchers as well as practitioners looking to identify sustainability aspects of DWM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Customer survey; Digital water meters; Experts survey; Modelling; Taxonomy; Water sustainability","water; academic research; climate change; economic development; environmental modeling; environmental values; infrastructure planning; life satisfaction; sustainability; water planning; water use; Article; controlled study; cost control; economic development; energy; energy conservation; environmental sustainability; human; human rights; patient satisfaction; stochastic model; taxonomy; water supply; Australia; climate change; commercial phenomena; Australia; Australia; Climate Change; Commerce; Water; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107139285

In this paper, an office building under the Mediterranean climate was instrumental in the collection of both indoor environmental parameters (air temperature and relative humidity, CO2, VOC) and user action-related variables (electricity power, window, door state, and air conditioning use). Each parameter was monitored along with the occupancy state at a one-minute time step for two years. The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate the potential application of three straightforward models, such as the Law of Total Probability (LTP), Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), to estimate the occupancy state using the indoor measurements. Thirty-four (34) different combinations of parameters were applied on the developed models; the true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and accuracy were used as evaluation metrics. The results confirmed that the performances of the models were influenced by both the number and the typology of the used parameters. In particular, the CART model was found to be the least affected by them; almost half of the parameters’ combinations provided accuracies higher than 93% and TNR higher than TPR.

Studies show that residential coal-fired heating in some countries has led to considerable air pollution. In China, coal consumption and air pollutants increase dramatically especially during the winter heating period when centralized systems provide heating for select cities. Using a Difference-In-Differences (DID), we examined the daily reduction effect of the Coal to Natural Gas or Electricity (CNGE) policy on air pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding (“2+26”) region that receives centralized heating. The net treatment effect from the CNGE policy is estimated to alleviate 3.4 μg/m3 of PM2.5, 5.3 μg/m3 of PM10, 4.3 μg/m3 of SO2, 14.1 μg/m3 of O3 and 0.1 mg/m3 of CO. Moreover, we estimated the total cost of the transition to natural gas or electricity to be 3,336.78 million USD in 2017. These results can provide references for policymakers to encourage using and/or prolonging the CNGE policy in China and other countries that wish to make the transition away from coal. © 2021","Ambient air pollution; Cleaner heating transition; Difference-In-Differences model; Economic cost; Environmental impacts","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Economic and social effects; Heating; Natural gas; Ambient air pollution; Cleaner heating transition; Coal consumption; Difference-in-differences models; Economic costs; Electricity policy; Environmental and economic impacts; Natural gas policy; Northern China; Residential coals; Coal; natural gas; atmospheric pollution; cost analysis; economic impact; environmental economics; environmental impact; heating; air pollutant; Article; China; coal power; controlled study; economic aspect; electricity; environmental impact; microclimate; winter; winter heating; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107135078

In this context, a global land and natural resource rush for business, development and climate and environmental stewardship purposes has been at work since the mid-2000s. This paper discusses whether, how, and the extent to which the resource rush behind mainstream climate stewardship and sustainability transitions shapes the contemporary resource property question regarding who has the ability and power to harness what natural resources where, how, and for what purpose(s). It explores the drivers, protagonists and implications for research and political advocacy of critical shifts in the object, subject, form, enforcing authority, policy structure, and justification of resource property during neoliberal globalization since the 1970s. An alliance of trailblazing resource rush supporters and accommodators is behind these changes which, when taken altogether, hint at a broader restructuring trend of the resource property question in climate stewardship and sustainability transitions today. Despite its potential to democratize resource access, control and ownership, the restructuring trend so far primarily serves the purposes of big business and conservation non-profits to enhance their social license to operate by means of reducing local resource tenure risks at the grassroots level and reputational risks more generally. While there is a need for further research, the examined changes seem to be transforming the playing field of political advocacy around resource governance in climate stewardship and transitions to sustainability. But the examined restructuring trend is highly contested and contingent on an unstable middle-ground sort of political compromise, the future trajectory of which remains to be seen. © 2021","Climate change adaptation/mitigation; environmental governance; Natural resource politics; Natural resource property relations; Property regimes; Sustainability transitions","adaptive management; climate change; environmental management; environmental politics; natural resource; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107134235

Regional PM2.5 transport and urbanization play important roles on the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations. According to the hourly PM2.5 distribution data in Beijing between 2014 and 2017, we used gradient analysis to identify the positive, negative and nonsignificant effects of south-north transport and urbanization on PM2.5 distribution pattern. The south-north transport effect on the distribution of PM2.5 was evidenced by significant south–north PM2.5 gradient, and the south–north PM2.5 gradient increased as the pollution level increased except in summer. PM2.5 concentrations are influenced by strong emissions located in the south. The frequency of the positive urbanization effect decreased, and the frequency of the negative urbanization effect increased as the pollution level increased during all seasons.

For this, we develop an integrated modeling framework by soft linking three different techno-economic bottom-up models of the power and energy systems, one partial equilibrium model of the natural gas sector, and a partial equilibrium model of the Mexican energy sector. Our results show several interesting results: high natural gas prices raise the use of carbon-intensive technologies in the short-term and boost renewable investments at longer time intervals, increasing emissions in earlier periods and reducing them thereafter. Regarding system costs, because of more capital-intensive green power and lower expenditures in raw energy carriers, capital costs rise and operating costs decrease in the long haul. Furthermore, we see an increase in natural gas demand when its price is low, reducing long-term capital and operating costs through cheaper energy inputs in natural gas facilities and a lower share of capital-intensive renewable facilities in the power system. Concerning emissions, low natural-gas prices decrease coal use in the United States, reducing anthropogenic emissions until the last stages of the optimization period. For Mexico, they show heterogeneous results across models. Policymakers can use this study's results to understand the influence of natural gas prices in the Mexican and United States energy sectors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated modeling framework; Mexico; Natural gas; Power system; United States","Gas emissions; Gas industry; Investments; Operating costs; Bottom-up modeling; Energy sector; Integrated modeling framework; Me-xico; Natural gas price; Partial equilibrium model; Power; Power system; Techno-economics; United state; Natural gas; alternative energy; electricity supply; emission inventory; energy resource; expenditure; integrated approach; natural gas; policy making; power generation; price dynamics; sustainability; Mexico [North America]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107127746

The variety of soil types, land-transition options, and management practices present in the Amazon region require detailed inventories to reduce the uncertainties associated with estimates of soil C change. Therefore, we conducted a study covering ca. 1 million hectares to estimate the soil C stock changes due to LUC in Paragominas and Santarém, Pará state, eastern Brazilian Amazon, for the period of 1990–2010. Soil C stocks for 1990 were modeled based on land cover at the time. In 2010, we carried out a field work taking soil samples to measure soil C stock changes in 356 transects across contrasting land uses (logged and burnt forest, young secondary forest, intermediate secondary forest, old secondary forest, pasture, and cropland). The response ratios for the conversion from undisturbed forest to new land uses were calculated considering the differences in soil C stocks, with the undisturbed forest as reference. Between 1990 and 2010, LUC induced a total loss of 1.51 Tg C year-1 (over an area of 7350 km2). For this period, the uncertainty of estimates was ± 23.2%. The land transitions to pasture and cropland were the main drivers of soil C losses. Thus, deforestation contributes to climate change not only through losses of forest biomass but also subsequently soil C losses. These results can inform national and international climate change initiatives associated with LUC in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Land use intensity; Monte Carlo method; Soil organic carbon; Tropical forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107127150

This article proposes a techno-economic methodology to identify the reinforcements needed to maintain grid stability at the lowest life-cycle cost. Novel contributions include the consideration of three-phase connection of low-carbon technologies as a reinforcement option and the fact that we study to what extent grid reinforcements can mitigate voltage unbalance issues. Additionally, to reduce computing time, a dummy island approach is used, whereby one feeder is modelled in detail and the remainder of the distribution island is represented by an aggregated load. Finally, random repetitions are proposed, to consider uncertainties related to building properties, occupants and the location of low-carbon technologies in the feeders. The methodology is applied to investigate the integration of heat pumps and photovoltaic systems in typical Belgian rural and urban grids. For the rural grid, heat pumps may lead to significant reinforcement costs (up to 1230 €/dwelling), mainly due to voltage stability problems. For the urban grid, heat pump and photovoltaic integration causes low reinforcement cost (<200 €/dwelling). Furthermore, more random repetitions are required to obtain robust results for the rural grid than for the urban one. The proposed methodology is generic and transferrable to other radial low-voltage grids and low-carbon technologies (e.g. electric vehicles). It can help grid operators and policy makers integrate low-carbon technologies in a more resilient and cost-effective way, by weighing their available grid reinforcement solutions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy systems; Heat pumps; Low-voltage grids; Photovoltaic systems; Techno-economic analysis","Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Heat pump systems; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Distributed energy systems; Economic methodology; Grid reinforcement; Heat pumps; In-buildings; Low-carbon technologies; Low-voltage grid; Photovoltaic systems; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economics; Reinforcement; building; computer simulation; life cycle; photovoltaic system; pump; reinforcement; smart grid; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107123946

While interventions to improve water quality can create large societal benefits, these investments are costly and the value of benefits is often unknown. Understanding the social and economic impacts of reduced phosphorus loading is critical for developing effective land use policies and for generating public and political support for these initiatives. Here, we quantify the social benefits and costs of improving water quality in Lake Champlain under a range of phosphorus reduction and climate change scenarios between 2016 and 2050. We use statistical models to link water quality outputs from an established integrated assessment model with three categories of benefits: tourism expenditures, property sales, and avoided human health impacts. We estimate the costs of reducing phosphorus loading using data reported by the State of Vermont. We find that under the most aggressive phosphorus reduction scenario, the total benefits of improved water quality are $55 to $60 million between 2016 and 2050. Over this 35 year time horizon, the combined benefits do not outweigh the costs under any scenario. If the time horizon is extended to 2100 or beyond, however, the benefits may exceed the costs if the applied discount rate is less than 3%. Importantly, we almost certainly underestimate the value of clean water, due to the omission of other types of benefits. Despite this uncertainty, our study provides a tractable framework for disentangling the complex relationships between water quality and human well-being, and illuminates the value of reductions in phosphorus loading to society. © 2021 The Authors","Benefit-cost analysis; Climate change; Integrated assessment model; Lake Champlain; Non-market valuation; Phosphorus; Water quality","lake water; phosphorus; phosphorus; algal bloom; climate change; cost analysis; economic impact; health impact; land use planning; phosphorus; pollution control; quantitative analysis; water quality; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Article; climate change; cost benefit analysis; environmental policy; health hazard; human; hydrodynamics; incidence; lake sediment; land use; reduction (chemistry); tourism; Vermont; waste component removal; water monitoring; water pollution control; water quality; wellbeing; cost benefit analysis; lake; water quality; Lake Champlain; United States; Vermont; Climate Change; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Lakes; Phosphorus; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107121113

Cities call for innovative approaches integrating climate protection with urban attractiveness and waterfront endeavors. There is a lack of studies targeting policy processes for coastal protection, including the choice of adaptation strategies and impediments for implementation. Sweden is an interesting case due to the decentralized character of coastal adaptation. Consequently, this paper aims to analyze the status of and conditions for large-scale multifunctional coastal protection by means of qualitative analyses of policy documents and interviews with frontline practitioners in four Swedish coastal cities: Malmö, Gothenburg, Helsingborg and Landskrona. The analysis documents a predominant focus on envisioning/planning for coastal protection rather than implementation of adaptation measures. While waterfront development functions as a window of opportunity in the more populous cities it also risks creating fragmentation and social imbalances in coastal protection between cities and their various coastal areas. Key implementation determinants emphasize formal institutional aspects, where politics and political decision-making need to set the necessary terms ensuring implementation. Current public-private and national-local distribution of responsibilities, stepwise planning and limited funding-mechanisms create uncertainties in system robustness and coherency. The consequences of a system for coastal protection heavily reliant on decentralized action needs to be properly considered by adaptation policy-makers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal protection; Implementation determinants; Institutional structures; Multifunctionality; Urban experimentation; Waterfront climate adaptation","action plan; adaptive management; climate change; coastal development; coastal zone; decentralization; decision making; environmental policy; environmental protection; policy implementation; redevelopment; strategic approach; urban area; waterfront development; Goteborg; Helsingborg; Malmo; Skane; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107116401

Very few studies conducted at the African level overlooked the difference in regions and income levels of the countries involved in the research. This study empirically examined the long-run impact of energy intensity, renewable energy consumption, and economic growth on CO2 emissions across regions and income levels over 50 African countries from 1980 to 2018. The most recent panel estimators, causality test, and impulse response and variance decomposition analysis were employed. The findings from panel estimators revealed that renewable energy consumption contributed to mitigating CO2 emissions, while energy intensity promoted emissions across regions and income levels, and at the African level. Economic growth affected CO2 emissions negatively at the African level but the effect was mixed across regions and income levels. The causality test confirmed bi-directional causations between CO2 emissions and its determinants in African, and some regions and income levels. Again, unidirectional causation was highly supported across regions and income levels. Moreover, results of impulse response and variance decomposition analysis showed that both energy intensity and economic growth counted higher variations of CO2 emissions, while renewable energy highly contributed to reducing emissions within 10 years. Our findings grasp new insight into country development, income levels, and regions for regional and government policymakers related to effectively mitigate CO2 emissions. © The Authors","African; CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Energy intensity; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energy consumption","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Impulse response; Sustainable development; African; Causality test; CO$-2$/ emission; Economic growths; Energy economics; Energy intensity; Environmental sustainability; Income levels; Panel estimators; Renewable energy consumption; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107112909

Pollution reduction, increased human wellbeing and climate change adaptation are only some of the challenges targeted by NBSs. However, under the warming climate affecting many of the world's cities, most of modern NBSs will be highly impacted by the same climate factors they hope to mitigate. As in the case of extreme temperatures or altered water availability, these factors can impact and cause the failure in the organisms, technical elements and governance structures that NBSs rely upon, thus decreasing performance, reliability and sustainability of these solutions. In this commentary we propose critical considerations related to designing, building and managing “climate-ready” NBSs – defined as local integrated solutions able to cope with or adapt to climate change. We do so by highlighting examples in heat- and drought-stricken areas across Australian cities as they sit at the global forefront of a hotter world.

However, accurate assessment of the effects of the GGP on carbon storage remains a challenge. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model can map and evaluate natural goods and services that sustain life and quantify their impact from the changes in the ecosystem. Taking Huining County in China's Loess Plateau region as a case, the land use and land cover changes (LUCC) following the GGP were quantified, and their effects on carbon storage between 2000 and 2016 were evaluated using the InVEST model. The results showed that, a total area of about 3996.13 km2 underwent changes following the GGP in Huining County during the study period, accounting roughly for 74% of the county. The total carbon storage increased from 6470.72 Gg in 2000 to 7335.07 Gg in 2016. Spatially, carbon density in the south of this county was greater than the northern part. Directly induced by the GGP (conversions of farmlands to forests and grasslands), the carbon storage increased by 786.84 Gg in total, with a rate of 46.28 Gg per year, the majority of which occurred during the first stage of the study period (from 2000 to 2008). The increase of carbon storage was mostly attributable to the increases in vegetation pool and the carbon density showed a strong spatial correlation with the growing season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The similarities between carbon density and NDVI spatial patterns during the study period may have been shaped by the county's climate patterns, but not to any significant extent by climate change during the study period. This county-scale study allows for a deeper understanding of the links between LUCC induced by environmental restoration programs and carbon storage changes, and contributes to a greater accuracy in the estimation of carbon storage at the provincial (or larger) scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon storage; Grain for green program; LUCC; Remote sensing; The InVEST model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107078798

A lack of consistent data on life-cycle carbon emissions and energy demand at the neighbourhood level has made it difficult to understand the origins of climate change at this scale. A sensitivity analysis brought clarity concerning the extent of environmental impacts on future climate evolution. From this perspective, the authors aimed to evaluate, analyse, compare, and provides recommendations to reduce carbon emissions, as well as the energy required by three types of neighbourhoods (urban, rural, and sustainable) located in and adapted to all countries worldwide. The most important parameters affecting carbon emission and energy consumption were analysed, including the energy mix of countries, local building materials and climate, technological solutions utilised, daily mobility, and occupied spaces. The results indicated that the highest levels of carbon dioxide emissions were produced by countries with prosperous economies, such as China, the United States, India, Germany, and Poland, because of high concentrations of coal in their energy mixes. Modernising cities through the construction of new eco-districts and increasing the use of new techniques for substantial renovations of outdated buildings worldwide could mitigate the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by neighbourhoods 53–97 % by 2050. Moreover, by combining substantial building renovations with the installation of photovoltaic panels on roofs, the objective of ‘zero carbon’ at the neighbourhood level could be achievable by 2050 in rural neighbourhoods. Radical changes in the judicious choice of construction materials and use of green energy production represent targeted opportunities to resolve the future climate dilemma. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Building sector; Energy consumption; Forecast scenarios; Life-cycle assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107059047

Present study aimed at evaluating the energy and carbon budget of diversified groundnut (Arachis hypogea L) based cropping system with over existing traditional practice towards the development of a sustainable production technology through restoration of soil and environmental quality and enhancement of farming resiliency by stabilizing farmers’ income. The trials comprised of three introduced groundnut based systems viz. groundnut– pea (Pisum sativum), groundnut–lentil (Lens esculenta) and groundnut–toria (Brasssica campestris var. Toria) replacing three existing systems viz. maize (Zea mays L) – fallow, maize – toria, and rice (Oryza sativa L)-fallow systems. Four years study revealed that adoption of groundnut based systems reduced non-renewable energy input use (fertilizers, chemical, machinery and fossil fuels) by 25.5%, consequently that reduced the cost of production. Repeated analysis of variance measurement also affirmed that groundnut based systems (groundnut-pea>groundnut-lentil> groundnut-toria) increased the energy use efficiency, energy productivity, carbon use efficiency, net returns and decreased the specific energy and energy intensiveness. Groundnut based systems increased the mean system productivity and water productivity in terms of groundnut equivalent yield by 3.7 and 3.1 folds over existing practice. The savings of fossil fuel reduced greenhouse gas emissions owing to reduced use of farm machinery and synthetic fertilizers. Groundnut based systems significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the soil carbon concentration (8.7–18.1%) and enzymatic activities (27.1–51.8%) over existing practice. Consequently, estimated soil quality index values were 35.9–77.3% higher under groundnut based systems than existing practice. Thus, the study indicated the resilient nature of groundnut based systems as an environmentally safe and sustainable production technology for enhancing resource use efficiency, reduce carbon emission, energy intensiveness and cost of production in the Eastern Himalaya region of India and similar ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon budgeting; Economics; Energy use; Greenhouse gas emission; Soil quality; System productivity","acid phosphatase; alkaline phosphatase; fertilizer; fossil fuel; water; carbon; carbon cycle; cereal; cropping practice; deciduous tree; ecosystem resilience; energy budget; environmental quality; farmers knowledge; greenhouse gas; herb; income; land degradation; land use change; legume; monoculture; resource use; soil ecosystem; agricultural worker; Article; Brasssica campestris; budget; bulk density; carbon footprint; cropping system; economic aspect; energy consumption; energy cost; environmental management; environmental resilience; extraction; fumigation; grain; human; income; India; land use; lentil; maize; pea; peanut; pod; productivity; sampling; soil analysis; soil management; soil quality; sowing; sustainable development; tillage; weather; agriculture; crop; ecosystem; soil; Himalayas; India; Arachis hypogaea; Lens culinaris; Oryza sativa; Pisum sativum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Carbon; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Farmers; Fertilizers; Humans; India; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107045724

However, the synergistic agricultural production mode of economy and ecology is still rare in this region. In this study, a 4-year fixed-point experiment was conducted to study the soil characteristics, production and ecological effects of three typical planting modes (continuous maize [CM], continuous peanuts [CP] and a rotational strip intercropping of maize and peanuts [RMP]). The results indicated that RMP had multiple benefits compared with CM and CP: it improved the soil carbon stocks in the 10−20 cm soil layer by 20.11 % and 34.19 %, respectively; it increased the grain yield and economic benefits, with an increase of 19.68 % and 17.29 % in the average annual yield of maize and peanuts, respectively, and an increase in revenue of 23.14 % and 13.99 %, respectively; the land use efficiency can be improved and the average land equivalent ratio of 4 years is 1.20; the soil erosion and the resulting carbon emissions were reduced, with a decrease in the intensity of erosion of 8.28 % and 45.45 %, respectively, and a decrease of 22.73 % and 45.16 % in the resulting carbon emissions, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the improvement in soil characteristics, such as the modification of soil organic carbon, mineralized carbon, and an increase in available nutrients, helps to increase the yields of maize and peanut in the RMP. In conclusion, RMP resulted in multiple benefits and was more consistent with sustainable agricultural production in the agropastoral ecotone region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Ecological effects; Economic benefit; Land equivalent ratio; Soil characteristics","agricultural economics; agricultural production; buffer zone; crop rotation; ecotone; experimental study; intercropping; legume; maize; China; Arachis hypogaea; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107045257

Mobile and in-situ measurements of ultrafine particles (UFP) and black carbon (BC) concentrations were conducted on three different types of urban greenway designs: 1) an at-grade greenway next to traffic; 2) an elevated greenway above (10−14 m) traffic; and 3) a sunken greenway below (2.5−3 m) traffic. Results from the mobile measurements showed that the UFP and BC concentrations were up to 30 % lower on all types of greenway than on sidewalks. This result was further confirmed by the in-situ measurement, which showed 47 % lower UFP concentrations in the sunken greenway and 80 % lower BC concentrations in the elevated greenway compared to the sidewalk. Pollutant concentrations also varied according to microenvironmental factors, such as land uses, height of surrounding buildings, nearby traffic, and vegetation. Our findings highlight the importance of considering air pollution exposure when designing urban greenways in highly urbanized environments. In particular, greenway designs that promote vertical separation from traffic sources might be crucial in mitigating air pollution exposure.

Over the last decades, various forest governance initiatives and institutions have evolved in global response to interlinked topics such as climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, indigenous rights, and trade impacts – accompanied by various levels of academic attention. Using a Delphi methodology that draws on both policy and academic insights, we assess the currently perceived state of play in global forest governance and identify possible future directions. Results indicate that state actors are seen to be key in providing supportive regulatory frameworks, yet interviewees do not believe these will be established at the global scale. Rather, respondents point to issue-specific, regional and inter-regional coalitions of the willing, involving the private sector, to innovate global forest governance. Linking forest issues with high politics may hold promise, as demonstrated by initiatives regarding illegal logging and timber trade. Confident rule-setting in support of the public good as well as responsible investments are seen as further avenues. New forest governance “hypes”, if used strategically, can provide leverage points and resources to ensure sustainability effects on the ground. At the same time, informal markets are often crucial for governance outcomes and need consideration. As such, clarifying tenure in sovereignty-sensitive ways is important, as are innovative ways for inclusive “glocal” decision-making. Lastly, new technologies, big data and citizens’ capacities are identified as potent innovation opportunities, for making global dependencies between consumption, production and deforestation visible and holding players accountable across the value chains. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deforestation; Delphi assessment; Foresight; Forest degradation; Future; Global forest policy; High-level expert panel; International forest regime","adult; article; big data; decision making; Delphi study; human; illegal timber; investment; politics; private sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106968134

At present, most of the relevant studies adopt the method of artificial rainfall simulation to quantify rainfall characteristics in terms of rainfall intensity, and mostly focus on one category of plants. Studies of rainfall intensity on different categories of plants are lacking. Therefore, in this study, common urban greenery plants were classified into four categories, namely, trees, shrubs, herbs, and aquatic plants. Artificial rainfall was used and three different gradients of rainfall intensity, 30 mm/h, 45 mm/h and 60 mm/h, were set. The mass of per unit leaf area PM removal was calculated using the elution weighing method and the filter membrane method was used to classify the PM into three particle sizes: coarse (10–100-μm), fine (3–10-μm) and ultrafine (0.4–3-μm). It was devoted to investigating the differences in the effect of rainfall intensity on the removal of PM from the leaf surfaces of different categories of common urban greenery. The results showed that the removal of coarse particles by rainfall was the highest under different rainfall intensities. At the same time, the removal effects of rainfall on leaf surface PM of herbs were the highest under different rainfall intensity, while that of trees was the lowest. Among the same category of plants, Salix matsudana had better particle retention capacity among trees, Buxus sinica among shrubs, Poa pratensis among herbs, and Acorus calamus among aquatic plants. In addition, all tested plants had the highest mass of PM removed from leaf surface units at high rainfall intensity (60 mm/h). However, at a higher rainfall intensity (45 mm/h), the mass of PM on plant unit leaf surface removed was lower than the minimum rainfall intensity (30 mm/h). The results of the above study can provide a basis and theoretical support for the selection of species for urban green space restoration, as well as a reference for the establishment of urban cleaning systems from the perspective of the relationship between rainfall intensity and PM on plant leaf surfaces. © 2021","Artificial rainfall; Leaf surface; Particulate matter; Rainfall intensity; Removal capacity","Forestry; Particles (particulate matter); Plants (botany); Aquatic plants; Artificial rainfall; Artificial rainfall simulations; Effects of rainfalls; Leaf surfaces; Particulate Matter; Plant leaves; Rainfall intensity; Removal capacity; Urban greenery; Rain; greenschist facies; greenspace; particulate matter; precipitation intensity; rainfall; shrub; urban ecosystem; Acorus calamus; Buxus sinica; Poa pratensis; Salix matsudana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106963455

We use actual data from a Finnish municipality to create a dynamic model of the heating system with Apros® simulation software. With the help of modelling, we examine various decarbonization scenarios for the existing heating system, using different combinations solar thermal collectors, thermal energy storage (TES) and limitations on how and when solar heat can access the system. According to results, zero emissions during the summer can be achieved with annual solar share of 13.2% and at 44 €/MWh levelized cost of heat (LCoH), if the integration is supported by TES and a careful planning of solar heat integration. Our results show that a simple approach of pursuing for a maximal solar share does not necessarily lead to a reduction in carbon emission or in LCoH. In fact, aiming at higher solar shares of 15–25% in our case system, actually increase greenhouse gas emissions compared to the base case. This highlights the importance of focusing on emissions reductions instead of simple addition of renewable energy when DH utilities plan for solar heat investments. © 2021","Bioenergy; Biomass; District heating; Energy production; Flexibility; Solar heat","Computer software; Decarbonization; Digital storage; District heating; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Investments; Solar heating; Bio-energy; Decarbonisation; District heating system; Energy productions; Flexibility; Levelized costs; Solar heat; Techno-economics; Thermal energy storage; Biomass; bioenergy; carbon emission; cheating behavior; demand analysis; emission control; energy storage; greenhouse gas; heating; solar power; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106946692

However, little is known about synergetic changes of microbial and physicochemical dynamics in soils after natural forest conversion and their implications. In the current study, we synthesized the responses of soil microbial and physicochemical properties in the uppermost soil layer (&lt;20 cm) following natural forest conversion, as reported in 51 published studies (127 sites). Our results showed that the response ratios of soil moisture, soil microbial carbon and nitrogen, bacteria, fungi, enzymatic activities, soil organic carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, NO3–, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, cations (K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) overall declined following natural forest replacement. In contrast, natural forest conversion caused significant increases in soil bulk density, soil pH and NH4+. Reductions of microbial carbon, organic carbon and total nitrogen in soil were independent of revegetation type, but variations in soil pH, available phosphorus and fungi were correlated to land use. Soil CEC reduction increased soil pH, allowing soils to retain NH4+, which promoted fungal growth. Moreover, natural forest replacement led to the loss of soil cations in regions of higher precipitation. Revegetation practices led to greater consumption of soil microbial and chemical nutrients and produced “harder” soils (increased soil compaction and decreased moisture content) in warmer regions. Stand age influenced ratios of soil carbon to nitrogen and ratios of bacteria to fungi following natural forest conversion. Altogether, our study suggests that natural forest conversion results in decreased soil microbial and chemical fertility, and desirable soil properties are more likely to be lost in warmer regions and over time as global climate warming exacerbates, which in turn may potentially damage ecosystem sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Meta-analysis; Natural forest conversion; Soil fertility; Soil properties","cation exchange capacity; forest soil; global climate; meta-analysis; physicochemical property; soil microorganism; soil quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106926723

The paper begins by discussing the carbon impact of the sector and the concept of ‘smart campuses' applied to the sector in the context of decarbonisation. Opportunities and challenges associated with integrating smart energy systems at the university campus from a policy and technical perspective are then discussed. This is followed by a review of building and campus-scale frameworks supporting a transition to smart energy campuses using the BPIE’ Smart Buildings' framework. The paper finds that the complexity of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for new and existing higher education buildings and energy systems can be addressed with the adoption of ‘smart building principles' and integrating 'smartness' into their energy systems. Several universities in the UK and worldwide are integrating smart services and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in their operations following the smart campus premise. At the building level, existing frameworks often create conceptual roadmaps for the smart building premise or propose technical implementation and assessment methods. At university campus scale, implementation typically comes through single-vector interventions, and only few examples exist that propose a multi-vector approach. Comparisons of the drivers and the decision-making process are made, with carbon and cost reduction being the most prominent from leveraging distributed energy generation. Therefore, this study identified the need for a comprehensive technical or policy framework to drive the uptake of the smart energy campus, aiming to bring together the holistic value of smart energy campuses. © 2021","Decarbonisation; Framework; Renewable energy; Smart campus; Smart energy campus; Systematic literature review; United Kingdom; University campus","Buildings; Carbon; Cost reduction; Decision making; Decarbonisation; Framework; High educations; Renewable energies; Smart campus; Smart energy campus; Smart energy systems; Systematic literature review; United kingdom; University campus; Decarbonization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106893822

Quantifying the crop phenological changes caused by climate change and anthropogenic-management practices can help formulate effective climate change adaptation strategies. In this study, the effects of climate change and anthropogenic-management practices on maize phenology (spring, summer, and intercropping maize) in China were distinguished based on historical meteorological and phenological data (1981–2010) of 114 stations using the first-order difference regression method. Our results show: (1) The vegetative growing period of spring and intercropping maize was extended, whereas that of summer maize was shortened. The reproductive growing periods of spring, summer, and intercropping maize were extended. (2) Isolated impacts of climate change shortened the vegetative growing period of spring maize, summer maize, and intercropping maize by 0.19, 1.06, and 3.12 d decade−1, respectively, while the reproductive growing period was extended by 0.19, 0.74, and 3.47 d decade−1, respectively. (3) The contribution of temperature to maize phenology was greater in the northwest inland maize zone and north spring maize zone than in other regions, whereas the contribution of sunshine hours was higher in Huang-Huai Plain intercropping maize zone and the southwest mountain hills maize zone. (4) The effects of anthropogenic-management practices on maize phenological stages such as sowing, emergence, and maturity were generally greater than that of climate change, which has delayed the phenological stages of summer and intercropping maize and extended the growing period of spring maize. The focus should be paid to the emergence, jointing, and milky stages to increase the water use efficiency in the northwest inland maize zone. The findings provide a scientific basis for improving the adaptability of agricultural systems in climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic-management practices; China; Climate change; First-order difference regression model; Maize phenology","adaptation; adaptive management; bioindicator; climate change; environmental assessment; intercropping; maize; management practice; phenology; sowing; strategic approach; adaptation; anthropology; Article; China; climate change; controlled study; environmental temperature; high temperature; intercropping; maize; nonhuman; phenology; precipitation; sowing date; spring; summer; vegetative growth; agriculture; season; temperature; China; North China Plain; Indicator indicator; Agriculture; China; Climate Change; Seasons; Temperature; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106893450

A city profile is designed and the literature about drivers to cities actions to climate change are used as theoretical basis. The presence of committed leaders, multilevel governance, being part of multinational cities networks and access to funding are traditional fundamental factors identified in the literature to strength climate agenda in a city which were also found in Recife. The climate risks imposed to cities with lower development level were found as important driver to climate action, unlike what previous studies showed for European cities. The article contributes evidencing factors that can decisively assist cities to strength the climate agenda, mainly in developing or less developed countries. It also provides insights for academics and policymakers about low carbon urban strategies that can be adopted by cities. This is the first city profile to address the relationship between the impacts of urban evolution in a Latin American city and the threats imposed by climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate action; Climate change; Low carbon development; Mitigation; Recife","adaptive management; climate change; mitigation; urbanization; Brazil; Latin America; Pernambuco; Recife",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106886655

We conducted a stratified sampling questionnaire survey among 1988 college students from throughout China studying in Nanjing, to examine how risk perceptions are influenced by socioeconomic factors and historical exposure among the high-educated young generation who will become leaders in future air pollution risk management and communications. First, a six-factor confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to estimate risk perception levels from the observable indices. 40 % of the participants felt air pollution levels in Nanjing were unacceptable, which suggested that air pollution control actions do not meet public expectations at the survey time. Hierarchical k-means clustering demonstrated difference in the spatial distribution of risk perception. Results showed that students from the northern part of China had higher risk acceptance, lower perceived risk, and higher government trust than other regions. Females, older participants, participants with higher education, and participants with higher economic levels were identified as risk-sensitive groups to air pollution by using linear regression analyses. The regression coefficients of risk perception and historical exposure decreased as the days tracking back to a pollution episode increased. The cut-off point where regression coefficients turned from significant to non-significant was around 60 days for risk acceptance, 10 days for perceived benefit, and 30 days for government trust. This indicates that a 2-month time window is a prime time for risk communication after a pollution episode. © 2021","Air pollution; Heterogeneity; High-educated young generation; Historical experience; Risk acceptance; Sensitive groups","adult; air pollution control; article; China; college student; confirmatory factor analysis; expectation; female; government; human; human experiment; k means clustering; leadership; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk management; risk perception; socioeconomics; stratified sample; tertiary education; trust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106882379

We analysed the data statistically in a bigleaf framework to compare the annual and seasonal carbon and water exchanges and their drivers at the two sites. The broadleaf deciduous forest at KNP varies from a weak annual carbon sink (−29 g C m−2 y-1) to a moderate source (+207 g C m−2 y-1), while the coniferous-dominated forest at KKM is a strong carbon sink (from −635 to −900 gC m−2 y-1). The component fluxes GPP and TER are much larger, and intra-annual variations are much stronger at KNP than at KKM. We found potential and actual evapotranspiration, as well as the evaporative fraction, to be higher at the broadleaf deciduous than at the coniferous forest. At both the sites, canopy-atmosphere decoupling coefficient is highest during the wet period and, as a whole, the broadleaf deciduous forest remains less tightly coupled to the atmosphere compared to its coniferous evergreen counterpart. At KNP, the biological carbon uptake primarily governs the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations (Ci/Ca), whereas at KKM it is the seasonality of surface conductance. The seasonal cycle of photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax25) is stronger at the deciduous forest than the coniferous forest, where photosynthetic capacity is retained at higher level during the winter. At both the sites, surface conductance and its intra-annual variability, due to environmental and physiological factors, and seasonal cycle of leaf-area, are the main factors controlling the seasonal patterns of surface-atmosphere coupling and ecosystem Ci/Ca. The Ci/Ca is found to decrease inversely with the square root of VPD at both the sites with the variation being similar in monsoon but widely divergent in winter. Our results will have direct implications in improving the parameterizations of the studied forest types in these models to improve their performances over this region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bigleaf model; Carbon and water fluxes; Eddy covariance; MetFlux India; Subtropical forests","Ecosystems; Forestry; Parks; Tropics; Bigleaf model; Broadleaf deciduous forests; Carbon exchange; Carbon fluxes; Eddy covariance; Metflux india; National parks; Subtropical forests; Water exchange; Water flux; Carbon; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; broad-leaved forest; carbon flux; deciduous forest; ecosystem dynamics; eddy covariance; evergreen forest; subtropical region; water exchange; Atmosphere; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forestry; Sites; Surfaces; Tropics; Water; Assam; India; Kaziranga National Park; Kosi; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106879534

These findings offer a compelling provocation for the scientific community to detect and investigate variations to air quality as a consequence of government enforced quarantine. In spite of countless research studies focusing on the connection between WFH policy and air pollutant levels, the majority of discussion has unfortunately ignored the central role of other potential sources (e.g. agricultural waste burnings, cooking emissions, and industrial releases) in governing air quality, or has neglected the psychological and social impacts of COVID-19.

In this study, the CDM tool was utilized to model methane emission reduction. The modeling results showed that methane emission reductions are 683,580 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) for the 10-year period 2021–2030, covering 0.4% of total emission in Myanmar. This study helps local authorities evaluate LFG capture and flaring facilities that could be financially self-sustaining by preventing methane emissions into the environment.

The first scenario, called the BASE scenario, was based on the projection made by the Brazilian Energy Research Company (EPE) for the Brazilian commitments at the Paris agreement, presented during the COP 21 (Conference of the parties) conference and ratified in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), assuming that all the electricity from biomass could be produced by the sugarcane sector. The second is a scenario considering a higher share of the sugar-energy sector in the Brazilian electricity matrix, called the BIO scenario. The investment needed for each scenario was evaluated, using a bottom-up approach and assuming currently available technologies. The results showed that the BIO scenario could produce 55 TWh of surplus electricity more than the BASE scenario, boosting the share of the sugar-energy sector in the electricity matrix, reaching a total of almost 130 TWh per year and requiring an additional investment that was 39% higher than in the BASE scenario. As the sugarcane surplus electricity could replace electricity from natural gas power plants, the BIO scenario could reduce emissions by 18.4 MtCO2eq in comparison with the BASE scenario. Through the input–output model used to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts, it was observed that the BIO scenario could add 919 000 job positions and cause a positive impact to the gross domestic product (GDP) of US$ 28.8 billion, which corresponds, in comparison with the BASE scenario, to adding 83 000 more job positions, and provides a 12.5% higher contribution to GDP. The total output was 8.6% higher in the BIO scenario in comparison with the BASE scenario. All of these analyses were carried out for three selected regions in the country: the traditional region, comprising São Paulo and Paraná states; the expansion region, including Goiás, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul states; and the rest of Brazil region. A spillover effect was observed over the total output in the Rest of Brazil region, showing that the impact of the investment over this region was proportionally higher in comparison to the investment done in other in other regions. The Rest of Brazil Region also presents a higher share of the indireect effects over the GDP, jobs created and total output. The final results of this research show the potential of the sugar-energy sector to boost electricity generation, which can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to preserving the share of renewable sources in the Brazilian electricity matrix and increasing energy security and generation closer to the biggest centers of consumption, mitigating challenges for electricity transmission between subsystems in the National Interconnected System (SIN). © 2021 Society of Industrial Chemistry and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","bioelectricity; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass; input-output model; NDC; sugar-energy sector; sugarcane; sugarcane surplus electricity","Economic and social effects; Economics; Electrophysiology; Energy policy; Energy security; Expansion; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gasoline plants; Bottom up approach; Electricity generation; Electricity transmission; Gross domestic products; Industrial chemistry; Natural gas power plants; Renewable sources; Socio-economic impacts; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106727827

Biomass-based fuels were responsible for more than 4 million deaths in 2012. Household energy consumption is steadily increasing across cities due to the urbanization of rural areas, more economic and travel activities. In this review, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and other bibliometric tools were applied to determine the conceptual structure and typological thematic areas of household emissions in urban areas. The current state of knowledge and opportunities towards creating carbon-neutral cities indicated that while most of the research was focussed on cities and regions of developed countries and China, the mitigation activities grouped under three broad heads - reducing emissions, consumption and impact of household emissions. Strong heterogeneity between the urban and rural areas, fuel options and human choices gave rise to fuel-stacking in developing countries. Integrated modelling and inclusion of environmental and human behavioural components into economic models were recognised as emerging fields oriented towards a systems approach. Accessibility and availability of clean energy and clean energy appliances were identified as the biggest challenges. To create carbon-neutral urban areas, integrated modelling should include categorization of carbon policy according to local conditions, analysis of feedback loops, embedded emissions, the global and regional impact of household consumption patterns, and uncertainty associated with mitigation measures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); Bibliometrix; Carbon neutral; General equilibrium models; GHG emissions; Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)","Behavioral research; Developing countries; Energy utilization; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Rural areas; Uncertainty analysis; Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); Bibliometrix; Carbon neutrals; Clean energy; General equilibrium models; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Integrated modeling; Multiple correspondence analyse; Urban areas; Carbon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106650854

The formalization of the concept of path integral formulation on which the construction of the random trajectories is based has made it possible to lay down a convenient framework to investigate sampling strategies and to design adapted low-variance algorithms. Our study focuses on the particular case of laser emission, which corresponds to a spatially-localized source emitting in a low solid angle, which partially illuminates the environment. In this case, the intrinsic characteristics of the laser emission cause problems of convergence with a Monte Carlo method due to the difficulty in statistically linking sensors (probe points) to sources. This paper proposes, using integral formulation and a Null-Collision Algorithm (NCA), a practicable and simply implementable method to avoid such constraints. The intensity is broken down into a direct and a scattered term (local estimate technique). Then, a reworking of the various integral terms makes it possible to propose a complete algorithm adapted to a collimated source partially illuminating the studied scene. Non-zero contributions are brought more continuously to the Monte Carlo weight and variance is strongly reduced. The entire methodology, from integral formulation to algorithmic interpretation, is presented step by step. For validation purposes, a new reverse and optimized Monte Carlo algorithm is compared with an analogous Monte Carlo for estimation of flux absorbed by a wall in an academic configuration, which ensures benchmark results. As the current proposed algorithm is highly suitable for building computer-generated images (probe calculation), the propagation of light due to laser emission through inhomogeneous environments is then illustrated by the construction of such images. This new tool provides useful support for experimental characterization of the radiative behaviour of particles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-generated image; Heterogeneous media; Laser emission; Monte Carlo method; Null-Collision algorithm; Radiative transfer","Monte Carlo methods; Probes; Computer-generated images; Heterogeneous media; Integral formulations; Laser emission; Meshless; Monte carlo algorithms; MonteCarlo methods; Null collisions; Null-collision algorithm; Reverse Monte Carlo; Radiative transfer; absorption; algorithm; computer simulation; laser method; Monte Carlo analysis; radiative transfer; scattering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106606174

The impact of the fuel trapping on the formation and distribution of unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) in the advanced compression-ignition concepts is not well understood. In this study, the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique was applied in a single-cylinder optical engine to visualize the fuel distribution before combustion and the formaldehyde formation during combustion. A three-dimensional computational model was established to explore the detailed mechanism of UHC formation in the piston crevice. Three cases with injection timings of 20°, 40° (SOI-40), and 100° (SOI-100) were compared. The PLIF and simulation results indicate that, under early injection conditions, the squish region and piston crevice trap a considerable amount of fuel, resulting in increased UHC emission and reduced engine work, and the main combustion zone resides in the squish region. The simulation shows that the amount of UHC formation from the trapped fuel is highly dependent on the local equivalence ratio distribution formed by different injection timings. The local equivalence ratio within the piston crevice region for the SOI-40 case exceeds 2 before combustion; the charge sequentially undergoes both low- and high-temperature heat release (LTHR and HTHR) processes and produces less UHC in the crevice region. However, the SOI-100 case produces an overall leaner mixture with a local equivalence ratio lower than 1 before combustion; the charge undergoes LTHR without noticeable HTHR and becomes UHC near the cylinder wall. The injector dribbling results in more UHC formation in the central part of the cylinder under very early injection timing, and thus an accurate injector dribbling model is required to better reproduce the UHC emissions. © 2021","Direct-injection engine; Numerical simulations; Piston crevice; Planar laser-induced fluorescence; Unburned hydrocarbons","Direct injection; Engine cylinders; Engine pistons; Fluorescence; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Ignition; Laser optics; Direct injection engines; Early injections; Hydrocarbon emission; Hydrocarbon formation; Injection timing; Local equivalence ratio; Numerical simulation; Piston crevices; Planar laser-induced fluorescence; Unburned hydrocarbons; Laser produced plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106597395

The relative importance value and niche breadth were used as comprehensive quantitative indices to characterize the status, role, and degree of dominance of plant species in the community. We found that relative importance value and niche breadth were higher overall in shrub species than in most grass species, except B. ischaemum. Meanwhile, the relative importance value was significantly correlated with plant phosphorus concentration, plant carbon:nitrogen ratio, rhizosphere soil organic carbon, rhizosphere soil total nitrogen, rhizosphere soil total phosphorus, rhizosphere bacterial α-diversity. A stepwise regression analysis indicated that, among the plant and rhizosphere characteristics of these species, only their rhizosphere bacterial α-diversity and plant root carbon concentration primarily influence ecological niche patterns of these plant species in the community. In summary, our study reveals that shrub species occupy more advantageous ecological niches than grass species in a stable community due to the active rhizosphere interactions, providing a new opportunity to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the plant community assembly in grassland. © 2021 The Authors","Niche breadth; Plant nutrients; Relative importance value; Soil microbial diversity; Soil nutrients","Bacteria; Ecology; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Regression analysis; A-stable; Ecological niche; Grass species; Niche breadth; Plant communities; Plant nutrients; Relative importance value; Shrub species; Soil microbial diversity; Soil nutrients; Soils; bacterium; dominance; grass; grassland; niche breadth; phosphorus; plant community; regression analysis; rhizosphere; shrub; soil microorganism; species diversity; China; Loess Plateau; Artemisia gmelinii; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bothriochloa ischaemum; Buddleja alternifolia; Cleistogenes squarrosa; Clematis; Ischaemum; Lespedeza bicolor; Periploca sepium; Sophora viciifolia; Stipa bungeana; Stipa grandis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106568643

Three categories of HPEs have been defined: HPE Ι, II, and III, corresponding to HPE durations of 1, 2, and at least 3 days, respectively. Sixty HPEs were investigated in this study. The number of HPEs decreased from 2013 to 2017 and then increased from 2017 to 2019, dominated by emission reductions and meteorological conditions. The average and maximum PM2.5 (i.e., aerodynamic diameter of &lt;2.5 μm) concentrations during those HPEs in 2019 decreased by 5.6%–11.8% and 11.9%–38.5%, respectively, compared with those in 2013. The longer the duration of an HPE, the higher the PM2.5 concentration. Secondary inorganic aerosol concentrations and their contents in PM2.5 during HPE Ⅲ were found to be higher than those during HPEs Ι and Ⅱ, as secondary transformations of precursor gases are more intense during long-term HPEs. The dominant trajectories of airflow arriving in Jinan originated from the southern and southeastern regions during HPEs, realized using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory. The trajectories from the north and west of Jinan contained the highest PM2.5 concentrations of 323.3–432.1 μg/m3 during HPE Ⅲ, although these trajectories only contributed 5.6%–11.1% of the total dominant transport pathways, while those in trajectories from the northwest were highest during HPEs Ι and Ⅱ. The highest contributions of air masses from short distances were found during HPE Ⅲ, of 77.8%, while they were only 65.6% and 47.8% during HPEs Ι and II, respectively. More attention should be given to transport pathways within the short distance from Jinan. Therefore, enhancing regional cooperation in Jinan and surrounding regions (particularly in the south, southeast, northwest, west, and north) is critical for improving air quality in the North China Plain. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air-mass trajectory; Heavy pollution episode; HYSPLIT; Regional transport; WRF-Chem","Aerodynamics; Air quality; Emission control; Air mass; Air mass trajectories; Heavy pollution episode; HYSPLIT; North China Plain; PM$-2.5$; Pollution episodes; Regional transport; Transport pathways; WRF/Chem; Trajectories; aerosol; air mass; airflow; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollutant transport; trajectory; aerosol; air quality; airflow; article; attention; China; gas; major clinical study; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; urbanization; China; Jinan [Shandong]; North China Plain; Shandong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106504361

The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of the construction of 1-MW GCSPV power stations at four locations in Jiangsu Province, China. The economic, environmental, sensitivity, and risk analyses of the proposed systems were performed using the RETScreen clean energy management software. The GCSPV systems in Xuzhou are more economically viable than those in the other regions under consideration, whereas the systems in Nanjing are relatively less economically feasible. The GCSPV power stations in Xuzhou have the largest reduction in annual greenhouse gases emissions, because of producing the most electricity from the proposed system. Sensitivity analysis results on the net present value (NPV) show significant variations owing to the variations of the electricity export rate (EER) and initial costs (ICs) parameters. The NPV of the proposed system increases from $707,589 to $2,046,766 with an increasing EER, while the NPV of the system decreases with increasing ICs at the same EER. The risk analysis shows the largest influence on the NPV of the project is the change of the EER with positive correlation, while the least impact on the NPV is the debt term with positive correlation.

In Pennsylvania, predicted SOC to 1 m decreased at 0.07 Mg ha–1 yr–1 in corn–soybean under CT or NT with stover removal, but increased by 0.71 Mg ha–1 yr–1 in dairy forage NT and manure added under climate change. The responses of SOC to climate change were affected by management, biomass type, edaphic properties, local climate, and agroecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.

However, the economic impacts of agroforestry are still poorly understood. We evaluate the impacts of the diffusion of agroforestry systems on the cattle herd and the total value of agricultural production in Brazil. We use panel data models with municipal-level information from the Agricultural Censuses 2006 and 2017. We check the robustness of our estimates combining several empirical strategies, including spatial panel data model and instrumental variable estimators. We also consider that agroforestry impacts may differ according to the biome and crops used in the integrated systems. Our results highlight that agroforestry systems' diffusion had positive and relevant impacts on the stocking rate (heads/pasture area). Agroforestry may have also stimulated the shift from cattle raising to other activities with higher gross added value, such as soybean. In fact, the most significant economic impacts of agroforestry occur when the diffusion of agroforestry systems is related to soybean cultivation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural productivity; Cattle farming; Integrated crop-livestock-forestry; Panel data models","agricultural production; agroforestry; cattle; cultivation; economic impact; mixed farming; panel data; productivity; soybean; spatial data; Brazil; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106394978

These include the four largest non-G20 fossil CO2 emitting Parties to the UN climate convention pre- Paris Agreement (Iran, Kazakhstan, Thailand and Ukraine) and one of the largest land-use GHG emitters in the world (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Other countries assessed include major economies in their respective regions (Chile, Colombia, Morocco and the Philippines). In addition to economy-wide GHG emissions projections, we also assessed the projected GHG emissions peak year and the progression of per capita GHG emissions up to 2030. Our GHG emissions projections are also compared with previous studies. On economy-wide GHG emissions, Colombia, Iran, Morocco, and Ukraine were projected to likely meet or significantly overachieve their unconditional 2030 targets with existing policies, while DRC and Thailand would come very close to their targets. Kazakhstan and the Philippines would need to strengthen their action to meet their targets, while Chile recently raised its 2030 target ambition. Only Colombia and Ukraine are projected to have peaked their emissions by 2030. Per capita GHG emissions excluding land-use under current policies were projected to increase in all countries from 2010 levels by 8 % to over 40 % depending on the country. While the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on 2030 emissions is highly uncertain, our assessment on the target achievement would not change for most countries when the emission reductions estimated for 2020 in the literature were assumed to remain in 2030. The findings of this study highlight the importance of enhanced and frequent progress-tracking of climate action of major emitters outside G20, as is currently done for G20 members, to ensure that the global collective progress will become aligned with the pathways toward Paris climate goals. © 2021 The Authors","Climate policy; Greenhouse gas emission scenario; Nationally determined contribution (NDC); Non-G20; Paris agreement","carbon dioxide; Article; carbon footprint; Chile; climate; Colombia; Congo; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental policy; government; greenhouse gas; Iran; Kazakhstan; land use; Morocco; Philippines; priority journal; Thailand; Ukraine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106391475

While previous research shows that crop diversification may increase or decrease technical efficiency in different regions, research on whether crop diversification involves a tradeoff between technical efficiency and income variability is limited. Using agricultural production data from Northern Ghana, this study uses the stochastic input distance function to examine the effects of crop diversification on technical efficiency. The study further explores effects of crop diversification on income variability using an ordinary least square regression to understand the nexus between technical efficiency and income variability in crop diversification. The results show evidence against a ‘tradeoff’ between technical efficiency and income stability for farmers in Northern Ghana. We find that crop diversification significantly improves efficiency and reduces income variability in Northern Ghana, so farmers do not have to give up efficiency for income stability or vice versa. This suggests that crop diversification could be an ideal Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) strategy for promoting agricultural growth and resilience in Northern Ghana. While our data has a maximum of three crops, which could limit generalization of results to farmers who grow more than three crops, our results make a novel contribution to the literature on crop diversification. © 2021 The Author(s)","Crop diversification; Income variability; Northern Ghana; Technical efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106388849

Theoretically, they are operated in an overall stoichiometric condition. In addition, high pressure is preferred not only for better thermal efficiency but also for easier CO2 capture and storage. In this study, a triple-coaxial-tube was selected as the simplest conceptual design for an oxy-combustion burner at elevated pressure. Flame stabilization, soot emissions, and combustion efficiencies were investigated in relation to variation of the tube size, CO2 dilution ratio, and pressure. As a result, a jet Reynolds number and CO2 diffusion could explain the flame stabilization limits. Soot emission could be reduced at atmospheric pressure when the fuel-tube tip was moved into the middle oxidant tube, which also improved the combustion efficiency. Nevertheless, serious soot emissions recurred at excessive fuel flow rates and at elevated pressures. In such conditions, a lifted flame detached from the fuel-tube tip could be employed by increasing the flow rate or enhancing the CO2 dilution, and the soot emission was reduced again without losing combustion efficiency. Finally, the flame-stabilization mechanisms of the attached flame and of the lifted flame were discussed and optimized designs and operating conditions were proposed for less soot emission and better combustion efficiency at higher pressures. © 2021 The Combustion Institute","Combustion efficiency; Elevated pressure; Lifted flame; Oxy-combustion; Soot emission","Atmospheric pressure; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Dust; Fuels; Reynolds number; Soot; Stabilization; Tubes (components); Combustion efficiencies; Condition; Elevated pressure; Flame soot; Flame stabilization; High pressure; Jet flames; Lifted flames; Oxy combustions; Soot emissions; Efficiency; carbon dioxide; methane; oxygen; Article; atmospheric pressure; boundary layer; combustion; diffusion; dilution; flame; flow rate; high temperature; laminar flow; priority journal; soot; steady state; turbulent flow; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106324989

Rich plant communities dominated by Gondwanan trees and other species with tropical modern distribution vanished and those with cool and arid distributions rose to prominence. Rather than a single event, this landscape-level floristic replacement may have occurred as pulses following the paleoclimatic dynamism of the Coolhouse state (~34–4 Ma). However, the associated shifts in diversity and in climatically-key sensitive plant species have never been studied in detail so far. Here, we estimated richness using robust (non-parametric) methods and selected climatically-sensitive species to trace back past floristic trends in the high southern latitudes during the Coolhouse state. We used a high resolution palynological record from well-constrained Patagonian sediments from the Early Oligocene to the Late Miocene (~34–10 Ma), spanning most of the Coolhouse state. Our fossil data reveal the presence of five major floristic phases, closely linked with global climate states and regional orographic events. We found that diversity rises during global warming periods (↑100% at the Late Oligocene Warming Event or LOWE and ↑50% at the Miocene Climatic Optimum or MCO) and drops during glaciation periods (↓60% at Oi-1 (earliest Oligocene), ↓50% at Mi-1 (earliest Miocene) and ↓35% at Mi-3 (Middle Miocene) glaciation events) or intense tectonism (↓60% after the Andean uplift), relative to background levels. The representation of warm-demanding taxa peaked during LOWE and MCO, while arid-adapted taxa rose briefly during the MCO and took over following the major surface uplift of the southern Andes by 15–14 Ma. Humid-demanding species (e.g., tree-ferns) showed a general decreasing trend in abundance from their climax at 34 Ma to their minimum occurrence at 10 Ma. Our study reveals the potential of using robust statistical diversity methods in unraveling the relationship between past floras and climatic-orogenic forcing during the Coolhouse state. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Coolhouse state; Fossil record; Plant richness; Pollen and spores; Southern Andean uplift; Southern South America","Forestry; Global warming; Plants (botany); Background level; Glaciation period; Plant communities; Sensitive plants; Sensitive species; Southern latitudes; Southern south america; Statistical diversity; Glacial geology; flora; fossil record; glaciation; global climate; Miocene; modernization; Oligocene; uplift; Andes; Antarctica; Patagonia; Mimosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106303598

Anthropogenic Greenhouse gases (GHG) are produced through burning fossil fuel leading to an increase in the global warming effect; thus, GHG reduction contributes to mitigating climate change. Utilizing renewable energies, increasing efficiency of and capacity factor (CF) of existing power plants, and recycling waste energy in various industries are convenient solutions to improve the energy systems performance to reduce fossil fuel consumption, leading to GHG emission. So, there is a substantial need for planning and evaluating the energy systems in which various technologies are used, technically and economically. Theis study's main objectives are utilizing the capacity of renewable energies such as biomass, wind, solar, hydropower, and enhancement of CF and efficiency of the power plants in the Mazandaran region in the south of the Caspian Sea. The energy system considered for the region is modeled and analyzed by six scenarios in this paper. The results indicated that the share of renewable energies in electricity production could be increased from 5.4% to 47.7%. The results of cost analysis show that by applying the sixth scenario, which is integrated policies of increasing RER share and improvement of efficiency and capacity factor. The trends of total annual cost, CO2 emission, and fossil fuel consumption are reduced compared to the business as usual (BAU) scenario. The average cost saved by this scenario is about 220 MUSD/year.

Consequently, desert regions are now targeted for development of large-scale photovoltaic solar energy facilities. Where vegetation communities are left intact or restored within facilities, ground-mounted infrastructure may have negative impacts on desert-adapted plants because it creates novel rainfall runoff and shade conditions. We used experimental solar arrays in the Mojave Desert to test how these altered conditions affect population dynamics for a closely related pair of native annual plants: rare Eriophyllum mohavense and common E. wallacei. We estimated aboveground demographic rates (seedling emergence, survivorship, and fecundity) over 7 yr and used seed bank survival rates from a concurrent study to build matrix models of population growth in three experimental microhabitats. In drier years, shade tended to reduce survival of the common species, but increase survival of the rare species. In a wet year, runoff from panels tended to increase seed output for both species. Population growth projections from microhabitat-specific matrix models showed stronger effects of microhabitat under wetter conditions, and relatively little effect under dry conditions (lack of rainfall was an overwhelming constraint). Performance patterns across microhabitats in the wettest year differed between rare and common species. Projected growth of E. mohavense was substantially reduced in shade, mediated by negative effects on aboveground demographic rates. Hence, the rare species were more susceptible to negative effects of panel infrastructure in wet years that are critical to seed bank replenishment. Our results suggest that altered shade and water runoff regimes associated with energy infrastructure will have differential effects on demographic transitions across annual species and drive population-level processes that determine local abundance, resilience, and persistence. © 2021 The Authors.

These voluntary programmes provide cities with benefits (e.g., knowledge, recognition, access to resources) if they meet the city network's programme requirements. This article seeks to understand how city networks make trade-offs between programme benefits and requirements to attract cities to the programmes they offer. We do so by analysing 55 voluntary programmes offered by 22 climate-related city networks using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). We are particularly interested in the design of voluntary programmes that attract large numbers of participants. We find three main insights. First, programmes with a clear, single benefit are more attractive to city members than programmes with a broad range of benefits. Second, the combination of programme requirements and commitments allows city networks to target cohorts of cities based on their capacities and needs. Finally, cities are attracted to programmes that do not explicitly ask for direct results. © 2021 The Authors.

To understand the underlying political drivers, we carry out expert interviews and examine how individual actors and their objectives, as well as the country context influence energy policy formulation. We find that under President Joko Widodo, energy policy formulation has been driven by the development of public infrastructure, while securing popularity for the presidential election in 2019. State-owned enterprises represent a source of political patronage and are employed to achieve those goals. Diminishing export markets have incentivized the politically well-connected and highly concentrated Indonesian coal industry to lobby for the construction of coal-fired power plants in order to raise domestic demand. There is also a strong incentive to sustain coal mining as a key economic activity, as associated royalties significantly contribute to local and national public budgets. Local pollution and climate change mitigation are of low priority. Despite the government's documented awareness of the energy sector as the biggest contributor to future emissions, climate protection is narrowly framed as a forestry and land-use issue. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coal; Indonesia; Mining; Political economy; Power generation","article; awareness; budget; climate change; coal mining; coal power; election; electric power plant; forestry; government; human; incentive; Indonesia; interview; land use; lobbying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105967486

When this occurs, it can lead to the formation of a policy implementation network. Surprisingly, there is a limited understanding of the characteristics of the members of such networks, the structure of the multi-level and cross-sectoral ties among them, and about how they relate to how these networks are governed. This paper initiates the development of such knowledge by calculating a variety of network statistics to analyse the policy implementation network formed to carry out Ireland's signature climate policy—The Climate Action Plan 2019. Results show that national level actors dominate, and that cross-level and cross-sectoral collaboration are limited. The plan is governed by a network administrative organisation (NAO), with the Department of the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) filling the role. How the network is structured and governed increases the likelihood that the network will be stable, have a unity of purpose and be able to meet its objectives. However, the dominance of national-level actors and its centralized structure are likely to make it challenging for the NAO to gain the support of local-level actors. This paper's methodological approach can be applied in other contexts to understand inter-actor relations and how these affect the responsibilities, challenges and opportunities of the actors involved in the implementation of a national environmental policy. © 2021 The Authors.

Planned relocation has been attempted in many communities globally and has raised serious issues of equity in some cases. Implementation driven by principles of equity is crucial in ensuring successful planned relocations that decrease loss and damage. In this Policy Analysis, we put forth a framework for equitable planned relocation rooted in theories of justice as a basis for implementation. The framework centers around three principles: comprehensive recognition of affected stakeholders in decision-making, consideration of socio-cultural risk factors relevant to relocation, and evaluation of multiple measures of well-being. There are many actors involved in planned relocation. Unique features and abilities of international organizations lend themselves to promoting equitable planned relocation in partnership with other stakeholders. Through the exploration of case studies, we identify best practices that international organizations have available to influence the design, implementation, and evaluation of planned relocation processes. These practices are relevant when striving for equity for all affected individuals and communities. Points of intervention include agenda-setting and advocacy, funding and implementation standards, and facilitation of international cooperation. International organizations also face barriers to supporting equitable planned relocation. Limitations include lack of enforcement mechanisms, limited resources, and fundamental dependence on existing governance structures and global collaboration. As the necessity of planned relocations grows, the need for leadership from international organizations in implementation is magnified, underscoring the importance of developing and evaluating approaches to just implementation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate migration; Climate mobility; Equitable planned relocation; International organizations; Planned relocation","equity; global change; international cooperation; leadership; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105955048

An observed decline in South Africa's maize production over the last few decades has raised questions about the capacity of institutions responsible for providing climate change-related adaptive support to maize farmers in the country. This study assessed the adaptive capacity of management institutions in South Africa supporting maize producers, using a combination of literature review, document analysis, and in-depth interviews applied in the adaptive capacity wheel (ACW) assessment tool. On the basis of the results obtained from this analysis, the adaptive capacity of South African institutions responsible for climate change response processes was scored as medium. Findings from the research suggest that the advances made to date in South Africa in terms of climate change-related policy development, resource allocation, and capacity development could be inadequate, given the extent of identified institutional weaknesses, capacity constraints, knowledge, and information limitations. The study concludes that an inability to address current institutional limitations, considering the threats associated with climate change, may result in intensified social and economic challenges in the maize production sector. The study recommends the consistent revision and capacitation of these institutions to enable them to provide the type of support that will ensure effective adaptive responses for farmers involved in maize production in the country.

However, efforts to better theorize the drivers of integration beyond listing explanatory factors remain weak. Viewing integration as a process of policy change for dealing with complex problems, this study argues that policy integration analysis can benefit from an advocacy coalition approach (ACF) to address this theoretical gap. It illustrates the analytical framework by empirically investigating the drivers of policy (dis)integration in Brazil’s subnational water policy introduced in the 2010s. The level of conflict between coalitions, adjustment of policy beliefs, coordination within and across coalitions, and existence of venues for interaction and policy-oriented learning were presented as factors that can foster or hinder the integration of public policies. Moreover, the study discusses the potential to acknowledge in ACF the mechanisms for coordinating policy actors and instruments, which would facilitate the analysis of the policy processes of cooperation. It also demonstrates that recent droughts in Northeast Brazil have been increasingly related to the local impacts of climate change, contributing to reframing water management as a cross-sectoral climate and water governance issue.

Within this wide array of measures, managed retreat of communities at risk is usually only taken into account if other strategies are ineffective or unavailable. Communities who are affected by managed retreat are confronted with radical changes in their livelihood. However, managed retreat is highly contested. The use of managed retreat includes not only the relocation of house owners but also has the challenge that it discriminates between landowners as some gain and others lose. Therefore, managed retreat raises issues of social justice. To mitigate the impact on land, compensation plays a crucial role in flood risk management. The level and kind of compensation varies between countries across the globe. In this paper, we compare two different policy compensation frameworks in two European countries: Austria and England. The comparative study shows how different compensation schemes affect social justice, both in terms of substantive distributions but also in terms of procedural justice. © 2021, The Author(s).","Comparative studies; Compensation; Equity; Fairness; Planned relocation; Policy analysis","compensation system; flood; hazard assessment; inventory; landowner; livelihood; relocation; social justice; Austria; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105937613

We investigated whether stream chemistry (i.e., SO42−) also benefits from this transition. Using publicly available data from Pennsylvania (PA), a U.S. state with heavy usage of coal as fuel, we found that the impact of SO2 emissions on stream SO42− can be observed as far as 63 km from power plants. We developed a novel model that incorporates an emission-control technology trend for coal-fired power plants to quantify potentially avoided SO2 emissions and stream SO42− as power plants switched from coal to gas. The results show that, if 30% of the electricity generated by coal in PA in 2017 had been replaced by that from natural gas, a total of 20.3 thousand tons of SO2 emissions could have been avoided and stream SO42− concentrations could have decreased as much as 10.4%. Extrapolating the model to other states in the U.S., we found that as much as 46.1 thousand tons of SO2 emissions per state could have been avoided for a similar 30% coal-to-gas switch, with potential amelioration of water quality near power plants. The emission-control technology trend model provides a valuable tool for policy makers to assess the benefits of coal-to-gas shifts on water quality improvements as well as the effectiveness of emission control technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Coal; Natural gas; Power plant; SO2 emissions; Stream SO42- Concentration; Technology trend model","Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Water quality; Emission control technologies; Pennsylvania; Power; SO$-2$; SO$-4$/$+2-$; SO2 emission; Stream SO42- concentration; Sulfate concentrations; Technology trend model; Technology trends; Coal; coal; natural gas; shale gas; sulfate; unclassified drug; sulfate; coal; concentration (composition); natural gas; power plant; shale gas; stream; sulfate; sulfur emission; trend analysis; water chemistry; Article; concentration (parameter); electric power plant; electricity; stream (river); trend study; United States; water pollution; water quality; air pollutant; air pollution; Pennsylvania; river; Pennsylvania; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Coal; Natural Gas; Pennsylvania; Power Plants; Rivers; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105894334

Characteristics of both southwest monsoon (aka summer monsoon) and northeast monsoon (aka winter monsoon or return monsoon) are analysed while assessing the performance. Indian monsoon is largely affected by climate change and studies demand a long-term (climatological scale) simulation and analysis. Furthermore, the vast study area consists of wide variation of topography and climatology that cause variation in best performing CCS across the HMRs. Month-wise and season-wise performances of different CCSs, namely Grell, and its combinations with Emmanuel as mixed schemes, such as Grell over Ocean and Emmanuel over Land (GOEL), and Grell over Land and Emmanuel over Ocean (GLEO) are assessed by using these schemes in the Regional Climate Model Version 4.4 (RegCM4.4) over a span of 34 years (1982 to 2015). The spatio-temporal variation of bias, investigated using the observed and simulated rainfall, shows more realistic performance for the peak monsoon months and positive bias during onset and retreating monsoon. Additionally, the spatio-temporal variation over the HMRs is investigated and the best possible CCS or a combination of CCSs is recommended. The better ability of mixed schemes in simulating the summer monsoon is noticed, particularly late monsoon, as compared to the early monsoon. Furthermore, GOEL performs best as compared to others to capture the spatial variation including peninsular India. The spatial distribution of observed rainfall during return monsoon is also well captured by the mixed schemes. However, GLEO scheme is found to be the best during return monsoon. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cumulus convective schemes; Homogeneous monsoon regions; long-term simulation; Northeast monsoon; Regional climate model version 4.4 (RegCM4.4); Southwest monsoon","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Clouds; Rain; Topography; Cumulus convection; Cumulus convective scheme; Homogeneous monsoon region; Long term simulation; Mixed schemes; Northeast monsoon; Performance; Regional climate model version 4.4; Regional climate models; Southwest monsoon; Climate models; cloud microphysics; computer simulation; convective cloud; cumulus; monsoon; numerical model; performance assessment; rainfall; regional climate; spatiotemporal analysis; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105891287

Field experiments were conducted to investigate the soil salt accumulation, responses, and yield simulation of winter wheat to the alternate irrigation strategies during 2017–2019. Five irrigation strategies included rain-fed cultivation (NI), fresh and saline water irrigation (FS), fresh water irrigation (FF), saline water irrigation (SS), and saline and fresh water irrigation (SF) during the growth stages. Irrigation with saline water increased soil salinity level and could be balanced annually; however, the leaf gas exchange of winter wheat was almost not significantly affected. The salinity caused by saline water irrigation negatively influenced the vegetative growth. The grain yield was increased by 24% and 32% under the FS and SF treatments compared to NI, while a minor reduction by 12% and 5% in yield under these treatments was recorded compared with the FF treatment. The SALTMED model was calibrated and validated to predict yield, and the high value of the R2 reflected a good agreement between modeled and observed values, indicating that the SALTMED model was able to simulate grain yield under the alternate irrigation strategies in the regional climate condition. Supplementary irrigation using saline water at the stem elongation stage and fresh water at the flowering stage is a practical solution to achieve comparable yields with low risk of salt accumulation for winter wheat particularly in the NCP. © 2021, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.","Brackish water; Growth; Model; Rain-fed; Salinity; Yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105873324

To date, the focus has been placed on the direct effects of warming on soil microbial communities, overlooking how concurrent changes in plant communities may mediate these effects. Additionally, few studies have examined long-term effects of warming in more than one environmental context. In the present study, we conducted a long-term simulated warming experiment to investigate how changes to the plant community within two different environmental contexts affect the responses of soil microorganisms and their respiration to warming. We analyzed the abundance, diversity, and community composition of plants and soil microbes, in addition to soil microbial interaction networks and soil microbial respiration, in two typical ecosystems of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Following long-term warming, the soil microbial composition, structure, and interactions changed, and the shifts depended on the aboveground plant type. Specifically, the co-occurring networks containing different microbial communities tended to be more complex in a shrubland than in a grassland after warming, leading to higher carbon use efficiency. Additionally, long-term warming changed the structure of soil microbial communities, increasing the relative abundances of oligotrophic taxa in the shrubland but not in the grassland. The shifts in community structure and interaction patterns could be explained by vegetation community attributes, highlighting the strong effect of plants on soil microbial responses. These plant-mediated effects on community structure and interactions subsequently could explain changes in soil microbial respiration rates. Microbial respiration showed a positive response to elevated temperature in the grassland but no response to temperature in the shrubland. These results indicate that interactions between soil microbial communities and plant communities determine how soil microbes respond to global warming. Therefore, future research on soil microbial community composition and associated carbon feedbacks to the climate change should include plant-mediated effects, which can provide a scientific basis for effectively mitigating global warming. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Microbial community; Plant; Qinghai–Tibet Plateau; Respiration rate","climate change; community composition; global warming; microbial activity; microbial community; plant community; shrubland; soil microorganism; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105835905

Here, the physiologic and metabolic responses at the base of CO2 assimilation were investigated in conditions of high or low CO2 availability in two of the most promising algae species for industrial cultivation, Chlorella sorokiniana and Chlorella vulgaris. In both species, high CO2 availability increased biomass accumulation with specific increase of triacylglycerols in C. vulgaris and polar lipids and proteins in C. sorokiniana. Moreover, high CO2 availability caused only in C. vulgaris a reduced NAD(P)H/NADP+ ratio and reduced mitochondrial respiration, suggesting a CO2 dependent increase of reducing power consumption in the chloroplast, which in turn influences the redox state of the mitochondria. Several rearrangements of the photosynthetic machinery were observed in both species, differing from those described for the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, where adaptation to carbon availability is mainly controlled by the translational repressor NAB1. NAB1 homologous protein could be identified only in C. vulgaris but lacked the regulation mechanisms previously described in C. reinhardtii. Acclimation strategies to cope with a fluctuating inorganic carbon supply are thus diverse among green microalgae, and these results suggest new biotechnological strategies to boost CO2 fixation. © 2021 The Authors.

Coastal ecosystems are extremely exposed and dynamic, where changes in seaweed assemblages have been associated with changing water temperatures. However, at local scale, the effects of changes in the upwelling events and related stressors seek further exploration. Location: Galicia rías, North West of the Iberian Peninsula. Methods: Using data collected in 42 sampling localities in Galicia rias and over two time periods (1998 and 2014), we analysed changes in the seaweed community's composition through time and space. We calculated the temporal beta-diversity index and spatial beta-diversity as the pairwise composition differences between sampling localities. We use generalized dissimilarity models, to identify local environmental drivers of spatial and temporal beta-diversity. Results: We found a significant change in seaweed communities of Galicia rias, between 1998 and 2014 (temporal beta-diversity). They were mostly related to species loss rather than to species replacement. The dissimilarity among localities (spatial beta-diversity) was significantly higher in 2014 than in 1998. Nitrate concentration was consistently predicted as the main driver of both temporal and spatial beta-diversity patterns. Main conclusions: Unlike other studies in marine ecosystems, our results suggest that observed changes in the structure of perennial seaweed assemblages in Galicia Rias might lead to a local biotic heterogenization, indirectly linked to climate change through changes in nutrients availability and the upwelling intensity.

They house a complex rumen microbial community that enables the host to digest their plant feed through microbial-mediated fermentation. However, the rumen microbiome is also responsible for the production of one of the most potent greenhouse gases, methane, and contributes about 18% of its total anthropogenic emissions. Conventional methods to lower methane production by ruminants have proved successful, but to a limited and often temporary extent. An increased understanding of the host–microbiome interactions has led to the development of new mitigation strategies. In this Review we describe the composition, ecology and metabolism of the rumen microbiome, and the impact on host physiology and the environment. We also discuss the most pertinent methane mitigation strategies that emerged to balance food security and environmental impacts. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.",,"hydrogen; methane; Actinobacteria; antibiotic resistance; Bacteroidetes; breeding; ecology; environmental impact; Euryarchaeota; Fibrobacteres; Firmicutes; food chain; food security; genetics; metabolism; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial interaction; microbiome; nonhuman; Proteobacteria; Review; rumen; spirochete; trophic level; animal; bacterium; classification; environment; intestine flora; microbiology; physiology; rumen; ruminant; Animals; Bacteria; Environment; Food Security; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Rumen; Ruminants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105773708

However, not many studies have considered estimating final consumer embedded emissions, which can be calculated by endogenizing all final demand categories except for final consumers. Endogenization refers to the process of converting a final demand category to an intermediate industrial producer. In addition, this lack of literature has also led to a lack of focus on final consumer embedded carbon externalities. Here the authors modify the input-output model to endogenize additional final demand categories and develop a method for presenting final consumer embedded net carbon externalities. The findings show that the endogenization of both capital formation and final imports increased the Chinese household carbon footprint by 33%. While endogenizing these two final demand categories increased the carbon footprint of the Chinese government by 14%. The Chinese government imposed net carbon externality on Chinese households by consuming products of thirteen different sectors. Urban households levied net carbon externality on rural households by end-use of all sectors. This presentation of final consumer embedded emissions provides the final consumer's actual carbon footprint from all sources. In addition, presenting net embedded carbon externalities can help develop a more effective and fair mechanism for assigning responsibility for embedded emissions between different types of end-users. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon externality; China; CO2 emission; Consumer; Emission responsibility; Input-output model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105722907

Societies across the world are working to adapt to climate change, but climate adaptation is currently inadequate to meet the needs of the people left increasingly vulnerable and the places that risk being irreversibly changed or destroyed. One tactic of climate adaptation is strategic retreat, sometimes referred to as managed retreat. Strategic retreat is the process by which the government or another entity purchases (buys out) developed properties that are at risk of destruction or have been destroyed by natural disasters. The structure is most often demolished, and the land is placed under a permanent easement to prevent future development. What happens next is dependent on the entities involved in the buyouts, and can range from derelict, vacant lots to full restoration of ecosystems and their abilities to mitigate flood damage. Sometimes recreational amenities, such as trails or park infrastructure, are prioritized and funded as well. Conservation organizations can leverage their expertise in conservation planning, land acquisition and restoration, policy advocacy, and partnership development to improve the implementation of strategic retreat so that nature and people can thrive in the long term. In this policy paper, we review ways that conservation organizations have and can continue to engage in buyout processes to ensure positive outcomes for communities and nature. Conservation organizations must also evolve their approaches to climate adaptation to integrate equity and redress historical injustices in land use, and contribute towards improving strategic retreat for a more just and resilient future across disaster-prone communities. This work focuses on the context of disasters and climate adaptation in the USA, though many of the principles presented are applicable around the world. © 2021, The Author(s).","Buyouts; Climate adaptation; Conservation; Environmental justice; Managed retreat; Restoration","adaptive management; conservation management; equity; flood damage; government; natural disaster; organization; prioritization; strategic approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105710086

It can affect soils ecosystem services directly through land management and indirectly through changes in the socioeconomic environment, which eventually leads to an increase in emissions of greenhouse gases. Soil carbon (C) sequestration plays an important role in offsetting the anthropogenic C emissions. However, there is limited knowledge of how urbanization affects the soil C especially that in suburban. In this study, we studied changes in easily oxidizable organic C (EOC) and total organic C (TOC) of suburban soils (0–100 cm) in the rapid urbanising megacity Chengdu, China. The EOC stock and TOC stock decreased from the outer-suburb to the inner-suburb by 17.8–28.2% and 5.4–13.5%, respectively; particularly, the inner-suburb EOC decreased by 31.4–38.6% during the past 10 years. The quotient of EOC/TOC in the soil profile, reflecting the stability of soil C, declined from the outer-suburb (0.78) to the inner-suburb (0.20). Factors that influenced the EOC and TOC included the changes in economics (economic density, industrialization), farmland (cultivated area, farmland structure), urbanization (city size, population growth) and traffic flow. Among which, economic density growth was the primarily driver of the loss in TOC, explaining 31.6% of the variation in soil surface TOC and 16.0% of the variation in subsoil TOC; changes in farmland and urban expansion were the main factors contributing to the loss of subsoil EOC, with 40.4% explanatory ability. In addition, traffic flow also has contribution to the subsoil EOC loss. We concluded that the increasing soil C loss with decreasing distance from the city centre has a continuous contribution to C emission, and the C loss will persist until the suburbs are fully urbanized. The large losses of EOC and TOC caused by urbanization, and their contribution to global warming, necessitate their consideration in future appraisals of climate change and urban planning projects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","C stability; Driving force; Rapid urbanization; Soil profile; Suburban area","Economics; Ecosystems; Farms; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Population statistics; Urban growth; C emissions; C stability; Chengdu; Driving forces; Megacities; Organics; Rapid urbanizations; Soil profiles; Suburban areas; Suburban soils; Soils; organic carbon; megacity; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil profile; suburban area; urbanization; agricultural land; analytical parameters; Article; carbon sequestration; China; city planning; climate change; concentration (parameter); cultivated land; economic development; greenhouse effect; industrialization; land use; oxidizable organic carbon; population growth; population size; socioeconomics; soil analysis; suburban area; total organic carbon; traffic; urbanization; Chengdu; China; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105699252

Many of them are ageing and are now being considered for the replacement to reduce the carbon intensity in electricity generation. One of the main routes to achieve this goal is by scaling-up the deployment of the renewable energy system (RES). However, the increasing share of variable RES tends to affect the electrical grid operation. Hence, the need for reliable and flexible energy sources has emerged to cope with the variability in electricity and energy markets. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are emerging as alternatives to baseload fossil fuel systems and retiring large nuclear plants, primarily due to their small capacity and less-capital intensive characteristics. The intermittency of power generation in the grid with a higher share of RES can be coped with in synergetic and effective way by adopting SMRs that form a nuclear-renewable synergy in fulfilling the electricity demand. Furthermore, SMRs are designed to operate in load-following mode adjusting the power output as demand of electricity fluctuates. SMRs feature modularity intended to enable enhanced constructability and phased-deployment, adapting to the increased share of renewable energy in a distributed energy system, as energy demand increases. This paper will highlight the main outcomes of miscellaneous recent studies on the integrated energy systems carried out by international experts under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The final publication of the study discusses the potential synergy of SMRs with RES for electric power production, as well as for other clean-energy applications including seawater desalination, district heating, and hydrogen production. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","hybrid; integrated energy systems; nuclear; renewable; small modular reactor","Desalination; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen production; Renewable energy resources; Small nuclear reactors; Conventional energy systems; Distributed energy systems; Electric power production; Electricity generation; Fossil-fueled power plants; Integrated energy systems; International atomic energy agency; Renewable energy systems (RES); Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105685313

Since 2000, investor–state dispute settlement mechanisms have increasingly been used against Northern countries to obtain compensation for and constrain policy decisions around nationalisation and remunicipalisation, as well as around the environmental or social regulation of service provision that threatens commercial interests. Social movements and governments alike resisted investor–state dispute settlement mechanisms, and despite the power wielded by multinational companies, the global trend is now to exclude investor–state dispute settlement mechanisms from new investment treaties. The purpose of this article is to provide a political-economy analysis of the processes of supporting and contesting the role of investor–state dispute settlement mechanisms in international treaties, processes that include activity at national, sub-national and international levels. The ensuing conflicts are analysed in terms of post-colonial contradictions over sovereignty under globalisation, continued contestation over the role of the public sector and climate change policies. Points for practitioners: The probability of investor success with investor–state dispute settlement mechanism claims should not be overestimated, and investor assessments of the basis and prospects for such cases should be subject to critical scrutiny. Governments should be aware of widespread popular antagonism towards investor–state dispute settlement mechanisms and global trends to remove such clauses from agreements. They should also review all bilateral investment treaties, free trade agreements and the Energy Charter Treaty that the country has ratified to assess the potential relative advantages of retention or leaving. © The Author(s) 2021.","bilateral investment treaties; compensation; Energy Charter Treaty; environmental regulations; globalisation; investor–state dispute settlement mechanism; municipalisation; nationalisation; populism","bilateral agreement; compensation system; environmental policy; globalization; investment; political economy; populism; social movement; state role; trade agreement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105627202

Here we first develop an analytical framework for assessing the Peruvian initiatives of conservation incentives. We then identify six ongoing interventions that have introduced incentives conditional upon compliance with voluntary environmental commitments. We collected information from secondary sources and conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty national- and local-level stakeholders. We scrutinized the extent to which such initiatives featured impact-oriented design and implementation elements, as typically recommended in the state-of-the-art literature on Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). We found only limited adoption of such recommendations, including spatial targeting, payment differentiation, enforced conditionality, and customized measures nurturing locally perceived equity and transparency. We argue, supported by a still incipient rigorous evidence from impact evaluations, that suboptimal design and implementation choices probably have influenced outcomes towards limiting the sought-for environmental and welfare impacts. We discuss three critical aspects for upscaling: overcoming financial and legal constraints, strategic involvement of non-government stakeholders, and more impact-oriented design of the interventions. © 2021 The Authors","Climate services; Deforestation; Environmental policy; Hydrological services; Payment for environmental services","analytical framework; climate change; deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental policy; incentive; nature conservation; stakeholder; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105597836

Critical disaster studies cast charitable individuals and organizations as sponsors of Black survival, yet nongovernmental aid programs remain marginal to scholarship on environmental justice and Black geographies. This paper sheds light on the funding programs, public-private partnerships, and design-build projects by which philanthropies and charities aid Black, Indigenous and other People of Color (BIPOC) in retreat from flood hazards. This nested case study of HUD’s Neighborhood Stabilization program and the Salvation Army’s EnviRenew program shows Black developers, planners, and architects of retreat from New Orleans’s Pontchartrain Park Historic District gained public, private, and philanthropic sponsors at steep costs: the loss of land, life, and leadership in sustainable development. Drawing on administrative data, legal documents, and stakeholder interviews, the mixed-methods analysis finds new housing built above projected base flood elevations inside flood hazard zones not by choice or by chance, but in compliance with aid programs requiring Black participation in land buyout programs (Road Home) and Black facilitation of green home building and buying (Build Back Better). The Pontchartrain Park case of “management failure,” which included rescinded grants and land takings, not only illuminates the macroeconomics and microaggressions that restrict where and how Black resettlement takes place.

Here, a multi-generation energy system combining cooling, heating, and power is realized by employing organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and absorption heat pump (AHP) technologies, which enable cascading the utilization of solar heat. The AHP can operate steadily providing cooling, heating and hot water from solar thermal and geothermal sources. A modelling approach presented to evaluate the energy, exergy, economic, and exergo-economic performance of the above system. The results show that the AHP could reach a coefficient of performance (COP) between 1.38 and 2.37 depending on the mode of operation. The yearly energy and exergy efficiency of the tri-generation system is 56.5% and 9.6%, respectively. Compared to a separate system, the simple economic payback time of the tri-generation system is 3.5 years. The specific exergo-economic cost of electricity produced is 0.12 $/kWh, whereas the cost of hot water is much higher, or 0.31 $/kWh. The sensitivity analysis performed shows that the inlet and outlet temperatures of the AHP together with the yearly solar irradiance have the highest impact on the performance.

Eu2+/Eu3+ co-doped NaBaB9O15 phosphors exhibit blue/red dual-band emission in the 370–450 nm and 580–750 nm wavelength regions, attributed to the 5d-4f transition of Eu2+ and the 4f-4f transition of Eu3+, respectively. The ratio of red/blue emission intensities can be easily tuned by changing the synthesis conditions, ranging from 0.07 to 2.67.

In this study, we took January observations from 2014 to 2018 as a case study to assess wintertime air quality improvement in Beijing after five years of continuous emission control measures and to investigate the causes of haze formation. SO2 and NO2 concentrations in January 2018 decreased by 84% and 41% from January 2014, while NH3 concentrations remained relatively stable during these years with an average of 7.28 μg m−3. The mean concentrations of PM2.5 and water-soluble inorganic ions declined over the study period, while compared with 2014, decreased SO42− ratio and increased NO3− contribution in PM2.5 were observed, highlighting the importance of reactive nitrogen (Nr) pollution control. High concentrations of NH3, NO2, as well as NH4+ and NO3− in PM2.5 at roadside monitoring sites, indicated that vehicle sources played a vital role in local urban Nr emissions. Finally, we found most NH3 existed in the gas phase in the Beijing atmosphere, even on polluted winter days, suggesting a considerable risk for additional secondary aerosol formation. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the emissions control in alleviating Beijing's air pollution. Significant reductions of precursor emissions are needed to achieve the goals set by air quality standards in the future, especially for NH3. It is especially crucial to jointly consider and control multiple pollution sources to effectively reduce the high levels of air pollution that remain in Beijing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; NH3-rich; PM2.5; Precursor gas; Vehicle source","Air quality standards; Ammonia; Emission control; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Urban growth; Air pollution prevention; Air quality improvement; Clean air; Haze pollutions; NH$-3$; NH3-rich; NO $-2$; PM$-2.5$; Precursor gas; Vehicle source; Air quality; air quality; ammonia; ammonium; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); haze; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; winter; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105581653

The debilitating state of current public transportation infrastructure as well as rising carbon emissions from private vehicles supports that investments be made in public transportation systems that are both efficient and mitigate environmental challenges of reducing carbon emissions. To address the problem, many Indian cities have been experimenting with metro rail systems. Metro rails are capital intensive projects. Given the budgetary constraints and limitations of external borrowing capacity, state governments in India are resorting to land based finances. Land based financing is predicated on the principle of land value capture. A popular mechanism to implement land based financing is to raise revenues through property development or real-estate cross-subsidisation. This study examined two real-estate cross subsidisation projects that were implemented to raise revenues for Bangalore metro project and Kochi metro project each. The study identified some of the key challenges to land based finances in India. In particular, the study analysed conflicts surrounding urban land management as land acquired under the rubric of ‘public purpose’ were transferred for commercial property development to generate finances for the metro projects. The study calls for evaluation of existing policies of land based financing for urban infrastructure projects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Land based financing; Land value capture; Metro rail; Urban development","financial system; land use planning; metro system; policy approach; railway transport; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; transportation system; urban development; urban planning; urban transport; Bengaluru; India; Karnataka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105576261

Results were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model with latent variables. The study indicated that the H'mong community is significantly more vulnerable than the Thai community. The H'mong community is more vulnerable to climate change mainly due to the higher level of sensitivity to natural disasters while the ability to adapt to climate change is lower. The key factors determining the vulnerability of the both communities are related to the adaptive capacity that households have including social networks, livelihood strategies and their household demographics. The results are helpful in identifying determinants of livelihood vulnerability to climate change of mountainous ethnic minority communities and may be applicable to other mountainous regions worldwide.

The diesel and diesel surrogate flames present a similar overall appearance, with a “dark core” region of fine droplets exiting the injector and a light blue outer flame near the base. Hot soot regions appear downstream, indicated by bright yellowish flame luminosity. Comparison of simultaneously acquired single-laser-shot PLIF images of OH and PAH indicates that smaller PAH reside mostly in the central regime in the ~20–60% height of the flame, sandwiched between the flame fronts. In contrast, larger PAH and soot particles are formed further downstream. Soot-LII signals are present only in the upper ~40% height of the flame for both the fuels. The distribution of mean PAH-PLIF and soot-LII signals along the flame height is also found to be similar for both fuels, except diesel is shown to produce approximately 1.5× more soot than the diesel surrogate. Based on the analysis of probability distributions, the maximum OH-PLIF signals in both fuels have similar radial and axial spatial distributions, while maximum PAH-PLIF signals occur at a higher axial location for the diesel surrogate. However, for the diesel surrogate, maximum soot-LII signals are frequently appeared at lower heights. Therefore, exploration of more appropriate diesel surrogates may be necessary to closely mimic the PAH and soot formation behaviors of diesel fuel. The present study shows that the combined optical diagnostic techniques and the statistical analysis can be used for studying commercial diesel and diesel surrogates, and thus establish a robust framework for detailed studies of chemical kinetics, combustion dynamics, and soot formation in liquid hydrocarbon spray combustion. © 2021","Diesel and diesel surrogate; Liquid-spray flame; OH/PAH-PLIF; Soot-LII","Chemical analysis; Combustion; Diesel engines; Dust; Fuels; Liquids; Optical properties; Petroleum prospecting; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Probability distributions; Diesel and diesel surrogate; Diesel surrogates; Laser-induced incandescence; Liquid-spray flame; OH$+-$; OH/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-planar laser-induced fluorescence; Planar laser-induced fluorescence; Polycyclic aromatics; Soot formations; Soot-laser-induced incandescence; Soot; diesel fuel; hydroxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; aerosol; Article; atmospheric pressure; blue light; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; comparative study; density functional theory; flame; fluorescence; imaging algorithm; incandescence; laser induced incandescence; liquid; luminance; oxidation; planar laser induced fluorescence; priority journal; soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105454434

Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of electricity consumption may be advisable to undertake suitable energy policies. This paper contributes to this understanding by analyzing the non-linear income and temperature effects on electricity demand in the residential sector in Andalusia (Spain). To this end, panel data OLS, PCSE, and quantile regression analysis methods have been performed to provide a complete picture of the relationship between the studied variables. The results show evidence to support an inverted N-shaped relationship, with respect to income, without reaching the upper threshold point. The results also show that electricity elasticity, with respect to income, tends to increase with residential electricity consumption. It is also observed that temperature values, increasing above 22°C and temperatures decreasing below 15°C progressively, increase residential electricity consumption, the elasticity with respect to temperatures being higher for municipalities with lower residential electricity consumption. Reinforcing energy efficiency measures in the municipalities with the highest electricity consumption is recommended. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Andalusia (Spain); Environmental Kuznets curve; Municipalities; Quantile regression; Residential energy; Temperature effects","alternative energy; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental assessment; income; Kuznets curve; regression analysis; residential energy; temperature effect; Andalucia; Spain; carbon dioxide; city; economic development; renewable energy; Spain; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Economic Development; Renewable Energy; Spain; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105444258

It causes an imbalance between people by creating a more desirable living environment for some societies while erasing settlements and shelters of some others. Due to floods, sea level rise, destructive storms, drought, and slow-onset factors such as salinization of water and soil, people lose their lands, homes, and natural resources. Catastrophic events force people to move voluntarily or involuntarily. The relocation of communities is a debatable climate adaptation measure which requires utmost care with human rights, ethics, and psychological well-being of individuals upon the issues of discrimination, conflict, and security. As the number of climate-displaced populations grows, the generations-deep connection to their rituals, customs, and ancestral ties with the land, cultural practices, and intangible cultural heritage become endangered. However, intangible heritage is often overlooked in the context of climate displacement. This paper presents reflections based on observations regarding the intangible heritage of voluntarily displaced communities. It begins by examining intangible heritage under the threat of climate displacement, with place-based examples. It then reveals intangible heritage as a catalyst to building resilient communities by advocating for the cultural values of indigenous and all people in climate action planning. It concludes the discussion by presenting the implications of climate displacement in existing intangible heritage initiatives. This article seeks to contribute to the emerging policies of preserving intangible heritage in the context of climate displacement. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate adaptation; Climate displacement; Climate justice; Climate relocation; Intangible cultural heritage; Stakeholder involvement","adaptive management; climate change; cultural heritage; ecological impact; flood; human rights; relocation; sea level change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105434723

However, failure to consider future flooding from climate change in municipal planning may have dangerous and costly consequences when the water does come. We suggest that managed retreat practices are challenging in Sweden, not only due to public opinions but also because of a deficit of uptake of territorial knowledge by decision-makers and difficulties in realizing flexible planning options of the shoreline. A territorial governance framework was used as a heuristic to explore the challenges to managed retreat in four urban case studies (three municipalities and one county) representing different territorial, hydrological and oceanographic environments. This was done through a series of participatory stakeholder workshops. The analysis using a territorial governance framework based on dimensions of coordination, integration, mobilization, adaptation and realization presents variations in how managed retreat barriers and opportunities are perceived among case study sites, mainly due to the differing territorial or place-based challenges. The results also indicate common challenges regardless of the case study site, including coordination challenges and unclear responsibility, the need for integrated means of addressing goal conflicts and being able to adapt flexibly to existing regulations and plans. Yet rethinking how managed retreat could boost community resilience and help to implement long-term visions was seen as a way to deal with some of the territorial challenges. © 2021, The Author(s).","Case studies; Climate adaptation; Flooding; Governance; Managed retreat; Sea level rise","adaptive management; advocacy; climate change; decision making; flooding; governance approach; participatory approach; perception; stakeholder; territorial planning; territoriality; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105409139

In order to ascertain the integration order of variables, the study utilizes the Pesaran second-generation unit-root test. The findings reveal that all the variables are stationary at first difference. The long-run results confirm that fiscal decentralization and natural resources rent improve the atmosphere by reducing CO2 emissions. Moreover, gross domestic product and total natural resources rent increase, while improvement in institutional quality reduces CO2 emissions.

Emissions and ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) were assessed in the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil. The methodology combined a month-long monitoring campaign with both fixed and mobile instruments, development of emission inventories, and dispersion model simulations on different scales. The mean urban background PM2.5 concentrations during the campaign were 7.3 μg m−3 in Curitiba city center, but three- to fourfold higher (25.3 μg m-3) in a residential area on the city’s outskirts, indicating the presence of local sources, possibly linked to biomass combustion. BC concentrations seemed to be more uniformly distributed over the city, with mean urban background concentrations around 2 μg m−3, half of which due to local traffic emissions. Higher mean BC concentrations (3–5 μg m-3) were found along busy roads. The dispersion modeling also showed high PM2.5 and BC concentrations along the heavily transited ring road. However, the lack of in situ data over these peripheral areas prevented the verification of the model output. The vehicular emission factors for PM2.5 and BC from the literature were found not to be suitable for Curitiba’s fleet and needed to be adjusted. The integrated approach of this study can be implemented in other cities, as long as an open data policy and a close cooperation among regional, municipal authorities and academia can be achieved. © 2021, The Author(s).","Emission source apportionment; Integrated air quality assessment; Mobile measurements; Short-lived climate pollutants","air quality; biomass; black carbon; dispersion; exhaust emission; integrated approach; particulate matter; residential location; urban area; Brazil; Curitiba; Parana [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105382076

Hence, the study analyzes how trade and economic growth impact environmental degradation in Belgium, the USA, and Canada using panel data from 1995 to 2016. The study utilized the autoregressive distributed lag approach to provide new evidence and policy implications. The outcome confirmed the presence of cointegration among the selected variables. However, it was observed that economic growth decreases environmental degradation in the long run while trade openness shows a positively insignificant relationship with carbon emission. Nevertheless, a positive short-run relationship was observed between economic growth and carbon emissions whereas a negatively insignificant relationship was observed for trade and carbon emission.

Evaluating the CH4 emission and energy generation potential of MSW landfills facilitates the development of appropriate measures for mitigation and recovery of CH4. This study evaluated the CH4 generation, CH4 emissions and potential energy generation capacity of Jiangcungou MSW landfill, Xi'an, China, during its operation and closure period using three inventory models, including the IPCC default method (DM), IPCC first-order decay (FOD), and US EPA Landfill Gas Emissions Mode (LandGEM). Based on the DM, FOD and LandGEM models, the total estimated CH4 emissions in 1994–2060 were 755.0, 348.9, and 344.9 Gg, respectively. There is a huge potential for electricity generation after the closure of the landfill, and the potential energy generation for 2020 was 688.3 MkW h and 599.7 MkW h.

However, traditional performance assessment of water companies ignores GHG emissions. To overcome this limitation and to compare productivity change estimations of water companies excluding and including GHG emissions, this study computes the Luenberger productivity indicator (LPI) and the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index (MLPI), respectively. Moreover, in a second stage, we investigate the impact of exogenous variables on environmentally sensitive productivity change estimations. The empirical application conducted for a sample of water and sewerage companies in England and Wales over the period 201–2019 has illustrated that when GHG emissions were considered in the assessment (i.e., MLPI estimations), average productivity decreased. By contrast, when productivity estimation ignored GHG emissions (i.e., LPI), average productivity increased. Hence, it is concluded that the inclusion of GHG emissions in productivity analysis impacted the results. This finding is very relevant from a policy perspective as it illustrates the importance of considering GHG emissions when evaluating the performance of water companies for regulatory purposes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy-water nexus; Greenhouse gas; Performance; Productivity change; Regulation; Water companies","assessment method; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; performance assessment; water industry; United Kingdom; Wales; Indicator indicator; water; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; industry; productivity; water supply; Efficiency; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Industry; Water; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105366139

This study quantified the annual emissions from lighting and cooking by the residential sector in SEA during 2010–2018 to create a new regional emissions inventory (EI). Available survey data of urban/rural fuel consumption and carefully scrutinized emission factors relevant for SEA typical fuel-cookstoves were used. The period average SEA emissions from the sector in Gg yr−1 were 734 ± 6 (PM2.5); 70 ± 3 (BC); 327 ± 3 (OC); 312,436 ± 5154 (CO2); 943 ± 11 (CH4) and 35.7 ± 0.5 (N2O). Lighting contributed from 0.1% of N2O to 16.5% of BC of the total sectoral emissions. Biomass fuels and biomass derived fuels, mainly charcoal, accounted for more than 85% of BC and nearly 100% of OC emissions from cooking alone. Over the period, SEA annual emissions of BC reduced by 11% owning to the declining use of kerosene (14.2%) while emissions of all other species increased. Charcoal consumption was also reduced (−3.7%) while consumption of other fuels increased, maximum for LPG by 6.8%. Average SEA emissions per capita (kg cap−1 yr−1) of PM2.5; BC; OC; CO2; CH4 and N2O from the sector were 1.19; 0.11; 0.53; 507; 1.46 and 0.06, respectively. Spatial distributions showed the highest BC emission intensities over Java island of Indonesia and over several populated areas in SEA. BC was the key contributor to the total global warming potential (GWP) of the emissions, i.e. sharing 86%, 57% and 30% of the total GWP over 20-, 100- and 500-yr time horizons if biomass fuels burning CO2 emissions were assumed to be climate neutral. Interventions to eliminate kerosene use would effectively reduce BC emissions and bring about greater co-benefits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Emission inventory; Fine particulate matter; Greenhouse gases; Residential combustion; Southeast Asia","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Charcoal; Combustion; Greenhouse gases; Lighting; Liquefied petroleum gas; Organic carbon; Black carbon; CH$-4$; Emission inventories; Fine particulate matter; Greenhouses gas; N$-2$/O; Organics; PM$-2.5$; Residential combustion; Southeast Asia; Housing; black carbon; carbon dioxide; charcoal; fuel; kerosene; methane; nitrogen dioxide; organic carbon; black carbon; climate forcing; combustion; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; human activity; particulate matter; spatial distribution; Article; biomass; climate change; combustion; environmental factor; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; residential area; rural area; Southeast Asia; trend study; urban area; Greater Sunda Islands; Java; Southeast Asia; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105354920

However, few studies have focused on their contribution from the point of view of regional transport. To address this gap, the validated WRF-CAMx-PSAT modelling system was applied to quantitatively evaluate the impact of vehicular emissions on air pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China in 2014. We found that although motor vehicle is a near-surface source, it can significantly influence the air quality through regional transmission, especially with respect to atmospheric PM2.5 and NO3− during haze days. The fraction of non-local emissions to the overall vehicular emission contribution was 45.2% and 60.3% for PM2.5 and NO3−, respectively. Furthermore, the regional transport of vehicular emissions played an increased significant role in contributing toward air pollution on haze days. The contribution of non-local vehicular emissions to atmospheric PM2.5 and NO3− from non-haze to haze days increased by 38% and 27%, respectively. An 8.01 times change in the per unit (104 ton) vehicular emission contribution (PVEC) of non-local emissions from non-haze to haze days for NO3− indicated that the control of non-local vehicular emissions can be more effective for the mitigation of NO3− pollution, as compared to the mitigation of undifferentiated emissions from different sources. An obvious power function relationship was found between the PVEC and transport distance. Attenuation index was defined to analyse the degree of attenuation of pollutants with distance. An obvious decrease in the attenuation coefficient from non-haze to haze days for NO3− indicated that the regional transport of NO3− was more prominent on haze days from vehicular emission. Thus, this study can provide new knowledge for understanding the environmental impact of vehicular emissions. In addition, the results can provide a scientific basis for formulating effective regional coordination control strategies for air pollution. © 2021","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; CAMx-PSAT; Haze pollution; Regional transport; Vehicular emission","Air pollution control; Urban transportation; Vehicle transmissions; Beijing-tianjin-hebei; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; CAMx-PSAT; Haze pollutions; Local emissions; Motor vehicle; Nonlocal; PM$-2.5$; Regional transport; Vehicular emission; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; haze; particulate matter; source apportionment; traffic emission; urban area; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; environmental impact; exhaust gas; haze; mathematical model; motor vehicle; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105332334

This resulted in a number of measures, including state-mandated lockdowns, as well as restrictions to economic and social activity. The direct effects of these measures were felt in the economy, as well as in key institutions within society; however, there were also indirect results from these changes. This review article focuses on these indirect effects, towards sustainable environment. It points to the fact that the net effect has been positive; in terms of reduction in greenhouse emissions, oil exploration activities, and pollution. By extension, at-risk ecosystems have been given improved environmental quality.

This process is commonly accompanied by Fe oxidation and release of H2, which can be involved in abiotic reaction pathways leading to the genesis of abiotic light hydrocarbons such as methane (CH4). Examples of this phenomenon exist at the seafloor, such as at the serpentinite-hosted Lost City hydrothermal field, and on land in ophiolites at relatively shallow depths. However, the possibility for serpentinization to occur at greater depths, especially in subduction zones, raises new questions on the genesis of abiotic hydrocarbons at convergent margin and its impact on the deep carbon cycle. High-pressure ultramafic bodies exhumed in metamorphic belts can provide insights on the mechanisms of high-pressure serpentinization in subduction zones and on the chemistry of the resulting fluids. This study focuses on the ultramafic Belvidere Mountain complex belonging to the Appalachian belt of northern Vermont, USA. Microstructures show overgrowth of both primary (Mg# 0.91) and metamorphic (Mg# 0.95) olivine by delicate antigorite crystals, pointing to at least one stage of serpentinization at high-temperature conditions and consistent with the high-pressure subduction evolution of the Belvidere Mountain complex. Formation of ubiquitous magnetite and local Fe–Ni alloys testifies to the partial oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ and generation of reduced conditions. Fluid inclusion trails cross-cutting the primary olivine relicts suggest their formation during the antigorite serpentinization event. MicroRaman spectroscopy on the fluid inclusions reveals a CH4-rich gaseous composition, as well as N2, NH3 and H2S. Moreover, the precipitation of daughter minerals such as lizardite and brucite in the fluid inclusions indicate the initial presence of H2O in the fluid. High-pressure serpentinization driven by the infiltration of metasediment-derived aqueous fluids is proposed at the origin of CH4 and other reduced fluid species preserved in the fluid inclusions. This suggests the Belvidere Mountain complex as an example of deep abiotic hydrocarbon genesis related to high-pressure serpentinization in an early Paleozoic subduction zone. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Abiotic methane; Belvidere Mountain complex; C fluxes at subduction zones; HP serpentinization; Metamorphic olivine","abiotic factor; carbon cycle; carbon flux; convergent margin; fluid inclusion; high pressure; infiltration; methane; olivine; peridotite; serpentinization; subduction zone; Appalachians; Belvidere Mountain; Green Mountains; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105298151

Studies accounting for individual-level health characteristics are lacking. Methods: We leveraged the breadth and depth of the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases and built a national cohort of 169,102 COVID-19 positive United States Veterans, enrolled between March 2, 2020 and January 31, 2021, and followed them through February 15, 2021. Annual average 2018 PM2.5 exposure, at an approximately 1 km2 resolution, was linked with residential street address at the year prior to COVID-19 positive test. COVID-19 hospitalization was defined as first hospital admission between 7 days prior to, and 15 days after, the first COVID-19 positive date. Adjusted Poisson regression assessed the association of PM2.5 with risk of hospitalization. Results: There were 25,422 (15.0%) hospitalizations; 5,448 (11.9%), 5,056 (13.0%), 7,159 (16.1%), and 7,759 (19.4%) were in the lowest to highest PM2.5 quartile, respectively. In models adjusted for State, demographic and behavioral factors, contextual characteristics, and characteristics of the pandemic a one interquartile range increase in PM2.5 (1.9 µg/m3) was associated with a 10% (95% CI: 8%–12%) increase in risk of hospitalization. The association of PM2.5 and risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 individuals was present in each wave of the pandemic. Models of non-linear exposure–response suggested increased risk at PM2.5 concentrations below the national standard 12 µg/m3. Formal effect modification analyses suggested higher risk of hospitalization associated with PM2.5 in Black people compared to White people (p = 0.045), and in those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Exposure to higher levels of PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 infected individuals.

In this study, we observed the most elevated mean daily and maximum daily 8-h (MDA8) O3 concentrations occurred from mid-Spring to early Summer (April, May and June, AMJ) at both urban and remote sites in Shanghai compared to other warm months (March, July, August, September, October), based on the long-term measurements from 2010 to 2019. The typical weather pattern of G-SW (High pressure with predominant winds of southwesterly) recognized by T-mode principal component approach (T-PCA), exhibits the strongest solar radiation and highest daily maximum temperature relative to other weathers in AMJ, leading to not only the most elevated O3 concentration, but also the largest O3 increasing variability in daytime. More importantly, under the G-SW weather condition, the MDA8 O3 concentration presents the greatest increasing rate at 3.95 ppbv/yr from 2010 to 2019 in Shanghai downtown compared to other weather patterns, suggesting that more occurrence and faster exacerbation of O3 pollutions could be expected under the G-SW weather condition in the future. To understand and mitigate high O3 occurrences under the weather pattern of G-SW during AMJ, process analysis by a chemical/dynamical model (WRF-Chem, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry) is conducted to elucidate the strong O3 productivity (19 ppbv/h in daytime), that dominates the high O3 occurrence under the G-SW weather condition. Sensitive studies suggest that under the G-SW weather condition, reduction of VOCs emissions is very effective to prevent the high O3 pollution in Shanghai. The model results show that photochemical productivity decreases by 35% in daytime response to 30% reduction of VOCs emissions, leading to 17.6% mitigation of peak O3 concentration in Shanghai downtown. This result provides valuable information for the development of emission control strategy in Shanghai under different weather conditions. © 2021","O3 pollution; Shanghai; Weather classification; WRF-Chem model","Chemical analysis; Emission control; Ozone; Principal component analysis; Productivity; Urban growth; Weather forecasting; % reductions; Condition; O3 pollution; Ozone levels; Shanghai; Surface ozone; VOC emissions; Weather classification; Weather patterns; Weather research and forecasting-chem model; Meteorology; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); meteorology; ozone; seasonal variation; weather; Article; China; concentration (parameter); measurement; pollution; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; summer; temperature; urban area; weather; wind; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105259703

Based on the matched Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database and China Customs Enterprise Database, the DVAR in exports is measured, and this mechanism is empirically tested with standard measurement methods. The study concludes that air pollution is not conducive to raising the DVAR during the sample period. This conclusion remains robust to many issues, such as endogeneity, measurement error, extension of the sample interval, substitution of the air pollution index, and policy changes. The impact of air pollution on the DVAR varies by the type of firm ownership, size, and age, as well as the size and location of the city. In addition, the negative impact of air pollution on the DVAR grows with increases in the PM2.5 concentration. The growing factor prices of domestic intermediate goods and the falling productivity due to air pollution are important transmission channels for the negative impact of air pollution on the DVAR. In order for firms to open up on all fronts through quality trade development, we recommend the prevention and control of air pollution, fueling internal driving forces for firms’ independent innovation, and encouraging firms to target the medium- and high-end markets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Cost-rise effect; Domestic value-added ratio in firm exports; Global value chains; Innovation constraint effect; Mediating effect analysis","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); database; domestic waste; empirical analysis; export; industrial enterprise; pollution effect; China; air pollution; China; city; industry; pollution; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Pollution; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105255855

However, it is still not clear if the sacrifice has paid-off since the environmental quality in the majority of these countries is yet to be significantly improved. As such, this study employs advanced panel data econometric techniques that account for cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity issues to explore the impacts of nuclear and renewable energy use in respect of CO2 emission mitigation in six of the seven G7 countries. The core objective of this study is to justify whether energy diversification through the promotion of nuclear and renewable energy consumption can assist the G7 nations in complying with their commitments concerning the Paris Climate Change and Sustainable Development Goals agendas. The overall findings from the econometric analysis affirm the abating role of nuclear energy on CO2 emissions. However, renewable energy consumption is found to be statistically insignificant in explaining the variations in the CO2 emission levels. On the other hand, economic growth is found to initially boost the CO2 emission level but mitigate it later on; thus, the authenticity of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is established in the G7 context. Besides, the country-specific results suggest that nuclear energy significantly reduces CO2 emissions in all the countries, except in Canada and the USA. Also, renewable energy significantly curbs CO2 emissions only in Canada and France. Furthermore, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is validated for Canada, France, the UK, and the USA. In line with these findings, it is pertinent for the G7 countries to boost nuclear energy use to reduce the fossil fuel dependency in the majority of the G7 nations to mitigate CO2 emissions. Moreover, it is also suggested that these nations adopt relevant policies to further green their consumption and production processes to ensure complementarity between economic growth and environmental development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emissions; Cross-sectional dependency; Economic growth; G7; Nuclear energy; Renewable energy","abatement cost; alternative energy; carbon emission; complementarity; econometrics; economic growth; environmental quality; G-7 country; nuclear power; Canada; France; United States; carbon dioxide; cross-sectional study; economic development; nuclear energy; renewable energy; Carbon Dioxide; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Development; Nuclear Energy; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105185251

Given that action against climate change is primarily taken via energy choices, limiting the use of fossil fuels and promoting renewable sources, an effective strategy is one in which interventions are designed to prevent diseases and jointly mitigate climate change, the so-called cobenefits. For policies capable of producing relevant co-benefits we focus on three categories of interventions, urban planning, diet and transport that are of special importance. For example, policies promoting active transport (cycling, walking) have the triple effect of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, preventing diseases related to atmospheric pollution, and increasing physical activity, thus preventing obesity and diabetes. In particular, we propose that for 2025 the following goals are achieved: reduce the prevalence of smokers by 30%, with particular emphasis on young people; reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by 20%; reduce the proportion of calories obtained from ultraprocessed foods by 20%; reduce the consumption of alcohol by 10%; reduce the consumption of salt by 30%; reduce the consumption of sugary drinks by 20%; reduce the average consumption of meat by 20%; increase the weekly hours of exercise by 10%. The aim is to complement individual health promotion with structural policies (such as urban planning, taxation and incentives) which render the former more effective and result in a reduction in inequality. We strongly encourage the inclusion of primary prevention in all policies, in light of the described cobenefits. Italy’s role as the cohost of the 2020 (now 2021) UN climate negotiations (COP26) presents the opportunity for international leadership in addressing health as an integral component of the response to climate change. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The lack of spatially resolved HONO concentration information results in large knowledge gaps of HONO and its role in atmospheric chemistry and air pollution in China. In this work, an ensemble machine learning model comprising of random forest, gradient boosting, and back propagation neural network was proposed, for the first time, to estimate the long-term (2006–2017) daily HONO concentrations across China in 0.25° resolution. Further, the key factors controlling the space-time variablity of HONO concentrations were analyzed based on variable importance values. The ensemble model well characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of daily HONO concentrations with the sampled-based, site-based and by-year cross-validation (CV) R2 (RMSE) of 0.7 (0.36 ppbv), 0.67 (0.36 ppbv), and 0.62 (0.40 ppbv), respectively. HONO hotspots were mainly distributed in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Pearl River Delta (PRD), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and several sites of Sichuan Basin, in line with the distribution patterns of the tropospheric NO2 columns and assimilated surface NO3− levels. The national HONO levels stagnated during 2006–2013, then declined after 2013 benefiting from the implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control. The NO3− concentration, urban area, NO2 column density ranked as important variables for HONO prediction, while agricultral land, forest and grassland played minor roles in affecting HONO concentrations, suggesting the significant role of heterogeneous HONO production from anthropogenic precursor emissions. Leveraging the ground-level HONO observations, this study fills the gap of statistically modelling nationwide HONO in China, which provides essential data for atmospheric chemistry research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China; Ensemble model; Nitrous acid; NO2 columns; NO3− concentration","Adaptive boosting; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Backpropagation; Decision trees; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; River pollution; Atmospheric photochemistry; China; Ensemble models; Hydroxyl radicals; Machine learning algorithms; Nitrous acid; NO $-2$; NO2 column; NO3− concentration; OH$+-$; Atmospheric chemistry; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous acid; algorithm; anthropogenic source; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; back propagation; concentration (composition); hydroxyl radical; machine learning; nitrous acid; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation; chemical analysis; China; concentration (parameter); forest; grassland; machine learning; prediction; priority journal; random forest; urban area; validation process; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Sichuan Basin; Tianjin; Yangtze River; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105109359

Using primary data collected in Xinjiang Province, we undertook a contingent valuation of rain covers that protect fruit from rain and estimated a discounted utility model using these data. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we find that local grape growers discount the future very heavily, with a discount rate of 0.17 per year, which is almost four times higher than the Chinese market interest rate. Farmers also tend to underestimate the benefits of adopting covers, with their purchase decisions appearing to largely depend on their past actual losses rather than future anticipated losses. These findings have broader implications for policies promoting proactive adaptation in response to likely increased rainfall in the region. Targeting farmers who give lower weight to events far off in the future and understanding that many farmers may tend only to make adoption decisions that have strong short-term benefits could improve the efficacy of climate policies that target agricultural technologies. © 2021 The Authors.

Passive microwave snow depth data and gridded data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU_TS4.04) are utilized in this study to investigate spatiotemporal variations of snow depth over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), with special focus on the vertical dimension. The response of snow to elevation-dependent warming (EDW) is determined accordingly. High mountains experience more rapid warming than lower elevations. During 1980–2014, the total snow depth over the TP decreased; areas with the most significant decreasing trends are mainly concentrated in the northwestern and southwestern parts of the TP. The plateau-wide decrease in snow depth (−0.24 cm/decade) is mainly affected by increasing temperature (0.30°C/decade). The reduction in snow depth trend intensifies as sub-regional mean elevation increases from 3,332 m (IID2) to 5,074 m (ID1). A stronger snow depth decrease in high-elevation sub-regions generally corresponds to higher warming rates, which demonstrates EDW. The most pronounced correlation between snow depth decrease rate and elevation occurs in the southeastern TP, which covers the largest elevation range on the plateau (from 2,000 to 6,000 m). © 2021 The Authors.

We use an agricultural trade model to determine the impacts on agricultural commodity markets and combine our results with an input-output model to measure economic effects in the United States. In addition, we calculate global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use change. The consequences of retaliatory tariffs are both trade destruction (lower overall trade) and trade diversion (trade diverted away from the U.S. and to other exporting countries). By the end of the projection period, total U.S. pork exports decline by 4.7%. Total soybean and wheat exports decrease by 31.2% and 0.5%, respectively whereas corn exports increases by 4.0%. Domestic U.S. retail pork prices decline by 0.8% and commodity farm prices decrease by 4.2%, 5.1%, and 15.8% for corn, wheat, and soybeans, respectively. The decline in foreign demand reduces U.S. production and welfare. Key among these impacts are a loss of nearly 15,400 jobs and a fall in labor income by $1.35 billion due to a $3.70 billion decline in national output at the beginning of the projection period. By the last year of the projection, the impacts grow to almost 30,000 fewer jobs and $2.31 billion less labor income. The U.S. economy experiences a loss of slightly under $6.80 billion in national output. Changes in trade due to the tariffs result in a reduction of GHG emissions from land-use change of up to 83.7 teragram (Tg) of CO2-equivalent. © 2021 The Authors.

Methods and main objective: This work examines the impact of Vienna's first lockdown on ground-level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and total oxidant (Ox). The analysis runs over January to September 2020 and considers business as usual scenarios created with machine learning models to provide a baseline for robustly diagnosing lockdown-related air quality changes. Models were also developed to normalise the air pollutant time series, enabling facilitated intervention assessment. Core findings: NO2 concentrations were on average −20.1% [13.7–30.4%] lower during the lockdown. However, this benefit was offset by amplified O3 pollution of +8.5% [3.7–11.0%] in the same period. The consistency in the direction of change indicates that the NO2 reductions and O3 increases were ubiquitous over Vienna. Ox concentrations increased slightly by +4.3% [1.8–6.4%], suggesting that a significant part of the drops in NO2 was compensated by gains in O3. Accordingly, 82% of lockdown days with lowered NO2 were accompanied by 81% of days with amplified O3. The recovery shapes of the pollutant concentrations were depicted and discussed. The business as usual-related outcomes were broadly consistent with the patterns outlined by the normalised time series. These findings allowed to argue further that the detected changes in air quality were of anthropogenic and not of meteorological reason. Pollutant changes on the machine learning baseline revealed that the impact of the lockdown on urban air quality were lower than the raw measurements show. Besides, measured traffic drops in major Austrian roads were more significant for light-duty than for heavy-duty vehicles. It was also noted that the use of mobility reports based on cell phone movement as activity data can overestimate the reduction of emissions for the road transport sector, particularly for heavy-duty vehicles. As heavy-duty vehicles can make up a large fraction of the fleet emissions of nitrogen oxides, the change in the volume of these vehicles on the roads may be the main driver to explain the change in NO2 concentrations. Interpretation and implications: A probable future with emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dropping slower than emissions of nitrogen oxides could risk worsened urban O3 pollution under a VOC-limited photochemical regime. More holistic policies will be needed to achieve improved air quality levels across different regions and criteria pollutants. © 2021 The Author","Air quality data; Atmospheric composition; COVID-19 lockdown; Machine learning; Meteorology","Atmospheric composition; Drops; Emission control; Fleet operations; Machine learning; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Quality management; Time series; Vehicles; Air quality data; Business-as-usual; COVID-19 lockdown; Heavy duty vehicles; Machine-learning; Nitrogen dioxides; NO $-2$; Ozone pollution; Reduced nitrogen; Times series; Air quality; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; lockdown; machine learning; meteorology; nitrogen dioxide; oxidant; ozone; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; Article; atmospheric pressure; Austria; carbon footprint; combustion; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental management; environmental monitoring; lockdown; machine learning; meteorology; photochemistry; relative humidity; seasonal variation; time series analysis; troposphere; urban area; air pollutant; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; particulate matter; Austria; Vienna; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Austria; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104912216

However, knowledge about modeling the coarse particle release from skin and clothing is limited. This study developed a new empirically validated CFD modeling methodology for particle release and transport from seated occupants in an office setting. We tested three modeling approaches for particle emissions: Uniform; Uniform + Localized; and Uniform + Localized with Body Motion; applied to four office scenarios involving a single occupant and two occupants facing each other at 1- and 2-m distances. Uniform particle emissions from skin and clothing underpredicted personal inhalation exposure by as much as 55%–80%. Combining uniform with localized emissions from the armpits drastically reduced the error margin to <10%. However, this modeling approach heavily underestimated particle mass exchange (cross-contamination) between the occupants. Accounting for the occupant's body motion—by applying the momentum theory method—yielded the most accurate personal exposure and cross-contamination results, with errors below 12%. The study suggests that for accurate modeling of particle release and transport from seated occupants indoors, localized body emissions in combination with simplified bodily movements need to be taken into account. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The impact of urban heterogeneity on the effects of environmental regulation is then examined. The study found that environmental regulation has a significant negative impact on PM2.5 pollution. In addition, environmental regulation can indirectly reduce PM2.5 pollution through technological innovation and industrial structure adjustment. However, it also restrains the environmental spillover effect of FDI, in this way exacerbating PM2.5 pollution.

The willow ET cover is a carbon-negative system with a total GWI of −13,206 kgCO2eq ha−1 over 30 years, while the GWI of clay (194,916 kgCO2eq ha−1) and geosynthetic covers (260,212 kgCO2eq ha−1) were substantial.

The empirical analyses are anchored on a set of estimation procedures including; cross-sectional dependence test, second generation panel unit root test, Westerlund cointegration test, Hausman test, and pooled mean group (PMG). The following results emanate from the findings. First, the presence of cross-sectional dependence and long-run relationships are confirmed for the countries. Second, RE significantly lessens the prevalence of carbon emissions across the estimated models. This further underscores the mitigating effects of RE on CO2 emissions for the G-7 countries. Third, the impacts of NRE and TO are found to contribute to surge in CO2 emissions. Fourth, the effects of technological progress captured by research and development (RD) and eco-innovation significantly reduce the stock of CO2 emissions using both unconditional (single effect) and conditional (interactive effect) methods.

By taking use of the mobile observations and WRF-STILT model simulations, this study analyzes the air pollution characteristics and air quality influences from an industrial emission source in Xinji, China. During the study period, the hourly average concentrations of smoke, SO2, and NOx emitted from the industrial source are 1.01, 22.04, and 26.22 mg/m3, respectively. The mobile observations show that with the increase of distance from the emission source, the concentration of air pollutants increases first and then decreases. The peak values of PM2.5, SO2, and NOx appear at the distance of around 0–3 km away from the emission source, among which PM2.5 and SO2 increase first and then decrease before stabilizing, while NOx is interfered by emissions from the traffic along the roads. Within the distance of 3 km, the emission source has obvious influence on the air quality with contribution rate 10–48% at night time and 3–23% at day time. The simulation results of WRF-STILT also support the observed gradient change characteristics of air pollutants, suggesting that this industrial emission source is an important pollution source for regions around it. Our results further show that the meteorological conditions play an important role on the transport capacity of industrial emissions. The results of this study provide support for quantifying the scope of influence of fixed emission sources, especially in industrial cities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; Emission contribution; Mobile observation; PM2.5; WRF-STILT","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); industrial emission; observational method; pollutant source; simulation; urban pollution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104717890

According to the World Harmonized Steady-State Cycle (WHSC) test cycle, the effects of EGR mode under high methanol energy ratio (MER) on the combustion, emissions and economy of DMDF engines were studied without the help of selected catalyst reduction (SCR). Considering the weight based on WHSC test cycle of full load was only 0.083, and EGR demand of full load was low, the optimal EGR strategy under different loads except full load was determined for DMDF engine. The results demonstrated that through the early injection strategy with high MER, particulate matter (PM) emissions were all at an extremely low level, far below the requirements by legislation limit of 0.01 g/kWh. With the increase of EGR rate, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were significantly reduced under different loads, accompanying with one or more EGR modes at 25%, 50%, and 70% loads to ensure that NOx emission could meet the requirements by legislation limit of 0.4 g/kWh, while PM emissions were at a very low level at the same time. Demand for EGR rate of light loads was generally higher than that for medium loads, but under light loads, each of hybrid EGR modes could meet the demand of China VI legislation. While under medium loads, the dual loop (DL) EGR modes, i.e., both low pressure (LP) and high pressure (HP) EGR mode must be needed. In LP EGR mode combined with back pressure valve (BPV), higher EGR rate was required under the same NOx control target, owing to the higher intake air volume than those of other modes. The trade-off relationship in HP_BPV mode between NOx and PM emissions still existed, and high EGR rate often leaded to an increase in PM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China VI legislation; Diesel methanol dual fuel; High and low pressure EGR; Trade-off","Air intakes; Combustion; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Economic and social effects; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Back pressure valve; China VI legislation; Diesel methanol dual fuel; Dual-fuel engines; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; Full-load; Gas recirculations; High and low pressure exhaust gas recirculation; Particulate matter emissions; Trade off; Methanol",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104667433

However, in order to estimate practical and factual DR potential, an analysis of load characteristics including user behavior is required based on information data. Thus, in this study, a novel analytic approach is proposed to detect resident behavior for environment responsive DR potential estimation. A new framework to determine optimal DR potential is proposed with related data analysis models. In each analysis model, resident occupancy behavior and forecasted renewable energy generation are estimated. During the process of resident behavior detection, sub-metering data of appliances are analyzed and profiled for multiple purposes by a new method based on hidden Markov model and time varying Markov chain. The optimal DR potential is estimated considering guaranteed residents' comfort constraints and the dynamic characteristics of appliances. The proposed framework is tested on the single household environment of residential region and the results present that the proposed model is environmentally and economically effective, while also suggesting meaningful implications through resident behavior data analysis. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","carbon dioxide emission; data analysis; Demand response; resident behavior; smart appliance; vehicle-to-grid","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Data handling; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Hidden Markov models; Information analysis; Markov chains; Microgrids; Renewable energy resources; Behavior detection; Carbon dioxide emissions; Data analysis models; Dynamic characteristics; Environmental problems; Load characteristics; Potential estimation; Renewable energy generation; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104662586

However, deforestation rates in many parts of the world continue to accelerate. The study evaluates the rate and causes of deforestation in Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment (UMSC) due to land use land cover (LULC) changes between 1990 and 2020. Landsat imagery analysis augmented by household questionnaire survey and key stakeholder interviews were used to assess the rate and cause of deforestation in UMSC. Over the 30 years, the sub-catchment lost 9.4% of its vegetation area due to land use changes. Vegetation loss was mainly due to urban expansion of Harare and its dormitory towns and the extensive peri‑urban agriculture mainly tobacco harvesting. Using the Markov Chain Cellular Automata model, the study estimated that in 2030 the catchment will lose approximately 3.3% of the current vegetation land cover area. This means a further reduction of the vegetation area from 20.1% to 16.8% in 2030. There is need for harmonisation of infrastructure development in Harare and the peri‑urban farming activities with policies that conserve forests such as the use of charcoal and eucalyptus plantations for curing tobacco instead of indigenous trees. This is critical if Zimbabwe is to meet its climate change mitigation targets in the Nationally Determined Contribution that promotes the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). © 2021","Cellular Automata Markov Chain; Deforestation; GIS and Remote Sensing; Land Use Land Cover changes; Paris Agreement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104576122

This is partly due to the limited understanding about how spatially variable Rs actually is, but also on how environmental controls determine Rs's spatial variability and how these controls vary in time (e.g., seasonally). Our study was designed to look more deeply into the complexity of Rs's spatial variability in a European beech even-aged stand, covering both phenologically and climatically contrasting periods (spring, summer, autumn and winter). Although we studied a relatively homogeneous stand, we found a large spatial variability of Rs (coefficients of variation &gt; 30%) characterized by strong seasonality. This large spatial variability of Rs suggests that even in relatively homogeneous stands there is a large potential source of error when estimating Rs. This was also reflected by the sampling effort needed to obtain seasonally robust estimates of Rs, which may actually require a number of samples above that used in Rs studies. We further postulate that the effect of seasonality on the spatial variability and environmental controls of Rs was determined by the seasonal shifts of its microclimatic controls: during winter, low temperatures constrain plant and soil metabolic activities and hence reduce Rs variability (temperature-controlled processes), whereas during summer, water demand by vegetation and changes in water availability due to the microtopography of the terrain (i.e., slope) increase Rs variability (water-controlled processes). This study provides novel information on the spatiotemporal variability of Rs and looks more deeply into the seasonality of its environmental controls and the architecture of their causal-effect relationships controlling Rs's spatial variability. Our study further shows that improving current estimates of Rs at local and regional levels might be necessary in order to reduce uncertainties and improve CO2 estimates at larger spatial scales. Highlights: The spatial variability of soil respiration (Rs) and its environmental controls vary seasonally. Seasonal shifts from temperature- to water-controlled processes determine Rs's spatial variability. Besides microclimate, slope and grass cover explain the spatiotemporal variability of Rs. An intense sampling effort is needed to obtain robust Rs estimates even in homogeneous forests. © 2021 British Society of Soil Science.","European beech; even-aged stand; microtopography; seasonality; soil microclimate; soil respiration; spatial variability","deciduous tree; microtopography; phenology; seasonality; soil respiration; spatiotemporal analysis; stand structure; water availability; Fagus sylvatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104547818

The effects of minimum, average, and maximum temperature, and precipitation at monthly, seasonal, and yearly scales on ecosystem services and their components were studied through stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results showed that in the northern grasslands, an increase in the total ecosystem services value (ESV) was mainly attributed to soil conservation, biodiversity, hydrological regulation, and aesthetic landscape. In the southern hills, an increase in total ESV in each region was mainly attributed to climate regulation, environmental purification, biodiversity, and aesthetic landscape. There were strong correlations between ESVs and fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. In the northern grasslands, temperature was the main driving factor of the values from 11 categories of ecosystem services in Anxi, Tumuji, and Xilingol. However, in West Ordos, precipitation negatively affected the change in ESVs. In the southern hills, ESVs were governed by both precipitation and temperature in Huaying. Precipitation variables were an important factor affecting the ESVs in Cili. There was a stronger correlation between temperature and the majority of ESVs in Danjiangkou, Chongyi, and Lechang than precipitation. This paper provides a basis for a better understanding of the impact of climate change on different ecosystem services, and helps to enhance ESV under climate warming. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Ecosystem services value; Grasslands; Hills; Redundancy analysis","climate change; climate effect; ecosystem service; grassland; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; China; Ordos; biodiversity; China; climate change; ecosystem; grassland; Biodiversity; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Grassland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104545421

However, a low percentage of YJS receive SUD services during their justice system involvement. The SUD care cascade can identify potential missed opportunities for treatment for YJS. Steps along the continuum of the cascade include identification of treatment need, referral to services, and treatment engagement. To address gaps in care for YJS, we will (1) implement a learning health system (LHS) to develop, or improve upon, alliances between juvenile justice (JJ) agencies and community mental health centers (CMHC) and (2) present local cascade data during continuous quality improvement cycles within the LHS alliances. Methods/design: ADAPT is a hybrid Type II effectiveness implementation trial. We will collaborate with JJ and CMHCs in eight Indiana counties. Application of the EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainment) framework will guide the implementation of the LHS alliances. The study team will review local cascade data quarterly with the alliances to identify gaps along the continuum. The study will collect self-report survey measures longitudinally at each site regarding readiness for change, implementation climate, organizational leadership, and program sustainability. The study will use the Stages of Implementation Completion (SIC) tool to assess the process of implementation across interventions. Additionally, the study team will conduct focus groups and qualitative interviews with JJ and CMHC personnel across the intervention period to assess for impact. Discussion: Findings have the potential to increase SUD need identification, referral to services, and treatment for YJS. © 2021","Juvenile justice; Learning health system; Substance use disorders","adolescent; Article; child; cohort analysis; community mental health center; controlled study; drug dependence; drug dependence treatment; health care planning; health care survey; human; Indiana; information dissemination; information processing; interview; justice; juvenile; juvenile detention; learning health system; longitudinal study; multicenter study; program sustainability; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; rural area; rural population; self report; substance use; therapeutic alliance; total quality management; addiction; drug dependence; program evaluation; rural population; Adolescent; Behavior, Addictive; Humans; Learning Health System; Program Evaluation; Rural Population; Substance-Related Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104334326

Surprisingly, this program has lowered urban nongreen innovation without affecting urban green innovation. An average decline of 0.31 (ranging from 0.27 to 0.34) in urban nongreen innovation contributes most to the average decline of 0.29 (ranging from 0.25 to 0.32) in total urban innovation during this period. This finding is at odds with the Porter hypothesis that environmental policy may trigger innovation, especially green innovation. Rather, the LCPC program appears to have a crowding-out effect on urban nongreen innovation. A possible mechanism that generates such an outcome is the program's negative influence on industrial firms without green innovation. Evidence of the reduction in the number of industrial firms without green innovation, the increase in the number of zombie firms and the reduction in foreign newborn firms all support this argument. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","Low-carbon policy; Porter hypothesis; Urban green innovation; Urban innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104279856

BC is one such component with severe implications in determining the fate of the environment. Hence, a comprehensive review has been conducted using meta-analyses of 675 studies spanning from 2009 to 2019 on a global scale to address the role of BC in a different environment, emphasizing sources, properties, transport, limitation, and uncertainties. Key findings of this review on the role of BC suggest that research directions have focused on the following topics as (1) fate of toxicants stored in the BC after deposition in the different environment; (2) role of BC on soil temperature with the perspective of agricultural production; and (3) atmospheric studies on large-scale coverage of mixing state chemistry and models. This review is designed to provide essential information on the current state of BC in a different environment and provide platforms for new conceptual frameworks.

Environmental performance analysis is widely considered a crucial and useful tool for effectively protecting the environment and developing a sustainable society. Many analytical techniques have been used to assess carbon emission performance, among which data envelopment analysis (DEA) is prominent. However, few previous DEA-related carbon emission performance studies recognize that the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions is limited to a specific level by authorities; ignoring this fixed-sum requirement may lead to distortions and deviations in empirical results. This paper proposes an alternative Malmquist DEA approach for evaluating the carbon emission performance while considering fixed-sum undesirable outputs. For this purpose, we develop a generalized equilibrium efficient frontier DEA model with fixed-sum undesirable outputs and combine the model with the Malmquist productivity index (MPI). The proposed approach is applied to assess the carbon emission performance of 30 provincial regions in China from 2009 to 2015. Then we provide analytical results and policy suggestions regarding the provincial carbon emission performance in China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission performance; Data envelopment analysis; Fixed-sum undesirable outputs; Malmquist productivity index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104119464

However, the small thermal conductivity (less than 0.5 W/(m·K)) and unstable morphology of OPCMs in melting state largely restrict their applications. Directed at these, different modification methods are designed or invented, such as physical blending, microencapsulation, spinning and pre-constructing three-dimensional (3D) filler network, etc. Thereinto, the method of pre-constructing 3D filler network to modify the OPCMs is a highly effective way to fabricate the composite phase change materials (PCMs) having a large thermal conductivity, a high phase change enthalpy and an excellent encapsulation ability at a low filler content. Besides, this method also has some other merits, for example, easy to handle and convenient for large-scale production. To date, various strategies, such as physical mixing, ice-templated method, hydrothermal and chemical reduction, carbonization, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), chemical crosslinking and template method, etc. have been developed to prepare the 3D filler network for the composite PCMs. In this review, we will focus on preparation methods and applications of 3D filler network, which are mainly used in the composite PCMs. Especially, we will discuss the effects of microstructures of 3D filler network on the performances of the composite PCMs and the advantages and disadvantages of different methods. Moreover, the advanced applications of the composites OPCMs are also summarized.

Although organic fertilization regulating aggregation has been well studied in various soils, how organic fertilization mediates microbial groups involved in soil N cycle in aggregates remained largely unclear. Therefore, the objective was to investigate the effect of 27 years of application of mineral and organic fertilizers (peanut straw, rice straw, radish, and pig manure) on the abundance of major microbial groups involved in the soil N cycle in four soil aggregate size classes. The results showed that organic fertilizers exerted significant impacts on the communities of microbes possessing N-cycling-related genes, with pig manure having a more important effect than plant residues. However, aggregate size classes contributed more to the variation (20%) than organic fertilizers (12%). Organic fertilizer types did not impact the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). However, aggregate size strongly altered the abundance of AOA, but not AOB, with AOA being particularly abundant in <53 μm aggregates. Organic fertilizers and aggregate size significantly influenced the abundance of the nirS gene rather than the nirK gene. There were greater amounts of nirS in the soils treated with rice straw and pig manure, primarily due to the higher soil organic matter content. As for fungal denitrification, there was a greater abundance of FnirK in microaggregates than in macroaggregates. Organic fertilizers and aggregate size significantly influenced the abundance of nosZ I and nosZ II genes, with aggregate size playing a more pronounced role. The abundance of nosZ I increased with increasing aggregate size while the abundance of nosZ II gene showed the opposite trends. This result revealed the clear niche differentiation of nosZ I and nosZ II genes in Ultisols, with nosZ I and nosZ II preferred to inhabit in macroaggregates and microaggregates, respectively. Overall, our results provide critical insights into the ecophysiology of major N-cycling-related genes in aggregates from an acidic Ultisol. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Acidic soils; Aggregate size; Fungal denitrifying genes; N2O-reducing genes; Niche differentiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103957195

The main objectives of this study were to i) investigate the temporal variations of ambient PM2.5 in Marseille (Southern France), where air pollution is again a major public health issue, and ii) estimate their short-term health effects and annual trend (Mann-Kendall test) over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2019. In Marseille, the main sources of PM2.5 could be related to road traffic, industrial complexes, and oil refineries surrounded the city. The number of premature deaths and hospital admissions attributable to ambient PM2.5 exposure for non-accidental causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were estimated by using in-situ air quality data, city-specific relative risk values and baseline incidence. Despite significant reduction of PM2.5 (- 0.80 μg m−3 year−1), Marseille citizens were exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guideline for human health protection (10 μg m−3) during entire study period. Exposure to ambient PM2.5 substantially contributed to mortality and hospital admissions: 871 deaths for non-accidental causes, 515 deaths for cardiovascular diseases, 47 deaths for respiratory diseases, as well as 1034 hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases and 834 for respiratory diseases were reported between 2010 and 2019. Compliance with WHO annual limit values can result in substantial socio-economic benefits by preventing premature deaths and hospital admissions. For instance, based on the value of a statistical life and average cost of a hospital admission, the associated benefit for healthcare would have been €131 million in 2019. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of PM2.5-related non-accidental deaths decreased by 1.15 per 105 inhabitants annually. Compared to 2010–2019, the restrictive measures associated to COVID-19 pandemic led to a reduction in PM2.5 of 11% in Marseille, with 2.6 PM2.5-related deaths averted in 2020. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Fine particles; Health impact; PM2.5; Trend","Accidents; Air quality; Economics; Pulmonary diseases; Risk perception; % reductions; Ambients; Fine-particles; Health impact; Hospital admissions; Human health; PM$-2.5$; Premature death; Trend; World Health Organization; Hospitals; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; health care; public health; road traffic; temporal variation; World Health Organization; accidental death; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; Europe; France; health care; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; morbidity; mortality; oil industry; pandemic; PM2.5 exposure; public health; respiratory tract disease; traffic pollution; World Health Organization; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental exposure; epidemiology; particulate matter; Bouches du Rhone; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; France; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103930726

The effect of applying nitrate loads of ∼22, 44, 66, and 88 g NO3− m−3 h−1 on (i) STR methane and nitrate removal performance, (ii) N2O emission, and (iii) microbial composition was investigated. Methane elimination capacities from 21 ± 13.3 to 55 ± 12 g CH4 m−3 h−1 were recorded, coupled to nitrate removal rates ranging from 6 ± 3.2 to 43 ± 14.9 g NO3− m−3 h−1. N2O production was not detected under the three nitrate loading rates applied for the assessment of potential N2O emission in the continuous N-AOM process (i.e. ∼22–66 g NO−3 m−3 h−1). The lack of N2O emissions during the process was attributed to the N2O reducing capacity of the bacterial taxa identified and the rigorous control of dissolved O2 and pH implemented (dissolved O2 values ≤ 0.07 g m−3 and pH of 7.6 ± 0.4). Microbial characterization showed that the N-AOM process was performed in absence of putative N-AOM archaea and bacteria (ANME-2d, M. oxyfera). Instead, microbial activity was driven by methane-oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria (Bacteroidetes, α-, and γ-proteobacteria). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Greenhouse gas; Microbial community; Nitrate removal; Nitrous oxide production","Bacteria; Denitrification; Methane; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Activated sludge; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Greenhouses gas; Microbial communities; N$-2$/O; Nitrate loads; Nitrates removal; Nitrous oxide production; Semi-continuous; Stirred-tank reactors; Greenhouse gases; genomic DNA; methane; nitrate; nitrous oxide; oxygen; nitric acid derivative; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; liquid; methane; microbial community; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; operations technology; oxidation; pollutant removal; activated sludge; Alphaproteobacteria; anaerobic oxidation of methane; archaeon; Article; Bacteroidetes; DNA isolation; environmental impact; Gammaproteobacteria; gas; gas chromatography; genetic analysis; greenhouse gas; liquid; microbial activity; microbial community; nonhuman; pH; physical phase; reactor operation; semicontinuous liquid operation; taxonomy; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Gammaproteobacteria; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Methane; Microbiota; Nitrates; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103702559

Based on printed material, digital repositories, and personal correspondence an up-to-date assessment of all studies reported so far has been conducted. It is shown that despite India having 4.6% of its area covered by natural or man-made wetlands, being home to a very large number of wetlands, and being the second largest cultivator of paddy in the world, its wetlands—including paddy fields which are intermittently flooded as typical wetlands are—have been very poorly studied in terms of their GHG emissions. Even the reports that are available have been mostly confined to a few regions of India, and as many as seven of the most wetland-rich states—Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir—have not been studied in this respect at all. A major finding is that, contrary to a recent report published by authors based in USA, intermittently irrigated rice fields have not been found to emit exceptionally high quantities of nitrous oxide. The study brings out the urgent need for carrying out assessments of GHG emissions from wetlands throughout India with a view to finding strategies to minimize such emissions. © 2021, International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Paddy fields; Wetlands","agricultural emission; agricultural land; assessment method; cultivar; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; rice; wetland; Bihar; Chhattisgarh; Himachal Pradesh; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Jharkhand; Madhya Pradesh; Maharashtra",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103408321

In this paper, we consider the operation planning problem involving vehicle dispatching, relocation, and recharging decisions. We model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to generate the optimal policy that maximizes the total profits. We propose a flexible policy to provide optimal actions according to the reward considering future requests and vehicle availability. We show that our model outperforms the predetermined rules on improving profits. To handle the curse-of-dimensionality caused by the large scale of state space and uncertainty, we develop an asynchronous learning method to solve the problem by approximating the value function. We first draw the samples of exogenous information and update the quality of approximations based on the quality of decisions, then approximate the exact cost-to-go value function by solving an approximation subproblem efficiently given the state at each period. Two variant algorithms are presented for cases with scarce and sufficient information. We also incorporate the state aggregation and post-decision analysis to further improve computational efficiency. We use a set of shared actual data from Didi platform to verify the proposed model in numerical experiments. To conclude, we extract managerial insights that suggest important guidelines for the ride-hailing operations planning problem. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Asynchronous learning; Flexible operations planning; Markov Decision Process; Ride-hailing service","algorithm; article; human; learning; Markov decision process; practice guideline; profit; reward; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103304403

We quantified greenhouse gas fluxes from managed 9 year old plantations of these species for all seasons in three consecutive years (2012–2013, 2013–2014 and 2014–2015) using manually-operated closed chamber method. CH4, N2O and CO2 were analysed by using Varian 450-GC based on Gas Chromotography. The mean soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in the Jatropha curcas plantation recorded were 7.720 t ha−1 y−1, 0.023 t ha−1 y−1 and 0.017 t ha−1 y−1, respectively. While in Pongamia pinnata soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were recorded to be 7.633 t ha−1 y−1, 0.008 t ha−1 y−1 and 0.019 t ha−1 y−1, respectively. Our results indicate that Jatropha curcas has higher GHG emissions than Pongamia pinnata. A pronounced seasonal variability was observed in CH4, N2O and CO2 flux rates. The highest emissions for Jatropha curcas occur during rainy season, whereas for Pongamia pinnata it occurs during winter. Soil moisture and temperature being the most influencing factors for CO2 fluxes from soil. We conclude that these plantation has an effect on soil-atmosphere GHG exchanges and can act as a good source of mitigation of greenhouse gases. © 2021, International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Climate mitigation; Greenhouse gases; Jatropha curcas; Pongamia pinnata","biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; dicotyledon; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; plantation; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; semiarid region; soil moisture; soil temperature; India; Jatropha curcas; Pongamia pinnata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103186557

Only a few models of these actions exist and are solely based on indoor and outdoor thermal environments. This leads to large discrepancies between the actual and predicted indoor environment. There is no such study prevails in India and this highlights the need to investigate the occupant's local adaptive behaviour using the actual field data. The present study has developed adaptive behaviour models that relate window opening behaviour, blind use behaviour and fan use behaviour to the environment conditions in naturally ventilated buildings under the composite climate of India. Field measurements of adaptive behaviour actions and environmental conditions were conducted in thirty-one naturally ventilated buildings. The occupant's adaptive behaviour models were thus governed by various explanatory variables. In window opening behaviour model, the indoor and outdoor air temperatures, indoor air velocity, indoor lighting level and indoor CO2 were important governing variables. In blind use behaviour model, the indoor lighting level, indoor air velocity and window state were significant governing variables and in fan use behaviour model, the indoor air temperature, indoor air velocity and window and blind states were the most influencing variables. The occupant's adaptive actions were mostly governed by the pursuit of comfort and primarily driven based on the change in indoor environment rather than outdoors.

The selection of fertilizer type may change these emissions, but whether or not using local resources such as indigenous organic fertilizer can reduce CH4 emissions is still unknown. This paper studied the effect of indigenous organic fertilizer compared with various fertilizers on methane (CH4) emissions at paddy fields and its relationship to the paddy growth by utilizing local resources. This research used a closed-chamber method and linear regression analysis. The planned experiment was conducted in a randomized block design pattern with five treatments and repeated four times, namely, (1) no fertilizer/control; (2) inorganic fertilizer; (3) cow manure compost; (4) indigenous organic fertilizer; and (5) commercial fertilizer. The CH4 gas was collected at 31, 61, and 91 days after transplanting (dat) and observed for its concentration. The results showed that at 31 dat, inorganic fertilizer was the highest CH4 flux and the lowest was no fertilizer; at 61 dat, commercial fertilizer was the highest CH4 flux and the lowest was no fertilizer; and at 91 dat, no fertilizer was the highest CH4 flux and the lowest was cow manure compost. Seasonal CH4 emission rates among the fertilizers from inorganic fertilizer, cow manure compost, indigenous organic fertilizer, and commercial fertilizer were 1.952, 1.884, 1.001, and 0.954 times, respectively, of that from no fertilizer. The statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the result of CH4 flux and the plant height whereas the lack of a positive correlation was found between the relationship of CH4 flux and the number of tillers. As a result, CH4 fluxes per grain yield were acquired in the following order: inorganic fertilizer &gt; cow manure compost &gt; indigenous organic fertilizer &gt; commercial fertilizer &gt; no fertilizer with 104.14, 91.79, 67.30, 63.38, and 34.22 kg Mg−1, respectively. The application of the appropriate type of fertilizer is one of the best mitigation methods to reduce CH4 emissions in paddy fields. The results showed that total CH4 emission from indigenous organic fertilizer was lower than that from inorganic fertilizer, and there was not a large difference between indigenous organic fertilizer and commercial fertilizer. Therefore, the use of indigenous organic fertilizer from local resources can be used as an alternative mitigation strategy to reduce CH4 emission from the paddy field. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Indigenous organic fertilizer; Local resources; Methane emission; Paddy field",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103056289

We used MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Algorithm) to predict the distribution of a highly invasive species, namely Parthenium hysterophorus L. under four Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) in 2050 and 2070 at global (world), regional (India) and local (Jammu & Kashmir State) spatial scales. Model predictions indicated differences in the extent of expansion in the distribution of this species under different climate change scenarios with marginal increase in moderately suitable area at the global scale but mostly a declining trend was noticed in its suitable and highly suitable area in future. More or less similar trend was predicted for India where increase in moderately suitable area was evident but decline in suitable and highly suitable areas was observed. In respect of Jammu & Kashmir, moderately suitable as well suitable area showed increase mostly under RCP scenarios of 6.0 and 8.5 in 2050 as well as 2070. Further analysis revealed that current centroid of P. hysterophorus is in south of Jammu and Kashmir and is predicted to shift by an average of 20.48 km in the north-west direction by 2050 and by 36.83 km by 2070. The future suitable area is likely to be around Hirapora Wildlife sanctuary in Kashmir. Pairwise comparison of the niche overlap and dynamics of P. hysterophorus between the native Americas and each of the regions (Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania) where the species is introduced using Schoener’s D revealed variations in the niche overlap which was high between native Americas and Australia (0.70) and Africa (0.69), moderate between Americas and Asia (0.59) and low between Americas and Oceania (0.24). Exclusion of 25% of rare climatic conditions did not have any effect on the niche overlap index (D). Niche similarity test was not significant for any of the pairwise comparisons of native Americas and the continents in which the species is non-native indicating that the native niche is more similar to the exotic niche than any randomly sampled niche from the exotic range. But the niche equivalency tests showed that the environmental realized niche of P. hysterophorus in its invaded range was not totally equivalent to that in the native range indicating niche differentiation. The niche dynamic indices based on analogous and the entire climatic space in the native and introduced regions revealed a very high niche stability. A very limited niche expansion was noticed only in Asia and niche unfilling was evident in Oceania. Like niche overlap index (D), niche expansion and niche stability were not affected by the exclusion of 25% of rare climatic conditions but marginal change was noticed in niche unfilling in the Oceania. The above predictions have implications for formulation of policies at local, regional and global level for the management of this invasive species. © 2021, International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Centroid shift; Habitat suitability; MaxEnt modelling; Niche conservatism and range expansion and contraction","climate change; climate conditions; conservation management; dicotyledon; future prospect; introduced species; invasive species; niche overlap; Anastasia State Park; Asia; Australia; Central America; Florida [United States]; India; Jammu and Kashmir; North America; South America; United States; Oceania; Parthenium hysterophorus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102819131

As for China, strongyloidiasis occur mainly in South of China and no relevant information about the parasite infection in North China was available. Case Presentation: An 84-year-old man from Shanxi province, North China, was admitted to Department of Nephrology with complaints of a 7-month history of intermittent edema of both lower extremity with foam urine and 3-day history of fever, chill and diarrhea. Large numbers of rhabditiform larva of Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) were observed in a stool sample. Diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection was established by morphological observations of larvae under the microscope in both wet mount and Wright–Giemsa staining smear and further confirmed by molecular biology identification. Conclusions: We report a rare case of S. stercoralis infection in a patient with chronic renal failure from North China, which implies the possibility of developing human strongyloidiasis in cooler climates. In addition, our case suggests that clinicians should consider the complication of S. stercoralis infection in immunosuppressed patient populations with chronic renal failure.

Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in cities in China, sources of particulate matter, including gasoline-burning vehicles, dust-producing building sites, and coal-fired factories, almost all ceased at the end of January 2020. It was not until early April that outdoor activities recovered. Ten cities were selected as observation sites during the period from 19 December 2019 to 30 April 2020, covering the periods of preclosure, closure, and gradual resumption. A total of 11 720 groups of data were obtained, and 4 indicators were used to assess the characteristics of the particle pollution in the period. The quality of the atmospheric environment was visibly influenced by human activities in those 5 mo. The concentrations of particulate matter with particle sizes below 10 µm (PM10) decreased slightly in February and March and then began to increase slowly after April with the gradual recovery of production. The concentrations of particulate matter with particle sizes below 2.5 µm (PM2.5) decreased greatly in most regions, especially in northern cities, during closure and maintained a relatively stable level in the following 3 mo. The trends of PM10 and PM2.5 indicated that the reduced human activities during the COVID-19 lockdown decreased the concentrations of particulate matter in the air, and the difference between the PM10 and PM2.5 trends might be due to the different sources of the 2 particles and their different aerodynamics. However, during closure, the particulate matter pollution in the cities remained at a high level, which indicated that some ignored factors other than outdoor production activities, automobile exhaust, and construction site dust might have contributed greatly to the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, and the tracing of the particulate matter should be given further attention in environmental management.

The coal-fired power industry is a key to achieving synergistic reduction of air pollutant and carbon emissions. This paper quantifies and compares synergistic effects of technology and policy reduction measures in the coal-fired power industry. Using 2158 coal-fired power generators of different types at 833 coal-fired power plants in 24 Chinese provinces as research samples, this study quantifies and assesses the synergistic effects of structural and technical emission reductions at coal-fired power plants through top-down analysis of structural emission reduction and bottom-up analysis of technical emission reduction. Comparing the synergy coefficients of both types of emission reduction measures, it is determined that structural emission reduction has a significant positive synergistic effect on energy consumption, pollutant and carbon emissions, with no extra emissions and energy consumption. On the other hand, technical emission reduction results in the negative synergistic effect of CO2 emissions due to electric power consumption and chemical reactions emissions in end-of-pipe measures of emission control, which demonstrated that prevalent desulfurization measure WFDG synergistically led to 0.688 tons of CO2 and 5.132 MWh electric power consumption for 1 ton of SO2 removed. Therefore, the structural emission reduction is an important means for multi-target energy conservation and emission reduction. It is necessary for technical emission reduction to reduce related negative synergistic effects while enhancing target pollutant removal. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","air pollutants; carbon emissions; coal-fired power plants; synergistic emission reduction","Air pollution; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mining; Structural analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant emission; Coal-fired power generators; Coal-fired power plant; Electric power consumption; Electricity demands; Emission reduction; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Reduction measures; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102611638

Soil bacterial communities are expected to be more strongly driven by pH and less by other edaphic and climatic factors. Thus, alkalinisation or acidification along with climate change may influence soil bacteria, with subsequent influences for example on nutrient cycling and vegetation. Future forecasts of soil bacteria are therefore needed. We applied species distribution modelling (SDM) to quantify the roles of environmental factors in governing spatial abundance distribution of soil bacterial OTUs and to predict how future changes in these factors may change bacterial communities in a temperate mountain area. Models indicated that factors related to soil (especially pH), climate and/or topography explain and predict part of the abundance distribution of most OTUs. This supports the expectations that microorganisms have specific environmental requirements (i.e., niches/envelopes) and that they should accordingly respond to environmental changes. Our predictions indicate a stronger role of pH over other predictors (e.g. climate) in governing distributions of bacteria, yet the predicted future changes in bacteria communities are smaller than their current variation across space. The extent of bacterial community change predictions varies as a function of elevation, but in general, deviations from neutral soil pH are expected to decrease abundances and diversity of bacteria. Our findings highlight the need to account for edaphic changes, along with climate changes, in future forecasts of soil bacteria. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"abundance; bacterium; biodiversity; climate change; microbial community; nutrient cycling; spatial analysis; topography; Bacteria (microorganisms); bacterium; biodiversity; ecosystem; genetics; microbiology; soil; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102596896

At the same time, forest landscape restoration has regained global attention as an integral strategy for climate change mitigation. Owing to unpredictable future risks and the need for new forests that provide multiple ecosystem services, mixed-species forests have been advocated for this purpose. However, the successful establishment of mixed forests requires intrinsic knowledge of biodiversity's role for forest ecosystem functioning. In this respect, a better understanding of tree-tree interactions and how they contribute to observed positive tree species richness effects on key ecosystem functions is critical. Here, we review the current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of tree-tree interactions and argue that positive net biodiversity effects at the community scale may emerge from the dominance of positive over negative interactions at the local neighbourhood scale. In a second step, we demonstrate how tree-tree interactions and the immediate tree neighbourhood's role can be systematically assessed in a tree diversity experiment. The expected results will improve predictions about the effects of tree interactions on ecosystem functioning based on general principles. We argue that this knowledge is urgently required to guide the design of tree species mixtures for the successful establishment of newly planted forests. © 2021 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","BEF-China; Biodiversity; Biotic feedbacks; Facilitation; Forest structure; Resource partitioning; Tree diversity experiment; Tree neighbourhood; TreeDì",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102452172

Vulnerable populations are often most susceptible to these stressors. This study tested whether susceptibility to linear growth faltering is higher among Peruvian children from indigenous, rural, low-education, and low-income households. High-resolution weather and household survey data from Demographic and Health Survey 1996–2012 were used to explore height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) at each year of life from 0 to 5.

The study used data collected from 400 farmers selected through a multistage random sampling technique from two States, Ebonyi and Enugu States, in the zone. The factors affecting the use of some climate change coping strategies were estimated using multivariate probit regression. We isolated factors that constrain farmers from coping with changes in climate using exploratory factor analysis. The findings revealed that the majority (98%) of the smallholder farmers indicated that delay in the onset of rains, too much rainfall (70%), higher temperatures (65%), and erratic rainfall patterns (43%) were the main types of climate change they experienced. The key strategies the farmers applied in coping with climate change are buying food (45%), starting the use of sustainable land management practices (43%), planting of early maturing crops (36%), planting trees (32%), starting non-farm activity (30%), and eating less food (30%). The multivariate probit regression result indicated that some variables influenced the likelihood of simultaneous adoption of the coping strategies. For example, providing climate change information to cassava and yam farmers through extension agents significantly increases the likelihood of engaging in climate-smart practices, namely, planting early-maturing crop varieties and tree planting. We also found that farmers' experiences with climate change variables and outcomes significantly influence the coping strategies they choose. For example, a decline in crop yield was positively and significantly associated with buying food, planting early-maturing varieties, starting a non-farm activity, and eating less as coping strategies. Constraints the farmers faced in coping with climate change were grouped as cultural impediments, weak knowledge/information, ineffective agricultural extension services, and weak policy and institutions. The study recommends, among others, strengthening of public agricultural extension services, provision of climate services to farmers, implementing policies to guaranty food security and enhancing the human capital of the farm households to reduce their vulnerability to climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Constraints; Coping strategy; Root crop farming system; Socio-economic factors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102425158

Fostering a positive classroom environment is an important protective factor in preventing bullying. Authoritative classroom climates may protect victimized and bystander youth from negative mental health outcomes associated with bullying involvement. The current study examined how dimensions of authoritative classrooms–disciplinary structure and teacher support – moderate the relationship between bullying involvement (e.g., victimization, witnessing) and students’ psychological functioning (e.g., psychosocial wellbeing, emotional problems). We explored how authoritative classroom climate may protect victimized and bystander youth across different cultural contexts. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted on two separate samples of youth, from China (2,395 students in grades 5-9, from 58 classrooms across 5 schools), and Canada (538 students in grades 5-8, from 31 classrooms across 5 schools). Findings indicated that both victimization and witnessing were associated with lower psychosocial wellbeing and higher levels of emotional problems among Chinese and Canadian youth. For Chinese youth, witnessing was less strongly associated with lower psychosocial wellbeing in classrooms with higher disciplinary structure. In contrast, witnessing was more strongly related to emotional problems and lower psychosocial wellbeing in Chinese classrooms with higher teacher support. Collectively, these findings suggest that bullying negatively affects the mental health of the broader school community across both Chinese and Canadian contexts. In more collectivist cultures, promoting classroom climates that regulate student’s behaviors by enforcing discipline fairly and consistently may help lower distress among students who witness bullying. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Authoritative school climate; Cross-cultural; Mental health; Victimization; Witnessing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102262898

Due to their multiple uses, short growing periods, high nutritional and medicinal values, wide adaptability has become popular not only to researcher but also for farmers and consumers globally. It grows in a wider range from low land Terai to higher mountains of Nepal. Maxent modelling was used to quantify the current suitable habitat and predicted future suitable area under different climate change scenarios, based on representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) in two different time periods (2050 and 2070 AD) using climatic predictive variables and species localities. The most suitable habitat area of cultivation, area loss, and gained for buckwheat were determined. The model showed that about 46% area of country is climatically suitable for buckwheat within the elevation range of 289–4441 m. Habitat suitability of buckwheat would shrink by 7.5% and 8.2% under RCPs 4.5 and by 7.6% and 8.3% under 8.5 RCPs in the year 2050 and 2070, respectively. The loss and gain area analysis also indicated that suitable area would be lost more than gained in both 2050 and 2070. These findings are expected to support planning and policy framing for climatic resilience smart agriculture practice to meet the livelihood and food security problems in the mountains of Nepal. Due to medicinal value of buckwheat, its demands is increasing.

Developing countries getting rid of their wastes by dumping them in the waste landfill and this effect negatively the environment. Moreover, these wastes attract a lot of insects which thread the public health and cause many diseases. This research intended to merge the organic wastes into construction industry and turn it into a useful cheap building material. In an attempt to reduce the initial costs of building materials, sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was used as an additive in the structural brick industry. This study aims to develop cheap building bricks from integrating sugarcane bagasse (SCB) with cement brick mixture to achieve environmental, social and economic sustainability factors by reducing the black cloud and hence its effect on human health. Removing sugarcane bagasse (SCB) that produced from juice shops in Egyptian streets, affect the visual image of the street as well as the quality of Egyptians life. Moreover, integrating wastes in construction industry will improve street appearance and improves environmental conditions by reducing local climate pollution (carbon dioxide emissions and black clouds). The research used experimental method to measure the structural properties of the new cement brick that is integrated with SCB. The results revelled that replacing cement with 1.5% sugarcane bagasse content, will preserve the structural performance of the bricks with respect to ductility and higher strength. In addition, the proposed integration will reduce the initial cost of building materials and this action will affect the price of the Egyptian real estate market. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","Cement brick; Organic waste fibers; Reduced construction; Reducing the black cloud; Reducing the cost of building materials; Sugarcane bagasse (SCB)","Bagasse; Brickmaking; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Construction industry; Cost reduction; Developing countries; Global warming; Structural analysis; Sustainable development; Wastes; Carbon dioxide emissions; Economic sustainability; Environmental conditions; Experimental methods; Organic wastes; Real estate market; Structural performance; Sugarcane bagasse; Brick",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102041779

The number of international travellers has increased more than 50-fold in the past 70 years. However, the contribution of tourism to (municipal) waste generation is also large and is increasing, accompanied by an increase in some environmental and socio-economic impacts. An average value of 1.67 kg waste is now generated per tourist (Obersteiner et al., 2017). Waste prevention and recycling should therefore be major objectives in tourist waste management by municipal authorities. Within the EU H2020-funded project “URBANWASTE – Urban Strategies for Waste Management in Tourist Cities”, eco-innovative waste prevention and management strategies were implemented in 10 pilot cities with high levels of tourism, in order to reduce urban waste production and improve municipal waste management. This study examined the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions savings for three selected waste prevention and treatment options: food waste prevention, reductions in single use plastic and increased separate collection and recycling of waste. Benefits were expressed per kg waste prevented or diverted higher up the waste hierarchy and per 1000 tourists. The measures achieved potential GHG emission savings of between 4 and 189 kg CO2-eq. per 1000 tourists, depending on local conditions such as the existing waste management system. Measures tackling food waste reduction and separate collection had low emissions associated with the measure itself, whereas for assessed measures reducing the use of single use plastics by providing reusable alternatives, emissions associated with the measures were relatively high. This was due to the emissions associated with the production of the alternative reusable products. Influencing factors reducing the carbon footprint of waste management in tourism other than the kind of waste focused on were the existing waste management system (especially for biowaste) as well as the practicability and scalability of measures under the divers regional circumstances. © 2021 The Authors","LCA; Tourism; Waste prevention",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101993686

These were assessed for CCI adaptation tendencies in their socioeconomics and farming operation/techniques (FOI) indices, CCI awareness, CCI adaptation strategies, and perceived required interventions (RIs) using structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed through descriptive and multivariate regression tools. Respondents were mostly male, adults, educated, Christian, married, medium-sized family, social group members, 1–5 years’ experience, medium-sized farms, and government trained. Income was 1.0–6.0 million Ugx/year. In FOI, semi-intensive culture system, use of rainwater plus groundwater, small-sized (&lt; 0.5 ha) ponds, ponds possession of inlets and outlets, seasonal farming and mixed culture/farming dominated.

The main contribution of the current paper is to examine the impact of green investment, renewable energy consumption and technological innovation on CO2 emissions of 30 sample provinces of China from 1995–2019. The results of CS-ARDL approach shows that renewable energy, technological innovation and green investment is important in abating CO2 emissions in China. Also, EKC for provincial data of China is confirmed. However, financial development escalates carbon emissions in China. It is also found that any policy change in green investment, financial development, renewable energy, technological innovation, and natural resource rent has strong implications for environmental quality of China. Therefore, shifting the economic structure to renewable energy is an important strategy to reduce carbon emissions. It is suggested that an adequate level of green investment projects should be initiated. Appropriate regulatory and economic drivers can boost investment businesses with more resources provided for the promotion of technical assistance. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","CO2 emissions; CS-ARDL; environmental degradation; green investment; provincial data",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101193620

We find that the relative market shares of the two airports are a function of time and distance, relative fares, and absolute frequencies. Given increasing congestion and population growth patterns, there appears to be potential for expanded operations at Ontario, with resulting economic and environmental benefits. We define the potential market as those travelers choosing LAX despite being closer in travel time and distance to ONT, based on specific postal codes. Using estimates of the value of time, vehicle and aircraft operating costs, and emissions, we calculate the potential effects of shifting both for the average individual passenger and for 10 percent of the potential market from LAX to ONT. These estimated shifts would require only a relatively small percentage change in flight operations. We estimate the value of time and cost savings for both private and ride-sharing services at between $6 million and $11 million annually for a 10 percent shift, depending on whether parking fee differentials are included. The parking fee differentials represent just over half the estimated savings for private vehicle travelers, and to some degree may reflect locational rents rather than resource costs to the overall economy. We also estimate potential reductions in CO2 emissions of more than 4200 tons annually for a 10 percent shift, as well as meaningful reductions in hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Airport access; Airport competition; Airport policy; Airport-airline relationships; Regional airports",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101082833

This irregular observation leads to thought that the cause of disease is new to this particular region. Molecular identification of the isolated fungus proved that the causal agent is Peronospora viciae. The sequences of the fungal isolate sent to GenBank and registered under accession number MN620384. Under field trials, it was observed that throughout the two cultivated seasons the fungicides application had greater effect on downy mildew incidence comparing with applied chemical inducers. Along the two cultivation seasons, pea plants sprayed with salicylic acid, potassium sorbate and ascorbic acid highly suppressed the disease incidence between 12.4 and 17.1%. Moderate effect was recorded as 19.2–22.7% disease reduction with potassium bicarbonate, lemongrass oil, lemongrass oil and humic acid application. The lowest effect was recorded as 32.5% at sodium benzoate treatment; meanwhile, 54.3% disease incidence was recorded at untreated control. Under field conditions, significant reduction in pea downy mildew disease was achieved by the use of fungicide alternative as foliar application. Therefore, these approaches could be utilized successfully for controlling this foliar disease especially they distinguished with safely use and avoidance of environmental pollution. © 2021, Indian Phytopathological Society.","Chemical inducers; Disease control; Downy mildew; Fungicides; Pea pods; Peronospora viciae",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100956645

Urged by policies to address climate change at the national and international levels, the government is committed to promote sustainable development, with emphasis laid on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, we provide an assessment of rooftop PV potential at the national level. A sampling strategy is used to acquire reduction coefficients, which are thereafter applied to energy-based equations. The result suggests that the rooftop PV potential at the country-scale is estimated at 20.04 GW with an annual energy output of 32,512 GWh. A novel architectural layout for a Solar City to be located at an identified optimum site is proposed. A shading analysis is conducted to verify the appropriateness of the city’s structural design to harness energy from the sun. An energy analysis performed, reveals that the Solar City has a solar power potential of 13.55 MW and an annual energy generation capacity equivalent to 21.99 GWh.

However, little evidence is available on associations between air pollutants and premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Therefore, we performed time-series analysis to evaluate the association between PROM and air pollution. The daily average concentrations of PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 were 54.58 μg/m3, 13.06 μg/m3 and 46.09 μg/m3, respectively, and daily maximum 8-h average O3 concentration was 95.67 μg/m3. The strongest effects of SO2, NO2 and O3 were found in lag4, lag06 and lag09, and an increase of 10 μg/m3 in SO2, NO2 and O3 was corresponding to increase in incidence of PROM of 8.74% (95% CI 2.12–15.79%), 3.09% (95% CI 0.64–5.59%) and 1.68% (95% CI 0.28–3.09%), respectively. There were no significant effects of PM2.5 on PROM. Season-specific analyses found that the effects of PM2.5, SO2 and O3 on PROM were more obvious in cold season, but the statistically significant effect of NO2 was observed in warm season. We also found the modifying effects by maternal age on PROM, and we found that the effects of SO2 and NO2 on PROM were higher among younger mothers (&lt; 35 years) than advanced age mothers (≥ 35 years); however, ≥ 35 years group were more vulnerable to O3 than &lt; 35 years group. This study indicates that air pollution exposure is an important risk factor for PROM and we wish this study could provide evidence to local government to take rigid approaches to control emissions of air pollutants. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Adverse pregnancy outcomes; Air pollution; Premature rupture of membranes; Time-series study","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); membrane; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk factor; Anhui; China; Hefei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100734296

To date, there is little research on GHG emission reduction in higher education institutions—particularly in developing countries—so this work presents such an initiative from an urban university located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Higher education institutions in Malaysia are progressively integrating similar strategies to apply the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to education-translational research activities. The paper presents the GHG emission reduction data from campus activities and a living laboratory project conducted within Universiti Malaya (UM) main campus. Emissions reduction was categorised based on the standard GHG Protocol from the Kyoto Protocol into Scope 1, 2 and 3. GHG Scope 1 contributes the most activities and yielded the main GHG emission reductions in electricity consumption (in kg CO2-eq/kWh) with a 90.72% decline for the year 2016–2017. The highest reduction for total annual GHG emissions was found for the year 2017–2018, with a reduction of 6,590,000 kg CO2-eq/year.

Heavy metals and particle sizes in 210Pb-dated sediment cores extracted from Hulun and Chagan lakes were measured to reconstruct the sediment record and evaluated health risk of heavy metals in the last 150 years in Northeast China. In general, the particle size of Hulun Lake was finer with more contents of clay than Chagan Lake, while the concentrations of most heavy metals in Hulun Lake was lower. Prior to the 1970s, significant positive correlations between most heavy metals and clay, indicating that that they were likely co-transported and both lakes were dominated by natural inputs. The two records showed significant increases in concentrations of heavy metals between 1970s and 1990s, which were associated with recent anthropogenic activities derived from principal component analysis of clay and heavy metals. Specifically, the exploitation of mineral resources and traffic source in the Hulun Lake, and the emissions of pesticides and fertilizers from agricultural activity, and the combustions of coal and fossil fuels from industrial activity in the Chagan Lake. Since 1990s, natural processes was the main source of heavy metals in Hulun Lake due to the environmental protection policy, while emissions of industrial, agricultural and domestic sewage were still the main source in Chagan Lake. Overall carcinogenic risks caused by single heavy metal elements determined for the two lakes were considered to be acceptable. However, Cr was associated with a risk for children across since 1970s which should be paid more attention. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Heavy metals; Lake sediments; Northeast China; PCA; Risk assessment","carcinogen; concentration (composition); heavy metal; human activity; lacustrine deposit; principal component analysis; risk assessment; sediment chemistry; China; Hulun Lake; Nei Monggol; Indicator indicator; heavy metal; child; China; environmental monitoring; human; lake; risk assessment; sediment; water pollutant; Child; China; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Lakes; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100536754

Although the spreading rate of COVID-19 is very high on October 6, 2020, the death rate is still less than 2.94%. Nonetheless, this review article shows that the lockdown has induced numerous positive impacts on the environment and on energy consumption. For instance, the lockdown has decreased the electricity demand by 30% in Italy, India, Germany, and the USA, and by 12–20% in France, Germany, Spain, India, and the UK. Additionally, the expenditure of the fuel supply has been decreased by 4% in 2020 as compared to the previous years (2012–2019). In particular, The global demand for coal fuel has been reduced by 8% in March and April 2020 as compared to the same time in 2019. In terms of harmful emissions, the lockdowns reduced the emissions of nitrous oxides by 20–30% in China, Italy, France, Spain, and by 77.3% in São Paulo, Brazil. Similarly, the particulate matter level has been reduced from 5–15% in Western Europe, to 200% in New Delhi, India, which in turn has enhanced the air quality in a never-seen manner in recent times. In some places, such as New York, USA, CO2 emission was also reduced by 5–10%. The water quality, in several polluted areas, has also been remarkably enhanced, for example, the dissolved oxygen content in the Ganga River, India, has increased by about 80%. Traffic congestion has also been reduced worldwide, and in some areas, it has been reduced by 50%, such as New York and Los Angeles, USA. Overall, while the COVID-19 pandemic has shrinked the global economy by 13–32%, the pandemic has also clearly benefited to other sectors, which must be considered as the spotlight for the permanent revival of the global ecosystem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; COVID-19 benefits; Environmental regeneration; Renewable energy; Surface water; Traffic congestion","air quality; COVID-19; dissolved oxygen; energy use; environmental effect; global economy; particulate matter; poverty; virus; Brazil; China; Delhi; Europe; France; Ganges River; Germany; India; Italy; Los Angeles [California]; New Delhi; New York; Spain; United States; Western Europe; Coronavirus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100447173

Findings indicate that efforts toward adaptation were limited to disaster preparedness for hurricanes, reflecting a short-term focus in the face of climate change uncertainties. In addition to the lack of finances and knowledge for incorporating adaptation measures, their capacity to adapt is diminished due to a lack of access to climate change information, skilled staff, and specific climate change planning reflecting limited human and institutional capitals. Recommendations are provided for strategies synergistic with the resilience focus of our paper such as ecosystem-based adaptation and green jobs.

Thus, better climate change adaptation strategies need to be identified and implemented. This study aimed at identifying the farmers’ perceptions of climate change and time series trend analysis of precipitation and temperature in northern Gondar Zuria District, Ethiopia. Data were gathered using a questionnaire from the institutional, socio-economic, and bio-physical situation of the 121 sample households. The survey data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21, XLSTAT software, and excel spreadsheets. The climate change trend analysis was conducted using monthly precipitation, which has been downloaded from free online resources such as Global Precipitation. The temperature data were collected using the Climate Centre and Climate Research Unit with 0.5 by 0.5 degree resolutions from 1980 to 2013. The climate variable data have been analyzed using a precipitation concentration index, anomaly index, coefficient of variation, simple linear regression, and Mann–Kendall test. The result revealed that for the main rain season (summer), a statistically insignificant decreasing trend was obtained. In the Belg season, there was a growing trend of precipitation. The max monthly and annual temperatures have increased significantly over time. However, the min temperature trend shows a non-significant increasing trend over the 1980–2013 periods. The recorded monthly precipitation and temperature data trend analysis were similar to the farmers’ perceptions of changes in temperature and rainfall over the past 30 years. Therefore, we recommend possible adaptation strategies designed for climate change. Particularly, countries whose economy is dependent on rain-fed agriculture should pay attention to the increasing trend of temperature and the decreasing and unreliable nature of rainfall. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Farmers’ perception; Gondar Zuria District; Mann–Kendall test; Rainfall; Temperature","climate change; global climate; precipitation (climatology); questionnaire survey; socioeconomic status; software; time series; trend analysis; Ethiopia; Gondar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099952214

However, due to the rise in the emission of greenhouse gases, the magnitude and frequency of future extreme rainfalls will be changed. Therefore, the current study aims to develop the IDF curves models in the region of Makkah Al Mukarramah, Saudi Arabia. In this study, five models were developed to estimate the rainfall intensity for the different durations and return periods, using three statistical parameters e, m, and C, calculated from the rainfall intensity data for the time series in each station. The results showed that the rainfall intensity average is ranged between 15.4 mm/10 min and 25.9 mm/60 min for Al Karr Sufli station from 1966 to 2005, and 29.8 mm/120 min and 49.6 mm/720 min for Baqrane station during the period of 1971–2005. Besides, the KGE, R2, and Theil’s U performance tests of the probability distribution models revealed that the exponential model is the best for the Al-Barzah, Ain Al Azizia and Al Karr Sufli, and Humma Syssed stations, and the log Pearson III model is the best model for Baqrane station. The outcomes of this research reveal the potential of this approach in projecting upcoming climate situations for urban catchment where long-term hourly rainfall data are not easily available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Estimation model; Intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves; Makkah Al Mukarramah; Probability distribution model; Rainfall intensity; Saudi Arabia; Statistical test","catchment; frequency analysis; infrastructure; precipitation intensity; probability; water management; Ain; Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Makkah; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099934374

This study determined the differences in the perception and choice of adaptation strategies between men and women farmers in Cinzana in the Segou region of Mali. The study used questionnaire interviews involving 260 farmers (49% women) and focus group discussions for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logit model to understand the determinants of the level of adoption of adaptation strategies. The results showed that, irrespective of gender, majority of farmers perceived climate change as extended period of droughts, shortened duration of rains, increased frequency of strong winds and increased day and night temperatures. While climate change perception was similar between men and women, choice of adaptation strategies differed significantly in most instances. Women farmers were generally low adopters of crop and varieties-related strategies, soil and water conservation technics (contour farming, use of organic manure), etc., compare to men. Notably, being the household head, age and the availability of free labor were found to positively increased farmers’ probability of adopting many adaptation strategies. The study recommends improving women’s access and control of production resources (land, labor) as means to improving their adoption of adaptation strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Gender; Mali; Perception","adaptive management; agricultural development; climate change; legume; probability; Cinzana; Mali; Mali; Segou; Segou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099921544

In temperate deciduous forests, increased soil frost severity can hamper tree growth and increase the mortality of fine roots, soil fauna and microorganisms, thus altering carbon and nutrient cycling. From single-site studies, however, it is unclear how the sensitivities of these responses change along continental gradients from regions with low to high snowfall. We conducted a gradient design snow cover and soil temperature manipulation experiment across a range of lowland beech forest sites to assess the site-specific sensitivity of tree growth and biogeochemical cycling to soil cooling. Even mild and inconsistent soil frost affected tree increment, germination, litter decomposition and the retention of added 15N. However, the sensitivity of response (treatment effect size per degree of warming or cooling) was not related to prevailing winter climate and snow cover conditions. Our results support that it may be valid to scale these responses to simulated winter climate change up from local studies to regional scales. This upscaling, however, needs to account for the fact that cold regions with historically high snowfall may experience increasingly harsh soil frost conditions, whereas in warmer regions with historically low snowfall, soil frost may diminish. Thus, despite the uniform biotic sensitivity of response, there may be opposing directions of winter climate change effects on temperate forests along continental temperature gradients due to different trends of winter soil temperature. © 2021, The Author(s).","European beech; forest ecology; frost sensitivity; global change ecology; gradient experiment; snow manipulation experiment; winter ecology","climate change; forest ecosystem; frost; microorganism; nutrient cycling; soil temperature; soil-vegetation interaction; stand structure; temperate forest; tree; winter; Fagus sylvatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099914197

The climate change on the other hand has a direct effect and degrades the environmental components and features of the destinations. Pakistan is highly vulnerable to changing the climate which has threatened the tourism sector. The study has emphasized on the significance of the climate in the tourism industry by using the Tourism Climate Index (TCI) which highlights suitable regions and seasons. TCI has been used worldwide to enumerate the impacts of climate change on tourism and tourist destinations. The current study calculates the TCI for four cities of Pakistan, chosen by public opinion. For measuring the index, climatic data of twenty-one years (1997–2017) were taken from the Pakistan Meteorological Department, which include temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours, humidity and wind speed. The results showed that among the seasonal distribution, autumn and spring are good seasons for tourism. Climatic suitability in summer was not favorable for Lahore and Islamabad because of high rainfall and lower thermal comfort. A rapid change in the Annual TCI score was observed and investigated through the contribution of TCI components which happens to be the core reason for the change. Analysis has shown that 75% of the study area as a Bi-modal shoulder peak and 25% as a winter peak. For city Lahore, a maximum number of months were observed as “Excellent” and “Good” for tourism due to a high TCI score. Furthermore, future projection predicts that tourism in Lahore will be highly threatened due to rapidly changing climate.

A whole range of human activities has been suspended Monday 17 March 2020 in all French regions. Since then experiments are progressing to reflect the effectiveness of reduced emissions. In this paper, we looked at variations of pollutants prior to, during and after containment period. In a first step, we proved through experiments on eight air pollutants, how all daily maximum pollutants concentration have decreased during containment phase, apart from the ozone pollutant O3. This Ozone pollutant has indeed increased by 27.19% during lockdown period and kept growing by 21.35% as well right after deconfinement. Indeed, the maximum daily concentrations detected in different regions of France, have decreased by 18.18%, 37.14%, 20.36%, 9.28%, 44.38%, 5.1% and 44.38%, respectively, for the pollutants SO2, NO2, CO, C6H6, NOX, PM2.5 and PM10. Declining levels of other pollutants, however, were not sustained after deconfinement for NO2, NOX and PM10. We have reinforced these findings by classifying each pollutant according to the ATMO and AQI indexes, to better visualize their criticality throughout the three lockdown phases (Pre/During/Post). The family of air pollutant variables with their associated geographical sources was thereafter exploited to justify their approximate contribution to the daily mortality rates associated to COVID-19 across all French regions. However, more thorough study is still in progress to validate this finding. Finally, coming up to the abrupt changes in airborne pollutants experienced in this period, a question about future climate crisis was raised again. Whereby a weighting study has shown the current and very short-term French scenario (Status-Quo) in view of its current environmental path, the political responses made towards future climate change crisis and French investments done in this sense. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","France air pollutants concentrations analysis; Multiple correlations; Pre/during and post lockdown periods; SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19); Scenarios projection","atmospheric pollution; climate change; containment; COVID-19; model validation; mortality; ozone; pollutant source; France; SARS coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099760107

Building on Tania Murray Li’s work on trusteeship, and drawing on governmentality studies, along with ethnographic insights from two low carbon energy projects, this paper illuminates two less examined aspects of politics of energy projects. First, the designs of these projects embed particular imagined subjects, and specific techniques, to afford governance. In particular, trustees use techniques of expertise, techniques of legitimacy, and techniques of subjectivity. Second, trusteeship is a contingent phenomenon as a clear line between trustees and subjects is often missing. Many actors, simultaneously trustees and subjects, also carry socio-cultural subjectivities of class, caste and gender, which complicates the conduct of conduct. Some trustees look for benefiting people, some for profits, some to make a political career and, yet others, to support their social groups. By engaging with trusteeship, the paper flags that the governance techniques do not always benefit the ‘beneficiaries’ and are often counterproductive.

The results show that (1) China’s OFDI has increased carbon dioxide emission intensity while the IFDI has a significant inhibitory effect on carbon dioxide emission intensity.

Unlike earlier forms of causality maps such as fuzzy cognitive maps, this novel approach uses two kinds of elements represented as different types of graph nodes. Based on the P-graph framework, “objects” and their “mechanisms” (or actions) are represented by O-type and M-type nodes, respectively. Objects consist of both tangible (e.g., technologies) and intangible (e.g., policies) elements, while mechanisms are the roles that objects play within the system. Objects in the network influence each other through these mechanisms as indicated by arcs. Two P-graph algorithms are used for this application. First, the maximal structure generation (MSG) is used to generate a maximal causality map based on specifications of local links of individual objects; the causality map assembly is automatic and does not require human understanding of the global problem topology. Next, the solution structure generation (SSG) algorithm is used to algorithmically generate all structurally feasible causality maps for the problem. The alternative networks can be evaluated to gauge practically viable candidate policy and technology combinations. Criticality of different objects can be quantified based on the frequency of occurrence in the enumerated causality maps. The methodology is illustrated using a case study on a policy framework for negative emissions technologies (NETs) for CO2 removal. The potential of this technique to determine how to sustain “virtuous networks” or to deactivate “vicious networks” is also discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Causality maps; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Knowledge networks; Negative emissions technologies; Process network synthesis; Socio-technological systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098959743

This article tests this theory at the subnational level through an analysis of the 50 US states. Drawing on energy and emissions data from US government sources, descriptive statistics and regression analyses show clear correlations between states’ production of coal, oil, and gas and higher carbon intensities. Evidence is also provided for four carbon curse mechanisms that drive this: extractive emissions, fuel-related crowding out, weaker incentives to invest in energy efficiency, and pressure to subsidize fuel consumption. These mechanisms highlight both new avenues of impact for supply-side climate policy and the difficulty of implementing it. Overall, this article makes the case for further attention to the carbon curse, which could serve as an important analytical bridge between supply and demand-side approaches to climate and energy policy. By demonstrating the likelihood of a subnational carbon curse, it also greatly extends the scope of its potential applicability. Countries that are not fossil fuel rich at a national level but have fuel rich subnational regions should also take heed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon curse; Carbon intensity; Energy supply; Fossil fuels; Resource curse; Subnational",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098712959

The specific measure has been proposed by Denmark and other co-sponsors in the context of the relevant discussion at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and in particular the so-called Initial IMO Strategy. The IMO is a specialized United Nations agency that regulates shipping. The Initial IMO Strategy, adopted in 2018, has been the most recent major international environmental agreement on how to reduce GHG emissions from ships at a global level. The central research question in this paper is to ascertain the potential impacts of the aforementioned measure to least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). There are concerns that such states may be negatively impacted, or even disproportionately negatively impacted, by whatever measure is decided by the IMO. After gaps in the literature and data are identified, our methodology develops a list of potential negative impacts, and looks at a set of factors that may influence these impacts. Then, we discuss how the goal-based measure may impact LDCs/SIDs as regards each of the identified negative impacts. The analysis argues that for LDCs and SIDS a risk for negative and disproportionately negative impacts exists. The only negative impact of which both the probability and the consequence are considered high is the difficulty to finance retrofitting of old ships or investment in new ships. As such, this is likely a disproportionally negative impact. At the same time, the degree of share (or responsibility) of the goal-based measure with respect to such potential negative impacts, vis-à-vis the share of other factors contributing to these impacts, cannot be precisely ascertained, even though we conjecture this share to be low. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Green house gases; IMO; Impact assessment; Least developed countries; Shipping; Small island developing states","data set; emission control; greenhouse gas; investment; maritime transportation; ship handling; shipping; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098667860

We find that the ensemble and individual RCM simulations generally preserve the broad regional scale ENSO signal from the general circulation models (GCMs) over different regions around of the world, reproducing the majority of the observed regional responses to ENSO forcing. Furthermore, in some cases, the RCM ensemble and individual models can improve the spatial pattern of teleconnections and the amplitudes of these patterns compared to the driving global models.

As climate actions reshape existing understandings of what cities are or ought to be, they constitute new modalities of what recent scholarship has referred to as ‘climate urbanism’. This research has framed climate urbanism as a climate-inflected iteration of neoliberal urban development, geared towards the mobilization of ‘green’ private capital for large-scale infrastructural projects, focused on carbon metrics, and conducive to population displacement through eco-gentrification. In this intervention, we commend these efforts to deliver a critical perspective on how climate change gives rise to forms of urbanism that reproduce urban injustices without addressing the root causes of the climate crisis. However, we warn against two biases in recent scholarship, namely an emphasis on technological solutions and an overreliance on familiar contexts of climate action. The literature on climate urbanism does not yet reflect the diversity of urban responses emerging under the broad umbrella of urban climate action.

Based on the Argentinean “HB4” technology, this paper analyzes how ignorance and a sunflower gene are mobilized to overcome this difficulty in soy and wheat. HB4 seeds can be understood as myopic: the technology does not obstruct the capacity of soy and wheat plants to sense droughts, but it prevents their natural reaction, which would be to put a halt on crop production and redirect their energy toward survival. Plants thus become “short-sighted” to droughts. Informed by ignorance studies and by the immunological concept of tolerance, this paper analyzes HB4 myopia as a type of nonhuman ignorance: an asset that allows plant breeders to achieve varied plant responses to droughts and to encode their capitalist values (that prioritize production over survival) into plants’ DNA.

An ensemble of five twenty-first century projections with the Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) and their driving Global Climate Models (GCMs) are analyzed in terms of the atmospheric water budget terms (precipitation, P; evapotranspiration, ET; and moisture flux convergence, C). Special focus is on four subregions: Amazon (AMZ), La Plata basin (LPB), Mid-Europe (ME) and Eastern Europe (EA). The precipitation change signal in SAM presents a dipole pattern, i.e. drier conditions in AMZ and wetter conditions in LPB. Over the two European regions a seasonality is evident, with an increase of ~ 25% in precipitation for DJF and a decrease of ~ 35% in JJA. The atmospheric water budget drivers of precipitation change vary by region and season. For example, in DJF the main drivers are related to the large-scale moisture flux convergence, while in JJA over the AMZ atmospheric moisture flux convergence plays only a minor role and local processes dominate. For JJA in the GCMs the high values of the residual term do not allow us to assess which mechanisms drive the precipitation change signal over the AMZ and LPB, respectively. Same conclusions are found for the RegCM4 JJA simulations over the LPB and EA. This points to the importance of the spatial resolution of climate simulations and the role of parameterization schemes in climate models. Our work illustrates the usefulness of analyzing regional water budgets for a better understanding of precipitation change patterns around our globe. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric water balance; Climate change; CORDEX-CORE; RegCM4","atmosphere; climate change; climate modeling; moisture flux; precipitation (climatology); temporal variation; water budget; Central Europe; La Plata Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096381431

The development of inexhaustible energy rehabilitated from agricultural waste is an alternative for fossil fuel to reduce CO2 emission and prevent global warming. The amount of waste generated has a direct correlation with the human population. Thus, the waste generated by the community is being added to the environment as the municipal, agricultural waste, and waste produced from forest-based industries. Moreover, there are high possibilities of having environment-friendly valuable bio-based products, including biofuels, biogas, enzymes, and biochar from biomass without competing with the food supply chain. However, only a few or limited kinds of products are produced industrially. This review highlights the significance of lignocellulosic biomass. It describes the different valuable products like biochemicals, biochar, enzymes, single-cell protein, dye dispersant, and bioplastic from lignocellulosic biomass, emphasizing their applications briefly. Besides, this review also highlights the pretreatment of biomass, mainly focusing on biological pretreatment.

It contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution, climate change impacts and traffic congestion, and to the improvement of safety, well-being and health of citizens and transport affordability of low-income population. Moreover, cycling has the potential to enhance co-modality, when used in combination with public transit. The pursue of all these advantages is dependent on the availability of an effective cycle network and bicycle parking, well designed to satisfy users' accessibility needs, while guaranteeing adequate safety and security against the risk of bicycle theft. The aim of this study is to provide a spatial multicriteria GIS-based method for the prioritization of locations of the cycle stations within an urban area, in combination with the design of a cycle network. The method takes into account spatial data related to socio-economic information, public transport accessibility, attractiveness and presence of points of interest. The methodology is applied to Catania, a medium-sized city in the south of Italy, with poor cycle infrastructures, very far from European bike ridership and a strong car dependency, even for short trips.

This study systematically investigated the spatiotemporal variations and the associated health risks of ambient O3, PM10 and PM2.5 between 2016 and 2019. The relationships between the target air pollutants and meteorological conditions were further analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient method. The results demonstrated that the annual mean concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 experienced a decreasing trend overall, and PM2.5 significantly decreased from 1.54 μg/m3 in 2016 to 1.48 μg/m3 in 2019. In contrast, the annual mean concentrations of O3 were nearly constant during the study period with a slight increasing trend. The pollutants exhibited different seasonal variations and cyclical diurnal variations. The most highest O3 pollution was seen in spring and summer, while spring and winter were the seasons with the most PM10 and PM2.5 pollution. The highest concentrations of O3 appeared in periods of strong solar radiation intensity and photochemical reactions. The highest concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 appeared at commuting time. The pollutant concentrations were significantly affected by meteorological conditions. Finally, the non-carcinogenic risks from exposure to O3, PM10 and PM2.5 were at an acceptable level (HI &lt; 0.96) and O3 accounted for ~50% of the total non-carcinogenic risks. However, PM2.5 posed highly carcinogenic risks (2.5 × 10−4 &lt; CR &lt; 1.6 × 10−1) and O3 exposure showed high potential ecological impacts on vegetation (AOT40: 23.3 ppm-h; W126: 29.0 ppm-h). © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric air pollution; Health risk; Ozone; Particulate matter; Variations characterization; Yancheng city","air quality; atmospheric pollution; coastal zone; concentration (composition); health risk; industrialization; ozone; particulate matter; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; China; Jiangsu; Yancheng; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; risk assessment; season; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094834397

But although these local government climate emergency declarations have received widespread government and media scrutiny, the precise nature and obligations of climate emergency declarations for local government remain unclear. Indeed, there is currently little analysis and understanding of what obligations local governments incur from declaring a climate emergency, whether those that have made such a declaration have fulfilled their obligations, and whether climate emergency declarations exceed the remit of existing local government environmental and climate roles and policies. This practice insight article seeks to answer these questions in both theory and practice.

This development is in line with the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management's policy goal of promoting cycling as a stand-alone mode, and in combination with trains. Such active travel policies generate social benefits, such as improved public health, reduced emissions and less congestion. The success of combined bike and train use in the Netherlands however has unresolved issues. Due to overcrowded bicycle storage facilities at large train stations, many bicycles are parked outside these facilities, resulting in public nuisance and inefficient use of space in the areas around train stations. Concurrently, the continued growth of combined bicycle-train use is desired. The policy question therefore is how to facilitate growth while accounting for the current bicycle parking problem. In tackling this challenge, this paper aims to shed more light on the bicycle parking behaviour of bicycle-train travellers. In cooperation with Dutch National Railways, train travellers were given a questionnaire designed to elicit information about their travel behaviour during the two-week period preceding the questionnaire's completion date. More than 3000 questionnaires were completed. Descriptive statistics and binary logit models were used to analyse the resulting data. We found that the privately owned bicycles used on a train trips' activity-end (the so-called ‘second bicycles’) were parked at train station parking facilities approximately four times longer than bicycles used at the train trips' home-end station. Initial estimates revealed that these second bicycles accounted for at least 45% of the bicycle parking pressure witnessed at all train stations in the Netherlands. We also found that among second bicycle owners, low-frequency train use, and using activity-end train stations located in suburbs, are positively associated with long term bicycle parking on the activity-end. Moreover, of all the times bicycles are parked, approximately 10% of activity-end bicycles, and 20% of home-end bicycles, are parked unguarded outside of train station parking facilities. There is a lower probability of home-end bicycles being parked outside of bicycle parking facilities at small train stations than at large stations. Possible solutions to the bicycle parking problem include offering more shared bicycles as alternatives to second bicycles, striving to ban second bicycles from racks situated close to train platforms (by means of pricing and enforcement), and locating parking spaces specifically designated for second bicycles further away from train platforms. This would free up parking spaces close to platforms for home-end bicycles, which are more frequently rotated in and out. Additionally, to further alleviate the parking problem, an awareness-and-warning campaign could be directed at those who wrongly park their home-end bicycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bicycle parking; Bicycle-train traveller; The Netherlands; Train station",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093698340

While this generally occurs by allocating street curbs for car parking instead of bike lanes, the privileging of the automobile is even more evident in the case of angled parking, in which cars sit roughly perpendicular to the flow of traffic. Such a layout takes up nearly double the space in the right of way as does parallel parking, which leaves even less room for bike lanes. Though angled parking is defended as a traffic-calming measure, numerous studies indicate that this layout is associated with higher rates of collisions than parallel parking. In addition, angled parking also inherently increases the number of cars that can be parked along a given curb, which incentivizes automobile travel generally. However, one challenge of understanding the impact that angled parking has on safety and bicycle infrastructure is that cities do not always maintain accurate records as to where angled parking occurs. For example, San Francisco, CA has ambitious air-quality, climate-mitigation, and active transportation goals, all of which are undermined by angled parking. Yet, its supply of this parking layout is unquantified, given that parking angle was omitted from the city’s parking census. This study uses satellite imagery to resolve this data gap, and calculates that San Francisco dedicates 50 miles of street curbs to angled parking. While some assume angled parking is a planning response to San Francisco’s famed hills, the majority of it occurs on streets with no incline at all. As to angled parking’s traffic-calming effect, this benefit appears to be non-existent in San Francisco; average vehicle speeds differed by less than a half-mile per hour between angled-parking streets and adjacent non-angled streets. The angled parking identified here—particularly the four miles that overlap with the city’s bike-lane network—represents opportunities for conversion to more balanced road layouts. Overall, this methodology can serve as the basis for identifying angled parking in other cities, a configuration that should be re-evaluated by transportation planners given its car-centric effects, debatable ability to calm traffic, and preclusion of separated bicycle facilities. © The Author(s) 2020.","complete streets; Parking; satellite imagery","cycle transport; parking; satellite imagery; traffic management; transportation planning; urban transport; California; San Francisco [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090246205

It serves as a solid scientific basis for further research related to vulnerability, impact, adaptation and climate services in addition to existing CORDEX simulations. The aim of this study is to investigate and document the climate change information provided by the CORDEX-CORE simulation ensemble, as a part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) CORDEX community. An overview of the annual and monthly mean climate change information in selected regions in different CORDEX domains is presented for temperature and precipitation, providing the foundation for detailed follow-up studies and applications. Initially, two regional climate models (RCMs), REMO and RegCM were used to downscale global climate model output. The driving simulations by AR5 global climate models (AR5-GCMs) were selected to cover the spread of high, medium, and low equilibrium climate sensitivity at a global scale. The CORDEX-CORE ensemble has doubled the spatial resolution compared to the previously existing CORDEX simulations in most of the regions (25km (0.22∘) versus 50km (0.44∘)) leading to a potentially improved representation of, e.g., physical processes in the RCMs. The analysis focuses on changes in the IPCC physical climate reference regions. The results show a general reasonable representation of the spread of the temperature and precipitation climate change signals of the AR5-GCMs by the CORDEX-CORE simulations in the investigated regions in all CORDEX domains by mostly covering the AR5 interquartile range of climate change signals. The simulated CORDEX-CORE monthly climate change signals mostly follow the AR5-GCMs, although for specific regions they show a different change in the course of the year compared to the AR5-GCMs, especially for RCP8.5, which needs to be investigated further in region specific process studies. © 2020, The Author(s).","CORDEX; CORDEX-CORE; IPCC reference regions; Regional climate change","climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; ensemble forecasting; general circulation model; numerical model; regional climate; research work; spatial resolution; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089381364

Therefore, Lebanon is currently interested in utilizing renewable energy technologies to reduce energy dependence on oil reserves and GHG emissions. The present study is focused on solar and wind power potential and the economic viability of wind/solar systems for the Rayak region in Lebanon for the first time. The input data sources for the study including the Meteorological data for wind speed and NASA database for solar energy. In the assessment of wind energy, a two-parameter Weibull distribution function was used to analyze the characteristics of wind speed. Yearly and seasonal Weibull parameters were calculated for 10 m height using the Maximum likelihood method. In addition, yearly and seasonal wind power density values were calculated. The results showed that the mean annual wind speed and wind power density values were 5.884 m/s and 124.534 W/m2, respectively, during the investigation period. It can be concluded that the value of wind power density at the region was classified as marginal wind power potential and high-scale wind turbines can be used to gather wind energy potential in the region. Furthermore, predicting wind speed depends on various atmospheric factors and random variables. Therefore, 63 ANN models are developed by varying the meteorological parameters to predict the daily wind speed in the selected region. All the models with various combinations are validated and the performances of the models are analyzed using root mean squared error. The results demonstrated that the most relevant input variables for predicting the daily wind speed were found to be temperature, pressure, and relative humidity. In the assessment of wind energy, average monthly global solar radiation data were evaluated. It is found that the annual global solar radiation was 1877.41 kWh/m2, which indicates the selected region has high solar resources and is categorized as an excellent potential class. Moreover, this study provides a comprehensive and integrated feasibility analysis of 100 MW grid-connected wind and solar projects economic projects that can be developed in the country to reduce the electricity crisis and GHG emissions. Several different economic and financial indicators were calculated. The results indicate that the wind farm is a more economical option than the solar plant because of the higher values of NPV, BCR, ALCS, and IRR as well as the lower values of EB, SB, and LCOE. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ANN; Lebanon; Rayak region; Retscreen expert software; Solar potential; Techno-economic; Wind potential",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087387433

The aim of the study is to assess the temporal and spatial difference of the heat stress on the human body in this area based on long-term data (1980–2016). On the basis of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) and designated Climate-Tourism-Information-Scheme (CTIS) diagrams, a comprehensive and detailed bioclimate assessment was made for three different areas. The highest values of the UTCI as well as the frequency of thermal sensations related to heat stress occurred at the Bielany station representing the city area, and the lowest at stations representing suburban area—Legionowo and outskirts—Okęcie. A negative linear trend of the number of days was observed for thermal stress related to cold stress and the category of ‘no thermal stress’ while a positive linear trend was obtained for thermal stress related to heat stress. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that in summer months (in June over 60%) the conditions are favourable for the residents causing the lack or slight intensification of the body’s adaptation processes and they are beneficial for practicing various forms of recreation and tourism. However, on the other hand, the rise in the number of days with the ‘strong and very strong heat stress’ especially at the station representing the city area is a disturbing factor and negatively affecting both the health and well-being of agglomeration residents in the future. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bioclimatic condition; Climate-tourism-information-scheme (CTIS); Thermal stress; Tourism potential; UTCI index; Warsaw","climate; heat injury; human; Poland; temperature sense; tourism; Climate; Heat Stress Disorders; Humans; Poland; Thermosensing; Tourism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087137963

However, Ag changes its chemical state during the reaction, resulting in the decrease of its photocatalytic activity. To examine the chemical state change during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, we have attempted a real time observation of the change in the chemical and physical states of Ag co-catalyst loaded on Ga2O3 by monitoring UV–vis reflectance spectra under the atmosphere simulating the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In UV–vis spectra, two characteristic absorptions appeared at around 450 nm and 600 nm corresponding to resonance absorptions of localized surface plasmon (LSPR) of Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) and Ag in metallic state. The LSPR absorption appeared as light irradiation started and grew with the time. It was revealed that Ag on Ga2O3 was initially in the oxidized state and reduced by the light irradiation to be Ag-NPs. Further light irradiation enlarged the size of Ag-NPs to be the metallic state especially under atmosphere with water. Under CO2 atmosphere, Ag-NPs remained small after further light irradiation. These results suggest that Ag initially loaded on Ga2O3 in the oxidized state was reduced to be dissolved as Ag+ in water and precipitated as Ag-NPs. Then, some of Ag-NPs aggregated to be larger Ag particles or in the metallic state. Such reduction process depends on gas species of the system, i.e. water promoted the formation of Ag-NPs while CO2 suppressed the formation Ag-NPs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ag nanoparticles; Chemical and physical states of Ag co-catalyst; Ga2O3; In-Situ UV–vis observation; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction","Carbon dioxide; Gallium compounds; Irradiation; Metal nanoparticles; Photocatalytic activity; Reflection; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface plasmons; Characteristic absorption; Chemical state changes; Localized surface plasmon; Real time measurements; Real time observation; Reflectance spectrum; Resonance absorption; UV-vis-diffuse reflectance; Silver nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084634176

The material properties of each layer are considered as functions of the temperature-dependent environment. By applying the Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov (FPK) equation on equilibrium equations of motion, the probability density function is obtained. Drawing probability density function and bifurcation diagrams indicates the influence of the aspect ratio of thickness (h/hp), temperature changes, various distributions and volume fraction of carbon nanotube and power law index of functionally graded core on stability and bifurcation of sandwich plate. By enhancing volume fraction of carbon nanotube, length of the stable region (one equilibrium point) increases and this method can be employed for improving the stability of sandwich structures.

I review 10 recent guidance documents that recommend strategies for enhancing racially just adaptation. I then assess how these recommendations advance the three pillars of progressive reforms: redistribution, expansion of democracy, and structural reform. I find that proposed strategies for racially just resilience are a welcome advance from mainstream, unjust resilience planning. However, history suggests that the focus on procedural justice for oppressed communities seen in recent discourse may limit their scope and durability. I conclude with suggestions for areas where climate activists and scholars can expand given emerging political space for ambitious thinking under a Green New Deal. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate resilience; Green New Deal; progressivism; racial justice; urban spatial politics","adaptive management; climate change; historical perspective; planning theory; racial disparity; reform process; social justice; social movement; strategic approach; urban planning; urban politics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081542329

Based on the results, inferences were derived out of the factors and conditions which are instrumental in increasing the fatigue performance. This research is done with the purpose of increasing the fatigue performance of power train shafts processed through vacuum carburizing followed by second tempering. The fatigue tests were conducted using a bi-directional torsional cyclic loading in a MTS make torque testing machine. Various researches has been conducted in this paper to find out the impact of surface roughness, second tempering, inter granular oxidation and carbon case depth on the transmission shafts. The existence of surface retained austenite has not yielded a notable enhancement in fatigue performance in the power train shaft whereas existence of martensite with minimum fraction of retained austenite enhanced the fatigue performance significantly from 12,000 to 35,000 cycles on ± 3100 N m torque load.

By using The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO-Norway) as a case study, we investigate how sectoral unions view the national confederation as a contested space of engagement in which they promote their positions on petroleum extraction and environmental conservation around the Lofoten archipelago. Affiliate unions of LO-Norway legitimise their policy positions through claims of sectoral and regional representation. The analysis traces the confrontation of these policy positions as inter-union solidarity was put to the test in the build-up to the 2017 LO-Norway congress. While an emerging climate agenda seemingly opened a discursive window for a policy shift within LO-Norway at the 2017 congress, we show how institutional norms harnessed claims of sectoral and regional dependence and maintained unity within the national confederation.

Central authorities emphasise co-produced local community initiatives including street triage and clinical liaison and diversion programmes as mechanisms for better managing mental health issues. The model of governance of policing and mental health developed by the Conservative governments emphasises a decentralisation of services as a means of better managing local demands. Consequently, much of the policy burden falls upon local police forces and the austerity-afflicted NHS overstressing the front lines of delivery. We argue that this rationale challenges the traditionally established model of central-local governance which saw local authorities implementing national policy. However, whilst central government has shifted responsibility for services to local deliverers, the structural and policy barriers to an integrated approach to mental health and policing have proven difficult to change when directed from the centre of government. The executive’s continuous direction of policy in a climate of austerity politics triggers not only a debate on the sustainability of local governance but also with regard to what power of delivery local institutions have. We conclude that the nature of governmental decentralisation on cross-sectorial policymaking can jeopardise the creation of sustainable local governance practices. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Austerity; Central-local governance; Decentralisation; NHS; Police",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077212199

The ontological debates concerning the role of finance are examined between two opposing schools of thought that can be labelled, very broadly, ‘instrumentalist’ and ‘realist’ (analytic-interpretivist). These two schools of thought have had momentous repercussions in understanding what is a good society. Each school defines Nature in particular ways which can be explored using ontology and philosophical insight. Our theoretical investigation aims to accommodate Nature in community financial deliberations. A positive role for government is advocated to finance environmental infrastructure initiatives. For example, precautionary strategies to address climate change must be funded. New roles for finance and government are proposed to align human relationships with Nature. Environmental precautionary principles must be developed in conjunction with finance theory to maintain decent standards of living for all.

This research emphasized CF calculation for mangosteen crops at the farm level. The study was carried out on 55 mangosteen farms that belong to the Tambol Troknong Community Enterprise in the Khlung District of Chanthaburi Province, Thailand. The findings revealed that the product CF average was 1.71 ± 1.38 kg CO2eq/kg, and the farm CF was 15,623.41 ± 16,981.27 kg CO2eq/ha. The total CF was determined from six sources, including the application of substances such as fertilizers (organic and inorganic), pesticide and herbicide, as well as from the use of electricity and fuel. We found that most of the CF was direct emissions from electricity usage, which accounted for as much as 85.33% of the total CF. Thus, this research provides important information on the CF and level of production inputs. We developed guidelines for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from mangosteen production in the area. © 2021, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.
